years of leading a broad range of teams, projects, and responsibilities provide a solid foundation and will add a unique perspective in her new role.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Whitney Anderson and wishing her the best of luck in her new role on the NAFCU Board of Directors.
I look forward to working with her and NAFCU members to better serve our constituents across Indiana's 7th Congressional District.
