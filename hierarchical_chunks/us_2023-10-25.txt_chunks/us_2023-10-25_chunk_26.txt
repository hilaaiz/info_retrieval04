Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former Coconut Creek City Official Mikkie Belvedere for her many years of public service.
Born in Tel Aviv to German parents who fled Nazi persecution, Mikkie emigrated to the United States as a teenager.
Elected to the Coconut Creek City Commission at 72, she has a long history of serving her community in Coconut Creek.
Mikkie served three four-year terms, during which her fellow commissioners elected her Vice-Mayor and then Mayor of Coconut Creek.
Her public service extends far beyond city government, becoming active in various local groups, from helping establish and grow the Coconut Creek Multicultural Circle to serving as President of the Wynmoor Democratic Club.
She is also an active member of her synagogue congregation.
In her retirement, Mikkie remains intent on staying positive and helping her community, encouraging everyone she meets to ``Keep Smiling.''
