Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Whitney Anderson on her recent election to the Board of Directors of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU).
Credit unions play a vital role in our nation's banking ecosystem allowing more people to access capital, obtain mortgages, and receive other financial tools that are otherwise difficult to obtain.
Additionally, I've seen firsthand in my district, how credit unions provided vital services during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that the smallest of businesses received the necessary aid to assist during such trying times.
Whitney currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Elements Financial, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
She previously served as Chief Community Development Officer at Michigan State University Federal Credit Union, served as President of the Desk Drawer Fund, and President of Ever Green 3C.
Additionally, Whitney has had significant community involvement on boards such as the African American Credit Union Coalition (AACUC) National Board, MLK Commission of Mid-Michigan, and United Way.
