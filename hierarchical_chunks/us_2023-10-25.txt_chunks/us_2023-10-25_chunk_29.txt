Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Conway C. Johnson as he celebrates his 10th Pastoral Anniversary at Sharon Baptist Church of New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Pastor Johnson continues to provide outstanding spiritual leadership and fellowship to the greater New Brunswick community.
Elected as pastor of Sharon Baptist Church on June 8, 2013, Pastor Johnson brought with him a wealth of experience when he began leading the congregation on August 4, 2013.
Pastor Johnson entered the ministry at 18 and began his pastoral ministry at 28.
Prior to his call to serve Sharon Baptist Church, Pastor Johnson led New Hope Baptist Church of Manitou Park for 10 years.
