Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Cook Out on being named one of the top ten regional fast-food restaurants in the country according to USA Today's Readers Choice 2023.
Cook Out opened in 1989 in Greensboro, North Carolina and has since spread nationwide, operating more than 300 locations across the Southern United States.
However, Cook Out has remained true to its Carolina roots and is a regional staple, best known for its famous tray combos and delicious milkshakes.
I have been a big fan of Cook Out since I was growing up in North Carolina.
To this day, one of my favorite parts about going home after a long stint in Washington is being able to sit down and enjoy Cook Out with my family, friends, or staff.
Cook Out is a cultural icon and an esteemed member of our community in North Carolina.
Its economic and community impact on our state is astounding and I look forward to continuing to work with them to see what they will accomplish in the future.
