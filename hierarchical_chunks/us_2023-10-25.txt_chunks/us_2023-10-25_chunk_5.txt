Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Van Raalte Farmhouse.
The Van Raalte Farmhouse has been a staple of our West Michigan community for generations, and we thank the City of Holland for preserving not only this site but the legacy of the Van Raalte family.
The farmland was purchased by the founder of Holland, Reverend Albertus Van Raalte, in 1847.
The Reverend split the land between two of his children, Albertus and Benjamin, as a gift for their valiant service during the Civil War.
Benjamin, a soldier in the Union Army who served in Michigan's 25th Infantry, purchased his brother's half of the land and constructed a beautiful neoclassical farmhouse on the property in the early 1870s.
Benjamin cultivated the land for the remainder of his life, producing peaches and peony flowers.
The farm became known as ``The Maples'' due to the large sugar maples grown on the property.
The farm stayed in the family for multiple generations until it was sold in the 1980s to the city of Holland, Michigan.
Holland helped transform the farmhouse and its land into a beautiful park.
In 1989, Van Raalte Farmhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Today, community members continue to enjoy hikes and picnics as well as cross-country skiing and sledding in the winter at the park.
