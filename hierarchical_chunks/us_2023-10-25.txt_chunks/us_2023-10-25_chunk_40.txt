Mr. VINCENTE GONZALES.
Mr. Speaker, due to a family matter, I was not present to vote on Roll Call No. 528.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 528.
I stand firm in my support for our ally, Israel, and the Jewish community amidst the ongoing conflict.
I condemn the atrocities committed by Hamas and other terrorists and support additional appropriations so that Israel may defend itself.
