Ms. MATSUI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of Colonel Chad W. Caldwell after a distinguished career with the United States Army of Engineers and over 25 years of service to our Nation.
Colonel Caldwell most recently served as Commander of the Sacramento District, South Pacific Division.
A graduate of West Point, he holds advanced degrees in structural and civil engineering and has served in key command and academic roles both stateside and overseas.
Throughout his career, Colonel Caldwell exemplified integrity, discipline, and excellence.
He began his service in 1999, first assigned to Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and went on to hold a variety of leadership positions, including company commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, and as the first commander of the 5th Brigade Engineer Battalion at Fort Carson.
His leadership helped strengthen our national defense and bolster critical infrastructure in California and beyond.
His influence will be felt for years to come through the projects he led and the soldiers he mentored.
