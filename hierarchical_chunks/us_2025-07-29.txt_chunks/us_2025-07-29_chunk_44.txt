Ms. Setnor earned her Master of Science in Nursing from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.
During her AANA presidency, Ms, Setnor has been a prominent advocate for the patients and practice of nurse anesthesia before federal agencies and members.
She has worked tirelessly to promote anesthesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs to our healthcare system.
Ms. Setnor has advocated to eliminate burdensome regulations for CRNAs, to have CRNAs recognized as full practice providers in the Veterans Health Administration, and to address underlying causes of surprise billing such as provider discrimination.
I extend my sincere congratulations to 
Ms. Setnor today on a job well done.
Her service to AANA and her commitment to safe, quality anesthesia care nationwide, are highly commendable.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Ms. Setnor's notable career and outstanding achievements.
