Browntown in modern times has been a part of Hookerton Township, which lies within a deeply historical corridor that connects the lived experiences of tri-racial descendants throughout eastern North Carolina.
The Browntown Community stands as a living testament to the enduring spirit of people by the shared tenacity of descendants from African, European, and Tuscarora people of rural eastern North Carolina.
Browntown's legacy is one of resilience and unity.
Established as a free, autonomous, and safe haven before and after the Civil War, it was home to pioneers of land stewardship and mutual aid, all woven together by distinct cultures into a thriving, mixed-rural community.
The Browntown community is also not far from Wheat Swamp, as the wooded wetlands offered natural seclusion for worship and reflection during antebellum times.
This uncharted settlement, born outside the boundaries of conventional towns, cultivated a unique social fabric that honored mixed people while cherishing common purpose.
