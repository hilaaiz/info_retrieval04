Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors the life and legacy of Commissioner Irma Clark-Coleman, a tireless champion for the people of Detroit and Wayne County.
From the Detroit Board of Education to the Michigan Legislature, the NAACP, and the Wayne County Commission, Irma dedicated over six decades to public service and uplifting her community.
She was a fierce advocate for children, seniors, and working families, always centering justice, equity, and compassion in her work.
Commissioner Clark-Coleman was the first in her family to graduate college, blazing trails for Black women in leadership.
Whether serving holiday meals to our community, helping others, or advancing housing justice, she did so with unmatched grace and conviction.
Her legacy will live on in every life she touched.
My deepest condolences go out to her family, including her husband, Rev. Ron D. Coleman.
Sr., her two children, her grandchildren, and her loved ones.
We mourn her passing, celebrate her 88 years of life, and remember her deep commitment to public service.
May her memory continue to guide us toward a more just and loving future.
