Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today the 12th Congressional District proudly recognizes Staff Sergeant Essie Dell O'Bryant Woods, a lifelong Detroiter and courageous member of the historic 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion.
Known as the ``Six Triple Eight,'' this all-Black, all women unit served under grueling conditions during World War II, sorting over 65,000 pieces of mail per shift to boost troop morale across Europe.
Despite facing racism and poor living conditions, Staff Sergeant Woods and her battalion cleared a six-month mail backlog in just three months.
She earned numerous medals for her service and continued supporting fellow veterans for over 35 years, co-founding the National Association of Black Military Women and the Wolverine Chapter of the WAC Veterans Association.
Sergeant Essie Dell O'Bryant Woods' induction into the Michigan Military and Veterans Hall of Honor is a powerful reminder of her legacy and the trailblazing bravery of the 6888th.
