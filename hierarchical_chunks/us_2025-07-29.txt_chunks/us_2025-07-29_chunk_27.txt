Mrs. Dahmer is the widow of the late Vernon F. Dahmer, Sr., a civil rights icon who gave his life in the pursuit of voting rights for African Americans.
Together, they formed a powerful partnership that challenged the injustices of the Jim Crow South.
When their home was firebombed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1966, 
Mrs. Dahmer's courage and quick thinking saved her family.
In the years that followed, she not only rebuilt her life, but continued the work she and her husband began-- ensuring that all Mississippians had access to the ballot box.
After her husband's murder, 
Mrs. Dahmer worked tirelessly to support her family, maintain their farm, and provide for the community.
She went on to serve with distinction as the District 2 Election Commissioner in Forrest County for 12 years.
Her quiet strength and tireless advocacy played a critical role in the fight for justice, culminating decades later in the long-overdue conviction of her husband's killer.
