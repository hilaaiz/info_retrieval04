Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize Caribbean American Heritage Month, and celebrate the culture, contributions, and history of Caribbean Americans in Michigan's 12th Congressional District and across our Nation.
National Caribbean American Heritage Month, first recognized in 2005, was established after years of global efforts to spotlight Caribbean Americans' vibrant culture and contributions to our country.
Caribbean Community Services, a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, Michigan, has done an outstanding job of uplifting Caribbean history.
Through their engaging events, they celebrate the rich cultural heritage of the Caribbean and its significant impact on our southeastern Michigan communities.
I am incredibly proud of the important work Caribbean Social Services undertakes to foster diverse and welcoming communities.
I especially want to highlight their leadership in ensuring these contributions are recognized and valued as we celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month.
Please join me in recognizing National Caribbean American Heritage Month and the contributions of Caribbean Americans across our Nation and the 12th Congressional District.
