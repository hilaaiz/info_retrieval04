Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, The 12th Congressional District recognizes and honors Battalion Chief Ryan Phipps of the Dearborn Fire Department for over 27 years of dedicated service to the people of Dearborn, Michigan.
Since beginning his career on April 28, 1998, Battalion Chief Phipps has served with honor, rising through the ranks from Firefighter to Battalion Chief and earning over 30 departmental awards and commendations for bravery, leadership, and community service.
A two-time cancer survivor, Battalion Chief Phipps has shown extraordinary strength and resilience both in uniform and in life.
His commitment extends beyond the station; as Vice President of Neighbors United, he has worked to support firefighters facing cancer.
A proud father of four, including his stepson, and a mentor to future firefighters, Battalion Chief Phipps exemplifies the heart of public service.
I thank him for his decades of sacrifice and leadership and wish him well in his retirement.
