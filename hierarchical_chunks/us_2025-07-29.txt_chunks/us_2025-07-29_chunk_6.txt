A living testament to the complexity of North Carolina's and America's rural past, it includes Richard Brown, a cornerstone figure in Browntown's development.
Born in 1852, to formerly enslaved or free parents, after living through Emancipation and Reconstruction, a photograph taken of him highlights a prominent figure.
It captures not just his face but also his determination.
Born just before the Civil War, Richard would raise a family amid the struggles of Reconstruction and segregation, passing on values of land stewardship and kinship.
His daughter, Annie Jane Jones (1884-1950), and her marriage to John C. Grant (1878-1936), represent the enduring lineage that remained on the land.

Historical records document Browntown's origins, at least, as far back as 1880.
