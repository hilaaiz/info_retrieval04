Mr. WALBERG.
Mr. Speaker, it is my special privilege to recognize and honor Delta Air Lines as they celebrate their centennial anniversary.
Delta Air Lines was founded on March 2, 1925, as Huff Daland Dusters, the world's first aerial crop-dusting company in Georgia.
Huff Daland's fleet of 18 planes became one of the largest privately owned fleets in the crop-dusting business.
In 1928, Huff Daland Dusters was renamed Delta Air Service to reflect the Mississippi Delta region it served, and by the following year, the airline's first passenger flight took off from Dallas, Texas.
By 1945, the company accrued more than 300 million passenger miles and formally became Delta Air Lines.
From its humble beginnings, Delta has evolved into one of the world's leading airlines, transforming the way we travel.
Today, Delta has over 4,000 daily flights to more than 280 destinations.
Delta currently employs a team of 100,000 people, including over 4,750 Michigan-based employees.
Since establishing Detroit Metropolitan Airport as one of its major hubs, Delta has transformed Michigan into a gateway to the world.
