The Browntown Annual Community Picnic is a living act of preservation.
For over 300 years, people and families of Tuscarora, African, and European descent have lived in this community in Greene County.
The people return to honor their lineages, which shaped a rural community that continues to unite in celebration of a shared heritage, family ties, and collective memory.
Preserving traditional foods, stories, and customs that contribute to the culture of Greene County and the State of North Carolina, the Annual Community Picnic is a living tradition that stands as both a homecoming and a cultural archive.
This gathering is more than a reunion; it is an act of generational memory, where traditional foods, stories, and customs are passed down under the shade of longleaf pines.
Generations in Browntown have thrived by blending traditions, celebrating lived experiences, and fostering a sense of belonging that transcends historical significance.
