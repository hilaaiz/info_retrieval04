Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District recognizes the life and contributions of remarkable resident Lizzie Toles, as she turns 100 years old.
We congratulate her on decades of community work that has had a lasting impact on our community.
Lizzie's roots started in Mississippi, where she was born.
She moved to Detroit in 1952, eager to work and make our communities a better place.
When she worked at a local nursing home, people always loved her smile and conversations that brought so much warmth and comfort to every person she met.
Mother Lizzie has three children--James, Patricia, and Jerry--and has five grandchildren and several greatgrandchildren.
Apart from her career and family, Lizzie has remained an active member of the community through her participation in water aerobics, bowling, and the Derrick Memorial Missionary Baptist Church.
She loves her garden, and her home is surrounded by beautiful flowers, which reflect her love for nature.
Join me in celebrating 
Ms. Lizzie on 100 years of life.
