Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize Mother Regina Rose Edwards on her 90th birthday.
We honor her life of dedication to service, mentorship, and spiritual leadership in Michigan's 12th Congressional District.
Mother Edwards served her community in the Michigan Southwest First Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction of the Church of God in Christ through three successive administrations as Jurisdictional Supervisor of Women for the Michigan Southwest First.
In her role, she has exemplified strength, leadership and a spirit of generosity.
Through her position, she has transformed lives across generations, building bridges between tradition and progress to serve a legacy grounded in love, justice, and faith.
The 12th Congressional District honors Mother Edwards for her commitment to faith and service in celebration of her 90th birthday.
I thank her for her lifetime of wisdom, guidance and her remarkable influence on our community and district.
