Mr. Speaker, On behalf of Mississippi's Second Congressional District and a grateful Nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Ellie J. Dahmer for a century of unwavering commitment to justice, education, and democracy.
Mrs. Ellie J. Dahmer is a living symbol of strength, sacrifice, and service.
Her 100th birthday is not just a celebration of longevity--it is a celebration of a life that has left a permanent mark on the conscience of this country.
