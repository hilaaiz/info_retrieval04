I welcome the increased uptake of electric vehicles.
Indeed we do still need to dispel many myths.
In my constituency, charging infrastructure is still a big issue, and the distribution networks struggle to speed up connecting to the infrastructure that is needed.
Will the Minister outline what work she will do with distribution networks to increase the expansion of EV charging networks?
