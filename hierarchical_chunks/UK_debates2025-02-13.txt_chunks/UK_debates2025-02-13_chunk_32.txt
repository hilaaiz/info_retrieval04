Yesterday, the leader of my party warned the Prime Minister that we might be facing the worst betrayal of a European ally since Poland in 1945.
The hours since have confirmed our fears.
This is a moment of great peril for us all.
Does the Minister agree that the US’s actions are a betrayal of our Ukrainian friends, who have fought so hard for their freedom, of the UK, and of all our European allies?
Will the Government step up and show British leadership, starting by passing urgent legislation to seize frozen Russian assets, so that we can support Ukraine whatever the US does?
Clearly, in the light of the events of the past 24 hours, the Government need to look again at defence spending.
Does she agree that the decision of the previous Government to continue with a cut to the Army of 10,000 troops at a time when war is raging on our continent now looks utterly unforgivable?
I do not accept what the hon.
Gentleman says about being betrayed by our allies.
The US Defence Secretary has made it clear that he that he wants a durable peace.
That is what he and the President are proceeding to try to obtain, so I do not accept that point.
In terms of our own forces, we are seeking to ensure that recruitment, which has failed to meet targets over the last number of years, is improved, so that the numbers in our armed forces are up to full strength.
