I agree with my hon.

It is clear that any such negotiations must involve Ukraine, and that the Ukrainians must be happy with the peace that is negotiated.
Our role at present, while fierce fighting is still going on, is to put them in the strongest position that we can, in order to enable them properly to negotiate.
