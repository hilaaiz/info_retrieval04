What steps she is taking to improve road safety.
The last Labour Government halved the number of people killed on our roads each year.
Under the Conservatives that progress stalled, with only a 12% reduction between 2010 and 2023, when almost 30,000 people were killed or seriously injured on our roads.
That is about one casualty every 18 minutes.
That shocking statistic is why improving road safety is one of my key priorities.
We are developing our road safety strategy, the first in a decade, and will set out more details in due course.
