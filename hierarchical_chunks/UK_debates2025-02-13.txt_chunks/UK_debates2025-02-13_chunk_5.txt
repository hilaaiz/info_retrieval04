I thank the Minister for her answers.
I am not a petrolhead, but I do love my diesel vehicle.
Those of us who live in the countryside understand that having a diesel vehicle is incredibly important, and there are no electric charging points across the rural countryside.
There need to be more of those charging points on the high street and in the shopping centres, and there definitely need to be more of them in the countryside, since those of us who live there are being disadvantaged by the electric car process as it goes forward.
What is being done to help the rural community—those of us who live in the countryside and those of us who represent them—take advantage of electric cars as well?
The charging points are not there; the system does not work.
