I welcome what the Minister has said from the Dispatch Box.
Does she agree that in this new world, and in the event of any peace deal, the United Kingdom and its European allies must lead in providing Ukraine with military support and, potentially, military presence across land, air and sea, to give Ukraine confidence that any peace will endure?
I assure the Government that they will have my support, if that is what they decide to do.
