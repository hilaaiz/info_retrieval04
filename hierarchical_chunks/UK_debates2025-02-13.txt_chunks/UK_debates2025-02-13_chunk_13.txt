I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
The Government know how important local bus services are in providing access to education and allowing young people to get around.
Empowering local leaders to improve services is at the heart of our reforms, including through the introduction of the Bus Services (No. 2) Bill, so that bus services deliver for hard-working families and communities throughout the country.
