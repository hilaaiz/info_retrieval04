I thank the Minister for that answer.
Nearly 400 of my constituents have filled in my survey about the dangerously short slip roads on the A34 at East Ilsley and Beedon.
They include Nick, who never uses the Beedon junction when his young family are in the car and is even considering moving house because he believes it is a real risk to their lives.
Will the Minister meet me and raise the issue of dangerous junctions with National Highways, so we can make them safe for local people?
