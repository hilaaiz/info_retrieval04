I thank the Minister for her answers.
It is obvious to me and other Members of this House that she has a heart that wants to help those in Ukraine, and we appreciate that, especially since it comes from Government.
I welcome the potential peace that might come, but of course it has to be a peace of justice; it has to be fair to the Ukrainians, and we hope a way can be found.
Does  she agree that any signs of negotiation are to be welcomed, but that there can be no doubt that Ukraine retains the support of this House?
She has said that, and everyone has said it.
What role will the UK have in ensuring that the people of Ukraine have security from further Russian aggression when Putin recalibrates his forces a year or two from now?
