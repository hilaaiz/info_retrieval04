I have not, but I know my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State has been having discussions and, indeed, our discussions are ongoing and frequent.
I have had contact with my counterpart in Ukraine, just not since yesterday.
Yesterday, no matter that we in this House wish it was not the case, the people of Ukraine were betrayed and the crimes of aggression and annexation were rewarded in a telephone call between Washington and Moscow.
Right now, we have to be building closer partnerships with our European allies for whom democracy, sovereignty and the rule of law still actually mean something.
I welcome the Government’s announcement that they defend the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but how will the Government do that in the face of two men who believe that, because of their military superiority, they can do whatever they want to whomever they want?
The US Secretary of Defence made it clear yesterday that any peace negotiations that the Americans are involved in need to lead to a durable peace that does not see a resumption of the aggression that has led to this war, and we support that.
We have also made it quite clear that these negotiations must involve Ukraine—of course they must.
That is the way in which this war will finally end.
