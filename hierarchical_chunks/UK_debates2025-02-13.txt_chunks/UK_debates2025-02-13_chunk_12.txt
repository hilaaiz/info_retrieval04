I thank the Minister for that answer.
The cost of transport is a huge cost of living pressure for children and young people in my constituency who are trying to access education and social and leisure opportunities.
What assurance can the Minister give me that the buses Bill will end a system in which bus services are controlled by ideology, and make it a system that puts them at the service of local people?
