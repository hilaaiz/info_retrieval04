I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his remarks.
Of course, when he played a part in these matters he was in office, so he is very knowledgeable  about them.
I can confirm that we aim to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to enable it to negotiate.
That involves continuing to supply the Ukrainians with the arms and weapons that they need in order to fight, because the fighting is still fierce.
We need to step up and ensure that we do that.
Certainly over the last period, the EU and European nations that are involved in the coalition to support Ukraine have given the majority of military aid and support.
As the Secretary-General of NATO confirmed yesterday, 58% of the support that Ukraine received last year was from European nations, so European nations are stepping up.
We must continue to do so.
