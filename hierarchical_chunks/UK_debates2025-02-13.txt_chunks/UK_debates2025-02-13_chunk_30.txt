The hon.
Gentleman said that there should be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine; my right hon.
Friend the Defence Secretary made that clear in his remarks yesterday.
NATO’s job is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position for any talks, but there can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine’s involvement.
We want to see a durable peace and no return to conflict and aggression.
That is the only way in which this war can end, with the kind of security that President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have referred to.
We are all conscious of the three-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, and our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine at this time.
However, there can be no peace without justice.
It is therefore welcome that countries are collaborating to try to bring about a de-escalation  of the war.
What are the Government doing to focus on the justice system, to ensure that war criminals are tried, and justice is brought to the Ukrainian people?
My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
We have always said that this has to be a just peace, and that those who have committed war crimes during the invasion of Ukraine need to be pursued for them.
