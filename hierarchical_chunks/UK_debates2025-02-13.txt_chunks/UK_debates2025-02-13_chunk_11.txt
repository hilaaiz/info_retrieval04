Too many of Britain’s roads are in a shocking state of disrepair, as the Secretary of State says.
In my constituency, Labour-run Merton council has the worst roads in London and the second worst in the country.
Some 40% of our local roads are rated as poor by her Department.
Although I welcome the coming year’s increase in funding, that is only a short-term measure and not based on need; Merton and others have received less than authorities whose roads are in a better condition.
As Labour-run Merton has failed to maintain its roads and has not been bailed out by its friends in the Government, will the Secretary of State meet me to discuss what action can be taken?
I would be very happy to meet the hon.
Gentleman to ensure that roads in his constituency and across London are maintained to an adequate standard.
The increase of £500 million in this year’s allocation to highways maintenance represents an average 40% increase for local authorities.
It will be making the difference, and I would be happy to discuss this issue with him further.

The Government are committed to delivering the better, more reliable bus services that passengers deserve.
We have already made significant progress by introducing the Bus Services (No. 2) Bill to help local leaders get the powers they need, and by announcing investment of over £1 billion to support and improve bus services.
