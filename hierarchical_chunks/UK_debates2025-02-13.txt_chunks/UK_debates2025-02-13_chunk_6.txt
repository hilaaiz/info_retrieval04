I think the hon.
Gentleman has already been charged.
The hon.
Member makes an important point: we need to ensure that there is access everywhere across our nation to electric vehicle charging points.
In the autumn Budget, we committed £200 million to supporting the roll-out of charging infrastructure, which is bolstered by over £6 billion in private investment that has been committed up to 2030.
The hon.
Member will be pleased to hear that there are over 73,000 public charging points in the UK, over 20,000 have been added in the past year, and there has been a 45% increase in rural charging points over the past year.
