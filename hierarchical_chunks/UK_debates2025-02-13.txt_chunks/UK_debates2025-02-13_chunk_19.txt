I commend my hon.
Friend for her support for safer roads.
National Highways has undertaken several safety studies on sections of the A34.
I am aware that improvement works took place on the East Ilsley slip in 2019, including work to widen, resurface and add new road markings.
It continues to review concerns about safety on the road and is happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss the issue further and plan a site visit.
I will, of course, keep up to date with progress.
Bridgwater railway station has a bus stop that has remained unusable since its construction due to road layout and safety issues.
Despite this being a relatively small fix, Somerset council has yet to take action.
What additional support can the Government provide to ensure that buses can stop at the station safely and improve connectivity in my constituency?
