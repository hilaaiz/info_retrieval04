Member knows, there has been a rapid increase in the roll-out of electric charging points—it was up by more than 40%  last year.

That is precisely why we are working across Government, including with my colleagues in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, to unblock those things, so that we can ensure that everyone can access the electric vehicle charging points that they need close to home.
