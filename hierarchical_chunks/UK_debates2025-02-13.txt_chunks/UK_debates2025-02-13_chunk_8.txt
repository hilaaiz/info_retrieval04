I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.
I recently met the roads Minister—the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) —and National Highways about the need for investment in Seaton Burn and Moor Farm roundabouts.
Those critical pieces of infrastructure are already struggling with capacity and congestion.
The local councils and the North East combined authority have all highlighted the fact that upgrades will be crucial for growth in the north-east.
Will the Secretary of State consider how this Government could support the project, and whether the scheme can test a new form of transport business case for projects intended to deliver growth in all of our regions?
