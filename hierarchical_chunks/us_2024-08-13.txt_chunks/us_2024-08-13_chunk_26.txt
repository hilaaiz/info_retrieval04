During my time in our mountains, I continuously hear from constituents who are interested in developing environmentally challenged properties in Western North Carolina but decide not to because of the significant cleanup, redevelopment costs and time delays that are often required from environmental contamination.
The Economic Opportunity for Distressed Communities Act that I introduced would provide a tax incentive for those who decide to redevelop Superfund and brownfield areas by designating such environmentally challenged properties as Opportunity Zones.
By incentivizing cleanup and development of brownfield and Superfund sites, we can create jobs, business opportunities and increase property values for Western North Carolina and nationwide.
