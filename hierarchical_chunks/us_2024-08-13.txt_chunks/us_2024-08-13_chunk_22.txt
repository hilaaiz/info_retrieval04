Coach Bowser was well-known for his rousing halftime and pre-game speeches.
Yet his strong heart and easy laugh made him beloved by everyone who knew him.
Under his leadership, the Bakersfield College football program thrived, and his influence continues to this day.
The hundreds of students and athletes he trained will never forget how Coach Bowser dedicated his life to fostering excellence on and off the field.
Aware of the steep climb players face seeking professional football careers, Coach Bowser taught personal life discipline which would set his players up for success beyond football.
His Interest in the lives of his players both on and off the field makes this loss particularly difficult, serving as a reminder of his unique way of leading strongly but with grace and empathy.
On behalf of the 20th Congressional District, I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to Coach Bowser's family, the Bakersfield College community, and all who were fortunate enough to have known him.
