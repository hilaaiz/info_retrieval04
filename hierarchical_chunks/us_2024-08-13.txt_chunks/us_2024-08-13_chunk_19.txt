Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Maryland Delegation and the Biden-Harris Administration's ongoing work to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge with federal funding as quickly as possible.
I hope that the House will act swiftly on Congressman Kweisi Mfume's (D-MD) ``Baltimore Bridge Response Invests and Delivers Global Economic (BRIDGE) Relief Act'' (H.R. 7961).
In the meantime, I encourage all Members of the House will join us in cosponsoring this commonsense reform.
