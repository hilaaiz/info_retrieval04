Western North Carolina is no stranger to high healthcare costs, and as a member of the House Budget Committee, I want to share what we learned from the committee hearing that evaluated the budgetary effects of healthcare consolidation.
The hearing discussed the unsustainable trajectory of federal health spending and policy opportunities to combat consolidation and enhance free market competition; or to put it simply, how to make health care more affordable and more accessible for the American people.
The U.S. is seeing a surge in hospital mergers, resulting in increased federal health spending and higher patient costs.
Simultaneously, patients have been experiencing lower quality of care, which is a less easily quantifiable but arguably worse consequence than dealing with high costs.
This is the reality right here in our mountains following the Mission HCA Healthcare acquisition in 2019.
That is why I have demanded the Federal Trade Commission, the agency responsible for all acquisitions and mergers, re-review the Mission/HCA deal and take action to overturn the acquisition if malfeasance is found.
It is my mission as a member of the House Budget Committee and House Appropriations Committee to promote policies and funding that deter consolidation and promote greater choice, affordability, and quality of care for the citizens of NC-11 and beyond.
