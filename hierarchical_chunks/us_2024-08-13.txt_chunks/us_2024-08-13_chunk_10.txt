Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th anniversary of the Sylvan Beach New York eatery Harpoon Eddie's, and to recognize the contributions of Edward Stewart, Jr., and his wife Leslie Stewart, posthumously, to the Oneida Lake community.
Furthermore, I commend the work of Eddie and Leslie's son, Edward (Rick) Stewart, III and his wife Wendy Stewart, who have continued the tradition of excellence through their commitment to service and the community.
Eddie and Leslie Stewart were married on December 26, 1966, and founded Harpoon Eddie's in the summer of 1984.
The Stewarts wished to expand Eddie's Restaurant, Inc., to include a separate location on the beachfront and thereby include the boating community.
After years of success, they ultimately became co-owners and operators with their son, Rick.
Harpoon Eddie's has remained a staple in the Oneida Lake community through the efforts of the Stewart family since its creation and continues to shine across generations.
Eddie and Leslie's contributions to the residents are reflective of their personal initiative and drive to give back, values which are still evident in their business even after their deaths in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
These values are kept alive through the efforts of Rick and Wendy Stewart, who now have sole ownership of the restaurant and ensure that it will continue to serve the community just as it has for the past 40 years.
I urge my colleagues to take the chance to visit the incredible beauty of Oneida Lake and to stop by this incredible family business.
Those who visit are welcome like family under the amazing hospitality of the people.
It is my humble privilege to be part of the celebrations and traditions of the Sylvan Beach Community.
Thank you to Rick and Wendy Stewart for their continued commitment to excellence and their loving memoriam of Edward Stewart, Jr. and Leslie Stewart.
