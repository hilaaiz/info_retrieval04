Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amherst H. Wilder Foundation in Saint Paul, Minnesota on its 100th anniversary of providing community mental health and wellness services.
For 100 years, this nonprofit organization has provided vital and supportive mental health services to children and families in Saint Paul.
Wilder's Child Guidance Clinic was founded in 1924 as one of the first of its kind in the Nation.
It is an outpatient psychiatric clinic for children and their families and is nationally acclaimed for its treatment as well as its training center.
Serving children who are experiencing emotional distress, it is one of the oldest continuously operated children's clinics in the country.
Currently, Wilder provides outpatient mental health and wellness services for children,
