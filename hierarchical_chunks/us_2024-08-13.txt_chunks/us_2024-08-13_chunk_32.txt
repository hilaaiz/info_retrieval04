Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the honorable life of Major Walter T. Tanimoto, a distinguished veteran, volunteer, and father.
Mr. Tanimoto, in his military service, career, and personal endeavors, left a mark of service, dedication, and a deep commitment to community.
Walt took on the task of protecting his country with devotion and skill.
Through his service in Operation Iraqi Freedom II, Walt received a variety of accolades, including a Combat infantry Badge.
Walt never stopped sacrificing for our country even after leaving the Army, embarking on a long, impactful, and dedicated career at the Washington Department.
