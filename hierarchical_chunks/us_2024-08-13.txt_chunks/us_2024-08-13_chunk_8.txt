Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 90th Anniversary of Eddie's Restaurant in Sylvan Beach, New York.
Eddie Stewart, Sr. and his wife, Florence ``Fifi'' Stewart, opened Eddie's Restaurant in 1934 as a seasonal hot dog stand on the shore of Oneida Lake.
At the time, the hot dog stand seated eight people on stools.
Daily, the restaurant reaches maximum capacity of 250 people and offers delicious American and Italian cuisine to residents and visitors of Sylvan Beach.
Eddie's and Fifi's legacy spans five generations and is now owned by their grandson, Edward (Rick) Stewart, III.
The previous owners to Rick (Edward III)
Stewart were Edward Stewart, Jr. and Leslie Wolcott Stewart.
The rest of the Eddie's Restaurant legacy lies in Rick (Edward III) and his wife, Wendy; their great-grandson, Edward IV and his wife, Madelyn; a soon to be born great-great-grandson, Eddie V; greatgranddaughter, Emily; great-grandchildren, Daunte and Nevaeh; their granddaughter, Alison and her husband, Anthony; and greatgrandchildren; Ava Santa and Ania.
Eddie's Restaurant prides themselves on using high-quality ingredients to create their delicious meals and provide fast and friendly service.
Over the years, Eddie's has provided service to many public figures such as Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, George Foreman, Harry James, Liza Minnelli, and The Ink Spots.
Eddie's welcomes all individuals with their familial hospitality.
The freshest fish, homemade Meat and Marinara sauce, hand-rolled meatballs, Italian house dressing, homemade pie, and ice cream desserts all can be found at this incredible family owned business.
Recognizing a long-standing family-owned business for their dedication and diligence to enhancing their community is a highlight of this position in Congress.
Ninety years and five generations of Eddie's Restaurant is a testament to the love they have for their business and community.
Congratulations again on this amazing accomplishment.
