Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following newsletter to give an update to my constituents on issues surrounding spending bills, healthcare consolidation, and government regulations.
Dear Friend, I'm disappointed that the Do Our Job Act, the bill I introduced to keep us in DC until our budget work is completed, did not get the support it needed and deserved to make it to a committee hearing.
But I've learned that many ideas need to be introduced many times before they get traction.
Fixing how Washington works will not be easy, so I am undeterred, and I'll continue to push for this reform.
While I enjoy time in the district with my constituents, I would rather be in DC passing the rest of our appropriations bills and avoiding the threat of another government shutdown or continuing resolution.
The Do Our Job Act would have made sure that Congress did not leave for this district work period unless the House passed all 12 annual appropriations bills.
While the House Appropriations Committee, which I am a member of, passed all 12 spending bills to be considered by the House, the House has only passed five of these 12 spending bills.
In the nearly five decades that our current appropriations process has been in place, Congress has only passed all 12 bills four times.
Four times in almost 50 years.
Western North Carolinians and the American people deserve better than an 8 percent success rate for funding our government.
The American people have been far too generous with us, and it is high time that we fix how Washington works.
