Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember an outstanding constituent from my district who recently passed away; Bishop D.C. Thomas.
Bishop Thomas was born and raised in nearby Trenton, New Jersey, and worked tirelessly to positively impact his community for his entire life.
In 1985, Bishop Thomas developed an afterschool program to help elementary and middle school students in Trenton.
But his efforts to assist Trenton's younger population did not stop there.
Bishop Thomas also started a youth summer camp, which not only provided the children of Trenton with summer activities, but it also ensured that every attendee would be properly fed.
Later, Bishop Thomas started a food delivery program that helped families in need.
This mobile kitchen provided families throughout Trenton with consistent access to hot meals.
Perhaps Bishop Thomas's most impressive accomplishment is the Christian Home Better Life Development Center.
This center began as an unhabitable home, but through his tireless work, was transformed into a rehabilitation center.
Without any subsidies or grants, Bishop Thomas helped over 300 individuals battling drug and alcohol addictions by working to turn their lives around.
Today many individuals who once passed through its doors are employed and married with families.
We are eternally grateful for the work that Bishop D.C. Thomas has demonstrated throughout his life and our community is a better place because of his extraordinary service.
May he rest in peace.
