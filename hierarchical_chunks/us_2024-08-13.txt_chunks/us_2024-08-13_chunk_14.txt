Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, the Ninth Congressional District of Virginia and the entire Commonwealth of Virginia mourn the loss of Smyth County Sheriff's Deputy Hunter Reedy.

He began by serving more than three years with the Chilhowie Police Department.
In 2021, he then joined the Smyth County Sheriff's Office.
His interest in the protection and care of his fellow citizens was profound.

He is survived by his wife, Bettina Quen Reedy, whom he had been married to since 2020, and his three kids, Brantley, Kaden, and Kaede Belle.
Deputy Reedy was twenty-seven years old.
While his life was cut hastily short, his service to the Smyth County Sheriff's Office and the people of Smyth County had impacts that will last many years to come.
