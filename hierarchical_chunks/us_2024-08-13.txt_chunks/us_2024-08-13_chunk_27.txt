As a small business owner, I have experienced the real-life consequences of new government regulations imposed by Washington bureaucrats who do not understand the implications The Show Me the Science Act that I introduced would require federal agencies to publish the data that they use to inform decisions behind new rules.
If a federal agency cannot prove that the benefits of a new rule outweigh the costs, then we should not burden the American people and Main Street businesses with unnecessary regulations.
Federal agencies make legally binding requirements on the public, often with an inability or unwillingness to share the information that they use to form the basis of their rules and fail to calculate the costs and benefits of those rules for American taxpayers.
We need to fix how Washington works by requiring more transparency in federal rulemaking and improving congressional and public oversight of the rulemaking process.
