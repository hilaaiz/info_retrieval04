Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Ensuring Child Health Coverage Compensation in Divorce Act of 2024.
This bill would require that when a court directs a non-custodial parent (including a stepparent) to provide health insurance for a child, the other parent may get reimbursed directly from the insurer for any out-of-pocket medical expenses for the child incurred by such parent, regardless of the source of insurance.
In a divorce, one parent is typically court-ordered to provide health insurance for the child.
However, the other parent may pay for out-ofpocket medical expenses for the child that are reimbursable by the insurer.
Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, group health insurers are required to directly reimburse a parent who pays for reimbursable out-of-pocket medical expenses when the other parent has been court-ordered to provide health insurance for the child.
However, other health insurers are not required to reimburse the other parent directly.
This bill would require all health insurers to provide such reimbursement.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
