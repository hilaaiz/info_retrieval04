Ms. Hanif has organized monthly youth-led community clean-ups to expose our youth to community service and to develop community pride, attracting over 350 participants.
Ms. Hanif is currently the Vallejo leader of All Children Thrive California initiative, a community-led movement working towards creating protective community environments that allow all children to thrive.
Jameelah has been a strong voice for children and families in Vallejo and with her passion for this work she will continue to expand her advocacy locally and regionally.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Jameelah Hanif for her positive contributions to our community.
