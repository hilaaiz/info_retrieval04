Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Tiffany Lynn Caver-Pugh, a loving mother and grandmother who passed away in her horne on August 25, 2023.
Tiffany was a character of devotion to kindness and spirituality.
Born in Buffalo on March 11, 1978.
Tiffany called herself a Buffalo native.
As the youngest of four siblings.
Tiffany's firm belief in doing what was right was exemplified in frequent spirited debates with her siblings.
Her devotion to the Church placed morals at the forefront Baptist Church, Tiffany, along with her mother and siblings, later became founding members of Free Spirit Missionary Baptist Church under Reverend Boyd and Careathers.
An active member of the Free Spirit Missionary Baptist Church until her passing, Tiffany exemplified a lifelong commitment to church service.
Tiffany, through her determined and wise personality, held herself and others to high moral standards.
As her favorite saying was ``What would Jesus do'', she found herself working for Aspire of Western New York and People Incorporated, two non-profit organizations dedicated to helping those with developmental disabilities lead lives integrated in the general community.
Tiffany joined Aspire in 2006 during a time of expansion, with the organization seeking to represent her own life's goals: to care for those who need it.
As a Buffalo native, she cared for her community through her work in the social work field.
She passed shortly after her advance to management in 2021.
Tiffany is survived by a large family.
including her new granddaughter whom she affectionately called ``P,'' ``CinnaBun,'' and ``Honey Bun.''
I invite all present to join me in recognizing Tiffany, who was devoted as ever to family, morality, and care until the end.
