Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Janet Scoll Johnson as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Janet is an active and determined community advocate for environmental justice.
She has served in many roles as part of her advocacy and community service.
She has served for nine years as the co-coordinator of the Sunflower Alliance, which works to protect the health and safety of all Bay Area communities affected by toxic pollution and climate change.
Janet also served for four years as the co-chair of the Richmond ShorelineAlliance.
She has advocated for a full cleanup of toxic sites, for the preservation of Point Molate, and for public awareness of the dangers of sea level rise.
Janet was a member of the Richmond-San Pablo AB-617 Community Air Monitoring Steering Committee and a lead organizer for No Coal in Richmond, a grassroots organization that works to prevent coal and petroleum coke from being shipped through the Levin-Richmond Terminal in an effort to prevent toxic dust from contaminating local air, water, and soil in nearby neighborhoods.
Thanks to Janet's successful advocacy, a land-use ordinance to phase out a coal and petroleum coke handling and storage at a private terminal in the Port of Richmond was passed.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Janet Scoll Johnson for her positive contributions to our community.
