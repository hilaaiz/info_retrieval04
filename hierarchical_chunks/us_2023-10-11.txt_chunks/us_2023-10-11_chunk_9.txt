Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in paying tribute to Coach Hampton Smith and in extending our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
Moreover, we pray that we will all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
