Mr. OBERNOLTE.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is with a heavy heart I rise today to honor the life of 
Mr. Aiden Ortiz, who was tragically struck and killed by a vehicle at age twelve on September 25, 2023.
His family, friends, and community are devastated by this sudden loss.
A sixth grader at Melva Davis Academy.
Aiden Ortiz was known as a selfless, caring son and friend to all who had the privilege As a father of two myself, it is nearly impossible to imagine losing one's child.
I treasure every moment with my sons, and losing a child so suddenly is every parent's greatest fear.
Aiden was caring and always put others ahead of himself.
According to his baseball coach, Rodney McNealy, Aiden has been a part of the league since Tee-ball and made a name for himself in the Majors Division of the Adelanto Little League, where he played for the Rockies last spring.
Aiden was a true sportsman whose passion for baseball and life was contagious.
While Aiden's life was tragically cut short, he made a tremendous impact on every life he touched.
Aiden is survived by his mother Allyssa, his stepfather, Alex, and his two siblings.
He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.
My thoughts and prayers are with Aiden's family as they navigate this difficult loss.
I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning Aiden's passing and celebrating his life.
