Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of the Chester Historical Society's annual scarecrow celebration in Chester, New Hampshire.
Each year, as the weather cools and the leaves fall, hundreds of new faces appear in the town of Chester as residents decorate scarecrows in support of the Chester Historical Society.
These stylized scarecrows represent everything from pop culture icons to historical figures and local heroes, but together they tell the story From scarecrows depicting Paul Revere on horseback to a Star Trekinspired Taylor Swift, each scarecrow is a unique expression of the creativity of Chester residents.
For 14 years, this celebration has served as an opportunity for residents to showcase their artistic skills with money raised from the sale of scarecrow kits supporting the efforts by the Historical Society to promote the history of the town and continuous education about local culture.
Along Routes 102 and 121, hundreds of scarecrows line the street demonstrating that the Chester Historical Society succeeds in spreading history and happiness across town.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to congratulate the Chester Historical Society for preserving this cherished tradition and to commend them on the work they have done to educate town residents on local culture.
I look forward to a continued partnership with the town of Chester, and I cannot wait to see the creativity displayed in this year's crop of scarecrows.
