Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Elizabeth Hoffman as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Elizabeth is the Executive Director of Rebuilding Together Solano County, an organization that provides home rehabilitation services and hosts community volunteer workdays.
Her tireless work has improved the quality of life for low-income families, veterans, and disabled individuals in our district.
She coordinates thousands of volunteers who help build low-income housing and community centers.
This year, she has led home improvement efforts to help low-income communities and veterans' widows.
She helped distribute over 2,000 Disaster Safe at Home Kits to low-income veterans, seniors, and disabled households.
Elizabeth partnered with local government and community volunteers to install smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, assemble raised garden beds, and distribute more than 950,000 pounds of food.
Her dedication to helping low-income individuals, veterans, seniors, and disabled residents throughout Solano County is unparalleled.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Elizabeth Hoffman for her positive contributions to our community.
