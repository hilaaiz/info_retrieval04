Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I would like to take a moment to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brown & Haley's invention of their flagship candy, Almond Roca, on October 10, 2023.
My district is home to vibrant towns and thriving small businesses-- but none so sweet as Brown & Haley, a confectionary company founded by two friends, Harry Brown and JC Haley, in 1912 in the City of Tacoma, Washington.
In 1923, they invented their signature candy: the Almond Roca, an iconic, log-shaped crunchy toffee covered in chocolate and crushed almonds.
Almond Roca traveled with our troops in World War II, was carried by Sir Edmund Hilary during his Everest expeditions, and today is sold in over 60 countries.
One hundred years later, Brown & Haley produces Almond Roca using the same recipe, the same ingredients, and even in the same plant in Tacoma--a converted shoe factory purchased in 1919.
Brown & Haley remains a family business with over 200 employees and today produces over three million pieces.
