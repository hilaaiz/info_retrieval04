I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
We take all allegations of fraud seriously.
People who suspect fraud against the Department for Work and Pensions can use existing channels to report it, including the national benefit fraud hotline.
This Government are not complacent.
As I mentioned in my substantive reply, we are taking action with the Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Recovery) Bill, which will provide a range of new powers to address fraud and error in the social security system, after the Conservative party failed to substantively update our powers to tackle ever-more complex fraud during 14 long years in office.
However, I will watch with interest whether there is learning from the schemes my hon.
Friend mentioned that could be applied to cases of benefit fraud.
