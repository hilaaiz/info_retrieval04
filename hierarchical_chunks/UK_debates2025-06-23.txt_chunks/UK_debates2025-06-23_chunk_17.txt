I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing that important case to the House.
Universal credit has no fixed hours requirement, but the connection between housing costs and universal credit, as she mentioned, is still a problem.
I would be keen to look at the detail of her constituent’s case.
Universal credit was introduced with the promise that it would move people off benefits and into work, but that clearly has not happened as we need it to happen, so considerable work is under way to deal with the inadequacies of the mess that the Conservative Government left us.
