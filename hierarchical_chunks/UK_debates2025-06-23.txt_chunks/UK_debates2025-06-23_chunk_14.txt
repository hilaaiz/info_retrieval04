I respect the Minister very much, and I know that he cares deeply about people who rely on the social security system.
That is why it is such a tragedy that he is presiding over these profound reforms without having consulted disabled people.
Can he explain why so many benefit claimants feel that these reforms have been rushed through, not to make a fairer system but because the Treasury demanded cuts to meet the fiscal emergency created by the Chancellor’s job-destroying, growth-stopping Budget?
They are right to think that, are they not?
We are putting in place a fairer system.
Action was urgently needed.
In the year before the pandemic, PIP cost the Government £12 billion at current prices, and last year it cost £22 billion.
It also went up last year alone by £2.8 billion.
PIP required urgent action, and that is what we are taking.
I am just sorry that there has been so little consultation with the victims of the changes that the Government are introducing.
One area where the Government do not seem to be looking for savings is in the Motability scheme.
It was supposed to help physically disabled people get around, but now we have 100,000 new people a year joining the scheme, many of them not physically disabled at all.
One in five of all new car  purchases are bought through this scheme, and it is costing taxpayers nearly £3 billion a year.
I know that the Minister will blame us for the system, but the fact is that the Government are not even looking at Motability.
They have had a year, and it is their policy now.
Will the Minister commit to a proper review of the Motability scheme, and if not, why not?
I am not sure whether the shadow Minister wants me to go further or not so far—he seems to be facing both ways.
He is right that we are not at this point proposing any changes to the Motability scheme.
