Iran’s proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas, have been considerably degraded over this period.
The Houthis have been held back but are still active in the Red sea.
We will do all we can, working with partners, to protect our shipping routes.
We have been crystal clear to the Iranian regime about the strait of Hormuz in particular.
The Foreign Affairs Committee met the Iranian ambassador twice last week, and he claimed that Iran’s nuclear programme was legal and purely civil, and he said that they want to negotiate.
Can the Foreign Secretary say, on the basis of the numerous meetings with the Iranian Foreign Minister that he has reported, whether he gained any impression of Iran’s willingness either to dismantle its nuclear programme or to negotiate?
That is the central question.
What I have found is inflexibility, as well as a failure to face the seriousness with which the international community are looking at this question and to accept both that we have moved on from the joint comprehensive plan of action, which the Iranians pulled out of back in 2019, and that the focus now is on zero enrichment.
Maybe they can have a civil nuclear capability, but it would have to be heavily monitored and would need some sort of international regime in locus with it.
They have to face that seriousness now at this point.
