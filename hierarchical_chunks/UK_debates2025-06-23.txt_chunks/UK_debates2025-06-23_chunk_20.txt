I thank my hon.
Friend for the work he is doing locally.
As I said, those with severe lifelong conditions —progressive conditions that will never improve, and which mean they will never work—will be protected.
Even more importantly, they will never again be reassessed for their benefits, removing that unnecessary and unacceptable anxiety and stress, and giving them the dignity and security they deserve.
