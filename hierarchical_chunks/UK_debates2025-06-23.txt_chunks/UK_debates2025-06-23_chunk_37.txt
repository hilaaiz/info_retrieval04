I thank the Foreign Secretary for his measured approach to this crisis.
In past rounds of violence, Iran has often leaned on its proxies to conduct retaliation.
They include the Houthis  of Yemen, who until recently had been attacking UK and international shipping in the Red sea.
What steps is the Foreign Secretary taking to protect UK shipping in that area and to keep safe the trade routes that are so vital for our country?
