Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Food Shed Co-op family on their achievement in organizing and establishing a community-owned grocery store.
The concept of establishing a cooperative emerged from discussions among a group of friends seeking to strengthen their community.
They collectively decided to create a community-owned store in McHenry County, embarking on an unpredictable and awe-inspiring journey.
Their dedication to bringing this dream to fruition is truly commendable.
Food Shed Co-op is more than a simple grocery store, it is a symbol everyone with access to fresh, locally sourced, and sustainably produced food.
With a mission to support local farmers and producers, reduce environmental impact, and foster a sense of community, Food Shed Co-op is a shining example of what can be achieved when like-minded individuals come together for a common cause.
Nearly 2,100 people purchased equity shares in the co-op, reflecting the strong support of the community during the project's development and grand launch.
This steady belief in Food Shed Co-op's mission speaks volumes about the community's commitment to building a vibrant, neighborhood-focused supermarket that is accessible to everyone.
I am proud to represent such an innovative group of individuals who continually strive to uplift their community and applaud the vital work they are doing to create a healthier and more sustainable future in McHenry County.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Food Shed Co-op in celebrating their grand opening.
