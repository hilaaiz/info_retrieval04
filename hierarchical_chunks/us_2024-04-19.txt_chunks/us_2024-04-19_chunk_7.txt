Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 30th anniversary Since its inception on January 3rd, 1994, the Opportunity Center has been a steadfast refuge for homeless adults, originally focusing on men but expanding to accommodate the increasing number of women seeking shelter.
Through this evolution, it has established permanent and transitional housing options to offer stability and hope to those in need.
Central to the Center's philosophy is the principle of recovery to service.
It proudly stands as the largest employer of homeless individuals in the El Paso community, with close to 60 percent of its staff having lived experience with homelessness.
This practice not only provides employment but also fosters a sense of purpose, self-worth, empathy, and dignity among its employees.
In a landmark achievement in October 2011, the Opportunity Center became the first homeless shelter in the United States to receive excess food from schools, thanks to Congressional clarification on food donation regulations.
This initiative has since provided over 1.2 million meals in 2023 alone, nourishing those in need and exemplifying the Center's commitment to holistic support.
Founded by Ray Tullius, a U.S. Army veteran and Golden Nugget award recipient, the Center is dedicated to aiding veterans facing homelessness and has assisted countless individuals.
By fostering collaboration among stakeholders, such as service providers, educational institutions, and local governments, the Opportunity Center ensures high-quality care and compassion for those experiencing homelessness.
Today, it is my privilege to honor the Opportunity Center for its 30year legacy of service, resilience, and compassion.
May it continue to make a profound impact on the lives of our community for many years to come.
