Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Black Maternal Health Week, to urgently address the ongoing epidemic surrounding the mortality and health of Black mothers, and to implore this esteemed body to take decisive action on legislation that can help reverse this alarming reality.
Women in America are tragically dying at a higher rate from pregnancy-related causes than in any other developed nation.
The disparities are even more stark for Black women, who are three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than their white counterparts.
This heartbreaking statistic is rooted in a long history severe injuries or pregnancy complications, or simply seeking assistance, are often dismissed or overlooked in healthcare settings that should prioritize their care--a stark truth regardless of socioeconomic status.
A recent study highlighted that even the wealthiest Black mothers and their babies face twice the risk of mortality compared to their white counterparts.
This disparity transcends income, as high-income Black women and low-income white women experience similar rates of childbirth-related deaths.
Additionally, many nonaffluent Black mothers lack access to safe housing, affordable transportation, and nutritious food--essential elements that profoundly impact maternal health.
Systemic injustice in our health care and other national capabilities threatens the lives and well-being of all Black mothers, who are unequivocally American mothers.
We cannot allow these inequities to persist when potential solutions exist.
I urge my esteemed colleagues to rally behind the efforts and legislation of the Black Maternal Caucus, dedicated to addressing these pressing concerns and championing the welfare of Black mothers.
A crucial step forward is the passage of The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, H.R. 3305 comprising 13 vital bills aimed at tackling this crisis and promoting healthcare equity for Black mothers.
The Momnibus encompasses measures to enhance healthcare and economic support for Black mothers, bolster our federal and community capacity to understand and rectify this crisis, and expand and diversify our perinatal workforce to better serve Black mothers.
This monumental legislation is cosponsored by 193 of my House Democratic colleagues, 32 senators, and backing from 200 stakeholder organizations.
The Momnibus Act can be a vital first step in forging an America where Black mothers can flourish.
Let us unite in our commitment to ensure the health and well-being of all mothers, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, as we strive towards a future where every mother receives the care and support she deserves.
