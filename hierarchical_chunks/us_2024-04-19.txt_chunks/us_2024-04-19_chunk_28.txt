Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in celebrating the life and legacy of Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr., USA (Ret.).
Moreover, we extend our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
May they all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
