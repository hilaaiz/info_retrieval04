Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 2nd Annual National Rendering Day.
The burden of responsibility for feeding the world extends beyond the farm.
Rendering plays a critical role in ensuring we can meet the growing global demand for food, feed, and fuel, while helping reduce food waste and loss.
By recycling unused animal products, renderers create valuable ingredients from resources that would otherwise take up enormous amounts of precious landfill space.
Renderers also collect billions of pounds of used cooking oil from restaurants and food manufacturers for upcycling into products and sustainable fuels, like biodiesel.
Rendering not only creates alternative, sustainable fuels to power trucks, trains, water vessels and other vehicles but also feeds our beloved household pets.
Rendering is the largest industry involved in prevention of food loss and waste and is an important component of a bio-circular economy.
Renderers play an important role in reducing food loss and waste, sustainably recycling valuable agricultural resources, and positively contributing to local, state, and national and international economies.
U.S. renderers contribute $10 billion in annual economic activity
