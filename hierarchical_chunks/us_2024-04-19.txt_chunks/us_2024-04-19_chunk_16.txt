Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Henderson County, N.C. resident Sgt.
John Ashe in recognition of his service.
This month, Sgt.
Ashe retired from the Henderson County Sheriff's Office after a long and decorated career in law enforcement.
He most recently worked as an officer in the Henderson County courthouse, where he developed a close relationship with my district staff.
Throughout John's 26 years in law enforcement, he worked in detention, warrant squad, criminal investigations as a general investigator, and as a narcotics detective, in animal enforcement, and was on the sniper team.
John and his wife, Lisa, have been blessed to share their lives with Meghen, Bryan and Bella, whom they cherish and adore.
I thank Sgt.
Ashe for his brave and tireless service to Henderson County, and I wish him best of luck on all the hunting trips in his retirement.
