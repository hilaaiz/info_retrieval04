The Secretary of State was asked— What recent assessment he has made of the adequacy of the retirement (a) age and (b) conditions for service personnel.
The thoughts and prayers of the whole House will be with the Secretary of State and his family during sitting shiva.
It is right that we record here today the anniversary of 9/11, a terrible act that changed our world.
Let me also say that the UK is standing with the Kingdom of Morocco; we are engaged on the ground already and stand by to help in any way that we can.
Defence recognises the need to evolve so that we continue to attract and retain the very best.
To that end, the MOD commissioned the Haythornthwaite review into armed forces incentivisation, which was published in June.
I will respond formally on behalf of the Department in the coming months, but it is supportive of the recommendations.
On retirement ages, I have committed to work with officials and the single services to review rigid cut-offs and to consider establishing an assessment framework to be used on a case-by-case basis.
May I associate myself with the earlier remarks of the Minister, whom I thank for his answer?
As he is aware, I have already taken an interest and written in about this issue.
I have a constituent who came to me recently having spent a good number of years in the armed forces.
He is very proud of what he has given to keep our country safe but is concerned that the armed forces, particularly the Army, are losing institutional memory.
He feels that the cut-off age of 55 for reservists is too young, certainly for more administrative roles.
Will the MOD take that into account in the review and consider allowing reservists to stay longer in those roles?
I am really happy to declare my interest at this point, as I am in my 63rd year and I remain a reservist.
I am sympathetic to the points that the hon.
Lady makes and we will certainly factor them into our review.
