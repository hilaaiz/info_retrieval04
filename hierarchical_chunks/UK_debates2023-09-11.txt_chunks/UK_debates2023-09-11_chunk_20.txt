Colleagues have rightly offered their condolences to the new Secretary of State, and remarked on the anniversary of 9/11, but the thing that has maybe fallen through the cracks is for us to send our regards to the former Secretary of State, with whom I had the great pleasure of working for three and a half years.
His effort and contribution to defence was quite extraordinary, and I think he will be remembered in history as one of the great Secretaries of State.
He should be very proud of everything he achieved.
The right hon.
Lady is absolutely right that NATO’s southern flank, Africa, is of enormous importance to Europe and the security of the Euro-Atlantic.
It will not surprise her to know that, in the wake of the coups over the summer in both Niger and Gabon, conversations among European Defence Ministers and NATO Defence Ministers have been regular and urgent as people seek to understand what the response could be.
It does not look like it is one in which NATO would be to the fore, but it is clearly in NATO’s interests that a European response in Africa to these coups is forthcoming.
I send my condolences to the Secretary of State.
As my right hon.
Friend knows, membership of NATO requires an expenditure of 2% of GDP.
This is an arbitrary and paltry figure bearing in mind the threats that we all face.
What discussions is he having with other NATO partners, many of which are not even spending the 2%, to increase their spending on defence?
I steer my hon.
Friend to the communiqué from the Vilnius summit, which was very clear that NATO countries that are not yet spending 2% need urgently to increase their spending to do so.
Our Prime Minister has gone further and indicated his willingness to spend 2.5% on defence once the economic circumstances allow.
I think that that is the right order, because we cannot have physical security without economic security.
