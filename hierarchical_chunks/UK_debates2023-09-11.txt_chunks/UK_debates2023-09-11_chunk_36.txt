I thank the shadow Home Secretary for the overall constructive approach with which she has addressed this issue.
It is important that we treat issues such as this on a cross-party basis in defence of our democratic institutions, and it is timely that this statement should be made on the anniversary of 9/11.
I will endeavour to address the points that she has raised, and I will be happy to write to her on any points that I inadvertently miss out.
