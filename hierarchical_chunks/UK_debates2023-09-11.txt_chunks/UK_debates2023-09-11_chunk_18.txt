I can absolutely give my right hon.
Friend the assurance she asks for.
Given her previous role in Government, she knows better than anybody  that those men and women who have come here have every legal right to start work and to settle in the UK.
They deserve their journey here on the back of what they did in support of our armed forces, so we will support them while they are in hotels, and better still, once we have got them settled in more permanent accommodation, we will support them into employment.
I will make sure that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs briefs my right hon.
Friend on his work on that matter.
What steps he is taking to ensure the UK meets its obligations to NATO.
Our commitment to NATO is unwavering.
We have strengthened our force posture in Estonia, stationed a light cavalry squadron in Poland, provided the NATO mission in Kosovo with personnel, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, and provided specialist personnel to the NATO mission in Iraq.
The national flagship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, sailed over the weekend, and will shortly fly the NATO flag as the NATO flagship while on operations in the Euro-Atlantic.
We contribute to every NATO mission, declare our nuclear deterrent to NATO, and consistently spend at least 2% of gross domestic product on defence.
We will maintain our leading position in NATO over the decades ahead.
I place on record my condolences to the current Defence Secretary, and my thanks to the former Defence Secretary, whom we wish well in whatever he undertakes to do.
