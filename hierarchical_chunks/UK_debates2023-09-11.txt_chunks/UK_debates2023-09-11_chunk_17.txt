I thank the Minister for his considered remarks.
Will he join me in thanking both Colchester City Council and Essex County Council for their work in supporting many Afghan nationals locally who have been in hotels since last autumn?
The councils have aided those people to get into housing; however, we still have six families and 40 individuals who need to be supported in temporary accommodation.
As such, can the Minister give assurances to the House about the cross-Government work that is taking place to ensure that those families come out of hotels and become settled, and in particular the work that his Department is leading on, helping to get Afghans into employment so that they can settle in the United Kingdom?
