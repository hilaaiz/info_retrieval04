The Prime Minister said he was going to lead by example, and that when it came to the military base at Catterick, he was going to ensure that illegal migrants were housed there.
We now understand that the generals have said they do not want a bunch of Afghans and Iraqis next to their squaddies, so nothing is happening with regard to illegal migrants being put there, although the Ministry of Defence is so determined that its soldiers should not  be placed near migrants that it is moving them out of RAF Scampton.
When will illegal migrants be placed in Catterick, as promised by the Prime Minister?

The Defence Infrastructure Organisation provides additional needs and disability adaptations to service family accommodation.
Those provide changes to SFA to meet a family’s needs, as set out by a suitably qualified healthcare professional.
Once the scope of any adaptation has been agreed with all parties, works will be delivered as quickly as possible.
That gives service personnel reassurance that their families’ needs can be met wherever they are assigned, regardless of the length and number of postings they have within their service career.
