I welcome the right hon.
Lady to her new position as my ministerial shadow.
We are very proud of our record, because in the past year or so we have been faced with a war on our doorstep in Europe, and procurement has risen to the occasion.
Defence Equipment and Support in Abbey Wood has delivered kit to Ukraine in record speed.
We have seen the acquisition of equipment such as the Archer on a quick basis, to fit our requirements.
I absolutely confirm that we are committed to maximising the number of jobs that come from our procurement, while balancing that with the need to give our armed forces the best possible capability.
