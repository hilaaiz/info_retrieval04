What happened overnight illustrates a huge problem that the new Foreign Secretary will need to deal with; I am pleased that the Minister will be ably helping her.
The problem is this: there is an emboldened, far-right Israeli Government who believe that they can do whatever they like and there will be no consequences, while on the other hand the country of Qatar is genuinely working towards peace.
I know the Minister has met the Qatari Ministers; I have met them too.
They could not be more sincere in the efforts they are making, yet they get bombed for their efforts.
The question for the new Foreign Secretary is how we can make sure that we are not just bystanders but play an active role in dealing with this issue.
How will the Prime Minister be able to convey such a message to President Herzog this afternoon?
