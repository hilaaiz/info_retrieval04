I thank the Minister for outlining the strongest condemnation of the attacks and the blatant disregard for Qatar’s sovereignty.
I refer the House to my registered interests, as I visited Qatar last year and spoke to Ministers there.
I saw how diligently they are working, day in and day out, to secure the ceasefire and the hostages, and to get that urgent aid in.
Does the Minister share my view that Qatar’s role in mediating this conflict will be blown into jeopardy by the recent attack, and will he ensure that the Prime Minister continues to condemn this attack when he meets the Israeli President later this week?
