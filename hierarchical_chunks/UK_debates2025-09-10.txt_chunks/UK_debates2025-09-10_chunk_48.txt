Friend’s constituent did not reserve a cookie for me, but I am grateful for the important question that she asks.
For the reasons I set out before, it is important that we continue to engage directly with the Israeli Government, particularly on questions such as the evacuation of vulnerable people from Gaza, on which Israel’s co-operation is essential for any further progress.
Several of our partners in the region—in north Africa and the middle east—have expended a great deal of political capital in trying to achieve a rapprochement with Israel in recent years.
The Minister will be aware, for example, of Morocco and its work and leadership in achieving the Abraham accords.
What does he think this attack has done to them, and what confidence can they have that Israel is now truly embarked on a quest for peace in the region?
Even in advance of the events yesterday, nations in the region that had taken the step of signing the Abraham accords were signalling disquiet, most obviously and signally the United Arab Emirates, which released an important statement on this question.
I will not seek to speak for our Arab allies, but I am sure that they will be looking at the events yesterday with great concern, and I am sure that the right hon.
Gentleman will have seen the number of statements that have issued from the region over the last 24 hours.
A man-made famine in Gaza, increased settler violence in the west bank, and now this attack on sovereign Qatar:
I fear that these are not the actions of an Israeli Government committed to peace.
With that in mind, will my hon.
Friend urge the Foreign Secretary to speak to our friends and allies and find out what more we can do to pile concrete pressure on the Israeli Government to get round the table and seek that ceasefire that we so badly need?
