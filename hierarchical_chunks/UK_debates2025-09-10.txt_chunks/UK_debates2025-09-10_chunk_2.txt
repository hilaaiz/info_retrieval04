I welcome the Secretary of State and her friendly-faced team to their posts.
I also welcome the millions going into Project Gigabit.
However, that money is finding its way into Openreach’s coffers but not to the end of the road in the Western Isles.
I have many constituents, including two in my own village of Swordale, who have built their homes and have all the utilities except broadband.
The cabinet is just a couple of hundred metres away, but why should Openreach throw the switch?
It has made millions from installation down the spine of the islands, but it is not going the last few yards.
Can the Secretary of State press Openreach to go those last few yards and look at the physical infrastructure access costs that other providers have to pay for legacies like copper wiring and wooden poles from another era?
