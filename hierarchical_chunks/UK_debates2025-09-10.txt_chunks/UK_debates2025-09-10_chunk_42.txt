I thank my hon.
Friend for his long commitment to these issues.
He has heard my condemnation, as well as that of the previous Foreign Secretary, the current Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, of many of the Israeli Government’s actions in relation to Gaza, the west bank and elsewhere.
Where we disagree with the Israeli Government, we are clear and forceful in saying so.
