I thank my hon.
Friend for his passion about this issue.
He should come in and talk to Ministers, officials and Building Digital UK to set out what he thinks needs to happen, because we are only going to get this right if we work with people on the ground.
The  Western Isles contract will provide cover for 65,000 new premises across the area, including 8,000 in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
We have to do this—we have to push further and faster—and I am sure my hon.
Friend will make it happen on the ground.
