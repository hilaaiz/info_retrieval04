I, too, thank the previous ministerial team and welcome the new one—I very much look forward to working together.
Following the roll-out of the Online Safety Act, there is evidence that harmful content is still being algorithmically shown to young children and that artificial intelligence technologies, which have been linked to teenage deaths, are not covered properly in the Act, and concerns have been raised about data protection and inappropriately age-gated educational content.
We must get the Act right, so will the Secretary of State consider our calls for a digital Bill of Rights to set the standard, in order that we can truly adapt to this era of technological change?
We do need to adapt to this age of phenomenal technological development.
I have already had a discussion with the chief executive of Ofcom and I intend to meet many other organisations, including those that champion stronger protections for children online.
The hon.
Lady raises the critical issue that we need to protect people’s privacy, and we need to protect freedom of speech, but we also need to make sure that illegal content, and harmful content for children, is removed.
I will leave no stone unturned in delivering on that objective.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help support the adoption of new technologies in the workplace.
New technology in the workplace can help companies become more productive and efficient.
In making workplaces more accessible so that people can get work and stay in work, it is also good for people.
We are supporting companies in a number of ways, especially through our industrial strategy, and we have seen great examples of UK firms adopting tech—artificial intelligence, in particular—ahead of their international peers.
We want to do all we can to support companies in this area, and I am determined to take action on that.
