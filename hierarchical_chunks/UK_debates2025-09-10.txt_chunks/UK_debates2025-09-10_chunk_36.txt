I thank the right hon.
Lady for those important questions.
The British Government are fully committed, with our Gulf and G7 partners, to efforts to ensure that the current negotiations come to the conclusions that we wish to see.
Those include conclusions in the short term—we have long repudiated Hamas’s hostage taking, so the hostages need to be released immediately, and humanitarian aid must get into Gaza.
As I said in response to  the hon.
Member for Bicester and Woodstock (Calum Miller) , there are also other questions about governance and security, and about the long-term prospects for Gaza, for the west bank, and for a state of Palestine and a state of Israel living side by side.
We are fully engaged in that diplomacy, as the right hon.
Lady would expect.
