I thank the Minister for his statement.
I do pray that one day he will come to the Dispatch Box with good news for us, to  be frank.
In my surgery at Oxgangs library on Saturday, a UK-Palestinian woman came to see me.
She brought date cookies, which had been freshly made by her mother.
I had hoped to save one for you, Mr Speaker, but it proved not to be possible.
She spoke passionately, and she was really concerned about the visit of the Israeli President to the UK.
I spoke about what the Government have been doing and actions that I have supported that I believe have saved lives.
But with what we have seen in Qatar, I think Netanyahu has made a fool of us, and I fear that he will continue to make a fool of us.
Is it time to change direction to avoid this happening again—to avoid us taking a stand, demanding a ceasefire and Netanyahu just laughing at us?
