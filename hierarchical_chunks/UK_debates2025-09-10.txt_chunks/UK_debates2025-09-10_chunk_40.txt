The Prime Minister set out some of what our Government have done in relation to the suspension of arms sales and sanctions on extremist figures in the Israeli Government, so I will not belabour those points here.
On peace talks, the Emir of Qatar is clear that the Qataris will continue in their mediation role.
We should not count out peace talks while the Qataris rightly continue to try to push them forwards.
Israel’s bombing of Doha was the action of a state that knows it can act with complete impunity.
Once again, the Netanyahu regime has shown that international law simply does not apply to it, and as long as this Government ignore the overwhelming evidence of the genocide in Gaza, so that they can profit from the sales of weapons to Israel, that situation will continue.
Will Minister tell us—unless this is just another example of the performative condemnation that we have seen so often from this Government—what exactly the consequences will be for Israel for this egregious attack on Qatar?
I have set out some of the steps that we are taking in relation to this strike, including supporting an emergency session of the UN Security Council and having discussions with our allies, including the E3, which the Foreign Secretary will undertake shortly.
I would not wish to be drawn further as we discuss this very important incident with our allies.
I take issue with the hon.
Gentleman’s characterisation.
The conflict in Gaza is not a question that relates primarily to UK arms.
We are a tiny supplier of residual arms.
We have suspended the sale of all of those arms that could be used in Gaza.
There are other states with much fuller arms relationships—[Interruption.]
The figure is 15%.
The hon.
Gentleman says “15%”, when in fact he means 15% of components of the total F-35 supply.
The truth about the total supply to Israel is that it is less than 1%.
