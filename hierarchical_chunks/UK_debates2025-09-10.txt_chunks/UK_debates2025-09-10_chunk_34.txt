I thank my right hon.
Friend for the question.
It is vital that at such serious moments that the UN Security Council plays its full part, so I can confirm to her that the UK is supporting calls for an emergency session of the UN Security Council this evening.
The Foreign Secretary will be joining calls with  her E3 counterparts this afternoon, and we will be discussing this matter, as my right hon.
Friend would expect, with a range of G7 allies, including the United States.
