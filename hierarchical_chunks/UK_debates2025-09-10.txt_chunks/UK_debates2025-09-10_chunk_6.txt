In the few days that I have been in post, a number of MPs and other organisations have already raised this issue with me.
I will always be driven by evidence.
I want to protect people’s rights to privacy, but I want to make sure that nothing is done that will put people at risk.
If the hon.
Member has evidence and wants to send that to me, I am more than happy to look at it, because I want to take the action required.
I have been contacted by many constituents worried about the implementation of the Act.
For example, Emily, who is home-schooled and has ME, struggles to access things that help with her learning and her rural isolation.
Alexander says that he has accessed gambling sites, but cannot access suicide prevention content.
As we mark World Suicide Prevention Day, how can we make sure that the Act is a little more nuanced?
I am glad that the hon.
Lady has mentioned that today is World Suicide Prevention Day.
Anyone who has experienced it in relation to their family or friends, or in their constituency, knows how devastating it can be.
The hon.
Lady raises an important issue.
From my constituency experience, children and young people want to benefit from all the opportunities and learning they can, but sometimes it is difficult to get it right.
It is a complex issue.
As a new Secretary of State, I need to get into the detail, but I will always listen.
When the evidence is there, I hope to take the appropriate action.
