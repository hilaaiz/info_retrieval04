The Secretary of State was asked— What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to reduce digital exclusion in Na h-Eileanan an Iar constituency.
Welcome, Secretary of State.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I hope the House will bear with me, as I fear I may be losing my voice.
Some people may be happy about that, but I will attempt to get through as best I can.
This Government are determined to ensure that everyone has access to the skills, support and confidence they need to take part in a modern digital society, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances.
This is a hugely important issue in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, which I believe has one of the lowest levels—if not the lowest level—of broadband coverage in the country.
Building Digital UK recently signed a £157 million contract to deliver broadband across the Western Isles, including in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
He is determined to make sure this happens as an urgent priority, as am I.
