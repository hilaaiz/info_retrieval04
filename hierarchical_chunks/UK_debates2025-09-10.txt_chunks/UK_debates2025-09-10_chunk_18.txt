I thank my hon.
Friend for an important and timely question.
It is important because I have been in the room with Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, and I have seen the tireless resilience with which he and the Molly Rose Foundation have campaigned to protect children online.
It is a timely question because, in memory of cases like Molly Russell’s, suicide prevention must remain front and centre in our minds.
That is precisely why, in the first week of this new ministerial team, the Secretary of State announced that self-harm content is now a priority offence.
Ofcom has requested risk assessments from over 60 services, including smaller but high-risk platforms, and I know it is actively enforcing compliance as well.
