Ms. HAGEMAN.
Mr. Speaker, respect for one's neighbors and service to one's community are the values that have built this great Nation.
However, solitary acts of kindness and assistance were not nearly enough for Dr. Elbridge Brubaker who throughout his entire career consistently made it his goal to improve the quality of someone's day.
Dr. Brubaker was a born and raised Wyomingite who always recognized his lifelong dream to become a physician.
He would later realize that dream after completing his education at the University of Wyoming in 1961 and obtaining his medical degree from the University of Tennessee in 1965.
Upon graduating with his medical degree, he made the decision to serve our country in the Army as the Chief Medical Officer in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was responsible for performing physicals of potential recruits.
Following his time in the Army, Dr. Brubaker returned to Casper, Wyoming, and opened a family medical practice that he operated for over 5 decades.
His exceptional ability to provide compassionate care was valued by each and every 1 of his patients.
However, most importantly, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather who valued time with his family and the good Lord above all else.
Dr. Brubaker's kindness and expertise have undoubtedly left a powerful mark on the community of Casper and in the hearts of everyone who knew him.
