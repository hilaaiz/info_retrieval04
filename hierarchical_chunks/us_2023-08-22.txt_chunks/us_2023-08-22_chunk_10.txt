Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Colleyville Heritage High School's Softball Team, who recently won the 2023 UIL Class 5A Region I championship.
This is the first time in the school history that the softball team advanced to the UIL 5A State Tournament.
On Saturday, May 27, 2023, head coach Allison Conaway led this group of talented young women to victory.
In the regional finals they beat Northwest High School, in the third game of the round with a final score of 1 to 0.
This team has shown hard work and dedication all season and this was a well-deserved victory.
I commend this group of young women on their UIL Regional championship victory and representing the 24th Congressional District.
