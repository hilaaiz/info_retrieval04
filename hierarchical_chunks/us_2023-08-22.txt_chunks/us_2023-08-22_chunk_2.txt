Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify that when I join a Congressional Caucus, it does not necessarily mean that I agree with every position of the Caucus.
At a minimum, my membership indicates that I seek to learn more about related issues and legislative agendas, and I look forward to a robust dialogue on topics under consideration by the Caucus.
In particular, as mentioned by my colleague, Congressman Brad Schneider, in his announcement of the Family Business Caucus, membership in that Caucus is open to all Members of Congress seeking to learn more about generationally owned family business issues.
