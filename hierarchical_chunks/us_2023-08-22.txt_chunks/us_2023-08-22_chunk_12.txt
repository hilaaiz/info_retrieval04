Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Goodwin, a shepherd of altruism in North Texas.
Lisa routinely goes the extra mile to give back to our North Texas community through her charitable conduct and volunteerism.
Lisa has earned a well-deserved reputation for going above and beyond to help others, including using her own resources to purchase childcare products for families in need.
In her free time, Lisa visits nursing home residents and refugees in the Fort Worth area to offer them companionship.
When Lisa is not volunteering her time at church, she can be found helping teens register for volunteer hours.
I want to thank Lisa for being a shining beacon of light in our community.
