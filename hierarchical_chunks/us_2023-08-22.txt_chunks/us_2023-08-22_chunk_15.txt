Ms. Kinney has demonstrated hard work, dedication, and a commitment to serving her country.
Her efforts have been a great benefit to her team, the U.S. Marine Corps, and our National security.
As she prepares for her next steps, please join me in thanking her for more than 37 years of contributions to the HQMC ARDE.
