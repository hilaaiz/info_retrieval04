Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kandi Stewart, co-owner of Courage to Conquer Cancer (C2CC).
C2CC is devoted to promoting research, advocating for patients, and ensuring costefficient resources and systems that will enhance post-surgical management outcomes for dialysis, cardiac surgery, cancer, and other patients.
Kandi is a HEBISD teacher and was diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall of 2014.
After her diagnosis and treatment, she had the inclination to help other cancer patients surmount the financial and physical costs.
C2CC's first initiative was the Breast Cancer Recovery
Tee Shirt, which is designed with fashion, affordability, and functionality in mind.
The nonprofit arm of C2CC works to donate free recovery kits to mastectomy patients facing financial hardship through post-surgical care.
Kandi is undergoing cancer treatment for the second time after being in remission for years.
I want to thank Kandi for being a beacon of selflessness and strength within our community.
