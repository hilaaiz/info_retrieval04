Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of 
Mr. William Friedkin, who passed away on August 7, 2023.
Mr. Friedkin was a master filmmaker who is best known for directing such hit films as The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973), which went on to become highly-acclaimed.
Mr. Friedkin was born on August 25, 1935, in Chicago, Illinois.
His parents, Louis and Rachael Friedkin, were Jewish emigrants who fled their dangerous home country due to religious persecution.
Mr. Friedkin attended public schools in Chicago, where he developed a fascination with movies and television.
He began his career in entertainment and television working with WGN TV immediately after graduating high school.
William moved to Hollywood in 1965 and shortly thereafter began to direct hit television programs like The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and his first feature film, Good Times, which starred Sonny and Cher.
Mr. Friedkin released his first acclaimed film in 1971, The French Connection, which depicted two NYPD officers who attempt to uncover a large smuggling ring.
This film was described as one of the best films time, having been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress in 2005.
Following the success of his previous film, 
Mr. Friedkin released The Exorcist in 1973.
The film was based on William Petter Blatty's novel which depicted the possession of a young girl.
It is known today as one history where horror movies were not considered critically acclaimed, The Exorcist elevated audiences' attitudes towards the entire movie genre.
Mr. Friedkin rose to be a sought-after director in Hollywood after the success of both films.
William's work has continued to be a strong influence on American and international filmmakers and he continued to direct into the final year of his life, directing a film adaptation of author Herman Wouk's The Caine Mutiny.
