Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of 
Mr. Walter Raymond Hall.
Walter Raymond Hall was born in Anniston, Alabama.
On April 26, 1933, he enlisted in the Civilian Conservation Corps at Fort McClellan, Alabama, and was mustered in as a laborer with Company 463, the Forest Service crew that built Cheaha State Park, Alabama, including the famed Bunker Tower.
Hall was honorably discharged from service with the Civilian Conservation Corps in June of 1934.
He began his service as a law enforcement officer in May of 1953, when Calhoun County Sheriff A.A. ``Socco'' Pate swore Hall in as Deputy Sheriff.
Tragically, in October of 1962 while transferring a prisoner from Calhoun County to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Hall was involved in a car accident.
Walter Raymond Hall passed away in November of 1962 from complications related to injuries sustained during the car accident.
He was laid to rest at Forestlawn Gardens in Anniston, Alabama.
He left behind his wife, Aileen, his two children, Jerry and Gail, a brother, Charlie, and a sister, Birdie Mae.
In 2023, Hall's name was placed on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C., as well as on the State of Alabama Law Enforcement Memorial in Centennial Memorial Park in Anniston.
