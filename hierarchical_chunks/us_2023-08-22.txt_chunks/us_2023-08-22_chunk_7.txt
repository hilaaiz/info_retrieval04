Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Energizer Holdings on its 75th anniversary in Asheboro, North Carolina.
Energizer Holdings is a dynamic and diverse company, operating within a wide range of industries and producing an equally wide range of products and services.
Perhaps best known for Energizer batteries and its bunny mascot, this company also runs Rayovac and Eveready, as well as prominent auto care brands like Armor All and STP.
Energizer's impact on our Nation's economy is tremendous, especially within my community in North Carolina.
Energizer set up shop in Asheboro, North Carolina 75 years ago and has since remained an economic staple of the community.
Energizer hosts hundreds of high paying, local jobs and has brought in millions of dollars in economic development into the region.
Yet, its impact is soon to grow even more.
Last spring, Energizer announced a new investment of $43 million into its Asheboro-based facilities that will add 143 new jobs with wages far above the average for the county.
This investment will greatly benefit both the city of Asheboro and our region at-large.
Energizer is an esteemed member of our community down in North Carolina.
Its economic and community impact is astounding, and I am pleased that they have called Asheboro home for the last 75 years.
I look forward to continuing to work with Energizer to see what they will accomplish in the future.
