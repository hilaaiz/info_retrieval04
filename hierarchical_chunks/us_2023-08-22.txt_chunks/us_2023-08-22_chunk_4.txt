Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the achievements of Marolyn Overton, the outgoing chair of ``Ladies on the Right.''
Marolyn has always been involved in her community and in politics.
She was once the President of the Skidaway Island Republican Club, and she founded ``Ladies on the Right'' in 2020.
To quote their website, ``when most folks were thinking of retiring, Marolyn started the Tea Party movement in Savannah.''
Since 2020, Ladies on the Right has been a home for conservative values in Savannah, Georgia hosting monthly meetings and events about the Constitution, the dangers of socialism, and many other topics.
Ladies on the Right does not just stop at meetings, either.
The group works to develop solutions to issues facing our country while holding politicians accountable.
