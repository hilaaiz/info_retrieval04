The Minister is fully sighted on what is, frankly, one of the most tragic and appalling cases: that of my constituent, Mr Tom Toolan, whose Polish ex-partner defied a family court order and took their daughter Rhian to Poland.
This case has been going on for too long—for many, many years.
I thank the Department for the engagement it has been having.
The Minister will also know that there are hundreds of other cases of children being abducted that are specific to Poland.
With the change in the Polish Government at the end of last year, what further plans do the Minister and the Government have to give real support to my constituent?
His life is being destroyed by this, and it cannot go on.
It is not sustainable any more, and he has been let down by Polish court orders again and again.
My right hon.
Friend’s persistent campaigning has made sure that the case of Tom Toolan has been raised regularly with our Polish counterparts.
The Government have raised it many times, including on  9 April  with the Minister of Justice.
The Foreign Office remains committed to using every appropriate opportunity to raise issues surrounding the enforcement of court orders under the 1980 Hague convention, as well as individual cases, with the Polish Government.
As my right hon.
Friend will know, now that I have taken over this brief, I am absolutely committed to ensuring that we are returning children to the parents they have been allocated to by courts.
What recent assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the humanitarian situation in Sudan.
This year, the UK will nearly double its support for people in Sudan, with £89 million in aid.
That is nearly double the amount we set out at the beginning of last year, but in the past quarter, we have augmented that figure as well.
