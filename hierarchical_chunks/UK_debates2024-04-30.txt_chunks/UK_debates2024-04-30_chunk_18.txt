“is on the precipice of a large-scale massacre”.
What is the Minister doing to avert this impending crisis?
The hon.
Member raises the position of El Fasher, and I specifically spoke about this with the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, yesterday.
She is absolutely right, and we are doing everything we can.
As she will know, Darfur is a particular focus of the British Government—and indeed of Parliament, through the all-party group on Sudan and South Sudan—and, through a number of mechanisms, we are doing everything we can to try to ensure that the people in Darfur are protected.
I do not know whether the Deputy Foreign Secretary has had the opportunity to see the evidence that frontline aid workers gave to the International Development Committee last week.
It was very traumatic evidence, but the one chink of light was their positivity towards the work that the FCDO has been doing to try to continue education for children displaced during this crisis.
Will my right hon.
Friend give a commitment that that support will continue and, indeed, be enhanced?
I am very grateful to my right hon.
Friend for what he has said.
We are seeking to assist 500,000 children under five in Sudan.
He will know that 8.6 million people have been displaced, 2 million have fled across borders and 17.7 million are suffering acute food insecurity.
More widely, 730,000 Sudanese children are suffering from the deadliest form of malnutrition.
