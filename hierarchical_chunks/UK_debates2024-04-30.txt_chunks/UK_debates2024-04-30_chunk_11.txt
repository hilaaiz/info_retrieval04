The Prime Minister has identified getting aid in and getting hostages out as two key priorities for the UK Government.
Israel is facilitating aid getting into Gaza by air, land and sea, with 468 trucks entering the area in a single day.
We are seeing real progress on aid; when will we see progress on hostages, too?
My right hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
We need to see breathing space so that we can get the hostages out and more aid in; in spite of what she says, the aid that is getting in at the moment is not sufficient.
That is precisely the policy of the British Government, and we will continue to pursue it with all vigour.
