The “World Watch List 2024” laid bare the significant persecution that Christians face across the world and the increasing pressure on churches in China.
During recent ministerial visits, what representations were made on this issue to the Chinese Government, alongside highlighting other aspects of their dreadful human rights record?
My hon.
Friend has always been a staunch advocate not only for the churches but for all faith groups in his constituency.
It is unacceptable that Christians are persecuted simply for practising their religion.
He highlights China in particular, and we remain deeply concerned about the persecution there of Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and Falun Gong practitioners.
He knows that I was sanctioned by China for raising the issue of the persecution of the Uyghur Muslims.
The Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Anne-Marie Trevelyan) , who is the Asia Minister, visited China last week, where she made clear our concerns about its human rights violations.
