I thank my hon.
Friend for his important question about the Dominican Republic.
I was there at the end of March and met President Abinader.
We talked about the situation and the importance of the MSS.
Clearly, the Kenyans will need to decide how they move forward, but as has been said, the putting in place of the transitional presidential council was an important moment.
