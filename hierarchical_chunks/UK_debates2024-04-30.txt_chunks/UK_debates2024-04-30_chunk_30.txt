In the short term, I assume that the steel going into the industry in Northern Ireland does not come directly from Port Talbot.
It probably comes from some of the other finishing plants.
I do not know the full detail of the exact grades of steel that go into the Northern Ireland construction industry, but I am happy to discuss that with the hon.
Gentleman.
Tata has made it absolutely clear that it does not expect any disruption in supply while the arc furnace is being built.
Everyone I have spoken to—not just those at Tata, but independent experts—has said that 90% of the grades currently produced using blast furnaces can be produced using an electric arc furnace, and that the technology of electric arc furnace steel production is rapidly improving, so I would not expect there to be any disruption to supplies in the medium or long term.
