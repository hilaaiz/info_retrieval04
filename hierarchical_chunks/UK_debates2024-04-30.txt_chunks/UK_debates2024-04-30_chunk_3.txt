More than 30,000 Palestinians are dead, more than 100 Israeli hostages are still unaccounted for and Gaza is facing famine.
The war must end now with an immediate ceasefire.
That needs both sides to agree.
It was Hamas, not Israel, who rejected the last internationally brokered ceasefire deal.
Now a new offer is on the table, and Hamas now have the power to stop the fighting.
Does the Minister agree that Hamas should accept this deal and avert a catastrophic continuation of this war?
Yes.
The right hon.
Gentleman makes a very good point and, although these negotiations are fluid at the moment, he is right to say that Hamas should accept the deal that has been put on the table.
