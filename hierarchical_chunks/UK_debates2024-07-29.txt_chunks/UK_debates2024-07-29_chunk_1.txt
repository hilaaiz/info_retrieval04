I had a feeling that my hon.
Friend might mention Avanti, and he knows my views.
One of the first meetings I held as Secretary of State was with Avanti.
I called in representatives of its Network Rail business unit for being one of the worst-performing operators—a meeting that was not held by any of my three predecessors while I was shadow Secretary of State.
I made it clear that Avanti’s level of performance will not be tolerated, and we will use all measures under its national rail contract to hold it to account.
That does not exclude terminating the contract before it expires if Avanti defaults.
We were promised High Speed 2 to Manchester, yet that was axed—in Manchester, no less—leaving a west coast main line that is now bursting at the seams.
Meanwhile, passengers continue to suffer, with overcrowded trains and poor facilities, record-high cancellations—almost one in three trains is late—some of the most expensive fares in Europe, and regular bouts of industrial action.
