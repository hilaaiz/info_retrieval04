The Secretary of State was asked— What steps his Department is taking to help prevent crime in Wales.
The Government are committed to investing in our police to drive down crime across Wales.
That includes an extra 1,127 police officers for Welsh forces under the police uplift programme.
Approximately £9 million has been allocated to Welsh forces through the safer streets fund, targeting neighbourhood crime, violence against women and girls, and antisocial behaviour.
Antisocial behaviour has a devastating impact on communities across Wales and in Cardiff North.
My constituent, Sarah, suffered a miscarriage due to the stress of repeated antisocial behaviour.
She was not entitled to any support, because this Government consider those who suffer from antisocial behaviour to be second-class victims.
My amendment to change that in the Victims and Prisoners Bill was rejected by this Government.
How can they claim to prevent crime while failing to support victims?
I assure the hon.
Lady that victims of antisocial behaviour are as much victims of crime as anyone else.
I absolutely stand with victims of antisocial behaviour; it is a matter that we take very seriously indeed.
I have not seen the amendment tabled by the hon.
Lady, but she must be aware that this Government have brought in longer prison sentences for the most serious crimes, and made it easier for the police to arrest people carrying out crime—matters that the Labour party has voted against.
