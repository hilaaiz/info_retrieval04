Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Strong economic links are dependent on the Government actually having an economic plan, but the Conservatives’ track record speaks for itself.
They cancelled the electrification of the main line to Swansea, they are spending half a billion pounds but still potentially making up to 3,000 steelworkers redundant and their pitiful semiconductor strategy does not even give us a bit part on the world stage.
Why should anyone believe  that their latest promises made for north Wales at a desperate party conference are worth the fag packet they are written on?
