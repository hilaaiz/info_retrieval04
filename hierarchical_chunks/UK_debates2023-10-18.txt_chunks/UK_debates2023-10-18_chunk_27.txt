As the Foreign Secretary said, we should soon know the direct cause of this explosion.
I will send him and the Prime Minister a letter that I have received from the Worthing Islamic society—I think that Jewish people and others in my constituency will agree with every sentence.
It ends by asking the Government to use their “influence and support” to “encourage a peaceful and sustainable resolution that prioritises the rights and well-being of innocent civilians” caught up in the onslaught.
The Father of the House makes an incredibly important point.
As a former Minister for the middle east, I am acutely conscious of the implications for Islamic communities both in the region and here in the UK, and the protection of those people is as close to our hearts as the protection of Jewish people here in the UK.
We will relentlessly pursue what is the enduring UK Government position, which is a viable two-state solution, with Israelis and Palestinians living in peace side by side.
Of course these circumstances are a setback, but nevertheless we will not be fatalistic.
We will continue to work with Israel, the Palestinian people and the wider region to bring about that positive aim.
