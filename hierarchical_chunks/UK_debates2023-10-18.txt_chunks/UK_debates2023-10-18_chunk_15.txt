I thank the Prime Minister for his answer.
The terrible news last night came as we are still mourning the terrorist attack on Israel last week, with Jews taken hostage, mutilated, slaughtered.
Yesterday I met the families of some of the British hostages held by Hamas.
Every minute of every hour of every day, they hope for good news but fear the worst.
They know that the lives of their loved ones are in the hands of murderers.
It is unimaginable agony.
Israel has a right—a duty—to defend itself from Hamas, keep its people safe and bring the hostages home, but is it not clear that if Hamas had a single concern for human life, a single concern for the safety of the Palestinian people, they would never have taken these hostages, and that they should release them immediately?
