Can I start by warmly welcoming my hon.
Friend  the new Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Michael Shanks) ?
The news last night of hundreds killed at the Baptist hospital in Gaza is incredibly distressing, but it is much worse for the people of Gaza.
Their fear that there is no place of safety is profound.
International law must be upheld, and that means hospitals and civilian lives must be protected.
Last night the Foreign Secretary said that the UK will work with our allies to find out what has happened.
I know that this only happened last night, but can the Prime Minister please tell us when he thinks he might be able to update the House on progress with that work?
I know that the whole House will have been shocked by the scenes at Al-Ahli Hospital.
Any loss of innocent life is a dreadful tragedy and everyone will be thinking both of those who have lost their lives and of the families they leave behind.
We should not rush to judgment before we have all the facts on this awful situation.
Every Member will know that the words we say here have an impact beyond this House.
This morning, I met the National Security Adviser and the Chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee, and I can tell the right hon.
and learned Gentleman that our intelligence services have been rapidly analysing the evidence to independently establish the facts.
We are not in a position at this point to say more than that, but I can tell him that we are working at pace and co-operating and collaborating with our allies on this issue as we look to get to the bottom of the situation.
We will also continue all our efforts to get humanitarian aid into the region.
