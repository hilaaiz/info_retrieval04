I thank my hon.
Friend for his continued campaign to improve rail services in Warrington.
He is right: we will be investing £12 billion to better connect Manchester and Liverpool.
That would allow for the delivery of Northern Powerhouse Rail, exactly as previously planned, including high-speed lines, which would provide better rail connections for the people living in northern towns such as Warrington.
I know that he will be discussing this further when he meets the rail Minister.
