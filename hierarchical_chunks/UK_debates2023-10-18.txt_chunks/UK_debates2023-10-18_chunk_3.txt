The chief constable of Dyfed–Powys police recently told the Welsh Affairs Committee that Dyfed-Powys police force now has more police officers than at any time in its history, following the UK Government’s decision to invest in more officers and increase the local number of officers by 154.
Will the Secretary of State join me in congratulating Dyfed-Powys police force on reaching  that milestone, and on all the hard work it does in helping to make Pembrokeshire one of the safest parts of the country?
My right hon.
Friend will be as pleased as I am that the Government have delivered on their 2019 manifesto commitment to recruit 20,000 extra police officers, and I commend the work of police officers in Dyfed-Powys police.
I had the privilege and honour to go to one of the passing out ceremonies recently, and I commend the work that it does.
