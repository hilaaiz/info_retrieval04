It is not just antisocial behaviour that is wreaking havoc across Wales.
Shoplifting in Wales is also soaring, and in the year to March 2023 it was up by 31%.
Why will the Secretary of State’s Government not adopt Labour’s plan to scrap the minimum £200-worth of stolen goods rule, which was introduced by his Government in 2014 and allows gangs of shoplifters to escape punishment and puts shop workers at risk?
I agree with the hon.
Lady that shoplifting is a serious offence, and repeat shoplifters and those who go out in organised gangs must be dealt with by the full force of the law.
That is why I welcome the fact that this Government have brought in longer prison sentences for people carrying out the most serious offences.
I do not understand why the hon.
Lady will not join the Government in supporting longer prison sentences.
Perhaps she should talk to her colleagues in the Welsh Government who seem to be against building any extra prison places.
