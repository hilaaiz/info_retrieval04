I thank the hon.
Member for highlighting the critical role played by non-craft support operatives at Defence Munitions.
Different rates of pay for workers with different skills and qualifications are entirely normal practice in both the public and the private sector.
This year, as part of DE&S pay 2023, a generous pay award was delivered which significantly improved the base pay of workers engaged in the dispute.
I am told that officials continue to be open to talks on a constructive basis with the GMB to resolve the situation.
