I welcome the hon.
Member to her position.
She shares Welsh lessons with me, and I hope she will continue to do so.
I urge her to be somewhat more positive about the £1 billion that has been announced for infrastructure development in north Wales by means of the electrification.
Also, in terms of the steel industry at Port Talbot, the half a billion pounds has saved many jobs and means that decarbonisation can occur.
