I thank my hon.
Friend for giving way, and I will be very brief.
There is a crisis of democracy, and as my hon.
Friend  the Member for North East Hertfordshire (Chris Hinchliff)  has just mentioned, we are rejecting a citizens’ assembly.
Such an assembly could have the technical support and technical capacity as well, but it would give a voice to the public.
Instead, we have decided to give that voice to Sir Jon Cunliffe, a lifelong Treasury insider who works in the City of London and who will make a decision based on its interests.
Can she not see the problem here, and the lack of confidence the public have in the democratic decisions that are being taken by people like that?
