I thank the right hon.
Member for his point.
I will come on to this later, and I hope other Members will pick up on it, but the fact that the public are way ahead of this House on the issue of public ownership is one of the reasons why so many people are losing faith in the two-party political system.
One only has to look at some political parties whose Members are not in their place—at the Reform party, for example, which has a policy of public ownership of water.
Yes, its Members will privatise the NHS, but they understand how popular this is, and they are ahead of the curve—they are ahead of us on this side.
