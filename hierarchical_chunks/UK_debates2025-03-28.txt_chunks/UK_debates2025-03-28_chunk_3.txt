Really?
On the issue of water, yes, I would say they are, because whether I like it or not, Reform has a policy for water to be owned 50% by pension companies and 50% by the public.
As much as it grieves me to say it, that is a policy of public ownership.
They are populist; they are listening to a popular voice.
Will my hon.
Friend give way?
I will make some progress and then give way, and I will also try to keep the volume down a little bit.
This is about the maintenance of a political and economic model that was never built to serve the public—a model designed to shield the wealth of asset holders, landlords, shareholders, corporations and, yes, privatised water companies.
But here is the great irony: the very greed, recklessness and contempt of the water industry—its excesses—have cracked open the door, and through that crack, we glimpse an opportunity.
It is an opportunity to shatter the myth of privatisation’s inevitability, to break free from the narrow, self-imposed rules that have  caged our Government’s economic choices, to expose its failures, to challenge its dominance and, above all, to show this country that there is an alternative—an alternative that is democratic, sustainable and run in the interests of the many, not the few.
We can do it better.
My hon.
Friend is making a typically impassioned speech.
He says the general public are ahead of us.
Where might that same public be when faced with the bill for bringing in the nationalisation he is clearly wedded to?
Furthermore, in the event that we do not have to buy the water industry but seize it, the implications of that seizure will cause an economic collapse.
At what point will he take responsibility for either of those scenarios when confronting a public who are, he says, ahead of us on this issue?
I will obviously come to many of those points later in my speech, but let me make this point now: I do not believe in nationalisation, and this Bill has nothing to do with nationalisation.
This is about giving the public a say over their water.
It is about governance, standards and democracy.
Will my hon.
Friend give way?
No, my hon.
Friend has made his point.
On this point?
No, I am going to carry on and make some progress.
You made your point.
Let the public— Order.
Mr Lewis, I do not believe I was making a point at all.
My apologies, Madam Deputy Speaker; I should have said that my hon.
Friend made his point.
The clock is ticking.
The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning.
It is our lived reality.
Rising droughts, creeping desertification, depleted aquifers, wildfires, systemic collapse—these are no longer projections; they are the forecast turned fact.
Preparing for this future and adapting to what is now inevitable has never been more urgent.
The evidence is sobering.
The UK’s water resources are under mounting pressure and not just from the climate emergency, but from rising demand and population growth.
Experts now project that England could face significant water supply deficits as early as 2034 unless we act decisively.
That is not a distant horizon; it is a little over a decade away.
But while the threat has grown, our resilience has shrunk, because while the climate crisis has intensified, our water infrastructure has stood still, or, worse, been sold off, hollowed out and left to rot.
In the 35 years before privatisation almost 100 reservoirs were built; in the 35 years since privatisation, not one major English reservoir has been built.
But it gets worse, because in that same period private water companies have sold off 25 reservoirs without replacing one.
Instead of investing in resilience, they have extracted value: £72 billion paid out in dividends while pipes leak, rivers choke, and the public pays the price.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Bury North (Mr Frith)  asks how we can afford it; how   can we not afford it?
That is not mismanagement; it is a betrayal.
If scientists tell us the climate crisis is an existential threat to humanity and to this country—
Will my hon.
Friend give way?
One second.
If scientists tell us the climate crisis is an existential threat to humanity and to this country, we must treat it as such: an existential conflict.
In that context, the actions of these companies—selling off reservoirs, failing to invest, polluting our water—are not just negligent; they are acts that actively undermine our national water security.
In any other existential crisis, we might call that what it is: sabotage.
And in a time of national peril, sabotage has another name: treason.
Let me explain why this matters to me personally.
When I served on tour in Afghanistan back in 2009—not in a boy band—I experienced something utterly alien to me: the gnawing fear of thirst; not the mild irritation of forgetting a water bottle, but the deep physical worry that there may not be enough clean water to get through the day.
In Britain, we have been blessed: water falls from the sky; it fills our rivers, it soaks our fields, and we joke about it—it is part of who we are.
But in Afghanistan there was no humour; only heat, dust and desperation.
There I saw children trekking miles through the desert, not for food, not for money, but to beg for clean bottled water.
Once we have seen that, and once we have felt that fear, we can never take water for granted again.
We never again believe it is something we can waste or pollute or privatise without consequence.
That is why I have brought forward this Bill: because anger is not enough; outrage, no matter how justified, will not fix the pipes, stop the sewage or fill the reservoirs.
We need a plan.
We need a strategy.
We need a future.
We can do it better.
My Water Bill delivers that.
It sets out the high standards our country deserves and the democratic governance our water system desperately needs.
First, it establishes clear, ambitious targets to stop the sewage in our rivers and on our beaches, to restore our water to high ecological and chemical standards, and to deliver universal, affordable access to water as a basic human right—a right we have never had before in this country.
It demands a system designed not just to extract profit but to adapt, to build resilience in the face of climate change, and to harness nature-based solutions that work with the environment, not against it.
Secondly, it transforms governance.
The Bill introduces representation for workers and local communities on the boards of water companies.
It gives voting rights to employees and customers, so that those who use and maintain a system have a real say in how it is run.
Water is not a commodity but a common good, and those who depend on it and pay for it should help govern it.
Thirdly, the Bill lays the foundations for a democratic future.
It establishes a commission on water ownership to advise the Secretary of State on long-term strategy, looking at international best practice, especially in OECD countries, where public water ownership is the norm, not the exception.
Crucially, it creates a citizens’ assembly on water ownership to bring the public into the process, to deliberate, debate and decide how we can govern this most precious of resources.
The public care, but how do I know that?
I know because a small fraction of them are in the Public Gallery today, having travelled here from all over the country; I know because of the thousands of emails that have been sent to MPs across the House; and I know because those people will never stop campaigning until this injustice is resolved.
They know that we can protect something not by selling it off, but by standing up for it, involving people in its care and ensuring that it serves the public, today, tomorrow and for generations to come.
My Bill offers a pathway out of crisis.
It offers control, resilience and democracy.
It is not just about cleaning up our rivers, but about cleaning up the system that allowed them to be polluted in the first place.
Privatisation is not just a problem—it is the problem.
We can do it better.
I can hear some people on the Labour Benches thinking, “But we have just passed”— You can hear thinking?
I can now—for my next trick, I can hear thinking!
I can hear them thinking, “But we have just passed the Water (Special Measures) Act 2025, Clive, so what are you talking about?”
Yes, we have, but I am afraid to say it has been watered down—[Interruption.]
Sorry, I had to get that one in—it was all going so well.
The Act does not live up to what was promised, it does not deliver what is needed, and it certainly does not live up to its name.
Do not get me wrong: it is a start.
I congratulate my good and hon.
Friend on making an excellent speech and on advocating for public ownership of water and the opportunity to make things better.
Does he agree that the mismanagement of the water companies under privatisation is a huge indictment of the whole principle?
In my area, bills are way above inflation and huge dividends are being paid by borrowing money.
At the very least, should our Government not be looking at stopping the payment of bonuses and share dividends while sewage pollution continues, and we have appalling mismanagement of the industry?
