I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I agree with him wholeheartedly and I am just about to come to that point in relation to what the Water (Special Measures) Act does and does not do.
It addresses some of those points, but as we have already discussed, privatisation is not just a problem, but the problem, and it is a big part of why so much has gone wrong.
