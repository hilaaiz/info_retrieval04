I thank my hon.
Friend for that point.
I hear his passion and his helpful iteration of those historic examples.
However, I would also say that we need to be clear about who the shareholders are—very often, they are our pension funds.
Pension fund trustees have a fiduciary duty to ensure they are maximising the income for those pensioners.
If that does not happen, we know that, effectively, the taxpayer picks up the tab.
A reality of privatisation was a drive to have a shareholder society.
We can argue about whether that was the right or wrong thing to do, and I think we would probably agree in many respects on that.
However, that is the reality of the situation now.
