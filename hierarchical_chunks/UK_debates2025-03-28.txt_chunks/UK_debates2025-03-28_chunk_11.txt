I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting clause 4(1)(a), in particular.
I was quite disappointed by the response from  the hon.
Member for Bristol Central (Carla Denyer)  to my very sincere intervention.
I think we have heard that many Members have made their minds up about the form of ownership, and they are determined to have nationalisation.
So if the citizens’ assembly came to a conclusion that was not in favour of nationalisation, I would have to ask people whether they agreed with the citizens’ assembly—in which case, what is the point of this House?—or whether they would ignore the citizens’ assembly, in which case, what is the point of the citizens’ assembly?
