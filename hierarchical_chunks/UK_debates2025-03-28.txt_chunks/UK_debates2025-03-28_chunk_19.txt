I thank the hon.
Member for Norwich South for that helpful reply to  the hon.
Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Neil Coyle) .
I am just doing my best to facilitate debate here, and I hope that you, Madam Deputy Speaker, will appreciate the congenial atmosphere that I am trying to create.
I do not know whether it is working; please let me know later.
