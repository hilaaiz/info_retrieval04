I thank the hon.
Member for that incredibly friendly and helpful intervention.
I am most grateful to him for the collegiate way in which he put that; I could not put it better myself.
That manifesto included public ownership of water and other services because those industries needed to come into public ownership; they were failing.
The policies in that manifesto were all well in the plus category—more than 70% supported public ownership of water.
This might be uncomfortable for him, but the Labour party actually received more votes publicly and nationally in 2019 than it did in the recent general election.
We have an electoral system that is unbelievably unfair, and which brought about an enormous majority on a very low total vote.
We can all play with the numbers.
