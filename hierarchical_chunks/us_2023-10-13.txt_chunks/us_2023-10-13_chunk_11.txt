Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Ruthie Dineen as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Ruthie is a compassionate and dedicated leader who works to improve her community through her work, talent, and volunteerism.
She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker as well as an accomplished pianist and composer.
Ruthie is the current executive director of the East Bay Center for the Performing Arts where she has led the organization with strategic vision since 2021.
Colleagues describe her as a dedicated and passionate leader who has touched the lives of countless students and staff.
Since taking the position, Ruthie has helped increase the funding for the East Bay Center from $3.2M to $4.2M and in doing so has helped raise wages for the Center's staff.
Ruthie is also leading the Center's Strategic Plan, requiring organizational and cultural changes to the operation, doing so while maintaining high faculty and staff morale.
Her work makes the school a more vibrant place for every student and helps many discover new talents and interests which may otherwise go unnoticed.
Ruthie embodies the mission of the East Bay Center of the Performing Arts to engage with students in the community through the world of performance traditions.
She is also an active member of her community who has been involved in a number of initiatives including Healthy Richmond, the Invest in Youth Coalition, and the planning group for the Blueprint to Prevent Interpersonal Violence in Contra Costa County.
In everything she does, Ruthie finds ways to bring positive change to her community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Ruthie Dineen for her positive contributions to our community.
