Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Rhonda Rochon Smith as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Described as passionate, charismatic, compassionate, and driven by her colleagues and fellow community members, Rhonda is a dedicated community servant involved with numerous non-profits, committees and advocacy groups throughout our district.

She is also the Volunteer Services Manager for Contra Costa Regional Medical Center where she plays an integral role in placing volunteers in the hospital to enhance the quality of patient care.
Outside of these roles, Rhonda serves on the Board of Directors of the Solano County Fair Association, Vallejo Police Oversight and Accountability Commission, and is Vice-Chair of the Contra Costa Regional Health Foundation.
She is also an active member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, the Vallejo NAACP, and Black Women Organized for Political Action.
Rhonda works every day to serve her community and inspires others with her commitment to making positive change wherever she goes.
