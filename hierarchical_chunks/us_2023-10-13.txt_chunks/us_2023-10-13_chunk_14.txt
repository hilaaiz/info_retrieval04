Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, last month, I had the honor of attending Ian McKinney's Eagle Scout Court.
Ian began his scouting experience as a Tiger Cub and after many years and transformative experiences, has now earned the rank.
Throughout the years, Ian has gained valuable knowledge and useful skills, made possible by his participation in the merit badge program and his steady involvement with the troop.
To achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, Ian developed and built a community educational garden to enrich his school's STEM program, leaving a lasting impact on fellow and future classmates.
Ian's dedication to the Scouts has been admirable and he should be proud of all that he has achieved with them.
God Bless Ian McKinney and God Bless the United States.
