Colonel Mark Volk, and his wife Lynn, continue to be active and generous members of our community, giving their time and energy to numerous organizations.
Their dedication to service has set a shining example for us all.
I commend Colonel Volk for his unwavering commitment to our community and our Nation; he truly represents the very best of Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District.
