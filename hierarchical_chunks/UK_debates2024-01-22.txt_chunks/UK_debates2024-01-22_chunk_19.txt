I thank the Minister for that answer.
What discussions has he had with large UK banks, such as Danske Bank in Northern Ireland, to ensure mortgages are made as accessible as possible for first-time buyers, encouraging them to buy, not rent, when they have a steady income?
Further, are there any plans to reintroduce the help to buy ISA?
