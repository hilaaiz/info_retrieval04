The Minister says “look at the evidence” and I am looking at the evidence—14 years of a Conservative Government, elected on a promise to level up the country, which has left working people worse off.
In Manchester, the average household is over £8,000 a year out of pocket.
Down the road in Burnley, the loss amounts to £28,000.
Will they now listen to our proposals to reform planning, reinstate housing targets and get Britain building again, or will the country have to suffer another final year of failure?
The Labour party has bankrupted Birmingham, and it would bankrupt Britain.
We have made huge progress towards levelling up, including by rolling out gigabit broadband, introducing educational investment in areas, opening new freeports, increasing the national living wage, recruiting more police officers, funding regeneration and community ownership, and devolving more power to local Mayors.
We will continue to level up.
