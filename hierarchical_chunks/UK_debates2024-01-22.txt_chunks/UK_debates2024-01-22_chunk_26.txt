I welcome this opportunity to correct some misleading stories about the childcare roll-out, and to hear from  the hon.
Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson)  about whether she supports our childcare policies, and, if not, what her childcare policies would be.
I am sure Members on the Labour Benches would like to know as much as we would.
