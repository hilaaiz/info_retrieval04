The Minister might know that we have wonderful public green spaces in our country—many of them are around London and in West Yorkshire—but is he aware that the decline of education departments in many local authorities owing to the policies of successive Conservative Governments means that today the ability to organise school trips to green spaces is minimal?
Could we have a policy that allows all our children, of whatever background, to go to and enjoy those beautiful green spaces?
