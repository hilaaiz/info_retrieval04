The Secretary of State is the deputy chair of the Tata Steel transition board, so if his Department is at all serious about levelling up, will he acknowledge just how devastating Tata Steel’s announcement was for Port Talbot and for families, workers and communities across south Wales?
Why will the Minister not work with Business and Trade Ministers to look again with the company at a longer, fairer transition that protects our sovereign steelmaking capabilities and our communities?
The hon.
Lady knows how important steel is to me; my constituency was deeply affected when SSI closed in 2015.
We have already provided £100 million of support, but I am happy to ensure that the relevant Minister meets her to discuss how we can provide further support.
It is very positive that Stoke-on-Trent has been included as one of the levelling-up partnership schemes.
Does the Minister agree that it is vital that every part of Stoke-on-Trent gets levelling-up support so that all communities, including those in my constituency and particularly the town of Longton, can benefit from the scheme?
The levelling-up partnership will be transformational for Stoke-on-Trent, building on the levelling-up investment we have already made there.
I was pleased to meet my hon.
Friend last week to discuss his priorities, including the town of Longton, and we hope to make further announcements about that in the coming months.
