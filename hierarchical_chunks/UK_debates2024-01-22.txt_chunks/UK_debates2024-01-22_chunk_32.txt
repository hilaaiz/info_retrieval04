I thank my hon.
Friend, who has also done a lot to champion the sector and to raise awareness of the challenge it faces.
He is right that we need to get more people into the workforce, particularly for the September 2025 roll-out.
That is what the recruitment campaign and the changes we made to the early years foundation stage are all about.
We listened to providers on the flexibilities that might make their lives easier and delivered almost everything they asked for, in the hope that it will help them with recruitment and retention.
