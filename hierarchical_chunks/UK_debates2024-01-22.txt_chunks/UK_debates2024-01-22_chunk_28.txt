I welcome the Minister’s statement, and working parents across my constituency welcome this expansion and the biggest ever investment in childcare in England.
Today, however, I received a letter from Victoria Morris, a very experienced childminder who has worked in Leigh-on-Sea for more than 20 years, pointing out that someone who owns a nursery can claim the funding for children to whom they are related, including their own children, but that does not apply to childminders.
She simply asks whether the Minister would consider lifting that ban so that childminders are on the same footing as other childcare providers.
