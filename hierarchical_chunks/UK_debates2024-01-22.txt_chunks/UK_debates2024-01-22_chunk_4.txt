The Secretary of State was asked— If he will target levelling-up funding at the most economically deprived communities.
The Government have set clear and ambitious missions to end long-standing geographical inequality in the UK.
In targeting levelling-up funding, we consider a range of factors, including levelling-up need.
These metrics draw on the extensive evidence base of what matters for levelling up, as set out in the levelling-up White Paper.
I am interested in the Minister’s comments about targeting.
Deprivation is made worse by bad policy decisions.
The bedroom tax significantly impacted and brought an end to a multimillion-pound housing renovation scheme in the village of Horden in my constituency.
Can the Minister explain to my constituents why our levelling-up bid aimed at regenerating Horden, which is ranked in the bottom 10% for the UK, was rejected?
We selected the bids based on strict criteria and the methodology is set out on gov.uk.
I am sorry that the hon.
Gentleman is disappointed that his constituency did not benefit.
We funded a project in County Durham in round 1 of the levelling-up fund, and I am happy to work with him to see what more we could do to invest in County Durham.
The household support fund has given a lifeline to councils across the UK, including Bracknell Forest Council, and it is discretionary.
Will the Minister confirm whether that fund will be extended beyond this financial year?
I cannot make spending commitments today, but I can say that my hon.
Friend is a fantastic champion for his constituents and I am happy to ensure that the relevant Minister is able to meet him to discuss the matter further.
