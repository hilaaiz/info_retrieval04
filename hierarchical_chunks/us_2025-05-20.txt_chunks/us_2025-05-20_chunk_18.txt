Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
I am pleased to announce that Lindsey Hatcher of Van Wert, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.
Lindsey's offer of appointment permits her to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
Lindsey brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Lincolnview High School, she participated in science club, band, student government, and was on the honor roll.
Throughout high school, Lindsey was involved in track and field and golf, earning her varsity letter in both.
I am confident that she will carry the lessons of her student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
