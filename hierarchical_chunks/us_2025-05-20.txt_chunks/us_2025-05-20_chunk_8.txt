Mr. FLEISCHMANN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Sergeant Willie J. Trueitt, Jr. of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in recognition of his impending retirement.
Sergeant Trueitt serves as the lead for Special Operations and Community Engagement with the University of Tennessee--Chattanooga Police Department.
He has held positions in law enforcement for 31 years, including seven years with the Chattanooga Police Department, five years with the U.S. Veterans Affairs Police, and more than 19 years with the UTC Police Department.
Sergeant Trueitt also served our Nation in the United States Navy.
In his eleven years of service, then-Petty Officer Trueitt served in duty stations including Scotland and Norfolk, Virginia.
I had the pleasure of meeting Sergeant Trueitt when he served in the security detail for my visits to the UTC campus, and he also oversaw the security planning for my Service Academy Day event this year.
He has committed himself to serving the campus community, displaying a high level of professionalism while also bringing a bright smile and a positive attitude to his work.
It is with gratitude that I recognize Sergeant Willie J. Trueitt, Jr., for his 42 years of public service to our Nation and our community, and I wish him well on his retirement.
