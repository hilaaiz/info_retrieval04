Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize Rutt Insurance for their 90th anniversary.
Founded in May 1935 by B. Titus Rutt, an orchard manager-turnedinsurance salesman.
Rutt Insurance is a family-run independent insurance company located on Main Street in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania.
Since Jamie Rutt, Titus's grandson, joined the business in 1991, the company has nearly doubled in size and expanded its reach by acquiring other small agencies.
Rutt Insurance continues to serve the people of Lancaster County with integrity, helping individuals and businesses find the right coverage for their homes, vehicles, and livelihoods.
As proud members of the Keystone Insurers Group and the Mount Joy Chamber of Commerce, their contributions extend beyond business--they are active participants in building a stronger, more resilient community.
As Rutt Insurance celebrates a milestone anniversary and prepares the next generation of Rutt family leadership, I commend Rutt Insurance for 90 years of hard work, service, and positive community impact.
The American Dream is alive in Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District, and Rutt Insurance demonstrates that.
May their success continue for many more years to come.
