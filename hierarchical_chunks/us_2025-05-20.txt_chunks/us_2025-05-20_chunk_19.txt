Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lindsey Hatcher on her offer of appointment to the United States Military Academy.
Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available, and I am positive that Linsdey will excel during her career at the Military Academy.
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to her as she begins her service to our Nation.
