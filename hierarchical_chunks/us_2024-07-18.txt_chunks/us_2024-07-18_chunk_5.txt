Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking 
Mrs. Kimberly Leach-Wright for her dedication to public service over the last 40 years.
I join her friends and loved ones in celebrating her contributions and in wishing her the best as she retires to spend time with her husband, Ron, and her grandchildren.
