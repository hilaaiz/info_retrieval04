Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Timothy Murphy as one of this year's recipients of the University of Buffalo's President's Medal.
The University of Buffalo's President's Medal recognizes those who have made extraordinary contributions to the quality of life and development in the University's community.
I can think of no one who is more deserving of this award than Dr. Timothy Murphy.
Dr. Murphy is an internationally recognized expert in respiratory infections and has transformed the way the medical community approaches them.
His research has made significant breakthroughs in the understanding of bacterial infections in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vaccine development for both ear infections and COPD.
Outside of his groundbreaking research, Dr. Murphy is the founding director of the University at Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute, which advances research throughout the University and its partners to reduce health disparities in our community.
With a team of approximately 40 faculty and 118 staff members, the Institute has catalyzed a transformation of the clinical and translational research environment.
More recently, the University at Buffalo launched the Community Health Equity Research Institute under Dr. Murphy's leadership.
Working closely with community partners and faculty from all 12 schools at UB, the Institute works to support research that address the root cause of health disparities while developing and testing solutions to the social determinants that cause them.
Once again, I would like to congratulate Dr. Timothy Murphy on his well-deserved achievement of receiving the University of Buffalo's President's Medal.
I thank him for his tremendous efforts to advance the medical field all while supporting his community.
