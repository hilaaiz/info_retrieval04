Mr. NEHLS.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate a fellow Texan upon his retirement on July 19th.
Mr. Gene Leehan is a past president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Texas (OAAT) and has worked in the out of home advertising industry for 38 years.
Mr. Leehan is retiring from his position as Executive Vice President and Senior Regional President of Clear Channel Outdoor North America (CCOA).
Over the years, CCOA and the Texas association have been key partners with federal and state agencies in times of emergency, using outdoor advertising assets to display important public messaging.
This partnership has been valuable to constituents in my district, and to all Texans, including recently with Hurricane Beryl.
In recognition of his many industry contributions, 
Mr. Leehan was inducted into the out of home advertising Hall of Fame in 2015.
Mr. Leehan's public service also includes work with the National Multicultural Western Heritage Museum, a Texas non-profit that recognizes pioneers of the American western frontier.
Again, I want to congratulate 
Mr. Leehan on a long and fulfilling career.
