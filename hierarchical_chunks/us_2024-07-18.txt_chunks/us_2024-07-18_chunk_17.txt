Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Nation's community supervision professionals, who are dedicated public servants and perform many vital roles in their work with justice-involved adults and juveniles.
Community supervision professionals identify opportunities and services to help justice-involved individuals contribute to society, while holding them accountable for their actions.
They remain mindful of their role in protecting public safety.
In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2024, we salute all those who have chosen this important career.
In the District of Columbia, we especially thank the employees of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia (PSA) for their service.
CSOSA and PSA are models of excellence in community supervision.
The theme of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2024 is ``Wellness Unveiled:
Navigating the Journey.''
Community supervision agencies are valuable partners of other government agencies, nonprofits, neighborhood-based groups and all who strive to make our Nation safer and stronger.
We extend out gratitude to community supervision professionals and encourage all people to recognize their many achievements as we proclaim July 21-27, 2024, as Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2024.
