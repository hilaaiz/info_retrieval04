Ms. BUSH.
Mr Speaker, I rise along with the people.
Louis today to solemnly pay homage to the Nurse Honor Guard of Saint Louis and its visionary founder and president, Aine Howard-Boerner, MSN.
Since its establishment in 2023, the Nurse Honor Guard of Saint Louis has emerged as a beacon of compassion dedicated to honoring nurses nearing or entering eternal rest, offering solace to grieving families across Missouri and Illinois.
Inspired by the tradition of military honor guards that honor fallen servicemen and women, police officers, and firefighters, the Nurse Honor Guard wears traditional white nursing uniforms, complete with a red and blue cape and traditional nursing caps.
They attend the funerals of their fellow nurses, paying homage and extending comfort to families in their time of mourning.
The organization has conducted 124 memorial tributes, four living tributes, and one memorial table for departed colleagues.
Comprised of 30 retired and active nurses, these tributes honor the departed and serve as a source of renewal for the members of the Nurse Honor Guard amidst the formidable challenges and demands of their profession, particularly underscored by the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
Nurses and their communities are reminded of their steadfast courage and unwavering commitment through these services.
As we reflect on the profound impact of the Nurse Honor Guard of Saint Louis, we follow our pledge to honor the memory of our fallen nurses, support grieving families, and uphold the pride and dignity of the nursing profession with enduring gratitude.
As a nurse and Congresswoman, I am honored to join our St. Louis community to commend the Nurse Honor Guard of Saint Louis and its members for their exemplary service.
