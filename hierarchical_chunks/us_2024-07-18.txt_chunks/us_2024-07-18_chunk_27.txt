Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Auburn University Men's Golf team for winning the NCAA Division I National Title.
On May 29th, the Auburn Tigers held off Florida State University three matches to two to secure their title win.
The tournament came down to the last match of the day and was finally won on the 17th hole with a par.
The tournament was played at the Omni La Costa Resort in Carlsbad, California.
This is the first national championship for the Auburn Men's Golf Team and advanced the team to 4-1 all-time in NCAA championship match play.
Previously, the team had not advanced past a semifinal round.
