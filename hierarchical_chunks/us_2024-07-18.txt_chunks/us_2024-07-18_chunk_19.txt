Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the second class of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Intelligence and Cybersecurity Diversity Fellowship (ICDF) Program.
The ICDF Program intends to help DHS cultivate diverse talent to enter public service in Federal cybersecurity offices and components.
This exemplary fellowship class is working across the homeland security enterprise--in DHS Headquarters, the Office of Intelligence and Analysts, Coast Guard, Secret Service, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
This year's class includes four returning fellows and eleven new fellows.
They represent 10 States and hail from universities of all sizes.
Six of this year's class attend Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and three attend other Minority Serving Institutions.
This talented class of fellows represents the diverse perspectives that are needed to help strengthen DHS's ability to analyze the evolving threats facing our Nation.
I am proud that the fellowship program I passed through the House has provided pathways to success for each of these future homeland security leaders.
Congratulations to Veronica Kyles, Christian Lopez, Erin Sullivan, Reyben Cortes, Kiara Kelly, Ariel Henderson, Ethan Polhemus, Sage Despignes, Sharanya Padithaya, Zaria Gibbs, Daryan Lassiter, Kamryn Brown, Shaqandra Roberson, Tori Johnson, and Kaari Harsila.
