Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 50th anniversary of Maggie Valley's incorporation as a municipality in North Carolina.
Home to about 1,800 North Carolinians, Maggie Valley's rich history predates the town's official incorporation by many years.
Located in Haywood County, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians occupied this region prior to the first White settlers.
In the early 1800s, mountain settlers began to move into the valley and brought with them the characteristics that still define Maggie Valley--selfsufficiency, resourcefulness, independence and free-thinking.
In 1890, one of the valley's residents, Jack Setzer, became fed up with having to pay someone to take and pick up mail from the nearest post office located five miles away.
Setzer began contacting officials with the United States Postal Service to establish a post office in his area that everyone in the valley could use.
When the U.S. postmaster general approved the creation of the post office, authorities requested that Setzer submit three potential names.
He gave them the names of his three daughters:
Cora, Mettie, and Maggie Mae.
On May 10, 1904, Jack received a letter from the U.S. Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock that postal authorities had decided on a name: Maggie, North Carolina.
In 1974, the North Carolina General Assembly voted to approve Maggie Valley as an official municipality and approved the town's formation of a local government, consisting of a mayor and a five-member board of aldermen.
Maggie Valley serves as the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and the Blue Ridge Parkway.
The town's proximity to these two attractions allows thousands of visitors to experience the beauty This year commemorates Maggie Valley's five decades as an official town.
As residents celebrate the 50th anniversary this week, they honor the virtues and traditions that have defined Maggie Valley for half a century and look to carry those forward for 50 more years.
