Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation to honor the public service of Katie Wheeler Mathews, as she retires from her role as Senior Advisor for Federal Affairs for the State.
Katie's career in state government spans over 36 years and is characterized by dedicated service, a bipartisan spirit, and a profound commitment to her home state.
Katie has worked across five gubernatorial administrations under both Democratic and Republican governors, demonstrating a unique ability to bridge political divides.
Her tenure in Washington, D.C., has been marked by tireless advocacy for California's policy priorities and effective collaboration with our congressional offices and other federal partners.
Prior to that, she spent eight years in the California Governor's office in Sacramento, fostering partnerships and crafting solutions across geographical divides.
Katie has been a formidable advocate for California's interests before Congress, across multiple federal administrations, and before organizations such as the National Governors' Association and the Western Governors' Association.
Her understanding of complex policy issues and ability to navigate the intricacies of federal-state relations have made her a valuable member of the Governor's office, including her work in recent years to support California's leadership on climate, immigration, and combatting the fentanyl crisis.
Katie's extensive government experience and relationships with leaders on both sides of the aisle have solidified her reputation as a trusted advisor to many.
