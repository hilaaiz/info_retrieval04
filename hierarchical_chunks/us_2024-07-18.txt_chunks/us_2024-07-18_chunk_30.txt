Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and wish a very happy and special 100th birthday to World War II veteran Robert Bohyer.
Robert embodies what it means to be a member of the ``Greatest Generation.''
When the forces of fascism threatened the peace, security, and freedom of millions upon millions, Robert answered the call to serve, joining the U.S. Army Air Corps--which later became the Air Force--when he was only 18 years old.
