Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to honor the life of Leslie Kenneth Champney in recognition of his service in the United States Navy Reserve during the Second World War.
Seaman First Class Leslie Champney served his country from September 1, 1943 to May 25, 1946.
While in enlisted in the US Navy Reserve, Mr. Champney served overseas as a security officer aboard the SS Charles J. Folger and the USS Barber for a total of twenty-three months, experiencing both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters of the war.
Once while on a ship in the North Atlantic, 
Mr. Champney and his shipmates encountered a majestic whale, a memory he would often share with his children.
Upon his return from service, 
Mr. Champney fathered seven children and worked hard as an automotive mechanic, primarily focused on diesel vehicles.
Although he did not often speak of his time in the military, he deserves our gratitude and proper recognition for his contribution to the Allied victory in World War II.
Today, we present the late 
Mr. Champney's son, Kenn, with the five medals his father earned through his service during World War II.
