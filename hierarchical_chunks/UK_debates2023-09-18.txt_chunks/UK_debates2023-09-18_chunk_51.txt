I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
It is sometimes difficult to know what the Leader of the Opposition supports or does not support.
We have had a three-way flip-flop in just the last few days.
It is interesting that  the hon.
Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Louise Haigh) , from the Opposition Front Bench, raised the fact that I am here today rather than the Secretary of State, given that the shadow Chancellor  of the Duchy of Lancaster seems to have a very different opinion from the hon.
Lady about what is going on with Labour policy.
