Huddersfield is a proud railway town.
Is the Minister telling my constituents and the rest of the country that this is an abysmal failure of the country—the country of Brunel and Stephenson, the pioneers of railway building?
Is he telling us that the £100 billion was for nothing?
Is that what he is saying today?
No, I am not saying that.
As my hon.
Friend knows, I am proud to host the UK’s fastest-growing ports in my constituency, and one of the things that those ports are investing in is more freight connections to transport more containers by rail, rather than road.
Achieving the full potential of those connections absolutely requires HS2 to free up capacity elsewhere on the rail network, so will the Minister assure me that all the implications of any changes to the timetable for HS2 will be considered?
It impacts on net zero, the demand on our road infrastructure, and where things will arrive.
