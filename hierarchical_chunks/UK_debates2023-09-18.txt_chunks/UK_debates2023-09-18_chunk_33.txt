Will the Minister give an unambiguous answer to this question: is this Government still committed to building HS2 to Manchester from Euston?
People in the  north need to know whether they are being abandoned,  because it looks like that to me from press reports, which have not been made up by journalists.
Is it not the case that the Minister is fronting a Government who will not dare tell the electorate that they are abandoning the north?
There is no question of this Government abandoning the north.
We have put in huge amounts of funding, including on buses and new roads.
I was in Preston a few weeks ago to open the new Preston Western Distributor road.
The Government are hugely investing in the north of England—on rail, on roads, and indeed on our important bus network.
As I said earlier, Ministers will continue to update the House regularly on HS2, as we have done throughout.
Even when this project had arms and legs and eyebrows going across the whole country, it was always accepted that the business case was very weak and that, as a nation, we cannot really afford it.
I hope the Government do scrap HS2 north of Birmingham and save many more communities from the human misery that my constituents endure every day of the week from the construction.
If they do scrap it, it would leave the quite literally legless stump from outside central London to outside central Birmingham.
Will my hon.
Friend take the message back to his colleagues and to the Treasury that we cannot afford it and that what is left of phase 1 should be scrapped as well.
