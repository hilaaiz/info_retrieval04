I welcome my hon.
Friend to his very well-deserved place.
Of course, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had planned to close down Uxbridge police station, along with many others, until my hon.
Friend forced him into a humiliating U-turn before he was even elected—that is more than most of us achieved prior to coming to Parliament.
I join him in calling on the Mayor of London to keep Uxbridge police station open and to add that custody suite, but also to confirm the future of all those other police stations around London that he had threatened to close just a few years ago.
