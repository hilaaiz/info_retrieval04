I thank my right hon.
Friend for her tireless campaigning on behalf of the people of Rochester and Strood.
Kent has record police officer numbers at 4,261, which is about 10% more than it ever had under the last Labour Government.
We intend to review the police funding formula.
I strongly urge Medway Council to get on with putting that PSPO in place.
