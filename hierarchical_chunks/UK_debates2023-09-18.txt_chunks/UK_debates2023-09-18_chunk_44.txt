We have seen the Government give up on the eastern leg; we have seen them give up on connecting to central London; and we have seen the downgrading of Northern Powerhouse Rail.
We are now seeing the Government give up on connecting to the north-west and Britain’s second city of Manchester.
Why are the Government giving up on the north?
As I have said in answer to other hon.
Members, this Government have put unprecedented investment into our transport infrastructure right across the country.
I have no idea at all what Labour’s policy in this area is: it seems to flip-flop from one thing to another daily, making hundreds of billions of pounds’   worth of unfunded spending commitments.
We are a responsible Government who are going to make the right decisions in the long-term interests of the country, just as we have in supporting Greater Manchester and the Mayor’s new upgraded bus network, which we have been delighted to invest in over the past few months.
Having chaired the Select Committee on the first phase for 20 months, I always privately had the view that Old Oak Common was a more sensible place to stop, because the Elizabeth line runs straight through Old Oak Common and can deposit people from Heathrow into the city.
As for anything to do with Euston, it is a very small site and horrendously expensive.
However, the logic of the railway is that it does have to go to Manchester and beyond, otherwise it was not worth starting.
