I thank the Home Secretary very much for her recent visit to Southend, where she met the excellent police, fire and crime commissioner Roger Hirst and our excellent chief constable B-J. Harrington.
She heard about how Southend’s revolutionary Operation Union has driven down antisocial behaviour across our city by over 50%.
That will be assisted by the Government’s steps last week to tackle nitrous oxide—I thank her very much for tackling that menace.
However, constituents are raising with me antisocial behaviour in and around pubs, including drug-related incidents, so can my right hon.
and learned Friend tell me whether she has any specific plans to help local police deal with that particular problem?
