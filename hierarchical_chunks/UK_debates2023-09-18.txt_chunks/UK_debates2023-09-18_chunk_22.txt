Since we left the European Union, my constituent—a UK citizen from birth, as was confirmed by the British Nationality (Regularisation of Past Practice) Act 2023—has been repeatedly stopped by UK border guards and had  his citizenship questioned.
Is this British Government satisfied that the customs and immigration system is so chaotic that their own citizens are being othered by the Department’s officials, just because their parents were born in the EU?
I have no idea what the hon.
Lady is referring to, but I would be very happy to look into that individual case.
Over the summer, dozens of Traveller caravans have been illegally pitched in my Warrington South constituency, impacting playing fields in Appleton Thorn, Bewsey and Dallam, and costing thousands to clear up.
Warrington’s Labour council has avoided bringing forward proposals, despite having money in its budget.
Does the Minister agree that local authorities need to play their full part so that the police can be effective in using the legislation passed by this House?
Yes, I do agree; local councils should be robust in using the powers this House granted them, as should the police in terms of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022.
The police do have strong powers   under the amended Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, and I urge police forces up and down the country to use those powers.
We heard a little about retail crime earlier and it is a real issue in Birmingham, where a number of ugly, violent assaults on staff have taken place at Co-op stores in my constituency.
I was pleased to hear the Minister’s earlier response.
However, with less than 4% of about 8 million crimes actually recorded by the police, when can we expect to see the tougher measures he hinted at earlier?
