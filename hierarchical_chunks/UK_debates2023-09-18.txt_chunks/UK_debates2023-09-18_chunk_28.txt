I hope the Minister has had time to calm  down and perhaps take a breath after that astonishing   performance.
In attacking Labour on costs, he seems to be admitting what we all know, which is that phase 2 is an utter shambles—financially, operationally and politically.
First, it was the north-east and Yorkshire that were let down by this Government on HS2.
Now it seems to be the turn of the north-west, let alone Scotland and Wales.
In a similar timeframe to that of HS2, Spain has managed to install 624 km of high speed rail for a fraction of the cost.
This includes tunnels and bridges through far rougher terrain than that which HS2  passes through.
Since June 2018, 233 kilometres of this track has come into operational use.
What we have is a gold-plated commuter line of just 100 miles between two cities on the south of this island costing nearly £50 billion, while the rest of the country is expected to fight for scraps from the table.
When Philip Hammond was Transport Secretary he gave commitments on  HS2 infrastructure reaching Scotland, but that infrastructure is barely getting to the midlands.
Can the Minister  tell me in which decade HS2 infrastructure will actually get anywhere near Scotland?
How does any further cancellation, postponement or watering down of HS2 commitments fit with the so-called levelling-up strategy and when will Wales receive its rightful share of Barnett consequentials?
