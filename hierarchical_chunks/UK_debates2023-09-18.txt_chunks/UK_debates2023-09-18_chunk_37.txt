My constituents have been through absolute misery for 13 years now, ever since the hybrid Bill first started and they tried to defend their own area.
Unfortunately, HS2 has not provided continuity of support, has not provided good customer liaison and has not provided proper compensation.
People have been made miserable, and their mental health has been severely damaged by this project.
They deserve the right answer: is this project going ahead or is it not?
My constituency looks like an industrial site right now.
