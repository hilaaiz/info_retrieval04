I thank my hon.
Friend and constituency neighbour for his question.
He is absolutely right: the Prime Minister uses those trains regularly—in fact, I think they are made in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, or very nearby—to travel right across the country.
I welcome my hon.
Friend’s continued fighting for his constituents on rail and transport projects not just in his area but across the wider north and north-east of England.
I shall take his comments back to colleagues.
