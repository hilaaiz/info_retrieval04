What estimate has been made of the cost in contract litigation alone if the Chancellor were to conceive of scrapping phase 2 of HS2?
What I would say is that the Government are putting a huge amount of money into stage 1 of the scheme.
Thousands of jobs have already been created, as well as hundreds of apprenticeships, and it is going to deliver transformation to central Birmingham and to a deprived community in outer London.
That is investment very well made in those areas.
For the record, the roads Minister is a very good one, who has had to swap lanes today at short notice.
How many of the HS2 stations will have ticket offices?
Last Thursday in Westminster Hall, there was a train crash of a debate in which not a single Back Bencher from any political party backed the Government’s proposals.
As many people have asked the Minister to pass on messages today, could I add one more, in all good faith?
“You are under enough pressure on HS2 as it is.
Do yourselves a favour and drop the bonkers proposals to get rid of our ticket offices.”
