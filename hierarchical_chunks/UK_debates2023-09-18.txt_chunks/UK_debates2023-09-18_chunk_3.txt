It has been more than a month since all 39 asylum seekers were hauled off the 500-capacity Bibby Stockholm because of the detection of legionella, but the Home Secretary is yet to give a date for when the barge will actually be ready for use.
We still do not know why she chose not to wait for the legionella results before ploughing ahead, and why her Minister was so slow to act once the results came in.
We are still yet to hear a denial from the Home Secretary that it is one of the most lethal strains of the bacteria, as reported in the media.
Today, will she set out her responses to those questions and confirm the exact cost of the barge?
Half a million pounds per month to house zero asylum seekers on this floating symbol of failure feels utterly extortionate.
Why is it that the only boat this Government have managed to stop is their own?
I am somewhat surprised by the hon.
Gentleman’s change of tune: he is on the record in the media as supporting our use of the barge, so a change of heart is welcome.
We have assessed the barge—it  has been under constant scrutiny—and we will be re-embarking people on to that barge as soon as is practical and possible.
What is clear is that the hon.
Gentleman simply has no answers for how to solve the broader problem.
The truth is that Labour’s policy has not survived contact with reality: it has been denounced by the EU, its shadow Ministers are making it up as they go along, and the leader has had to backtrack—and it has not even been a week.
Only the Conservative party has a plan that is based on reality, deterrence and delivery, and it will stop the boats.
