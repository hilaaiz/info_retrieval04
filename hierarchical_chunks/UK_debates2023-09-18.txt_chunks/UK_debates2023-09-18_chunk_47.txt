I thank my hon.
Friend for making that important point—I was delighted to visit some of those freight services in her constituency with her just last week.
Getting freight on to rail is obviously an important objective of the Government, as is supporting those on the road network, and I will ensure that that is taken into consideration in any future decisions that the Government take.
