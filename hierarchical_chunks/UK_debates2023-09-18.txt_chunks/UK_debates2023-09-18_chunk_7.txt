The Minister will know that the Lord Advocate in Scotland has issued a prosecution statement saying that she will not prosecute anyone in possession of controlled substances in any pilot safe consumption or overdose prevention facility that might be established in Scotland.
Can he confirm what the Secretary of State for Scotland indicated in the House last week—that the UK Government will not seek to use any administrative or legislative means to frustrate or block the establishment of such a pilot facility?
First, it is important to make it clear that the UK Government’s position on drug consumption rooms in England and Wales is that we do not support them.
We are concerned that they condone or even encourage illegal drug use.
I want to put that on the record straightaway.
Of course, we respect the independence of the Lord Advocate as Scotland’s prosecutorial authority.
Providing that that power is exercised lawfully, of course we are not going to stand in the way of it, as my right hon.
Friend the Scottish Secretary set out last week.
I understand that plans may involve a strong integration with treatment and some consideration of each case on its individual merits, but we do not plan to interfere with the lawfully exercised prosecutorial independence of the Lord Advocate.
