Effectively, we are part of a European market.
Most of the gas that we produce is consumed in the United Kingdom, and most of our oil is refined elsewhere in Europe and contributes to European and UK energy security, as it is converted into product.
It is one joined-up market for historical reasons, and our refineries are used predominantly for oil that comes from abroad, as opposed to that which comes from the North sea.
These are multi-decadal investments, and as part of a managed decline in demand we will see refinery capacity reduced over time.
We are doing absolutely everything to do this in the most sensible manner possible, and it is a shame that Labour Members would have us import more.
They are all in favour of oil and gas jobs, so long as they are not in the UK, and they will bring in foreign imports from which we will get no jobs and no tax, with higher emissions.
It makes no sense, and only  the right hon.
