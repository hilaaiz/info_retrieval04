I thank my right hon.
Friend for his very helpful question.
I know that this is an issue of great concern to many Members.
He will appreciate that the Home Secretary and the Government will want to make any future announcements in a timely way while also considering all the effects that such a course of action might bring about, not least to our ships and their insurance, but I shall ensure that the Home Secretary has heard what he has said.
