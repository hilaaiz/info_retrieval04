I welcome the Government’s commitment to SMRs, which are the way forward for the future of nuclear.
Sheffield Forgemasters is ideally placed to produce the essential parts for those reactors and has a memorandum of understanding with both Rolls-Royce and Hitachi.
Will the Minister meet the Mayor of South Yorkshire, Sheffield Forgemasters and others in the consortium?
The consortium now has access to significant development capital, so we can build the SMRs in South Yorkshire and create the thousands of well-paid jobs we want, as well as green energy.
