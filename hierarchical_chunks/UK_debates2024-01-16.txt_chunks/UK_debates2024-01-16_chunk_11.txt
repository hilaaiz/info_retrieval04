I would be delighted to meet the Mayor of South Yorkshire.
Through the nuclear road map, we are committed not only to ensuring our energy security and achieving a further drive towards our net zero objectives, but to building up the supply chain and creating those high-wage, high-skilled jobs at all levels across the United Kingdom.
Of course I would be delighted to meet the Mayor of South Yorkshire and, indeed, anybody else who represents an area that wants to invest in this future and this great exciting moment for nuclear capacity.
I, too, am in favour of new nuclear; it is an important part of a balanced green energy mix.
Does the Minister share my concern that much of the investment in new nuclear in the UK is coming from overseas companies, and even the Governments of overseas countries, especially given that the emphasis is not just on reducing carbon emissions, but on energy security?
Would he perhaps consider other forms of renewable energy, such as tidal power,  for which the entire supply chain is British and which would be great for our economy as well as for tackling climate change?
