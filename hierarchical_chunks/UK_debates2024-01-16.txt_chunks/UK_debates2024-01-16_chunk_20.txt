New renewable energy generation demands new transmission infrastructure.
This Government have been asleep at the wheel for 14 years, showing zero pace, ambition or grip in delivering that energy infrastructure, and that is why bills are so high.
Nevertheless, we are where we are.
Will the Minister confirm to the House for the record what National Grid  has said: that UK Government policy is that when constructing new transmission infrastructure, overhead lines are the starting position?
