I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question; he is right to highlight the issue of debt and families who are struggling.
This is why we are providing £104 billion—or, on average, £3,700 per household—between 2022 and 2025, which is one of the most generous packages in Europe.
In the autumn statement, we increased the national living wage, which is worth £1,800 to a full-time worker, and increased benefits by 6.7%—that is worth £470.
Just last week, we also delivered a tax cut for 27 million people, which is worth £450 for the average worker.
So we are taking steps, but we recognise the reality for many people that he set out.
