Can my hon.
Friend confirm that, given all the questions about carbon accounting, sustainability and value for taxpayers’ money, the Government will not be guaranteeing Drax billions more in subsidies?
As my hon.
Friend knows, we will shortly be consulting on potential support arrangements to help facilitate the transition of large-scale biomass generation to power bioenergy with carbon capture and storage.
Power bioenergy with carbon capture and storage could deliver negative emissions to support our climate change targets and the UK’s energy security.
