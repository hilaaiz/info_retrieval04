On  28 November , I asked the Minister how many planning applications for onshore wind had been lodged in England since the alleged loosening of planning restrictions on onshore wind in September.
The answer then was zero.
Even now that the policy has had more time to bed down, the answer, I am afraid, is still zero, and I predict that it will be zero the next time we meet.
In September last year, the Secretary of State said that the changes made in September “will help speed up the delivery of onshore wind projects”.
Does the Minister think that the Government have succeeded?
