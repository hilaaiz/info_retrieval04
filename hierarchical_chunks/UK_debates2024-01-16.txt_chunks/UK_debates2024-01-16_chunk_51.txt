I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that helpful question.
I will ensure that the Home Secretary has heard what he has said.
The actions that he has described are not new; I think that, on average, that organisation has been behind about 500 attacks during any recent year against international shipping and people going about their daily business, and, as I have said, it is also engaged in activities in the UK.
As a member of the Defence Committee, the hon.
Gentleman will know of some the issues that surround this decision, but I am sure that if and when the Home Secretary makes his decision, he will want the House to be alerted at the earliest opportunity.
