My hon.
Friend will be pleased to know we are bringing forward small modular reactors and that the next phase of the live SMR competition will launch within weeks.
Our aim is for the competition to be the fastest of its kind in the world, to help facilitate final investment decisions for the project being taken in the next Parliament and operational projects being here in the UK by the 2030s.
The launch will mark a significant step forward for eligible companies and for the UK’s broader nuclear ambitions.
We have given away over the decades the massive advantage this country had with the Calder Hall development in 1956, so will my hon.
Friend reassure me that we will regain that ground by pushing for more rapid development of a sensible nature, as the Finns have with their hole in the ground for storing nuclear waste?
Will he inform the House with which nuclear vendors the Department is engaging?
My hon.
Friend is right to refer to the proud history we have in this country when it comes to civil nuclear—the developments at Calder Hall led the world—and the deep geological disposal that is happening in Finland right now.
The plans in our nuclear road map will quadruple nuclear capacity by 2050.
We are making rapid progress on Sizewell C and the SMR competition.
We continue to work closely with countries such as Finland, with which I engage with regularly.
It has built and operates large-scale geological disposal facilities, and signed up to the COP pledge to triple nuclear capacity.
