In the past month, the former Prime Minister who legislated for net zero has condemned the Minister’s oil and gas policy.
His colleague the former COP President has accused the Government of “not being serious” and the Government’s net zero tsar has resigned his seat in disgust.
Why does the Minister think that that is?
As we have rehearsed, the UK is the first major economy to halve its emissions.
It is the one that is delivering more going forward.
It is so important that we recognise that we will continue to need oil and gas for decades to come.
The Labour party’s policy will do the opposite; it will weaken British jobs, reduce taxes and put up emissions, and that is why we remain committed, working across society, to ensuring that we deliver.
It is not just us who oppose the Minister’s Bill, but those on his own side—he has lost an MP over it.
I know he brought down the last Government over fracking; he is trying to do it again with his new Bill.
That is the reason that people have lost confidence.
They see the hottest year on record and a Government backsliding on net zero.
Is it not the truth that the Conservatives who know and care most about climate change no longer support this Government?
The right hon.
Gentleman would love to think that was the case, but the Conservative party is united in driving this forward and in delivering.
We are powering up Britain from Britain.
We have taken ourselves from the abject position left by him when he was in government, which so many of my colleagues have described.
We must not go back to that, because it would put bills up, it would put emissions up, and it would stop us being the global net zero leader that we are.
