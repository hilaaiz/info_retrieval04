In my country, energy debt is rising, as Scottish consumers pay a premium on their energy bill—it is a high price to pay to keep the lights on in England.
In the light of that imbalance, has the Minister discussed abolishing the not-fit-for-purpose Ofgem?
If not, should his Government not give full responsibility for energy pricing in Scotland to the Scottish Parliament?
We have moved decisively to support families in Scotland and across the rest of the UK.
I am pleased that the price cap has fallen by half since its peak last year, and we are making sure that our support is targeted at the most vulnerable.
I have already laid out many of the measures we are taking precisely to ensure that people in Scotland and elsewhere are supported in what has been a tough time.
Overall, we are, of course, looking to power up Britain.
We have set out a plan to do that, precisely in order to have more of our power coming from Britain and to remove our dependence on foreign fossil fuels.
I hope that the hon.
Gentleman and his party will support us in our efforts to deliver that.
