I thank the Leader of the House for the statement and welcome the intention to hold the debate on Thursday.
In response to  the right hon.
Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr Francois) —a fellow member of the Defence Committee—the Leader of the House said that the Home Secretary would come back to the House “in a timely way”.
As the right hon.
Member highlighted, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps supplies the Houthis, especially with drone materials, and it was also committing international action last night in northern Iraq.
Rather than talking of a “timely way,” many of us in the Defence Committee would say, “Time’s up.”
I wonder whether the Leader of the House could reinforce to the Home Secretary the fact that across the House there is a clamour to proscribe the IRGC at the soonest opportunity.
