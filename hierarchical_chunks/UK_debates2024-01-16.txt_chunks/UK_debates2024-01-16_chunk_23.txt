I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, which has a sort of comic element given Labour’s monumental failure to deliver renewables when it was in power, coupled with the fact that it wants to bring forward GB Energy.
That, as his left-wing colleague,  the hon.
Member for Cynon Valley (Beth Winter)  just said, would be public investment.
It would drive out private investment and destroy the transformation of the UK energy system that has happened under the Conservatives—it had flatlined under Labour.
We have led the world and have now decarbonised more than any other major economy on the planet.
Under the policies of this Conservative Government, which major world economy is predicted to decarbonise fastest by 2030?
This one.
