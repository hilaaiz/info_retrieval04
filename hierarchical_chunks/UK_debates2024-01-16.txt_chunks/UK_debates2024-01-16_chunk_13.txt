I thank the Minister for that most progressive answer.
The progress made in nuclear safety and the need for clean energy clearly indicate that the Government must invest in the security of this sector.
That would lower energy costs and help us to meet our green targets, which we all want to meet and should meet.
Will the Minister outline what progress has been made to secure this investment?
