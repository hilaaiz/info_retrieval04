I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
He will be delighted to learn that renewable generation has increased fivefold from 2010 to 2022.
It has gone from a risible 26 TWh to 135 TWh.
Some 40 GW of renewable energy has connected to Great Britain’s electricity networks since 2010.
Since 2010, the UK has seen a more than 500% increase in the amount of renewable electricity capacity in the grid thanks to this Conservative Government.
