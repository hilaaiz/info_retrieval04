I welcome the fact that, belatedly, the Government have accepted that, despite their net-zero policies, the oil and gas industry is important for the future in the United Kingdom.
Does the Minister recognise that to benefit from the oil and gas in the North sea that will be released by the new licensing regime, we need to have refinery capacity?
There has been little, if any, investment in refinery capacity, because of the uncertainty of the future and the carbon taxes placed on it.
When will the Minister address that issue to ensure that we get the full benefit of the oil and gas that we extract from our shores?
