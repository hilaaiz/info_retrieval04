I am glad the Minister is frustrated about the complete failure of this alleged policy turnaround, but I am frustrated because if we had not had the absurd ban in the first place, the onshore wind development that would have taken place would have saved each family £180 on their energy bills.
All Labour is suggesting is that onshore wind is treated like any other development.
How long will it be before the Minister accepts the reality and concludes that he needs to go back and properly repeal the ban?
