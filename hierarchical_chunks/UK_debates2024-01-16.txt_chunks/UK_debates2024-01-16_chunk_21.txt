I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Of course, we have been moving at pace.
We have had the Winser review and the connections plan.
In the autumn statement and, indeed, the Prime Minister’s speech in September, there was so much to drive forward and change the transmission infrastructure, including halving the 14-year timeline to seven years.
We are working flat out.
