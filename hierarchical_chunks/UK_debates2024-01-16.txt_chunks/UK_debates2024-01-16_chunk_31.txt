I welcome the investment in carbon capture—we just need to get on and make something happen there.
Teesside is home to some of the most energy-intensive industries in the country, but instead of attracting more of those industries, including primary steel making, we are seeing plants closed down and jobs lost because investors do not see any industrial strategy from the Government.
High energy costs mean that it is cheaper to import many of the goods that until now we have made at home.
Why are the Government content to see this managed decline, rather than back the kind of strategy that will protect existing industries and drive investment and job creation?
