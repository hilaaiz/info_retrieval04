I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question and his personal commitment to this area, but he knows as well as anyone the parlous performance of the previous Government, which his right hon.
Friend  the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)  was a leading figure in.
Less than 7% of our electricity came from renewables as recently as 2010.
It is this Government that have led the world after a flatlining in carbon emissions from our electricity sector under Labour.
We have seen renewables grow and, by October, we will see coal entirely removed from our mix.
