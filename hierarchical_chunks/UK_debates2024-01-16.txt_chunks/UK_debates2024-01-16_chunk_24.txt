If I may puncture the Minister’s rant, I would like to ask him what certainty his Government will give businesses.
We need a £23 billion combined investment from the public and private sectors, but because targets have been missed, that figure will need to double or treble every year between now and 2050, according to a Public Accounts Committee report.
The Government’s chopping and changing in delivering what they need to do is a big problem in businesses having the confidence to invest.
That has happened on his watch, so what is he doing to improve the situation?
