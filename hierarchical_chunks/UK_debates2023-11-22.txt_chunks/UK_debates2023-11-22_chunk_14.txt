The hon.
Member is absolutely right to raise that.
She will know that such matters are mostly for the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.
That is why we are so keen to get the finances on a sustainable basis and achieve the long-term change that is needed.
That, of course, includes having a strategic plan for adaptation.
I hope to have the opportunity in this role to work with a Northern Ireland Executive to those ends.
