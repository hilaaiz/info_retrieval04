I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question and his obvious popularity in the House.
I agree with him.
He is completely correct that there are a whole host of issues that require elected Ministers in Northern Ireland to take their place.
I would like to place on record my thanks to the Northern Ireland civil service for the work they have been doing in such circumstances with the limited guidance we have given them, because they have been doing a sterling job on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.
