I thank my hon.
Friend for all his campaigning on this important issue.
In his constituency, we have delivered over 9,000 apprenticeships in great local businesses, including some in the hair and beauty sector that I visited as Chancellor.
While we continue to invest in apprenticeships, the Opposition want to halve the number offered.
That is the difference between us: we want to give people a hand up, but all Labour wants to do is to keep them in their place.
