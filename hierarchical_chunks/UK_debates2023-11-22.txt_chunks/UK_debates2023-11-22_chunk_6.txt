I thank the Secretary of State for the additional support that has been provided to businesses affected by flooding in Northern Ireland.
Will he work with us to ensure that, whatever additional support is required for the recovery of towns such as Downpatrick, Newry and Portadown is delivered by Northern Ireland Departments working together with the Northern Ireland Office?
