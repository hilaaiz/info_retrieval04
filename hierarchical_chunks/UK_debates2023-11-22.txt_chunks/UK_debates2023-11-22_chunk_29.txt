I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the important work of his local theatre company, Unleashed, and I wish it well in its future endeavours.
We are investing an unprecedented £2 billion over the next three years to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping, including by building thousands of move-on homes and implementing our landmark Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which has already prevented or relieved almost 600,000 households from suffering from homelessness.
