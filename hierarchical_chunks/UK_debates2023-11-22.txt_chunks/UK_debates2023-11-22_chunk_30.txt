Why are 34% of children in my constituency living in poverty?
It is this Government who, as a result of our actions, have ensured that across our country 1.7 million fewer people are living in poverty.
That’s not true.
Yes, it is true.
Not only that, but hundreds of thousands fewer children are living in poverty, and income inequality is at a lower level than we inherited from the Labour party.
We do not want any child to grow up in poverty, and the best way to achieve that is to ensure that they do not grow up in a workless household.
That is why the right strategy is to ensure that we provide as many children as possible with the opportunity to grow up with parents in work, and because of the actions of previous Governments several hundred thousand more families are in that— Got it.

I have a question about apprenticeships.
It is vital that individuals of any age can train and retrain for good local jobs, further education and skills opportunities that are available.
Will the Prime Minister work with me in my campaign to establish an apprenticeship hub in Broxtowe?
