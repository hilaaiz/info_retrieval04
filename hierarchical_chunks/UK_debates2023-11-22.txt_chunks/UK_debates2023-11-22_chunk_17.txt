There will have to be a review of what happened during the floods to learn lessons for the future, including things such as the need for a warning system—there is not currently one in Northern Ireland—better flood defences, and flood protection, which will all need funding in the years ahead.
In the continuing absence of the Executive, which is really needed at a time like this, does the Minister agree that there should be a review?
Does the Northern Ireland civil service have the power to establish such a review?
If not, will the Secretary of State do it?
