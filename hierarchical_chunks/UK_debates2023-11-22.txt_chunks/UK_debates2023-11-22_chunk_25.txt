I thank my hon.
Friend for his excellent campaigning on behalf of his constituents.
I agree with him that housing must meet the needs of local communities.
Our affordable homes programme is delivering hundreds of thousands of homes across the country.
Crucially, on this side of the House we believe that local communities must be consulted, in contrast to Labour’s plan for top-down housing targets, concreting over the green belt and destroying our precious countryside.
