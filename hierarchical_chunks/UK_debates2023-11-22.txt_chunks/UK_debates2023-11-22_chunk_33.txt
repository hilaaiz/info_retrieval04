I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue and for continuing to be a fantastic campaigner on birth trauma.
I am pleased that the first ever debate in Parliament on birth trauma was held recently, in October.
It was powerful and moving, and it highlighted the significant impact that birth trauma can have on so many women’s lives.
The Department of Health and Social Care is working with NHS England to make sure we improve maternity care and related mental healthcare.
I will ensure the Health Secretary meets with my hon.
Friend so that we can get this right for all the women who are depending on it.
