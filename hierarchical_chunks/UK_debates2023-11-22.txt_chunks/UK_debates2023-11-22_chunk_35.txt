I thank my hon.
Friend for her continuing dedication as my special envoy on this vital issue.
Red Wednesday is an important moment to demonstrate our solidarity with Christians and all those persecuted around the world for their religion or belief.
Marking this event annually was just one of the recommendations in the Bishop of Truro’s report.
I am pleased that today we will light up Foreign, Commonwealth  and Development Office buildings in the UK in red in support.
I am also pleased to say that we have taken forward all 22 recommendations in a way that we believe is making a real change for those persecuted for their religion or belief.
