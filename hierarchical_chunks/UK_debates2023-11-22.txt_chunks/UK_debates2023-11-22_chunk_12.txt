May I associate myself with the Secretary of State’s remarks on the anniversary of the Birmingham pub bombings?
Our thoughts continue to be with all who are affected by that tragedy to this day.
The UK Government, as we have just heard, are holding back levelling-up funding for Northern Ireland, ostensibly because of the lack of a functioning Executive.
However, the UK Government are seemingly content to bypass the views of the Governments in place in Edinburgh and Cardiff in allocating levelling-up funding.
Is the point of consistency not about a desire to level up, but just that there is a shortage of Conservative MPs in Northern Ireland who need to shore up their re-election prospects with public cash?
It is easy to throw out a cheap political line like that, but as the hon.
Member has heard me say to my right hon.
and learned Friend  the Member for South Swindon (Sir Robert Buckland)  and  the hon.
Member for Putney (Fleur Anderson) , the reality is that that levelling up money will be spent in Northern Ireland.
I can certainly assure him that none of that money has appeared in my marginal seat of Wycombe—even though the whole House will know it is undoubtedly the most deserving and most beautiful constituency in the nation.
What assessment he has made of the adequacy of the funding for flood recovery in Northern Ireland announced on 8 November 2023.
The floods have seen devastating consequences for businesses and households, so the Government have worked hard to come forward with a substantial package that is consistent with our approach across the UK.
In the absence of an Executive, we are making up to £15 million of support available through the reallocation of existing Northern Ireland funding.
We have worked closely with colleagues in the Northern Ireland civil service and the Treasury to ensure that the Northern Ireland civil service and local councils can provide affected businesses with the support they need.
