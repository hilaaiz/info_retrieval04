Following on from that question, communities across Northern Ireland are angry about the Government’s decision to exclude them from the latest round of levelling-up funding.
The Government have said that is because Stormont is not sitting, but that is a poor excuse, because round 2 funding was allocated to 10 projects in Northern Ireland in January this year, when the Executive were also not in place.
Only £120 million of the pot of £5 billion has been allocated to Northern Ireland so far.
There is a huge additional need in communities, but millions is being held back, as the Minister has just said.
Will the Secretary of State commit to reversing this unjust decision with immediate effect?
The hon.
Lady makes her point with great force
but, as I just said to my right hon.
and learned Friend  the Member for South Swindon (Sir Robert Buckland) , the money will be spent in Northern Ireland.
We are keen to work with Northern Ireland Ministers to that effect.
When it comes to the overall level of money required, the hon.
Lady will know that we have just put more than £700 million into PEACEPLUS, which will help support Northern Ireland.
The reality is that we are working hard to ensure that Northern Ireland has the funding it needs, but in order to sort out the problems that Northern Ireland faces, we need a restored Executive and, I am afraid, revenue raising.
We need to be working with Northern Ireland Ministers to make sure that we get the public service reform that is so urgently needed.
