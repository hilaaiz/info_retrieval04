I welcome the Prime Minister’s Network North project, which will see the full £1.7 billion put into the midlands rail hub.
That will reopen the central platforms at Kings Norton station, which have been derelict for so long.
Will he bring forward the cash so that we can increase capacity on the line and improve journey times?
Will he also look at my campaign to extend the new Camp Hill line to Longbridge?
That would open up access to the new Longbridge business park, which he visited earlier in the year and will bring back manufacturing jobs to Longbridge for the first time since MG collapsed in 2005.
