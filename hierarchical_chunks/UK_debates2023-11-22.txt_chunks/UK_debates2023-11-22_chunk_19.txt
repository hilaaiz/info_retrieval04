I thank the hon.
Member for the proposals that he and his party have shared with me regarding these matters, as well as those of  the hon.
Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson) .
I read his article in The Irish Times earlier this morning with great interest, but he will know that such change is not exactly the silver bullet and will need some negotiation.
