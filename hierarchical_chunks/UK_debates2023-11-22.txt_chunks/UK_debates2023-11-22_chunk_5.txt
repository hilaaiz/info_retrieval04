I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I very much enjoy working with him on a regular basis to try to achieve the aims he has set out.
We have so far gone a long way in this space with the Windsor framework, but I look forward to continued engagement with him in the next few days, because we do need to find a resolution to these issues that also means we can re-form Stormont and deal with the other domestic issues in Northern Ireland.
