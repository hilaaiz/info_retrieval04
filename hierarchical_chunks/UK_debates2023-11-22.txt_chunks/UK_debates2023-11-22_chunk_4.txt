Further to that excellent question from  the hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Jonathan Gullis) , our objective is to ensure that Northern Ireland’s place in our biggest market, the United Kingdom, is restored and protected in law.
Will the Secretary of State work with us to ensure that, where goods are moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, they are not subject to EU customs processes that are neither necessary nor fair and right?
Save for reasons of animal health and the risk of smuggling, there should not be checks on those goods.
