I join the Secretary of State in his remarks about all those who lost their lives in the terrible Birmingham pub bombings.
We remember them.
Last week, in Downpatrick, Newry and Portadown, I saw the terrible effects of the flooding on businesses and households, many of whom cannot get flood insurance and therefore face huge losses.
Can the Minister assure  us that once the initial £7,500 has been paid out to all businesses from the money that the Secretary of State announced during his visit, the Treasury will approve proposals for the use of the rest of the money quickly so that businesses affected can receive help and get back up and running again?
If more is needed, will he provide it?
The rest of the money is within the power of the Northern Ireland civil service to spend, because it is reallocated funding.
Alas, the Treasury is not under my control—all I can say is that I look forward to the day.
