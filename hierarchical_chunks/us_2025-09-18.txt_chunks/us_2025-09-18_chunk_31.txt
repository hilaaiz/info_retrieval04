Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize my friend, Mr. David Williams, for being awarded the Best Community Banking Award for 2025 by the Community Bankers.
This prestigious and welldeserved distinction reflects his dedication to Michigan's banking industry and his tireless contributions to communities throughout Michigan's 1st Congressional District.
