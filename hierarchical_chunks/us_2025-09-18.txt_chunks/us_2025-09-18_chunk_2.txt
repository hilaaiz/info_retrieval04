Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter of American Business Women's Association (ABWA), charted in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on July 31, 2021, and to celebrate American Business Women's Day.
ABWA's Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter held its first meeting on May 22, 2019, with a clear vision: to provide a community for businesswomen to grow through networking connections that empower, advocate and educate in a diverse atmosphere of meetings and community involvement.
Through their efforts, they have brought together businesswoman from a variety of fields, offering opportunities for personal and professional growth through mentorship and more.
I am proud to join them and their sister chapters across our country in celebrating 76 years of ABWA and its impact in Fredericksburg, Stafford, and Central Virginia.
I thank the Fredericksburg Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter for their dedication to uplifting others, and I'm proud to join them in celebrating their achievements and ongoing commitment to empowering women in business.
