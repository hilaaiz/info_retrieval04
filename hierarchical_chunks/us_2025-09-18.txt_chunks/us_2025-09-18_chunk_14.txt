Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mayor Donny Schmit for his extraordinary service to Fox Lake, his devotion to Grant Community High School, and his well-deserved induction into the Grant Community High School Hall.
His contributions will have a lasting impact, and his example will continue to inspire future generations.
