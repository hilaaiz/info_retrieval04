Mr. JAMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of the Orthodox Christian Church, the second largest Christian church in the world.
This week, His All-Holiness is visiting the White House and members of Congress, and I am proud to join in recognizing his leadership.
Patriarch Bartholomew has been a tireless voice for peace, religious freedom, and human dignity around the globe.
He is also a recipient of the prestigious Templeton Prize, joining the ranks of Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, individuals who have dedicated their lives to advancing humanity's purpose and moral compass.
Michigan, and especially Macomb County, is blessed with a vibrant Greek-American community.
More than 7,200 residents in Macomb trace their heritage to Greece, with Sterling Heights home to the largest concentration.
Within Macomb County alone, nearly 4,500 Greek Orthodox faithful gather in worship and service.
Parishes like St. John Greek Orthodox Church and Assumption Greek Orthodox Church are not just places of faith, they are pillars of community life, strengthening families, serving neighbors, and preserving treasured traditions.
On behalf of Michigan's 10th District, I extend my gratitude and pride to His All-Holiness Patriarch Bartholomew for his spiritual leadership and his enduring contributions to people of faith in Michigan, across America, and around the world.
