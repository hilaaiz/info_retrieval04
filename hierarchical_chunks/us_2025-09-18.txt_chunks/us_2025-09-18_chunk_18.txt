Mr. WIED.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Vernon Krawczyk, a devoted veteran, business owner, educator, and longtime resident of the Green Bay community.
Born on December 23, 1933, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Zeno and Isabelle Krawczyk, Vern exemplified service and commitment throughout his life.
A proud graduate of Central Catholic High School in 1952, he attended St. Norbert College before enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1954, serving honorably until 1957.
He completed his degree at St. Norbert College in 1959 and married Judy Selissen on November 27, 1959, building a life rooted in family and community.
Vern and Judy operated the Skytop Supper Club from 1972 until their retirement in 2005, creating a cherished gathering place for the community.
Vern's dedication to Green Bay was remarkable as he served as an adjunct instructor at NWTC for over 15 years, teaching business, marketing, and responsible beverage service.
His leadership extended to roles as president of the Brown County Tavern League for over 20 years, former chair of the Brown County Republican Party, and member of the St. Vincent Hospital Advisory Council, the Bellevue Optimist Club, and the NEW Zoological Society's Tech Advisory Commission.
He also served on the City of Green Bay's Protection and Welfare Committee and chaired fundraising for the Shy Ranch for Boys, further reflecting his commitment to education and youth.
In his spare time, Vern enjoyed gardening, cooking, fishing, and deer camp, always with a focus on conservation.
Through and beyond his hobbies, he touched countless lives with his warmth, generosity, and tireless work ethic.
Vern is survived by his wife, Judy, their three children, Patty, Steve, and John; eight grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and many nieces and nephews.
