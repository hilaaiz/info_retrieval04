Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of American Legion Post 667 in Universal City, Texas.
Since its chartering in 1975, Post 667 has stood as a cornerstone of service, supporting veterans, active-duty service members, and families across northeast Bexar County.
For five decades, the Post has served as a hub for camaraderie, patriotic education, civic engagement, and community service.
From mentoring youth through programs that instill duty and honor, to assisting veterans as they transition to civilian life, Post 667 has embodied the American Legion's mission of service not self.
Their members have organized countless community events, supported patriotic observances, and provided a strong voice for those who have worn the uniform of our Nation.
