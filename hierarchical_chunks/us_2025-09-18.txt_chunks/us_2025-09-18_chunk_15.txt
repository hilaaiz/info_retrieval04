Ms. MENG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor His All-Holiness Bartholomew, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, on his visit to Washington, D.C., and his reception of the Templeton Prize in New York City.
Patriarch Bartholomew has served since 1991 as the spiritual leader of more than 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, including many from the Greek Orthodox community from Queens, New York, whom I am proud to represent.
Known as ``first among equals'' among the Primates of the Orthodox Church, he carries forward a tradition that reaches back nearly two thousand years to the Apostle Andrew.
Throughout his ministry, he has been a champion of religious freedom, human rights, and interfaith dialogue.
He has worked to build bridges between Christians, Jews, and Muslims, and has consistently spoken out for peace.
He is also recognized as the ``Green Patriarch'' for his leadership in addressing climate change and environmental destruction, which he has called a sin against God's creation.
His efforts have brought together scientists, world leaders, and faith communities to safeguard our planet.
The Ecumenical Patriarch is no stranger to this Capitol.
In 1997, he received the Congressional Gold Medal under this very dome.
As he visits Congress once again, we honor his lifetime of service as a peacemaker and a bridge-builder for our world.
