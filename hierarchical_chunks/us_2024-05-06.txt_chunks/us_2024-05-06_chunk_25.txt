Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Jose Lugo.
Jose was a loving son, father, brother, uncle, cousin, and friend.
He put others before himself, and he made people laugh endlessly.
He loved music and having a good time with his family and friends, while always ensuring that his friends and family were taken care of.
While Jose is no longer with us, his loved ones are left with so many beautiful memories of him.
His favorite places to visit were Half Moon Bay, Pescadero, or any beach.
He was selfless and truly had a heart of gold, and demonstrated this by choosing to donate his organs at the end of his life so that others would receive an opportunity to extend their lives.
He was able to save five different lives by donating his earthly organs, and for that he is now a guardian angel and hero.
He will forever be in his family's hearts, and with his loved ones wherever life takes them.
We love him and he will be missed dearly.
May he rest in peace.
