Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional life and the dedicated service of United States Navy veteran Thomas William Killian.
Thomas was born on April 8, 1931, in Troy, New York where he was raised and attended school before enlisting in the U.S. Navy.
Thomas enlisted in the Navy in 1951, serving for twenty years during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
During his time in the Navy, he was trained as a shipfitter and served aboard the USS Baltimore (CA-68), a heavy cruiser; the USS Lowe (DE-325), an Edsall-class destroyer escort; the USS Sierra (AD-18), a Dixie-class destroyer tender; and the USS Jason (AR-8), a Vulcan-class repair ship.
Thomas remained in the Navy until September of 1971, when he retired at the rank of First Class (E-6).
For his service, Thomas was awarded the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal with two bronze stars.
Thomas married his wife Patricia in October of 1952.
Together, they shared 69 devoted years of marriage and had 4 children:
Thomas, Beth, Colleen, and Patricia.
After coming home from duty, Thomas returned to his wife and children in Troy.
Utilizing the skills that he developed during his career with the Navy, he obtained a job as a fitter and welder at McKinney Steel Fabrications in Albany, New York where he worked for 22 years until his retirement in 1993.
When Thomas was not working, he enjoyed spending time with his family.
He had many hobbies including traveling, camping, surf fishing, and going on cruises.
A beloved member of his community, he is remembered for his many professional and private accomplishments.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to recognize Thomas Killian's extraordinary life of service, hard work, profound commitment, and devotion to the United States.
