I listened carefully to that answer.
While Brexit has been deeply damaging to farmers all across the United Kingdom, the actions taken by the Scottish Government mean that farmers in Scotland have far greater protection than those elsewhere on these islands.
The SNP Government have guaranteed Scottish farmers the level of funding that was available pre-Brexit, unlike the Tories here in England or indeed the Labour party in Wales.
That is the SNP standing up for farmers in words and deeds, unlike the Westminster parties.
Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to apologise to farmers in England for his Government’s betrayal of them?
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to the £2.4 billion commitment in our manifesto, which has been met in full.
What steps his Department is taking to help increase tree planting.
This Government have put in place the most comprehensive regime ever to increase tree planting.
Crucially, it is underpinned by legislation in the Environment Act 2021 and legally binding targets to increase our tree cover to 16.5%, and supported and backed up by our £675 million nature for climate fund.
To date, 15 million trees have been planted under this Government, more trees than in any other decade.
Trees must play a crucial role if we are to meet our commitments on nature recovery and net zero, and they are a tremendous source of happiness, well-being and landscape beauty.
To meet the ambitious tree-planting goals that the Government have set, can they streamline the permissions process?
Some of the red tape seems disproportionate and in need of regulatory reform.
