I thank the Leader of the House for the business statement and for announcing the Backbench Business debate for  Thursday 16 May .
If awarded time on  23 May , we would propose debates on UK arms exports to Israel and on potholes and highway maintenance.
Those would be the two debates immediately before the Whitsun recess.
Although all Chamber slots until the Whitsun recess are now pre-allocated, we would still welcome applications for Thursday debates in Westminster Hall, where the new time seems to be working quite well.
