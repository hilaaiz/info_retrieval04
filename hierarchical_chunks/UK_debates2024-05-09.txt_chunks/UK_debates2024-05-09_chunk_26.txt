My hon.
Friend is quite right to draw attention to the online fraud charter—a world first—which sits under the Online Safety Act 2023.
Twelve of the biggest tech companies are working together to reduce fraud on their platforms.
The signatories are agreeing to undertake certain measures within six months, such as blocking, reporting and take-downs, to ensure that the vulnerable—such as children being exploited as money mules—are protected online.
What assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the Crown Prosecution Service in prosecuting people that have committed crimes while protesting.
Non-threatening peaceful protest is fundamental, but those rights are not absolute and they must be balanced with the rights and freedom of others.
The CPS works closely with the police to ensure that those who commit offences during protests are brought to justice and our streets are kept safe.
Indeed, just last month the CPS successfully prosecuted a protester under the Terrorism Act 2000 after he wore a Hamas headband to a pro-Palestine rally.
