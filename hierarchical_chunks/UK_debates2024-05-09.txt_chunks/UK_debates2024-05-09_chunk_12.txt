We learned from the Public Accounts Committee report that 500 flood defence projects have been cancelled, just like the one in Lowestoft.
Whether the Minister chooses to use the words “cancelled,” “deferred,” “delayed” or “on a long list” makes no difference, because he is still refusing to tell us where those projects are.
Why does he insist on holding residents in contempt by not telling them the fate of their local flood defences?
I and my officials have been reviewing the applications that have been put forward, and announcements will be coming very soon.
The Government are investing £1.3 billion in flood defences, which is more than ever before, and we will continue to ensure that we are better protecting coastal communities.
How much funding his Department plans to provide for catchment partnerships in the 2024-25 financial year.
One hundred catchment-based approach partnerships are set out in the plan for water.
The catchment-based approach is exactly the right one— I agree with the decision taken by my right hon.
Friend on that—and is exactly the approach that we are taking.
In the financial year, £15,000 is allocated to each catchment for that.
