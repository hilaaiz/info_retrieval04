I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for raising this very important matter.
I am pleased that the meeting between the Prime Minister, the Education Secretary and university vice-chancellors is going on today.
We know from recent research that there are universities that do this really well—that treasure all their students and want an environment on campus in which people can learn and live their best life.
Sadly, that is not happening on all campuses.
The conduct by the NUS, and by particular students in it, is nothing short of grotesque, and I am sure that Members in all  parts of the House would agree on that point.
It is absolutely vital that we push back against the growing trend of increased antisemitism.
I think that I speak for most, if not all, hon.
Members when I say that we are supportive of any measures that will do that.
