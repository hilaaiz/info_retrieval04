I have always said that the Conservatives made a mistake in overlooking the right hon.
Lady, and she has shown that again today.
In that regard, can she help me with what I think is a narrow but important problem?
Both Front-Bench teams support the continuation of arms sales to Israel, but the great majority of Back Benchers, even on the Conservative side, would like the opportunity to vote otherwise.
That has been stopped—stymied—in the past.
I hope that she can find a way for the House to freely express its attitude to this question.
The Government, and the Labour Front Benchers, might get a rude awakening and a big surprise.
