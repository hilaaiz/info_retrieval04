We have heard questions about the International Court of Justice, but I want ask some questions about the International Criminal Court.
Its chief prosecutor said last week that “all attempts to impede, intimidate, or improperly influence” the Court over its investigations of war crimes in Gaza must “cease immediately”.
He was forced to issue that demand after a letter signed by 12 United States senators warned the ICC: “Target Israel and we will target you.”
That letter threatened sanctions not just against the ICC’s officials, but against its employees, associates and families.
Will the Attorney General join me in condemning those Republican senators for their outrageous actions?
Will she also join the chief prosecutor in agreeing that  anyone who threatens the ICC simply for doing its job is undermining the very impartiality and independence on which its international mandate depends?
I thought that the ICC’s statement was worthy of note, and I am grateful to the right hon.
Lady for bringing it to the House’s attention.
In his statement, the independent prosecutor was also keen to point out that he welcomed active engagement by Governments and other parties on the work in which he is clearly engaged around the world to ensure that international humanitarian law is respected and war crimes are not committed.
He is a British prosecutor, and we in this Government are proud to work with him; we have been very proud to support him in his work in Ukraine, for example.
There are ongoing investigations of what is going on in Israel and Gaza by more than one international court at present, and I think it is difficult to speculate on specific outcomes.
