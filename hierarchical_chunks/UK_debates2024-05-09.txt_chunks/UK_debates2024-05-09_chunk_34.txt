I welcome my new hon.
Friend  the Member for Blackpool South (Chris Webb) .
He is the first person from Blackpool to represent Blackpool in over 60 years.
Having campaigned with him for years, I am now proud to call him my hon.
Friend.
I know that his former boss, and our good friend, Tony Lloyd would be thrilled and proud, too.
