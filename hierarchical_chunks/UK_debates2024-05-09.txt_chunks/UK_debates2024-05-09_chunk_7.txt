What are the Government doing to support farmers?
Quite a few people are asking that.
When one looks at the evidence of what is going on, the survey this week from the National Farmers Union into farmer confidence revealed that a staggering 65% of farmers are facing declining profits, or their business will not survive at all.
Their prospects are worse than most Tory MPs, it suddenly seems.
Why is it that farmers do so badly under the Conservatives?
The hon.
Gentleman seems to have written that question before listening to the various examples that I have just given, but let me give him one.
The most successful scheme the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has ever run is the current sustainable farming incentive scheme, with over 20,000 applications—more than any other scheme the Department has run.
We have also been flexible in looking at how those schemes are delivered, given the challenges of the wet weather, and I will have more to say on that very shortly.
