I thank my right hon.
Friend for the work she has done in her constituency to encourage tree planting, but she is right that the process needs to be fast and simple.
We have taken that on board, and the Forestry Commission has recently introduced the woodland creation fast track, aiming to help to decide eligible woodland creation offers within just 12 weeks.
To inform that scheme, it has developed a low-sensitivity map of the whole country to show people the best places to plant  trees, or where they could think about planting trees, that are not on our best available agricultural land, which is important for food.
