One has only to look over the hedges of eastern England to agree with those who are predicting the worst harvest in living memory.
What assessment has the Secretary of State made of the impact that will have on the wider rural economy—in particular, the availability and price of straw, which is vital for the livestock sector, and important commodities such as potatoes, which are likely to be under great pressure in terms of supply and price this autumn?
As ever, my right hon.
Friend is absolutely on the money in terms of the concern regarding straw prices and lower harvests this autumn.
We are engaging extensively with the sector.
We have the Farm to Fork summit next week, chaired by the Prime Minister.
That is an indication of how seriously we are taking this, and how much we are engaging with farmers and farm leaders.
It is north-east week in the parliamentary canteens, and I hope all Members are taking the opportunity to enjoy great north-eastern produce.
However, it is always north-east week in Grainger Market in Newcastle, which tries to champion local farmers and produce.
What is the Secretary of State doing to support north-east farmers in the challenges they face to produce sustainable and affordable food for my constituents facing a cost of living crisis?
As the MP for North East Cambridgeshire, I feel I should extend north-east a little wider, given that we are a big food-producing area.
To the hon.
Lady’s specific point, the Minister for Farming is engaging with that issue and is travelling up to the north-east this evening as part of that engagement.
Our colleague, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Colchester (Will Quince) , is conducting a review of public sector food procurement, so that within our public sector we can better procure domestic produce.
We also have a review of labelling so that we can more clearly label that fantastic produce from the north-east, to ensure that purchasers can buy it more easily.
