Can we have a debate in Government time on the vexed question of leasehold reform?
In my constituency, developers are selling, or proposing to sell, packages of property freeholds to third-party companies and denying  leaseholders themselves the chance to buy the freeholds of the properties that they live in.
This is a really complex legal question, but an awful lot of leaseholders do not have the wherewithal to fight the property development companies and third-party companies buying such investment portfolios.
Taylor Wimpey is a company with an interest in development in my constituency that is currently doing this.
Can we have a debate in Government time to try to sort out this vexed question?
