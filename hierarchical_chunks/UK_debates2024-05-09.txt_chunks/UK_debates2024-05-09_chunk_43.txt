I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his helpful advert for the Backbench Business Committee.
He raises the very important matter of a particular aspect of leasehold.
He will know that the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is very focused on these issues.
If the hon.
Gentleman wants to give me specific examples, I will ensure that the Secretary of State has heard the detail of his case.
