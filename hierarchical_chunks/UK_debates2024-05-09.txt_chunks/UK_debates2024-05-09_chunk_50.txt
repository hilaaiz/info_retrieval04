The hon.
Gentleman has found the answer to his own question: he has just been able to freely express his view on this matter.
As he knows, there are strict rules regarding our arms exports, which are also scrutinised by a Select Committee of this House.
That is the Government’s policy, and if those lines are breached and there is evidence of that, that policy will kick in.
Wessex Fields is a large chunk of council-owned land in north Bournemouth.
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council is rushing through the sale of that nine acres of real estate for £4 million less than its independent evaluation, claiming it is storage rather than employment land.
This is the same council that is cutting our famous annual air festival and selling off car parks, public paddling pools and plant nurseries, all because—it claims—there is no money, yet here it is throwing away £4 million of local taxpayers’ money.
I have written to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up and to the council’s scrutiny committee calling for that decision to be investigated, but Bournemouth deserves better, so can we please have a debate on poor council decision making?
I am extremely sorry to hear about those decisions in my right hon.
Friend’s constituency, and I am sure many Members of the House who have visited the air show previously and are very fond of Bournemouth as a consequence will also be disappointed to hear about the choices his council is making.
He has done the right thing in asking the Secretary of State and the council’s scrutiny committee to look at this issue; I will also make sure that the Secretary of State understands its urgency, and I hope we can get some common sense.
