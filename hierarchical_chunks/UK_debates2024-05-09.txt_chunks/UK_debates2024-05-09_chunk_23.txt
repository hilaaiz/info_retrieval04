I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this extremely pertinent point.
She is right to emphasise the importance of early co-operation between the police and the CPS.
At a visit last month to Charing Cross police station I considered precisely that point.
There is a buddy system there, with CPS lawyers working with police officers, which is improving case file quality.
We are actively exploring how to ensure closer early working with the CPS and the police, and I will look at Stockport with her.
