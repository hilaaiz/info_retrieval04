The Secretary of State was asked— What the locations are of successful applicants to the natural flood management programme.
Forty projects have been selected to proceed to the development stage of the £25 million natural flood management programme.
They include a broad range of locations, from Alnmouth to St Austell.
I am working with residents in the Chase Way and Kendal Drive area of Great Sutton, alongside Environment Agency representatives and members of the local authority, to try to find a solution to the flooding problems that we have there.
There are lots of different pots of money available at different times, and sometimes it is difficult to understand what the realistic chances are of our succeeding in getting the funding that we need to bridge the gap that we have at the moment to get the works done.
Will it be possible for me to meet with either the Secretary of State or some of his team to talk about what realistic funding options we have for the area?
