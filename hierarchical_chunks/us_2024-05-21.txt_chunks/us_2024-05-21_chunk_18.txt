Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Fredon Township on its 120th anniversary.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with them.
Over the past 120 years, Fredon Township has flourished into a lively town with vibrant natural scenery and rich history.
As the youngest township in Sussex County, Fredon Township was formed from parts of Andover, Green, Hampton, and Stillwater Townships and is home to approximately 3,450 residents and 1,203 residential dwellings.
Once a dusty, rutted, narrow dirt road on Route 94, traveling through a busy little village in the 1800s, can now be found as the core of the township.
I am proud to have such a remarkable town within the 7th District, and I look forward to watching it continue to thrive in the coming decades.
I wish Fredon Township a wonderful 120th anniversary.
May its next 120 years be filled with as much success as this one.
