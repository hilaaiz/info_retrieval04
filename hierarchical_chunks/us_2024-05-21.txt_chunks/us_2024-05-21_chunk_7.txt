Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Marine veteran Conrad C. Janowski, who passed away on May 12, 2024.
A long-time resident of Fort Wayne, Indiana, Conrad was a respected member of the community, an accomplished architect, and beloved husband, father, and friend.
Conrad attended the University of Notre Dame, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree.
After he moved his family to Fort Wayne, he served on the Board of Directors for the Indiana Society of Architects and was President of the Northern Chapter early in his career.
One of Conrad's greatest sources of pride throughout his life was his service in the United States Marine Corps from 1956 to 1958.
We honor Conrad for his service to his country and for the civic leadership he showed across the entirety of his life.
May he rest in peace.
