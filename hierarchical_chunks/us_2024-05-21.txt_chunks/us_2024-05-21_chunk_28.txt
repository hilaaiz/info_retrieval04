Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, South Carolina is recognizing the extraordinary achievements of Gayle Averyt, who is a Southern Gentleman who has been a top business and political leader.
My personal appreciation is for his courage as one of the state's earliest Republicans, building the modern Party from non-existence to now super majorities with all statewide elected officials Republicans.
