Born and raised in Detroit, it was a childhood dream of Bob's to become a police officer.
When looking for a position, Bob was saddened to find that most police departments at that time had a height requirement.
Luckily for Bob and for Novi, the Novi Police Department had no such requirement.
Bob began his service to the City of Novi as a police officer in 1975.
Soon after starting the job, Bob learned about the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program.
After attending a two-week course and becoming a DARE Officer, Bob launched the DARE program here in Novi.
To this day, Bob teaches DARE to the children.
Bob's leadership within the department led him to be promoted to the role of Detective, later earning the rank of Seargent shortly before his retirement in 2002.
After spending some time on Novi's Zoning Board of Appeals, Bob decided to run for City Council, a seat he would hold for the next 8 years.
In 2011, Bob took the next step and was elected Mayor of the City.
His 12 years at the helm has led Novi to reduce its debt by 75 percent and cut its crime rate in half.
Novi has received national recognition for their support of small businesses, community schools, and technology innovation.
In 2022, Fortune Magazine ranked Novi in the Top Ten Best Places to Live for Families in the United States.
