Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski and held important positions at the Buffalo City Court.
She was the Vice President of the Pulaski Association, chaired the Youth Services and Citizens Police Advisory Boards in the Town of Cheektowaga, and sat on the board of the YWCA Institute for Public Leadership Planning.
She was an American Heart Association board member and had been Grand Marshall of Buffalo's Pulaski Day Parade.
Active in politics, she was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1992, 1996, and 2012.
She generously lent her time, her expertise, and her friendly and positive attitude to political efforts.
We join our friend, Camille's dedicated husband, Bob Brandon, in mourning this tremendous loss.
All of us who knew and worked with Camille will remember her with deep gratitude and affection.
If more people in the realms of politics, government and civic affairs shared Camille's deep commitment to kindness, decency and mutual understanding, our nation would be far better off.
May she continue to be an example to all of us.
