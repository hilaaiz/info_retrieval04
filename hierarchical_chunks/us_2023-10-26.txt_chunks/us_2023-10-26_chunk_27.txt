Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Bob Gatt and the 48 years of service he has given to the residents.
While he is retiring from local politics, service runs in his blood, and Bob plans to continue as the Manager of the Oakland County Animal Shelter.
We thank Bob for his tremendous service and wish him some much-deserved tranquility in this next chapter of life.
I thank Bob.
