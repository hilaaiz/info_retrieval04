Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring the remarkable life of 
Mrs. Mary Ellen Rivers Smith.
She is remembered fondly by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchild, beloved relatives, church family, and dear friends.
Mrs. Smith lived a life full of love, devotion, public service, and grace.
She will be sorely missed and well-remembered by all blessed to know her.
