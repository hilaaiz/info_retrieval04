Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize an incredible friend and community leader, Samantha Woll.
Our community is deeply saddened by her tragic death and the sudden loss of a courageous and tenacious fighter for all.
I first met Samantha, affectionately known as Sam, in 2016.
Sam was driven by her Jewish faith that led to her interfaith work.
Sam had the ability to connect with diverse communities and bring people together in a way that made us all stronger.
Her lasting impact is a testament to her strong values and character.
Not only did she serve as the President of the Isaac Agree Detroit Downtown Synagogue where she worked tirelessly in preparation of its recent re-opening, Sam also served with numerous community organizations, including serving on the board of the Mary Turner Center for Advocacy.
Through her work, Sam created spaces for both Muslim and Jewish youth together.
Sam served on a number of Democratic campaigns and volunteered for many political causes, helping support local, state and national issues.
Above all, Sam was a daughter, sister and aunt who absolutely adored her family.
If she wasn't actively organizing her community, she was spending most of her time with family and traveling.
Sam was our beacon Samantha Woll's infectious spirit, warmth, and friendship will be sorely missed.
Please join me in recognition of Samantha Woll's life and legacy.
May her memory be a blessing.
