Ms. Smith was a proud graduate of the Charleston School System, having attended Simonton Elementary School, where I began my professional career, and the historic Avery Institute, the first accredited secondary school for African Americans in Charleston.
The Avery Institute had a special place in her heart.
Decades after graduation, 
Mrs. Smith donated several artifacts from her school days to what has become the Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture.
