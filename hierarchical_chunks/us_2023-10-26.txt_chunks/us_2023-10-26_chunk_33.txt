Under Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White's leadership, the members of the Women's Missionary Society have grown in their mission focus.
Episcopal Supervisor Penny is intentional about ensuring the missionaries bless organizations that serve ``the least of these.''
Donations of diapers, clothing, socks, coats, toiletries, toys, and funds are just a sampling of the ways the missionaries have an impact.
Penny's service to her community is rich and extensive, including serving: with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Miami; as Chair and Co-Chair of United Way Campaigns: as a Co-Chair for multiple March of Dimes sub-committees; on Committees within the American Cancer Society; as Treasurer for the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce Trustee Council; with the Chamber as they travelled to Brazil and South Africa to foster working relationships between countries; and as an officer of the Fort Lauderdale Chapter of The Links, Incorporated.
Penny currently serves as a Board Member of the Black Women's Agenda, Inc.
During her tenure, Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White spearheaded the project to build a home for a pastor in Africa when she learned he needed a place to live.
She led the construction of a commercial kitchen in the public library in Pembroke, Illinois, to ensure the community had a suitable gathering place.
She also coordinated the purchase of sewing machines for widowed women in India so they could make items to sell to support their families.
I join with members of the 4th Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the global community to thank 
Mrs. Penny Hartsfield White for her exceptional service to the church and our nation.
I wish her health and happiness in her weIl-deserved retirement.
