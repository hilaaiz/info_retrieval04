Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument located at Joint Base San Antonio--Lackland.
For the past ten years, the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument has served as a physical symbol of the loyal service and unconditional sacrifice that military working dogs have made alongside our men and women in uniform since WWII.
It is a privilege and an honor to celebrate the anniversary of the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument.
I hope this record serves as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed to both soldiers and K-9s by the American people.
On behalf of Texas' 21st Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary sacrifice of these individuals and animals.
