Mrs. Smith accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior at a young age and was baptized at Calvary Baptist Church.
Her love for the Lord would follow her throughout the entirety of her life.
A longtime devoted parishioner of Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, 
Mrs. Smith was involved in the Senior Choir, Hour of Power Choir, Educational Ministry, Newsletter Ministry, Social Butterflies, Senior Ministry, Pastoral Aid, Senior Citizens, and Sunday School.
After relocating to the Washington, D.C. area to live with her daughter Jennifer, 
Mrs. Smith became a member of the Reid Temple AME Church.
There, she participated in the Reid Temple Senior Services Bible study.
However, Morris Street Baptist always remained dear to her heart.
