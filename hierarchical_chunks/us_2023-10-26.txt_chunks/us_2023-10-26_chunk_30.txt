Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional service of 
Mrs. Penny Hartsfield White, 4th Episcopal District Supervisor of the Women's Missionary Society of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
The 4th Episcopal District is headquartered in the 7th Congressional District.
Penny is a native of Tallahassee, Florida, and the fifth of nine siblings, six girls and three boys.
Her father, the late Richard Allen Hartsfield, Sr., was the Assistant County Agent, and her mother, the late 
Mrs. Mamie S. Hartsfield, was an elementary educator and a staff member of Florida A. & M. University.
Penny, along with her family, grew up in Fountain Chapel A.M.E. Church in Tallahassee where she participated in the Youth Choir and the YPD'ers (Young People and Children's Division).
