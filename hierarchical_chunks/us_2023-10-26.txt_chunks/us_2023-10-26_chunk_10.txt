Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, on October 29, 2023, the Republic of Turkiye celebrates the 100th anniversary of its founding, and I congratulate the People of Turkiye and Turkish Americans on this 100th commemoration.
As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on U.S.-Turkiye Relations and Turkish Americans and the only Member of Congress of Turkish descent, I recognize the vast reforms that were undertaken by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and his vision for a reformed, modernized, and democratic Turkish Republic.
Today, Turkish Americans represent a vital thread of the American fabric, and with rich culture and history, they serve as the best ambassadors for strong relations between our two countries.
I take pride in the contributions and cultural richness brought by Turkish-Americans to the United States.
Our heritage is a tapestry woven into the diverse fabric of this nation, and we remain committed to fostering understanding and collaboration between Turkiye and the United States.
I congratulate the Turkish people and Turkish Americans on this centennial milestone and look forward to strengthening U.S. Turkiye relations.
