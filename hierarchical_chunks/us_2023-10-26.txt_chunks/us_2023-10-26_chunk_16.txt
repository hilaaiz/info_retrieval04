Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the recognition by the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives of the North Central Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce as the 2023 Chamber of the Year.
I am so proud that the North Central Chamber of Commerce is the first Chamber of Commerce in Massachusetts and New England to be recognized with this prestigious national honor.
The Chamber will be celebrating this success at their Congressional Luncheon on November 1, 2023.
Congresswoman Lori Trahan and I will jointly celebrate this monumental achievement.
The North Central Chamber demonstrates excellence in operations, member services, and community leadership.
The Chamber provides immeasurable support to budding and established entrepreneurs in the region, which helps our businesses thrive.
From new programs supporting Latinx small business, to revamping highly trafficked tourism destinations, the Chamber tirelessly works to improve the life of residents and guests to Central Massachusetts.
This recognition affirms what my constituents already know: the North Central Chamber of Commerce goes above and beyond for all.
The Chamber's commitment to continued improvement is what makes them so successful.
And, of course, 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the countless partners that help the Chamber excel at their work.
North Central Massachusetts's educational, economic, non-profit, cultural, and governmental organizations each have seamlessly integrated into the Chamber's purview.
The over 700 businesses and organizations the Chamber assists rightly trust the Chamber to help them serve the twenty-seven communities across North Central Massachusetts.
