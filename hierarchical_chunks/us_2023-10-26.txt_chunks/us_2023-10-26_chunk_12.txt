Mr. CARDENAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Fabian Aiomar as a Valley Luchador.
Fabian is a professional skateboarder and actor.
He stated his career in the `90s, and since then he has involved himself in community advocacy.
He most recently appeared in FLAMIN' HOT, an ode to the invention of Hot Cheetos--a beloved snack.
A former resident of Panorama City, Fabian balances acting with his love for skateboarding.
He supports the sport and kids interested in it by donating skateboards so they can get involved in and improve at skateboarding.
Over four years ago, Fabian became involved with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition as a formerly incarcerated individual.
The ARC empowers formerly and currently incarcerated people to thrive by providing a support network, comprehensive reentry services, and opportunities to advocate for policy changes that will help others caught in cycles of incarceration.
Today, Fabian uses his platform to share the mission of ARC to help others who are formerly incarcerated integrate back into society.
Fabian, like me, is the son of immigrants and came from a lineage of farmers.
He told one of our local newspapers, the San Fernando Sun, that he recently reconnected with his campesino roots and is expanding his advocacy efforts to include agricultural workers.
His advocacy, energy, and compassion are limitless, and we are proud to call him a Valley native.
I thank Fabian.
It is my honor to recognize him as a distinguished leader and luchador during Hispanic Heritage Month.
