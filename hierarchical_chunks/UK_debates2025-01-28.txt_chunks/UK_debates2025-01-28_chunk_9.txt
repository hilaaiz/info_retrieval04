I thank the Minister for his warm words and encouraging remarks.
He will know that in Scotland the “68 is too late” campaign by the Prison Officers Association enjoys cross-party and Scottish Government support, but the UK Government have refused to take action on this important issue.
The current retirement terms ignore the reality of the frontline role that prison officers perform in prisons on a daily basis across the UK.
It is a dangerous role, and no less so than that of firefighters or the police, who enjoy very different terms.
Although justice is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the pensions of Scottish prison  officers are controlled by the UK Government.
So will the Minister or the Secretary of State commit the Government to reviewing the current prison officer retirement age of 68, and will he meet me to hear this case in more detail?
