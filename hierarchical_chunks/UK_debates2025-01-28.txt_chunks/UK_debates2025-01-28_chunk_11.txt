I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
In this case the court’s decision was to impose a prison sentence, and neither Ministers nor officials can intervene in sentences passed down by our independent courts.
I understand the frustrations and can assure the House that we are working hard to find alternative approaches to ensure a secure resolution to this issue.
