I thank the Minister for his unambiguous statement.
I had a feeling that he was going to say something along those lines, because I read a similar unambiguous statement from the Home Office in this morning’s newspapers.
Therefore, I do not understand how the shadow Home Secretary has struggled to follow the Government’s position.
Does the Minister agree that the correct way to deal with extremism is to focus on what drives it?
As we heard in the House last week in relation to the  Southport attack, weaponry, including knives, has a devastating effect across the country.
What steps is the Home Office taking to restrict access to knives and weaponry for those with extreme views?
