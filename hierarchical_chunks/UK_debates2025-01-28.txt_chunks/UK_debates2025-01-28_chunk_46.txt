I thank the Minister for his answers and, in particular, welcome his commitment to supporting the police, which he has mentioned a few times.
I have great concerns that the revival of non-crime hate incidents will mean more work for our overstretched police forces, and that it will mean getting involved in a war on offensive words, rather than the war on drugs, the war on terrorism or the war on violence against women and children.
Will the revival of non-crime hate incidents come with a substantial increase in police funding, and if so, where will that come from?
