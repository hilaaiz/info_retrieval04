I pay tribute to women’s centres across the country such as that in north Wales for the excellent contribution that their work makes.
I agree that short custodial sentences can be problematic; they exacerbate women’s underlying needs without allowing time for rehabilitation, and they separate mothers from children and mean that women are more likely to reoffend.
That is why the Women’s Justice Board—I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for welcoming it—aims to increase the number of women supported in the community.
The board will also look at how we can better support mothers with young children.
Does the Minister accept that allowing biological men into women’s prisons increases the risk to female offenders?
Does he further accept that only biological women should be housed in women’s prisons?
The vast majority of transgender prisoners are in men’s prisons.
We have continued the policy of the previous Government, but all policies are always under review.
Across the UK we face the bizarre and worrying reality that common-sense protections for women are being dismissed.
For example, in Northern Ireland a motion to ensure that  biologically male prisoners who identify as women are held in male prisons has been opposed by many elected representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly,  and it is an issue that extends across the UK.
What assurances—we do want assurances—can the Minister give that women’s safety is taken seriously, and that they are guaranteed single-sex spaces in prisons, and other settings, free from biological males who identify as women?
Safe spaces for women are crucial and a No. 1 priority in everything we do.
