I thank the Secretary of State for that positive response, and I thank her and the Prime Minister for meeting me and my constituent Cheryl Korbel, the mother of Olivia Pratt-Korbel, the nine-year-old who was tragically murdered in 2022.
Cheryl is pleased that the Government have committed to implementing Olivia’s law without delay.
Can the Minister ensure that  Cheryl is involved in the development of this law, placing victims and their families at the heart of the justice system?
