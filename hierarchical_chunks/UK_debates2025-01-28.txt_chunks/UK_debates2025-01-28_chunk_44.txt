I thank the Security Minister for clarifying the timeline of when this report was commissioned.
We should remember that since it was commissioned, we have seen the brutal, sadistic murders in Southport and the riots that came after them.
Clearly, we are living in a time of rising and worrying extremism, which should concern Members on all sides of this House.
Does the Security Minister therefore agree that Members on all sides of this House should be working together to deal with extremism, rather than playing political games?
