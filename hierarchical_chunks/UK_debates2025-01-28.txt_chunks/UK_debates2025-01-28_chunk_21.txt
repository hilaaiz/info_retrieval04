I welcome the Government’s action to increase prison capacity, but I am worried about youth custody.
My local police force is particularly concerned that there is simply not enough space in the secure custodial estate.
Many vulnerable young people are at risk of being exploited by organised criminal gangs.
That is less to do with young offenders institutions and more to do with the lack of capacity in secure children’s homes; that capacity has fallen since 2010.
The number of Ministry of Justice contracted spaces is now around only 100 for the entire country, which is appalling.
How will the Minister work with Department for Education to increase capacity, and protect vulnerable young people and our residents?
