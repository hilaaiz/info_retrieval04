The Prime Minister has responded to the other questions that have been raised.
The appropriate information was made available at the appropriate time to either the Prime Minister or the Home Secretary.
It was right that the Government did not give any commentary that could have collapsed the trial.
On the specific charge relating to ricin, that decision required Law Officer approval, which was sought and immediately given.
I know that the Justice Secretary is aware of the tragic case of my constituent Sara Sharif.
Will she consider reforming family courts and ending the presumption in favour of parental contact despite the fact that there were safeguarding concerns?
That case of that little girl, Sara Sharif, is one of the most tragic of recent times, and I know that that view is shared right across the House.
That is why a safeguarding review is under way to look at all the agencies that were involved and should have been protecting that little girl from those who ended up killing her.
We are looking at the presumption: there is a review, and we will consider the findings of that review and publish our response in due course.
My constituent, who is a British citizen and the mother of two young children, faces the prospect of being forced to return to Poland to accompany those children under the Hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction, having fled escalating domestic abuse.
If she does, her inability to speak the language or work will leave her entirely dependent on her abuser, even though he is barred from contacting her.
Will the Minister work with me to ensure that domestic abuse is explicitly recognised as a valid defence against return orders of this type?
