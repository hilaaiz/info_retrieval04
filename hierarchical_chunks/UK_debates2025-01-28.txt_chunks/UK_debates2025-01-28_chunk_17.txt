Contempt of court laws are guardrails that ensure fair trials.
Does the Justice Secretary accept that, as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has said, by failing to provide basic information to the public that has been disclosed in previous cases—information that would not prejudice a trial—the authorities created a vacuum in which misinformation spread?
That misinformation could itself have been prejudicial to the trial.
Does she agree that in an age when most people consume their news through social media, saying nothing is not cost-free?
Will she commit to reviewing this issue now, rather than waiting for the Law Commission?
There will always be differing views among lawyers about what can and cannot be said.
It is right that the Government took their own position and that we did nothing that could risk collapsing the trial.
I agree with the shadow Secretary of State that the online world poses a significant challenge to our contempt laws.
That is why that is already being looked at.
As there is a piece of work already under way, I do not want to pre-empt where that could land.
The Law Commission has a good track record of considering major law changes.
Because of the inquiry and the fast-moving nature of these things, I will keep this area under close review myself.
If she will bring forward legislative proposals to enable courts to order the attendance of offenders at sentencing hearings.
By failing to attend their sentencing hearings, criminals add insult to injury and deny victims and their families a vital part of seeing justice done.
Iusb will be legislating to give judges the power to order attendance at sentencing hearings, and I will make it clear in the law that reasonable force can be used to make sure that happens.
The Prime Minister and I met Cheryl Korbel last week to discuss these proposals, and we will ensure that the families of other victims are involved before the Bill is put before the House.
