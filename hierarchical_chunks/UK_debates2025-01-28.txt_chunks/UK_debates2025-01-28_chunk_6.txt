The Secretary of State has announced two major reviews of the criminal justice system—the Leveson review and the Gauke review—and has said that, very impressively, they might report by the spring, which could be  1 March .
There is a difference between reporting and taking action, so could she set out exactly when she expects the results of those two reviews to have a direct impact on case numbers?
The Chair of the Justice Committee is tempting me to pre-empt what the reviews will find.
Those findings will, of course, dictate the pace at which change can then occur.
He will be aware of the acute pressure on our prisons system, despite the emergency levers that I have had to pull—that has only bought us some time, as I have said when regularly updating the House.
The sentencing review measures have to take account of our remaining problem with prison capacity.
Once the review has been published, we will move quickly to decide which recommendations to take forward.
On the courts package, it is likely that any measures will also require legislative reform.
Again, I will seek to move at pace on that, but that rather depends on the package of measures that Sir Brian Leveson ultimately recommends.
