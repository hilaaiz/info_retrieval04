There are more than 3,000 women prisoners in England and Wales—a number that the Ministry of Justice projects will rise to 4,200 by November 2027.
Like many, I welcome the newly established Women’s Justice Board, which will oversee efforts to tackle this issue and ensure a tailored approach to female offenders.
What measures are being implemented to provide support through community sentences and residential women’s centres?
We are awarding £7.2 million for the upcoming year to community organisations and local areas that are already supporting women in the community.
We are also employing options to increase the use of residential provision as an alternative to short custodial sentences.
That includes engaging with the judiciary to ensure that the option of a community order with a residential requirement is considered in appropriate cases.
