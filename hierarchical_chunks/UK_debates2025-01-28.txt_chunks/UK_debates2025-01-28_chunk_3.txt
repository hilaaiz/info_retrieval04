I want to speak in favour of new clauses 16 and 19.
New clause 16, entitled “Establishment of Water Restoration Fund”, establishes the principle that fines should go towards environmental improvement rather than to the Treasury.
I am somewhat curious as to why the Government would not support that, but perhaps the Minister can explain when she responds to the debate.
In November 2024, Wessex Water, which serves my constituency, was fined £500,000 for polluting two rivers, one in Wiltshire and one in Somerset.
That money should be used to improve the local environment; it should not be swallowed up by the Treasury.
New clause 19 states that when civil penalties are imposed, there should be an equivalent reduction in customer bills.
That is important, because otherwise the water company that has been fined will simply pass on that fine to the consumers; the new clause would ensure that there was no penalty for the customer.
I am curious, again, to know why the Government would oppose new clause 19—along with new clause 18—and I look forward to hearing the Minister’s explanation.
