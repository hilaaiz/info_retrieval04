The Secretary of State is well aware of the A12 widening scheme, and the concerns of my constituents about the route and design.
They are trying to engage with the Department and National Highways, but a one-person legal challenge is putting the entire project at risk, despite the Government’s financial investment.
Will the Secretary of State assure me that those communities will be consulted and engaged with despite the legal challenge, so that we can make progress?
I assure my right hon.
Friend that National Highways works closely with local communities when delivering major projects, and it will continue to do so on the A12 widening scheme.
My Department is committed to delivering the scheme, and granted consent for it on  12 January
but, as she said, it is subject to an application for judicial review.
I therefore cannot add anything further, but I will continue to work with her local residents.
If at any time she wants to raise issues with the scheme with me, I will be delighted to meet her.
