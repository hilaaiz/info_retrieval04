I thank the Minister for buses,  the hon.
Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) , for sharing with me the list of actions he managed to elicit from  north-east bus operators following my debate on real-time bus information.
However, no dates were given.
This afternoon, our fantastic candidate for North East Mayor, Kim McGuinness, is launching her vision for transport in the north-east.
Can the Minister confirm that those actions will be fulfilled to enable her to deliver on her commitment to real-time bus information as soon as possible?
