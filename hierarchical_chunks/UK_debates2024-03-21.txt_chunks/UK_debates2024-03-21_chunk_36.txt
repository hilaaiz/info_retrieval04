I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
General practices are now delivering 20% more appointments than they were pre-pandemic, and more than 33 million appointments were carried out in January of this year alone.
We have also brought in, as she rightly points out, Pharmacy First.
I think that this has been well received in our communities, but of course there is always more we can do to publicise these new services, which are available to everyone in our community.
The next Health and Social Care questions are not until after Easter, so I will ensure that the Department has heard what she has said.
