The leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, who has a nice side hustle as  the hon.
Member for Mansfield (Ben Bradley) , once said: “The full delivery of HS2’s Eastern Leg is what the East Midlands needs to support and create highly skilled jobs, link communities to opportunities and decarbonise our transport network.”
As he failed to persuade the Prime Minister, who cancelled that vital investment in our region’s rail services, can the Minister tell me how we will now deliver the transformative change to our connectivity, sustainability, job creation, productivity and social mobility that HS2 promised?
Filling a few potholes will not cut it.
I certainly look forward to the day when my hon.
Friend  the Member for Mansfield (Ben Bradley)  is also an excellent East Midlands Mayor, and we are devolving more powers to the east midlands to help him with that task.
The hon.
Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood)  references HS2 moneys, from which more than a £1 billion will be allocated to the Mayor of the East Midlands to spend on the transport projects that he and, indeed, the hon.
Lady may want.
That allows us to devolve more projects to the local area, and we have been absolutely clear that all the moneys that have been saved as a result of the HS2 cancellation will be reinvested primarily in the north and the midlands.
