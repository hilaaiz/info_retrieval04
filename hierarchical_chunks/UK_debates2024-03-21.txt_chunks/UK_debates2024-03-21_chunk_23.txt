I thank my hon.
Friend.
He has been a champion not only for Cleethorpes’ direct rail service, but for the east coast main line timetable change that was announced in the Budget.
We are now going through the stages with those who use the lines to ensure we do not have any timetabling issues like those that arose in May 2018.
I hope we will come to a position on this in some weeks and that I can give him more detail, but I very much hope to see those direct services to Cleethorpes.
This timetable change was designed to bring in great improvements such as the one he has championed.
