As the House may be aware, the Chairman of the Backbench Business Committee is not able to be here because his daughter-in-law is seriously ill in hospital, and it is right that he is by her side at this time.
I am sure the whole House will wish her a speedy recovery.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.]
On behalf of the Committee, let me say that our debates in the Chamber are now full until  9 May , provided we are allocated the time by the Leader of the House.
Equally, we are full in Westminster Hall until  2 May —obviously, we will have control of that time.
So all those who wish to get applications in before the summer recess should do so quickly, as the Committee has been working overtime to process these applications.
The shocking rise in antisemitism and anti-Muslim hatred has been well publicised, but what has not been is the anti-Hindu hatred occurring on our campuses and across our country.
I have the honour of chairing the all-party group on British Hindus and it has recently published a report on that hatred, on which action is clearly required all round.
So will my right hon.
Friend allow time in the Chamber for a debate on hatred of British Hindus and enable us to celebrate the contribution they make to this country?
Given that it is Holi on Tuesday, will she also join me in wishing all Hindus “Holi hai!”?
First, may I, on behalf of all of us in this place, send our good wishes to  the hon.
Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)  and his family at this time?
I thank my hon.
Friend for stepping in for him and assisting Members with an advert for future business from the Backbench Business Committee.
On the all-party group’s report on anti-Hindu hatred, I will make sure that the relevant Secretary of State has heard what my hon.
Friend has said today.
I know that he has been campaigning on this matter for some time and that he will have listened to what the Minister for Equalities said about it at Women and Equalities questions yesterday.
