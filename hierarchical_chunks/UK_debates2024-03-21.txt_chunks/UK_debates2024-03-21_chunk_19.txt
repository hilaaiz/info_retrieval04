I am pleased to be able to tell the hon.
Lady
that within a week of her debate in Westminster Hall, my hon.
Friend the Minister for buses made sure that those meetings took place, so the actions that are necessary are under way.
I am sure that my hon.
Friend will be able to update her on the specific timeline in due course.
The Rail Minister is well aware that Network Rail continues to let down disabled residents and visitors and families at Chalkwell station by repeatedly failing to install the much-needed disabled lift.
This is the seventh time I have raised this issue in this place.
Two years ago, I was promised that the lift would be installed this year.
I have now been told it will not even be started until next year.
This is a disgrace.
What can the Minister do to accelerate this project and address this poor performance?
There was a retendering at Chalkwell, and Network Rail found that the existing structures would not be suitable to deliver the project as it stood.
The design work is going on right now and building will happen next year.
My hon.
Friend is right that the delay is not acceptable.
I will meet her at Chalkwell station and bring the Network Rail team along so that we can talk her through the project and its challenges and, if we can, show how we will speed it up.
