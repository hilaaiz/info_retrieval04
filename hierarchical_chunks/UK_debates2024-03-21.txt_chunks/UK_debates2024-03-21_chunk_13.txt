The Minister will have seen reports this week that 3,000 jobs are at risk at Alstom rail factory in Derby.
The Government told us that they were doing everything in their power to prevent those job losses, but they appear to be failing.
It gets worse: this morning, I received correspondence from Hitachi Rail, warning that despite years of representation to Ministers, no solution has been found that will keep its order books full and safeguard the future of 700 staff at its factory in Newton Aycliffe.
The Secretary of State has it in his power to vary contracts and commission the necessary orders.
When will he do that and protect those jobs?
