On planning, the Father of the House raises a worrying concern.
I am sure the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities will be concerned to hear that people are not shouldering the responsibilities to which they were elected.
I will ensure he has heard what my hon.
Friend has said.
This week, I was astonished and appalled to find that Moat housing association, in my constituency, is increasing rent and maintenance service charges in affordable accommodation to an exorbitant amount.
Something needs to be done about that, because the increase to rent is over 9% and the increase to the maintenance service charge is a whopping 50%.
Those rises are due to start in April, so there is a level of urgency.
Will the Leader of the House ensure that the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities looks into this case, so that residents do not fall into in-work poverty and they are not priced out of the area?
The housing association must deal with them efficiently and fairly, and keep  to the formula initially given to residents to calculate  such increases.
I am sorry to hear about that situation in the hon.
Lady’s constituency and will certainly ensure that the Secretary of State hears what she has said today.
I hope also that the organisation she refers to has heard her words and can come to some accommodation with its residents.
May we have a debate on improving access to GP appointments?
In the north-central London area, the number of appointments in GP practices per month is now 680,000—50,000 up on last year—which is a huge improvement, but a debate would give us an opportunity to discuss how Pharmacy First can enable people to get treatment from their pharmacist, freeing up more GP appointments for patients with more complex conditions.
