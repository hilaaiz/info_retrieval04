I wish to raise two brief things.
First, the Leader of the House will soon see the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman’s report on women’s state pension age and its findings on “injustice” and associated issues.
The report is about the WASPI women—Women Against State Pension Inequality.
I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend  the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)  who campaigned with me on these issues and saw various Secretaries of State.
Will the Leader of the House say how the Government intend the House to respond to the reference to Parliament considering the recommended remedy?
It is not a massive remedy, but it is an important one.
Secondly, the Leader of the House may have heard me question the Prime Minister yesterday about planning and building over prime agricultural fields.
Yesterday afternoon, Arun District Council planning committee considered an application.
All the members of the committee looked as though they were going to turn it down, until the planning officer said the costs of an appeal by the developer were more than the Council could afford.
All the members of the committee, except for the Conservatives and one Liberal, then voted to leave it to the council planning officers to make the decision.
Can we have a debate on intimidation on costs by developers that make district and borough councils feel they have to approve something or allow something to go through that should be opposed?
Will the Leader of the House join me in recommending the council calls in the proposal and, if it does not, the Secretary of State does?
