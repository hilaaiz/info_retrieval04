I thank my hon.
Friend, who is an absolute champion of that project, and he makes his point clear.
Upgrades made in the Gatwick area are already delivering significant improvements to the Brighton main line, and the industry continually reviews how best to respond to changes in demand.
I understand that my hon.
Friend has been in discussions with the operator on the options for increasing capacity on busy weekend services between Carshalton and London Victoria, and  that Govia Thameslink Railway will shortly respond to him directly.
I will continue to work with him on the enhancement project that he champions.
