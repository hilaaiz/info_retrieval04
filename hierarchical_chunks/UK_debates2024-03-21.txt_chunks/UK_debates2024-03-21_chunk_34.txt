I thank the Father of the House for his questions.
I know the Department for Work and Pensions will want to consider today’s announcement about WASPI women.
This is a concern among Members across the House, and I am sure the Minister will want to update the House at the earliest opportunity.
They will want time to consider what has been said today, but I hope that an update will be given to colleagues before recess.
