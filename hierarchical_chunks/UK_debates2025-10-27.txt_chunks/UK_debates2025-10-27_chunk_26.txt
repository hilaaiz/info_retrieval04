I welcome the Secretary of State to his office and thank the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Andrew Western) , for a recent visit to the DWP debt and fraud centre in my constituency.
There are 95 jobs at the centre doing tremendous work across the UK, proving that civil service job dispersal does work.
Is this not a template for other Departments and an example to the SNP Government in Scotland, who have dispersed no jobs, no power and no funds from Edinburgh?
