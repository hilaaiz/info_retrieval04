I welcome the Secretary of State to his new position.
In my seat of Newbury, over 5,200 women have been unfairly affected by changes to the state pension age.
Those women were wronged through no fault of their own, and they deserve justice.
With a High Court hearing due in December, this could be a crucial moment for the Government—a moment to finally do the right thing.
Will the Secretary of State now listen to the ombudsman’s recommendations and commit to providing compensation to women of the Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign?
