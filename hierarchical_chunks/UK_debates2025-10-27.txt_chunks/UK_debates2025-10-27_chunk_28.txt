I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
In general, lots of life could do with less “computer says no”, so on that basis we will agree.
On the specifics of the question she raises about pension credit, the nature of the system is obviously that it provides a guaranteed level of income; it is not setting out an entitlement like universal credit, so there does have to be a limit somewhere, and I am afraid that that does mean that some people will always be on one side of it.
What we do not want to see in a system is too many things in that winner-takes-all perspective—I take the point she raises.
