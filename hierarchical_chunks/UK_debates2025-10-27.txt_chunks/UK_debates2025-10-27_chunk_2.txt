The Secretary of State was asked— What assessment he has made of the potential implications for his Department’s policies of the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies entitled, “How do people already out of employment fare when the state pension age rises”, published on 17 September 2025.
The clocks went back at the weekend, and you nearly put them forward again, Mr Speaker.
I am pleased to be here answering my first set of questions as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
I look forward to my exchanges with the shadow Secretary of State,  the hon.
Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Helen Whately) , and the other spokespeople in the House.
The state pension age will rise to 67 from 2028.
We continue to support later-life planning by helping people review their health, finances and skills—for example, by having specific work coaches for over-50s in our jobcentres.
Consideration of the future of the state pension age is already under way, as asked for under the Pensions Act 2014.
