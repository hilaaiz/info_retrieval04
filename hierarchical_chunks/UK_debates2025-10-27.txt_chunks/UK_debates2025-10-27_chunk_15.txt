Every Member in this Chamber shares a commitment to lifting people out of poverty, especially children; we just have different views on how to go about it.
Children in workless households are nearly four times more likely to live in poverty than those in households where adults work.
We know that work pays, yet we on the Conservative Benches find ourselves surrounded by parties that are just itching to scrap the two-child benefit cap, resorting to yet more sticking plasters, like universal breakfast clubs, to reduce uncomfortable figures without putting in the hard work to tackle their causes.
Does the Minister share my concern that lifting the two-child benefit cap will increase worklessness, and can he guarantee that taxes will not go up in next month’s Budget for adults who work hard and make careful decisions about family size in order to pay for the £3.6 billion it will cost to lift that cap?
I am stunned to hear that the fight that the Opposition Front Benchers are choosing to pick on this occasion is opposing universal free breakfast clubs, when we know that well-fed children have hungry minds.

For those chirping from a sedentary position, that is exactly what the shadow Minister.
What I find even more staggering are the lectures from an Opposition who left almost 3 million people in this country economically inactive and around 1 million young people out of work.
They dragged 900,000 children into poverty, when the last Labour Government lifted 600,000 out.
It is the last Labour Government who we will be taking lessons from, not the last Tory one.
