Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this past weekend, I was grateful to participate with the U.S. Delegation for the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Copenhagen, Denmark, led by Delegation Chairman Mike Turner and Assembly former President Gerry Connolly.
On Friday, the focus was on war criminal Putin's murderous invasion for Ukraine and incredibly Finland is now a NATO member with an 830mile border with Russia, as Sweden gives up 200 years of neutrality to stop dictators.
The West is united as never before in history to protect democracies.
On Saturday, with the sadistic invasion of Israel, there was extraordinary unanimity supporting Israel's territorial integrity.
Clearly the axis of dictatorships of Putin, the regime in Tehran, and the Chinese Communist Party, had collaborated again with the invasion from Gaza.
Sadly, the war we did not choose, Dictatorship with Rule of Gun against Democracies with Rule of Law, is proceeding and must be faced with Peace Through Strength.
On Sunday, Resolutions were presented from the five standing committees with amendments to be considered with debate.
Parliamentarian Michal Szczerba of Poland presented Towards Reconstruction of Ukraine emphasizing payment by seized Russia assets, while Parliamentarian Njall Fridbertsson of Iceland explained Enhancement of Protection of allied critical maritime infrastructure.
