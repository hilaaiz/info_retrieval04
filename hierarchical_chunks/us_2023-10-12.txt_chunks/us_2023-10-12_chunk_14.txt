Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions.
Melvinia King as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
As the Executive Director of Fighting Back Partnership, Melvinia helps lead the organization's drive to alleviate and eliminate poverty and substance abuse amongst youth in Solano County.
Since joining the organization in 2018, she has spearheaded an agenda rooted in Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s vision of ``Creating the Beloved Community,'' addressing the complex issues of poverty and racism while simultaneously empowering families and nurturing the potential of our youth.
Beyond this important work, Melvinia serves on several local committees, including the Solano County Workforce Development Board, Black Infant Healthcare Advisory Board, and Solano County Home Visiting Community Advisory Board.
She is known by her colleagues as not only a strong advocate for change, but also an active contributor to it.
Her work has created a lasting legacy that will touch the lives of countless individuals throughout our district.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Dr. Melvinia King for her positive contributions to our community.
