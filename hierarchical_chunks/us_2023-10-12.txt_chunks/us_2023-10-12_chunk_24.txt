Honor Roll.
Outside of scouting, he is an athlete on his school's Varsity Track and Field team and a volunteer at his church, all while maintaining a job at a local farm.
Along with his Eagle Scout award, Noah will be presented with the Bronze and Gold palms for his remarkable leadership and his willingness to accept responsibility.
I am incredibly proud of Noah for all his accomplishments in the Scouts and I know he has a bright future ahead of him.
God Bless Noah and God Bless the United States.
