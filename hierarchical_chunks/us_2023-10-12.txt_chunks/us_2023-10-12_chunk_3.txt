Representative, I am committed to speaking up for the rights of Hispanics and confronting the issues that affect them.
From lowering the uninsured healthcare rates and fighting to make higher education more affordable, to championing an increase in the minimum wage and addressing the economic challenges facing working women and families, my colleagues and I will continue working for the Latino community's top priorities.
Devoted to family, faith, country, and hard work, Hispanic Americans bring unique and bountiful perspectives and experiences to our national community and character.
The vibrant Hispanic influence can be seen in all aspects of American life and culture, and especially in Houston, Harris County and Texas, and from distinctive cuisine to colorful festivals, and from the rhythms and melodies of traditional music to the contagious beat of today's most popular songs.
The Hispanic community has persevered in the face of discrimination and hardships.
While significant barriers still stand in our way, I will continue fighting with a strong commitment to achieve comprehensive immigration reform and to support an inclusive and unified country.
