Mr. KEATING.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in honor of the life of Danielle ``Dani'' Duggan.
Born on May 7, 1966, Dani was raised in Middleborough, Massachusetts, where she found a passion for the arts at a young age.
After graduating as an honors student from Middleborough High School in 1984, Dani went on to study at St. Michael's College, where she received an honors Bachelor of Arts degree in fine arts and theatre and was the recipient achievement in fine arts.
Dani then moved to Dublin, Ireland to work for the famous Abbey Theatre.
This is where she also met her husband, Gerry Clements.
She lived in Ireland for eight years receiving an honors master's degree in modern drama from University College Dublin and would later form the Salem Willows Theatre Company.
Dani returned to the U.S. with her husband, Gerry, moving to Pembroke, Massachusetts, and over the next 24 years, she taught drama at Middleborough High School.
During her time at MHS, she became chair construction of the new Middleborough High School Performing Arts Center and Blackbox Theatre.
At MHS, Dani directed numerous school productions and the speech & theater workshop, as well as several productions with the Plymouth Community Theatre.
Sadly, Dani left us too soon on October 15, 2022, after a two year battle with cancer.
Whether during her time at Middleborough High School or her work with the Abbey Theatre, Dani's passion for sharing her love for the arts serves as an example to all.
Throughout her years at Middleborough High School, Dani laid the groundwork for the school district to hold an annual event celebrating students' work in the fine arts.
On May 20, 2023, Middleborough held its inaugural Dani Duggan Fine Arts Festival to honor Dani's legacy.
