Gacek implemented numerous reforms and initiatives that helped modernize the department, reduce crime and develop the community.
Some community policing strategy.
updating the department's technology and information systems, expanding the department's analytical and intelligence capabilities.
and developing several community engagement initiatives, among many others.
Perhaps one of his greatest initiatives was the creation of the Concord Police Foundation, which supports Concord Police Department employees and their families and helps make Concord a safer community to live and work.
Gacek established this program in 2021 in honor of Concord Officer Jason Shuping who was tragically killed in the line of duty on December 16, 2020.
I have known Chief Gacek for many years and witnessed firsthand the tremendous work he has done for the people.
I am proud to call him my friend and know I speak for the whole community when I wish him well in this next chapter of his life.
