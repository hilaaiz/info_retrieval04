Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to recognize and congratulate Mayor Joseph Thallemer, who is completing his tenure of dedicated service to Warsaw.
Indiana at the end of this year.
Currently serving in his third term as Mayor.
Joe Thallemer has long advocated solutions that make Warsaw a better place to live, work, and raise a family, and that maintain and build on Warsaw's status as the Medical Device and Orthopedic Capital of the World.
Prior to becoming Mayor.
Joe Thallemer also served on the City Council and the Warsaw Plan Commission, meaning his record of faithfully serving Warsaw runs nearly three decades deep.
Beyond City Hall, many Hoosiers know Joe through his Optometry practice that he established in Warsaw in 1980.
Outside of his medical practice and elected office, Joe has also given back to the community he and his wife Jill call home by serving on the local YMCA board as well as in church and school activities with Jill and their four children.
As he prepares to step down as Mayor, spend more time with his family, and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to congratulate Joe Thallemer on a distinguished career and a job well done.
The Warsaw community is unquestionably better off thanks to this good man with a servant's heart.
I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our gratitude to Mayor Thallemer for his service and in wishing him and his wonderful family nothing but the very best going forward.
