Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Margaret Kolk as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Maggie is a passionate public servant who demonstrates a tireless dedication to serving her community.
For the past nine years, Maggie has served as Chair of the Benicia Human Services Board, directing funding to local nonprofits that serve low-income Benicia residents and improving funding for city agencies.
She is also the Secretary of Sustainable Solano, an environmental organization championing renewable energy and sustainable food production services.
Along with her public service, Maggie has demonstrated equal dedication to serving her community through her volunteer work and political activism.
For the past three years, Maggie has served as manager of the Benicia Community Garden helping to maintain an important resource that brings local sustainable food to Benicia residents.
In 2016.
Maggie co-founded Progressive Democrats of Benicia, now the city's largest political organization, and is currently spearheading a local ballot initiative to raise revenues to fix Benicia roads.
She is known to never back down from the toughest challenges and to always offer her complete commitment to any undertaking.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Margaret Kolk for her positive contributions to our community.
