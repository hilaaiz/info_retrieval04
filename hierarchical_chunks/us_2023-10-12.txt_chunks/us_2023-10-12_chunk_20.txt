Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Marinda Elaine Keith as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Marinda has been a community leader and owner of Marinda's Family Daycare for decades.
After operating her daycare center for 35 years.
she has served roughly 400 children and families.
She is passionate about educating every child in her care and works to ensure that every child receives food, education.
and the support they need.
Her love and commitment to the children she cares for is evident in the educational and career pursuits her students have accomplished.
She is also an active member of the church, where she volunteers and gives back to those in need.
Through her church she has organized the annual backpack drive for underprivileged children and numerous food giveaways.
During the COVID-19 Pandemic she donated, prepared, and delivered baskets of food and supplies to seniors.
In addition, she volunteers to cook and serve meals for the unhoused in the parks throughout Richmond.
Marinda's compassion, selflessness, and dedication serve as an inspiration to all who meet her.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Marinda Elaine Keith for her positive contributions to our community.
