I thank my hon.
Friend for the question.
The Committee discussed the commission’s work to support the implementation of voter ID at its public evidence session in March.
A transcript of that session is available on the Committee’s website.
The commission has also published an initial analysis of voter ID in the May local elections in England, saying that further work is required to ensure voter ID does not become a barrier to voting and that elections remain accessible to everyone.
The commission is undertaking further research and will make recommendations for improvement in its full election report to be published in September, and it will continue to run public awareness activities and provide guidance to electoral administrators ahead of future elections where voter ID is required.
