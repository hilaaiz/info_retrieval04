My question is about the regulation of charities, following on from the question asked by  the hon.
and learned Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry) .
Does my right hon.
Friend the Minister read Private Eye?
If he does, he will have seen the saga of the Actors’ Benevolent Fund, where it appears that the people who did right have been put out and the people who did wrong, over and over again, have been supported by the Charity Commission.
Could he say to the Charity Commission that people in Parliament are watching this with some surprise?
Of course the Charity Commission is an independent body, but I have regular meetings with it.
I am not a regular reader of Private Eye, but I will make sure that I seek out that article ahead of my next meeting with the Charity Commission.
What assessment she has made of the potential effect of the UK’s departure from the EU on the UK arts and culture sector.
The UK arts and culture sector has many strong existing positive relationships in Europe, and we are taking a number of steps to deepen ties.
The Government have developed bilateral agreements with European countries, and the British Council offers further sector-specific support, including the recently announced spotlight on culture between the UK and France.
The UK Trade and Business Commission found that the Scottish arts and film industry has lost €27 million in EU funding as a consequence of Brexit, so will the Minister’s Government make up for that shortfall and the calamity that Brexit has imposed on the sector?
While the UK decided not to participate in Creative Europe, nevertheless the UK shared prosperity fund, which is a UK-wide funding initiative, has match funded what was originally available from the EU and also gives local authorities, and indeed nations, control over how that money is spent.
Whether she has had discussions with the BBC board on its complaints procedures.
