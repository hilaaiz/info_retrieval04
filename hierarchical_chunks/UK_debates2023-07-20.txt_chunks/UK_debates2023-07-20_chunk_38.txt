I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing the House’s attention to a very serious situation, as he so often does.
He is the second highest attender of business questions, and he always raises important matters.
We are deeply concerned about this situation.
I will make sure that the Foreign Secretary is fully aware of it, and we urge the Pakistani authorities to investigate any allegations fully, prosecute those responsible, and provide justice for the victims and their families.
