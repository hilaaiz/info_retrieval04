The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to highlight the importance of the quality of outdoor waters, and a lot of work is done to educate children in water safety.
I have not had the chance to speak to anybody in Northern Ireland yet, but I understand that I may well be going there during the recess, so I will take the opportunity to do just that.
What recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the regulation of charities.
The Charity Commission performs an important and effective function as the independent registrar and regulator of charities in England and Wales.
The commission’s annual report and accounts for 2022-23 provide a detailed analysis of the its performance and effectiveness.
Charity law and regulation is of course devolved in both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
My question is about Arts Council England, which is of course a registered charity.
A senior employee there recently won a tribunal claim for harassment on account of her gender-critical beliefs.
In the course of the hearing, it became evident that there was considerable homophobic bias among some staff at Arts Council England, who did not wish the Arts Council to give grants to projects initiated by LGB groups unless those groups accepted gender identity ideology.
There was evidence that an LGB charity had been described by Arts Council employees as a “cancer” and “neo-Nazi”.
What is the Minister doing to tackle the climate of prejudice and bias that has been exposed at Arts Council England, a charity that dispenses over £950 million of public money per annum?
I hope the hon.
and learned Lady knows that I take all forms of discrimination extremely seriously, and there should be no place for that.
She raises an individual case.
The Arts Council does not come under my portfolio, but I will happily speak to my ministerial colleagues about that and ensure that we write to her with an answer.
