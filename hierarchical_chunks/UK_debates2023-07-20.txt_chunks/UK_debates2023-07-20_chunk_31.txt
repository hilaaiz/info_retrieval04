I thank the Leader of the House for the forthcoming business, but I am disappointed that two pieces of important House business seem to be missing.
First, there was no mention of when MPs will get to debate and vote on the Commission’s proposals to introduce a new process for dealing with MPs accused of violent or sexual offences.
The Leader of the House was not able to answer me when I asked about the matter last week, so I would be grateful if she could do so today.
She and I have worked hard on this together, as well as with you, Mr Speaker, the commissioners, staff and the trade unions.
We cannot lose momentum.
I know the Leader of the House agrees with me that the proposed new mechanism is needed to reduce the risk of harm to all those who work on and visit the parliamentary estate, so will she give us some clarity, show all the people listening that we are making progress and tell us when the House will get the chance to vote on it?
