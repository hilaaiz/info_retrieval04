You may remember, Mr Speaker, that  21 April  is my birthday—a birthday that I shared with Her late Majesty the Queen.
On  21 April  this year, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities raising the serious concerns of constituents who continue to be affected by ongoing fire safety concerns following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.
I have not had the birthday present of a reply since  21 April .
I had sought the Secretary of State’s advice on how leaseholders should proceed when a developer had signed up to the Government’s much-publicised charter but then refused to pay for the cost of any initial surveys to ascertain what works need to be done.
Many hundreds of leaseholders in Gateshead are stuck in limbo, unable to sell or pay for remedial works and unable to pay for surveys.
Will the Leader of the House please ask the Secretary of State to respond to my request on behalf of my constituents?
