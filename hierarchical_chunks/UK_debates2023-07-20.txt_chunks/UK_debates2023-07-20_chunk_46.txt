I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this serious matter, and I shall ensure that the Secretary of State has heard his request.
I am sure that the House will want to focus on the matter, particularly those Members whose constituents are directly affected.
The right hon.
Gentleman obviously knows how to apply for a debate if he wants to, but I will make sure that the Department hears what he has said today.
