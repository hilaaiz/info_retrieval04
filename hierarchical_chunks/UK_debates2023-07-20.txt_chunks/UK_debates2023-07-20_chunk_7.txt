I thank  the hon.
Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous)  for the question and the Minister for his response.
Growing up in Ballywalter in the ’60s—also the age I am right now—there were no swimming pools, and we always used the sea.
It is important that water has the quality and cleanliness to allow people to swim, so has the Minister spoken to any of the councils or authorities in Northern Ireland to ensure that our waters, including Strangford lough and the sea off Ballywalter, are of a standard that enables people to swim without any fear?
