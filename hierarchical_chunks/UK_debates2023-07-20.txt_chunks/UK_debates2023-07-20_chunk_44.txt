I thank my right hon.
Friend for her focus on matters that I am sure are of great concern to her constituents.
She will know that successive Conservative Administrations have felt it important to devolve powers down to a local level, to give local residents more control over shaping their local plan and the design guides that accompany it.
She raises an important point and I know that she will be campaigning on behalf of her constituents to ensure that the right decision is taken.
