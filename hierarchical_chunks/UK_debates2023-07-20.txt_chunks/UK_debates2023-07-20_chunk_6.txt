The Secretary of State was asked— Whether she plans to support the uptake of outdoor swimming.
Outdoor swimming represents one of the many ways to stay active.
Through the together fund, Sport England has provided over £80,000 for outdoor swimming projects.
Swimming and water safety forms a mandatory part of the primary PE national curriculum.
The Beccles lido does great work in promoting outdoor swimming in the Waveney area, but it and other lidos have been particularly hard hit by high energy costs and long-term fixed-price contracts, often arranged by rogue energy brokers.
The swimming pool fund is extremely welcome, but I urge my right hon.
Friend to work with lidos to put in place a long-term plan for their future.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to highlight the importance of swimming pools and lidos.
We announced the swimming pool fund to help those that have been particularly struggling with high energy costs.
Sport England also plays a vital role in working with local authorities on managing sustainable facilities, and we will shortly publish our new sports strategy, which will set continued commitments in this area.
Let us go to the wild swimmer of Strangford lough, Jim Shannon.
[Laughter.]
Wild swimming conjures up all sorts of things in my mind—probably more emphasis on the wild.
