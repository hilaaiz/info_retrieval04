I am also concerned that the Leader of the House has still not announced when the House will consider the Standards Committee’s report on the conduct of  the right hon.
Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher) , the findings of which are shocking.
Colleagues and staff have been asking when the House will get the opportunity to approve the report and endorse the sanction.
He has brought this House into disrepute and frankly should no longer be a Member of it.
Will the Leader of the House tell us whether she knows if the Member will be resigning or if he has appealed the Committee’s sanction?
Either way, she could table the motion as a remaining order, even without a date attached.
When will she bring forward a motion so that the House can vote and move on?
I wish all Members, Members’ staff, House staff and everyone who works on the parliamentary estate a very happy summer recess.
As we come to the end of term and head back to work in our own communities, it is worth reflecting on what the Government have achieved—or not—this year.
People I have been speaking to up and down the country are simply fed up.
Nothing works in this country any more, and the Tories have simply given up doing anything about it.
I saw on the Order Paper today that the Leader of the House is due to announce the date of the next King’s Speech in a written ministerial statement—perhaps I could press her to give us an early sighting of that now—but the Government have nowhere near finished with the last set of new laws they said they were going to pass.
