I thank the hon.
Member for his excellent question.
The Committee has not discussed those matters with the commission as yet.
The Electoral Commission does not have a role in the regulation of political or news programmes.
Ofcom is responsible for regulating broadcasters and providing guidance on impartiality, but if the Member wants to take up this issue further with the commission, it would be more than happy to meet him.
