I thank the Leader of the House for the business statement and, in particular, for announcing the Backbench Business for the week beginning  Monday 4 September .
If we are awarded the time, we shall have a very interesting topic to debate on  Thursday 14 September , namely the relationship between football and early-onset dementia.
The application for that debate is well subscribed.
I also thank the Leader of the House for writing to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport on my behalf following last week’s exchange.
That was an important topic as well, and it was referred to earlier this morning during questions to the Secretary of State.
