The Secretary of State and I meet with the BBC’s leadership regularly to discuss a range of issues.
The BBC’s processes for handling audience complaints about its editorial content are an area of focus of the mid-term review and, as required by the terms of reference, the DCMS has been consulting the BBC on the review’s findings.
We are seeking to conclude the review at pace and to report on its findings by 2024.
I look forward to the conclusions of the review.
The Minister will know my views: the complaints process within the BBC is utterly inadequate, and I think  he agrees with me on that.
There is no genuine independence in that process and therefore there is a lack of confidence in how that process is working.
I hope he will factor those views into making sure that the outcome of the review takes on board the need to have a genuinely independent complaints mechanism, so that the public can have confidence in the broadcasts.
We are aware that research from Ofcom bears out what the hon.
Gentleman has said, in that there is considerable dissatisfaction with the existing complaints procedure.
That is something about which the BBC is also aware, and we are keen to address it in the mid-term review.
So far, we are making good progress in reaching agreement with the BBC on how it can be strengthened in the future.
