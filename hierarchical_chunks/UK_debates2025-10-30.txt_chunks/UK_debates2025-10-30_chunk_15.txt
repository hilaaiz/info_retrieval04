I associate myself with the remarks about British Beauty Week.
In addition to beauty businesses, one of the key ingredients for growth on our high streets is having a post office in the mix.
As Post Office Minister, he has inherited a network of 11,500 post offices across the country and a consultation on the size of that network.
Can he echo what his predecessor said at the Dispatch Box, and commit to supporting our high streets by maintaining the scale of the post office network throughout this Parliament?
