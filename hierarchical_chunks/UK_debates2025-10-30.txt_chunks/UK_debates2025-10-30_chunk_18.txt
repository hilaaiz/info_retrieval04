I thank my hon.
Friend for his long-standing advocacy in this area.
We want to work constructively with unions, employers and stakeholders to build on the Employment Rights Bill.
Our first priority for a fair pay agreement is adult social care, a large and complex sector with over 19,000 providers and 1.5 million dedicated workers.
As such, our priority is ensuring that this process works effectively, which is why I am delighted that the Government have announced a £500 million investment in the first ever fair pay agreement in the social care sector.
We will use what we learn to consider where fair pay agreements can offer similar benefits across other sectors.
