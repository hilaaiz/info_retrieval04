I thank the shadow Minister for her welcome.
She is absolutely right about the anchoring effect of post offices on high streets all over the country.
We know not just that, as we mentioned in the Green Paper, if people go to their post office they are likely to spend money in local shops, but that post offices are essential—as I found out during a visit to one the day before yesterday—in giving small businesses somewhere to take their takings.
The Green Paper set out the options for maintenance of the post office network, and it is certainly our intention to maintain it.
