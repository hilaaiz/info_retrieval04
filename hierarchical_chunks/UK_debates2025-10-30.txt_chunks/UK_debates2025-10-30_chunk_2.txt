The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support the hospitality sector in Bicester and Woodstock constituency.
As this is my first time at the Dispatch Box, if I may I would like to thank my predecessor, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Ellesmere Port and Bromborough (Justin Madders) .
It is an honour to build on his work, particularly on employment rights and championing fairness and dignity at work.
Hospitality businesses, including those in the constituency of  the hon.
Member for Bicester and Woodstock (Calum Miller) , are vital to the UK economy, driving growth, creating jobs, and strengthening our communities.
The Government are delivering targeted support under the small and medium-sized enterprises strategy to boost productivity, cut red tape and revitalise our high streets.
Our £1.5 million hospitality scheme aims to help businesses boost productivity and adapt to local needs, while the licensing taskforce seeks to address unnecessary barriers that hospitality businesses face.
Furthermore, we plan to permanently reduce business rates for eligible retail, hospitality and leisure properties.
rose— Order.
Just to help Members, this question is purely about Bicester and Woodstock.
I wish all the questions were just about Bicester and Woodstock.
