I thank you for granting this urgent question, Mr Speaker, as you have done with a number of others, but this important issue should not have to come to the Floor of the House by way of an urgent question.
The Government must be more proactive.
The Minister for Africa gave a commitment to the International Development Committee that they would be more proactive during this Parliament, and I hope that that commitment will be honoured.
Will the Minister set out more fully what discussions there have been with the UAE?
Not only are there concerns about the use of weapons, but it is clear that the UAE has significant influence over the RSF and is a key player.
It is stated by the Government that we have influence with the UAE, so are we using that influence to ensure that it uses its influence with the RSF?
