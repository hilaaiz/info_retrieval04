I also welcome the ministerial Front Benchers to their new roles.
The Liberal Democrats have long championed an industrial strategy.
In government, we created the Green Investment Bank, the British Business Bank and the regional growth fund, and we opposed the Conservative Government’s damaging decision to scrap the industrial plan.
We welcome the industrial strategy’s return, especially its focus on investing in skills.
However, businesses know that the apprenticeship levy does not work: funding is hard to access and millions go unspent.
We welcomed the pledge in June to replace it with a more flexible growth and skills levy, but firms and young people are still awaiting details.
Will the Minister provide details of what training this will fund, so that businesses and young people can plan ahead with certainty?
