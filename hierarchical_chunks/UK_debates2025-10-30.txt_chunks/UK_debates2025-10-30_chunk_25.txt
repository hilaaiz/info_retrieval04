I thank the Minister for that answer, for his work thus far, and for his extensive correspondence with me and the industry during this crisis.
Local suppliers, such as the brilliant BCW in Burnley, have told me that the finance just is not getting to suppliers and that some of them are going to the wall or cutting jobs.
JLR is not doing enough to avoid widespread supply chain job losses.
This is affecting the entire British car industry through contagion effects, and suppliers are telling me that they are not out of the woods yet.
What more can he do to get more support for our suppliers, such as BCW?
