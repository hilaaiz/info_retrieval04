I note the right hon.
Gentleman’s comments and will ensure that my colleague in the other place is aware of them.
We are actively engaged on this matter.
Our teams, our officials and our special representative are working on this issue every day, so I do not want him to think that we do not take it serious—we absolutely do, particularly in light of the  new allegations that have been made in recent days.
We are the third biggest donor and the penholder, and we have been showing leadership on the issue over the past year and before that, including under the Government in which he served, as he knows.
The right hon.
Gentleman asks about the Quad and the UAE.
We welcome the efforts of the US-led Quad in seeking a resolution to the conflict.
He will know that the Quad issued a statement on  12 September , which was a significant development, but we remain in close contact with all the relevant stakeholders and parties in pushing for a humanitarian pause, a wider ceasefire and a Sudanese-led political transition.
We will continue to support Quad efforts in that regard, including through our role at the UN Security Council.
