On the industrial strategy, what steps have been taken to fund high-quality workforce apprenticeships in sectors such as technology, manufacturing and hospitality, to provide young people with opportunities for employment and lives in those industries?
Will the Minister undertake to discuss these matters with the relevant Minister at the Northern Ireland Assembly?
As I said to  the hon.
Member for South Antrim (Robin Swann)  a moment ago, we have already met with the Northern Ireland Executive on these issues.
Skills are an essential part of the industrial strategy because we see, again and again, industries around the country that are desperate to grow, and have the orders, but are unable to create the high-paying jobs that we need.
That is an absolute priority for us as we implement the industrial strategy.
