I thank my hon.
Friend for his continued advocacy for the Cornish critical minerals industry—in fact, I thank all our fantastic Cornish MPs.
He knows that the critical minerals strategy is eagerly anticipated in Cornwall and across the UK.
The minerals in Cornwall are crucial to the future of our critical minerals industry and the security of the UK.
We have the largest lithium deposits in Europe; we need to take advantage of that.
We will look at all options to ensure that we get the financing to exploit those minerals.
