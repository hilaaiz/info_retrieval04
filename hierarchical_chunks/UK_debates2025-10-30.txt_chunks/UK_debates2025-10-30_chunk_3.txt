I welcome the Minister to her place.
Becky, who runs the Red Lion in Eynsham, and Donna, who runs the Oxfordshire Yeoman in Freeland, tell me that they are working upwards of 80 hours a week just to keep their pubs open.
Despite loyal customers and rising turnover, they are struggling to meet soaring bills from employment costs, food, energy, business rates and a tied tenancy, which means that prices are over £100 more per barrel.
In small villages across my constituency, pubs are the  lifeblood and fabric of the community.
Will the Minister meet Becky, Donna and me to discuss what more the Government can do to support the vital village pub?
