I welcome the Secretary of State to his place and invite him to Benbecula Distillery in my place.
It is a dramatic lighthouse distillery, and a great addition to the landscape.
It recently secured £1.5 million from the British Business Bank’s investment fund.
Benbecula’s distillery is one of a chain of small distilleries across the Western Isles and other islands.
I had a wee dram in Raasay, where that distillery has revived the island as much as its product revived me.
What is the Secretary of State doing to make sure that this new wave of small Scottish distilleries will be part of the next round of trade deals?
