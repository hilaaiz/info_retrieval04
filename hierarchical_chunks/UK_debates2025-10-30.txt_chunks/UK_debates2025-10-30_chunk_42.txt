I thank the Minister for his statement—it is good to have somebody at the Dispatch Box who both understands and cares about this issue.
We have spent no shortage of time in this Chamber talking about the conflicts in the middle east and in Ukraine, but I think all of us are guilty of not talking enough about Sudan.
The International Criminal Court is investigating some reports of atrocities in Sudan.
Does the Minister feel that that investigation should extend to those who knowingly export weapons into the conflict?
