I thank the hon.
Lady for her kind words on my new appointment.
I will not get ahead of announcements on that, but given the importance of skills to the industrial strategy, we are not waiting for those announcements.
We have had TechFirst, a £187 million investment in secondary school pupils, undergraduates, PhD students, entrepreneurs and businesses, to help them get ahead on that.
We have the engineering package of over £100 million, and the defence package of £182 million.
We are making those investments now to ensure that the pipeline is there for those industries, which are the priority within the industrial strategy.
