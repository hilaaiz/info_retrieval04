What steps his Department is taking to improve the UK's trading relationships with other countries.
This Government wasted no time when it came to trade deals—not just talking about them, but delivering them.
We have already secured trade deals with the biggest economy in the world, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, and our biggest trading market.
The Government’s clear principle is to deliver for British businesses and the British people.
That is why in the first month of my new role I travelled to three continents to further strengthen UK trade and investment.
