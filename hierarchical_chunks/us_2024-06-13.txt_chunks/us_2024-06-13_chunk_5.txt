Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and congratulate Rocky's Pasties on their 100-year anniversary.
I am extremely grateful to be able to celebrate this incredible milestone with the Rocky's Pasties family and our community.
A small takeout food business specializing in hand made Cornish style pastries, Rocky's has been family owned and operated for four generations.
For the past 100 years, they have shown their dedication to delivering meals the oldfashioned way while carrying a piece of their ancestors with them.
They have shown their commitment to this community by preparing daily meals from scratch, using only the freshest ingredients.
The Rocky's Pasties friendly environment is a testament to their 100-year history.
Rocky's Pasties has been described as an ``unexpected gem''
but if you are a part of this community you know it is no surprise.
As we reflect on the past 100 years at Rocky's they have exceeded the expectations and I know they will continue to do so for the next 100 years to come.
I am honored to have such an amazing community in the 7th congressional district, and I look forward to what is to come.
