this year.
To this union, three children were born:
Cheryl Barnes, Gregory Barnes, and Kimberly McCants.
Dr. Barnes began his career as a mathematics teacher at Hinds Agricultural High School in 1962.
This would begin his 51-year professional and family life in Utica.
During his tenure, Dr. Barnes served as an assistant basketball coach, college math instructor, Hinds AHS Principal, and Academic Dean and Acting President of Utica Junior College.
When he retired, he was the Vice President for the Utica and Vicksburg-Warren Campuses and Administrative and Student Services.
Dr. Barnes loved meeting people, talking to people, and helping them as well.
He valued knowing that he made a difference in the lives of others and served as a positive role model for his family, friends, and colleagues.
His interests in building humanity, specifically, were time consuming yet fulfilling.
He worked tirelessly to build the cultural character in the surrounding communities.
He leaves a legacy of dedicated and committed leadership, and his work never went unnoticed.
