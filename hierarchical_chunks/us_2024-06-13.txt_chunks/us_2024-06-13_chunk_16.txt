Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, on May 8, 2024 we lost my father, Lou Soto.
He was an amazing dad, loving husband, and joyful grandfather.
He was a Navy veteran, computer programmer, as well as a football, baseball and basketball fan.
He had a calm, loving, and amiable demeaner, one that inspired peace in others.
He had many friends, loved to dance, grill, host BBQs and listen to music.
His story embodied the American Dream.
Born in Manati, Puerto Rico, he traveled to the mainland at nine years old.
He then served in the Navy as a young man during the Vietnam era.
He and my mother, Jean, bought their first home thanks to a VA Loan and attended college thanks to the GI Bill, where he took night classes to finish his degree while working in the day and raising his young family.
He worked in computers and information technology for many years.
He now leaves behind his wife Jean, son Lou, grandchildren LJ, Mateo, and Sabrina, and myself as well as many other family members.
The imprint he has left on our lives, we will carry with us forever.
He was a Catholic and man of faith.
Our family will miss him dearly, knowing he now joins the angels, and is finally at peace.
