Mr. PHILLIPS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Constituent Advocate, David Chernack, for his work on behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
At the end of April, David departed my office for a new opportunity to serve as the Immigration Constituent Advocate in the Office.
Angie Craig, and I could not be more proud or grateful for his service.
Hailing from California, David came to Minnesota for college at the University.
While in college, David got hooked on Minnesota politics and spent time interning for 
Senator Amy Klobuchar and Governor Tim Walz before graduating and joining our office.
The constituents of Minnesota's Third District were fortunate to be served by David who always went the extra mile to help a constituent in need.
David's ability to treat each individual as if they were his top priority has impressed our entire office.
In under a year, he held two job titles- Staff Assistant and Hospitality Director and most recently, Constituent Advocate- and brought intellectual rigor, tireless dedication, and trademark quirkiness to each role.
Our fondest memories include his drives to random parking lots to shepherd lost constituents to our office, lunches consisting of three variations of simple carbs with no protein or produce in sight, and expressions of undying gratitude when given even the smallest treat.
The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to have his dedication and leadership, and he will be dearly missed.
However, I'm extraordinarily happy that he will continue to do this work and serve the Nation and the people of Minnesota's Second Congressional District.
I wish David all the best in his future endeavors and thank him for a year of faithful service to this Nation-- and many more to come.
