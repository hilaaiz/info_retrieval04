Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the momentous occasion of Evapco's 45th anniversary and the significant completion of the Sierra building expansion in 2024.
Evapco is a global industry-leading manufacturing company with global resources and solutions for worldwide heat transfer applications, it is employee owned, and was founded in the United Slates.
Evapco launched its second U.S. manufacturing company in Madera, California, in 1979, and now employs more than 234 individuals.
Evapco's expansion in Madera County has not only created more jobs in the congressional district that I represent but is also a testament to my constituents' dedication and hard work.
It also has bolstered Evapco's production capabilities and will help it meet growing demand for advanced cooling solutions in our community, the Central Valley of California, and beyond.
My constituents enjoy working for Evapco as it follows the vision of ``one global team, united to be universally recognized as the superior provider of a full spectrum of heat transfer solutions.''
And its commitment to teamwork has enabled its employees--my constituents--to excel.
It is a team their employees and customers alike can count on for a lifetime.
