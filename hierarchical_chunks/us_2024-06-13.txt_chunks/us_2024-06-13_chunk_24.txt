Ms. STRICKLAND.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major General Bret Daugherty, who will retire at the end of this month from the Washington National Guard, after 44 years of service protecting the great state of Washington and our nation.
Major General Daugherty began his military service in 1980, serving nine years on Active Duty in the Army.
After transitioning to the Army National Guard, he rose to the rank of Adjutant General and became the longest-serving National Guard leader in the United States.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Major General Daugherty navigated unprecedented emergencies across the state of Washington with diligence.
Whether he was facilitating access to vaccinations and masks, responding to some of our state's worst natural disasters, or ensuring the security of our national elections, he completed these duties with unfaltering resiliency.
Major General Daugherty's accomplishments also laid the groundwork for an improved collaborative environment that Washingtonians benefit from today.
When I had the honor of meeting with him in 2021, I was particularly inspired by his dedication to public service and commitment to supporting the members of Washington's National Guard.
His mindfulness of the future of our nation, and care for the personnel who serve it, are clear in both his words and actions.
I commend Major General Daugherty on his decades of service to Washingtonians and the Guard.
Congratulations on his retirement and may he enjoy this next chapter.
