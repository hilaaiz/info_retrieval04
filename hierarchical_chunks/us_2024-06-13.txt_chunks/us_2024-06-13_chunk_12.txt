Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of a tenacious and self-motivated leader, the late Dr. George Everett Barnes.
Dr. Barnes showed what could be done through hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve success.
Dr. George Everett Barnes was born in Collins, MS, on August 10, 1941.
He was the youngest of nine siblings born to Elmer and Lora Barnes.
During the course of his life, his parents stressed the importance of God, family, education, and hard work.
He would find his calling as a devoted husband, father, educator, and servant.
These values are evidenced by the fact that all nine siblings attended and graduated from Jackson State University.
They went on to establish the Barnes Family Endowed Scholarship Fund to aid students majoring in education.
Dr. Barnes graduated from Carver Central High School in Collins and went on to advance his education at Jackson State University (BS, Mathematics), Louisiana State University (MA, Mathematics), Mississippi State University (EdS, Community College Education), and the University of Southern Mississippi (PhD, Educational Administration).
He furthered his studies at the University of Illinois and Auburn University.
While attending Jackson State University, he met his wife, Doris.
They married in June 1963 and celebrated their 61st anniversary
