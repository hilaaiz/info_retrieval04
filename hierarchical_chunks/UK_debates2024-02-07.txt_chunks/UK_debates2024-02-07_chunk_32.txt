The Secretary of State will be aware that the NHS dentistry crisis has been 14 years in the making.
She will also be aware that it is impossible for anybody in Knowsley today to sign up with an NHS dentist.

The advice and guidance to dentists will be going out today, while the new patient premium that I have told the House about will come in from March—it is weeks away.
