The golden hellos, the toothbrushing for pre-schoolers—as long as the workforce can handle it—and the mobile vans are good, but even a day longer of a contract focused on units of dental activity is a problem.
Can the Secretary of State say how she plans to entice professionals into returning to NHS dentistry?
So many have left, and that is key.
