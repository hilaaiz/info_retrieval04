The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 7 February.
I know the thoughts of the House and the country are with the King and his family.
We wish His Majesty a speedy recovery and look forward to him resuming his public-facing duties in due course.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in the House, and I shall have further such meetings later today.
I, too, send my best wishes to the King.
Last week, the Foreign Secretary said that, with allies, we will look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, so that the Palestinian people “can see that there is going to be irreversible progress to a two-state solution.”
Afterwards, it was briefed that these words had not been signed off by No. 10.
Does the Prime Minister agree with his Foreign Secretary?
Our long-standing position has been that we will recognise a Palestinian state at a time that is most conducive to the peace process.
The most important thing is that we are committed to that two-state solution and are working with our allies to bring it about.
People in Northampton South are desperately short of NHS dental provision—indeed, in Duston there are now none at all.
So today’s dentistry recovery plan announcement is hugely welcome, but can the Prime Minister guarantee to my residents that there will be improvements within months, not years?
We are publishing the dentistry recovery plan today, and my right hon.
Friend the Health Secretary will be making a statement shortly.
Over 1 million more people saw an NHS dentist last year than the year before, but we know that there is more to do.
That is why the recovery plan will make sure that NHS dental care is faster, simpler and fairer for patients and staff.
