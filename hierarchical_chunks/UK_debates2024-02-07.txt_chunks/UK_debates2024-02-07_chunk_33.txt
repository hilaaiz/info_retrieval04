I thank my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for an excellent statement and an excellent plan.
It is exactly what patients in Suffolk have been waiting to hear—the rural payment, the bonus there and the mobile service.
I am conscious that many dentists have chosen not to have more patients, and they might blame the contract—this, that or the other.
That is why I welcome her plan about potentially tying in graduates to the NHS.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford)  has already referred to the General Dental Council, which, in my view, has not taken full advantage of the regulations that came into force last March.
Will the Secretary of State also look at the NHS’s own rules that further restrict the rapid supply of dentists into the NHS for our constituents?
