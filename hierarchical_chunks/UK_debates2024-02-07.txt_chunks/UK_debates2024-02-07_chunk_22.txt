I thank my right hon.
Friend and colleagues from all parts of the House for their campaigning over many years on this issue.
As I said, it is right not only that we extend our sympathies to those affected, but that we carefully consider the recommendations from the Patient Safety Commissioner’s report.
I can assure my right hon.
Friend that we will do that with all due haste, and I know that the Health Secretary will keep the House updated.
