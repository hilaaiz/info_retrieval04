I thank my right hon.
Friend for all the work she did on dentistry in the Department.
I am conscious that many people have contributed to this plan; I am grateful to her and others.
Again, I hear the observations on the General Dental Council, and will ensure that the GDC hears them as well.
That is a fair challenge to the NHS.
Colleagues will see that the plan is co-signed by NHS England, which shares our ambition to deliver those 2.5 million more appointments and set up the future of NHS dentistry for our country.
