I thank my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for this brilliant statement, and thank all the team for their huge amount of hard work.
Today is dentist day—yesterday was dentist day for me, as I had an appointment with the Minister and an appointment with a real dentist from South Derbyshire.
This news is absolutely superb.
Will the Secretary of State get dentists to move to South Derbyshire, and ensure more free NHS dentistry there?
