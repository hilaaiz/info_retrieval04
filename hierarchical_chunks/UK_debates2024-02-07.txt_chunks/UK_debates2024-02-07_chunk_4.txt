We must support the courage of those witnesses in giving that harrowing testimony about Hamas’s mass-scale perpetration of sexual violence on  7 October .
We cannot be silent about these atrocities.
We must ensure that the world does not forget that sexual violence shatters lives and devastates communities.
The UK stands in solidarity with survivors and continues to call for the release of the remaining hostages.
I appreciate that the Government have been trying to tackle violence against women and girls, specifically with the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.
Unfortunately, amendments that would have gone further to protect migrant women, who too often still feel unable to come forward and report abuse for fear of their data being shared and their being detained or deported, were not accepted.
Will the Minister commit to reassessing the merits of preventing survivors’ personal data from being shared with the Home Office for immigration purposes?
That is a matter for the Home Office.
I support all the work that Home Office Ministers are doing to tackle domestic abuse, and I know there would have been good reasons for not accepting those amendments to the Act.
We will continue to do all we can.
I have just heard from the Minister for safeguarding—the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Newbury (Laura Farris) —that concessions are being made.
We will continue to work with her and others to tackle domestic violence in all its forms.
