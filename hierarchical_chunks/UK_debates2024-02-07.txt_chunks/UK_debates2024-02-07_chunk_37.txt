Thanks to the work of my hon.
Friend and others, Tees Valley is a powerhouse of growth industries, as exemplified by the Chancellor in his Budget and autumn statements recently.
I will take away my hon.
Friend’s words of advice about his university.
On the point about encouraging ICBs to take part in this work, as this plan is a joint document with NHS England, the expectation will be on ICBs to deliver the plan, because they exist to look after our constituents.
This plan is one of the ways we will be able to secure that help.
In Bedford and Kempston, like many areas in the country, we have a dental crisis.
I have raised the matter of dentistry previously, including in a Westminster Hall debate.
There can be no question but that under this Conservative Government there is a dentistry crisis and the people of this country have been failed.
Why does the Health Secretary refuse to admit that 14 years of neglect and underspending have led us to this?
Says the script.
I assume the hon.
Gentleman will welcome the 2.5 million more appointments that this dental recovery plan will deliver for all our country.
