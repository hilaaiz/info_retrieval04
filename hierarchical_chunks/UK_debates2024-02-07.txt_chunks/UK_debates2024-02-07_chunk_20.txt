I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting this exciting initiative, and commend Beccy and Lindsey for their campaigning.
He will know that our £150 million community ownership fund is there specifically to help to safeguard small but much-loved local assets.
Our cultural development fund, which he mentions, is there to support further cultural projects as well.
I will ensure that he gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss the plans further, and wish him and his constituents all the best with this redevelopment project.
