The Minister for Women and Equalities was asked— What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle violence against women and girls.
What recent steps she has taken with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle violence against women and girls.
Tackling violence against women and girls is one of the Government’s key priorities.
We are making progress in delivering various cross-Government workstreams, including the tackling violence against women and girls strategy and the rape review action plan.
Three quarters of police-recorded domestic abuse cases are closed due to evidential difficulties or because the victim does not support further action.
Does the Minister agree that Labour’s proposal to put rape and domestic abuse specialists in every police force in England and Wales will give women the confidence to come forward and secure more convictions?
We will have 2,000 rape specialists across all police forces by April.
In the autumn statement, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would provide £2 million of additional funding for a flexible fund that trials one-off payments to victims of domestic abuse.
That fund was made available to victims on  31 January .
Last week, I co-hosted an event here in Parliament with a delegation from Israel who have first-hand experience of the aftermath of  7 October .
They described innocent women, dead or alive, who had been raped by terrorists.
Hamas desecrated their bodies and even booby-trapped them.
Those acts of sexual violence must be condemned by every institution and individual who cares about women’s rights.
