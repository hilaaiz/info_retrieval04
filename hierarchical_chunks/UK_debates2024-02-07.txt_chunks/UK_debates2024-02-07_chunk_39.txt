I have no doubt that with my hon.
Friend’s characteristic joy and as an irresistible force of nature, she herself will be an advert for dentists to come to work in her constituency.
A constituent recently told me that when she tried to register members of her family with an NHS dentist, she was told that there was an eight-year wait.
We know that workforce is a really big issue.
On that basis, will the Secretary of State meet me and a cross-party group of Members of Parliament to talk about how we  could develop a dental school at the site of the excellent Hull York Medical School to grow our own dentists for the future?
The right hon.
Lady will know that part of the focus of the long-term workforce plan is to train people where they are most needed.
I will happily arrange for her to meet the relevant Minister.
On registration, the current system is not like a GP practice where, once a family is registered, they can only go to that GP.
The whole reason that we have been encouraging dentists to update their details on the NHS website is so that people can move around to visit different dentists to get the treatment they need.
Today’s plan will help turbocharge those efforts.
