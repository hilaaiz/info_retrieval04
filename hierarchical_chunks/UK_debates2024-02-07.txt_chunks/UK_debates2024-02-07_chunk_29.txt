I thank my hon.
Friend and recognise the enormous expertise he brings to the Chamber on this matter.
He knows—he has genuinely talked to me about this on many occasions—the important role that the General Dental Council plays to ensure that we get international dentists registered as quickly as possible.
I very much look forward to discussing that with the GDC so that we can get more international dentists on to our register and working in our practices.
