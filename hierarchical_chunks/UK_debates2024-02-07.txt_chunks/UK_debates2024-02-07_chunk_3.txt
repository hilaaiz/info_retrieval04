I thank my hon.
Friend and her co-chair for organising what was for attendees an extremely difficult meeting.
We heard the harrowing accounts of witnesses and family members of young girls who were kidnapped on  7 October , and we heard from the first responders who found the bodies of women and girls of all ages with obvious signs of sexual violence.
Female  soldiers were found naked with nails and sharp objects shoved into their vaginas.
One told of a mother he found with her hands tied behind her back, naked and bleeding from the waist down, shot in the back of the head, and with a live grenade left in her hand for whoever found her body.
