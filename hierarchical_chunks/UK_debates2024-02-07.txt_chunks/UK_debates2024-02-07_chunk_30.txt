I welcome much in the plan, which mirrors many of my ideas over the years, and indeed much in Labour’s plan.
However, on access, the Government claim that the recovery plan will deliver care for up to 2.5 million people, but Government data shows that 12 million people in England have unmet dentistry needs, which leaves about 9.5 million people without an NHS dentist.
That includes my constituent Beverley Kitson, who has osteoporosis and takes alendronic acid as treatment.
The drug has damaged her teeth, and she now requires a check-up every three months after four of her teeth have decayed to such an extent that they need to be extracted.
Beverley has been with the same dental practice for 50 years, but she has just been told that it is going fully private, leaving her without an NHS dentist.
Will the Secretary of State guarantee Beverley that she will be able to access an NHS dentist under these plans?
