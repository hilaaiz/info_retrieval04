The Secretary of State was asked— What recent discussions she has had with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care on increasing the use of AI in the NHS.
The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology closely engages with all Departments on the adoption of AI, including the Department of Health and Social Care, and we are committed to ensuring that the adoption of AI is done in an ethical, safe and responsible way.
That includes using AI to improve public service outcomes and productivity in the NHS.
Ahead of the AI Safety Summit last year, we announced a new AI in healthcare fund, backed by £100 million, to target areas where the rapid deployment of AI could create transformational breakthroughs.
