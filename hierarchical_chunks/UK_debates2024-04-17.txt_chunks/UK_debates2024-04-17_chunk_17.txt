I thank my hon.
Friend for his tireless campaigning on behalf of the residents of Carlton.
Our long-term plan for towns means that 75 towns across the country including Carlton will benefit from £20 million each to invest in their local area.
Crucially, as he has said, it will be in the hands of local people to decide on their priorities for the place where they live.
Whether it is regenerating local high streets, investing in parks and green spaces or tackling antisocial behaviour, we are levelling up across the country and he deserves enormous praise for his role in securing that investment.
