I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the potential of this innovative technology for patient care.
I am delighted that more generally Cornwall is benefiting from our new hospital programme, providing a new women and children’s hospital at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, in the centre of Cornwall, which he and I discussed when I was last with him.
