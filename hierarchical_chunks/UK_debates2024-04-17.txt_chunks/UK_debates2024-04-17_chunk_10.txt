I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting that case.
I regret what has happened to the GLA candidate, which highlights some of the risks in relation to technology.
That is why we have high data protection standards, but there is a range of ways in which we need to tackle this problem.
We have the national cyber strategy, which is working to ensure that we can deal with the cyber-threats we face.
We are taking measures to protect our data infrastructure and trying to do things to stop fraud in the national “Stop!
Think Fraud” strategy, as well as new laws on security of devices, such as connected devices.
We need to do a whole range of things, but we need to keep making sure that we are vigilant about the risks.
