I thank my hon.
Friend for his role in championing the rail industry in the UK.
As he rightly said, the Department for Transport and the Secretary of State have been actively engaged with companies to ensure that we have a robust supply chain.
As my hon.
Friend knows, we are investing record amounts in rail, particularly in the north, and we are pleased to see that that is being delivered.
