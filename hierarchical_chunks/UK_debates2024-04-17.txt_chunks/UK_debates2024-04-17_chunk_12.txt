We are told that this is the general election year.
In other countries, we already see those who want to manipulate democracy using AI to scrape together personal details, including someone’s face and voice, allowing them to falsify candidates’ views.
What  the hon.
Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)  raised about the GLA candidate is pertinent.
As we quickly approach the second half of the year—when we are told the Prime Minister will finally call the election—will the Government commit to ensuring that personal details are protected for candidates, voters and, above all, democracy as a matter of urgency?
We absolutely share those concerns.
That is why we have a defending democracy taskforce working across every Department to look at the threats  to our democracy.
We face a substantial threat, and it is one that we must all be mindful of in how we conduct ourselves as candidates.
AI, fakes and the protection of data is one element of that, but I assure the House that we are taking a whole range of measures to ensure that the protection of the coming general election is robust.
