I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting how Bracknell Forest Council has worked positively with the Department for Education through the safety valve programme.
As part of that agreement, the council will receive £16 million in extra funding over the next few years to provide the vital education that his constituents deserve.
I am told that the Department is still reviewing capital bids for the safety valve programme, but it will be in touch with local authorities directly as soon as possible.
