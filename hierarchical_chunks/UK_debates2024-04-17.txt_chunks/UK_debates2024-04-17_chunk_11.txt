When my 91-year-old mother died, I took on her landline for purely sentimental reasons.
For months and months after that, I kept getting scam calls offering all sorts of dodgy products.
Does the Minister agree that the elderly almost more than anyone else must have their personal data protected?
I am sorry to hear of that experience, which I am afraid is shared by constituents across the country.
That is why we have taken new measures in the data Bill to try to deal with scam calls by trying to ensure that we can see where those numbers are and take action by blocking them on bulk.
I appreciate what the hon.
Member said; it is something that we must tackle.
