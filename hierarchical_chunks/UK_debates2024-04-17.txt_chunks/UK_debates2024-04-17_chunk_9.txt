I thank my hon.
Friend for that answer.
It is clearly vital that the enormous amounts of personal data collected by Departments and private companies are safeguarded.
I have received a number of complaints about people’s personal data being abused by companies, and indeed about public sector data being sold to companies who then use it.
Just this weekend, our Greater London Authority candidate had his phone hacked and his social media destroyed.
That is equally important as a demonstration of what can happen to democracy when data is abused.
Will my hon.
Friend take further action to safeguard people’s personal data?
