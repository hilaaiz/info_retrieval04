I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that helpful point.
Where we can co-ordinate information and data across Government to identify people who need more support, we will do so.
My Department is currently working with the Department for Work and Pensions to release as much of that information as possible, and we hope that we will be able to make progress in due course.
