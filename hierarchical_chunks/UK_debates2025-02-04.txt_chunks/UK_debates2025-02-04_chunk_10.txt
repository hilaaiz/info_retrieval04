I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and congratulate him on his advocacy.
Members across the House have a decision to make here.
As the Under-Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Peckham (Miatta Fahnbulleh) , said earlier, we are exposed to fossil fuels and we see what is happening in global markets with prices going up.
If we want to change that and have clean home-grown power that we can control, we have  to build the infrastructure we need.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket (Peter Prinsley)  on supporting it and on supporting our planning reforms, and I urge Members across this House to do the same.
