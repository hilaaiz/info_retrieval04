On this World Cancer Day, will my hon.
Friend the public health Minister tell me what efforts he is making to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer, such as a bloated tummy, lack of appetite or feeling full, tummy pain or needing to pee more often, in order to increase lifesaving early diagnosis?
I am very grateful to my hon.
Friend for all the work that she has done on ovarian cancer since becoming an MP.
She knows—the rest of the House might not—that I lost my mum to ovarian cancer.
I was 19 when my mum died and she was only 50—my age today.
She had a late diagnosis.
They basically opened her up to perform a hysterectomy and the cancer had spread all the way through her body.
They sewed her back up and she died at the end of a hospital ward two days later in pain and agony.
Having awareness of those symptoms is so important.
My mum was fobbed off by her GP, because she worked in a shop and lifted boxes.
She had a bad back and was bloated and so on.
The GP said it was down to her work, rather than erring on the side of caution and getting her checked out.
We must ensure that women today are heard by GPs and, more importantly, that we err on the side of caution and get people on to treatment.
