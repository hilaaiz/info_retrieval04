Next week, the Select Committee will be hearing from some of the victims of the botched solid wall insulation installed under the previous Government’s energy company obligation and GB insulation scheme.
That includes people whose homes may well have to be rebuilt, as the cost of repairing the damage may be higher.
Will the Minister tell us how such a thing could have happened, and will she confirm that she is happy to come back to the Select Committee to add to the comments that she has already made about rebuilding consumer confidence after the disaster under the previous Government?
What is clear to us as a new Government is that the system of regulating home upgrades was too ad hoc and too fragmented.
Accountability was not clear enough and consumers were not at the heart of the system.
We are committed to turning around that system.
Put simply, when someone has a home upgrade, they need to have the confidence that it will work for them and that, when things go wrong, redress will be put in place.
I am committed to update the Select Committee on the progress that we are making on getting a grip of what we have inherited and on making sure that such a thing never happens again for consumers.
