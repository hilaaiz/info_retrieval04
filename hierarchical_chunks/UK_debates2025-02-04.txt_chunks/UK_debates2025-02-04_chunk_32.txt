I thank the Minister with responsibility for energy consumers for agreeing to convene a roundtable tomorrow on the subject of radio teleswitching switch-off at the end of June.
The problem will be particularly acute in communities like mine; we are well behind the rest of the country when it comes to smart meter roll-out.
When she comes to the meeting, will she have a target for getting us the number of smart meters that we need?
