I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for that question, and also for the written parliamentary questions about prostate cancer that he and a number of other Members have tabled.
According to the current guidance, screening for prostate cancer is not recommended in the UK because of the inaccuracy of the current best test for prostate-specific antigen.
Indeed, it could actually harm men, as some might be diagnosed with a cancer that would not have caused them problems during their lives.
However, I am looking at this carefully, and I know that further information has gone to the National Institute for Health and Care Research so that it can, perhaps, reach a different conclusion.
Obviously, as technology and other mechanisms advance, this may well be an area where we can make inroads, but I am happy to work with the hon.
Gentleman to ensure that every opportunity is met.
