With permission, I wish to make a statement on the national cancer plan.
Today is World Cancer Day.
Almost everyone in our country has been affected by cancer, either themselves or through a friend or relative.
Having lost both my parents to cancer, I am so grateful to the Prime Minister for giving me this job.
He has given me the chance of a lifetime to do my parents proud by creating the kind of compassionate and humane healthcare that all our constituents deserve.
