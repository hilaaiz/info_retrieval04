I thank the hon.
Member for pointing out the inheritance and the legacy.
That is material, because it is the backdrop to everything we are trying to do.
We are clear that we need to drive forward with momentum and pace.
That is why we are already upgrading up to 300,000 homes this year alone.
It is also why we are working with local authorities and social housing providers to deliver warm homes that are cheaper to run for communities across the country.
We are absolutely moving at pace with our warm homes plan.
We will be setting out that plan, and at its heart is an ambition to ramp up the number of upgrades massively, so that more families across the country can benefit from what we know works: warm homes and lower bills.
