I thank the Minister for all her work in this area.
I know from conversations with my constituents that energy costs are a large part of the cost of living crisis for them.
Following the Conservative party’s failure to protect our energy system and invest in home-grown clean power, can the Minister give us an update on what steps are being taken to tackle my constituents’ high energy bills?
