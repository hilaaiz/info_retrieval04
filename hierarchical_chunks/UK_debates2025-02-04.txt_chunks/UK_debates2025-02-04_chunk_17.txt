Is it not a fact that, regardless of how much money is put into a warm homes scheme, social tariffs or whatever, consumers can never be insulated against the massive cost of the mad net zero policy that will require thousands of new turbines, acres of solar farms and miles of new transmission lines, all at a cost to the consumer?
How on earth does the Minister believe that we will deal with the issue of fuel poverty in this country with that cost?
I will say to the right hon.
Gentleman that at the moment, families are not insulated from fossil fuel markets.
We have seen one of the worst energy crises, which has had a huge impact on the cost of living.
The status quo is not tenable.
We already have record-high energy prices and the only way that we are going to bear down on that is through clean power.
The alternative is to do nothing—but we have seen the impact of doing nothing over the last 14 years and consumers and constituents across the country are the ones being impacted.
We will absolutely drive forward with clean power by 2030 because that is our route to providing an energy system that delivers energy security and that can deliver financial security.
