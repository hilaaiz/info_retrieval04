My hon.
Friend asks a really important question, which Members from right across this House will agree with.
The situation we have inherited from the last Government is that Germany has almost twice as many renewables jobs per capita as Britain, Sweden almost three times as many, and Denmark almost four times as many.
Through a combination of Great British Energy, the national wealth fund and a clean industry bonus, we are making sure that we do not just build offshore wind in this country, but reap the huge industrial opportunity from it.
Will the Secretary of State confirm that the Court of Session’s judgment on Rosebank and Jackdaw was to do with their consents, not their licences?
When he comes to consider his decisions on those consents, he should do so on the basis that these are existing, not new, licences.
That is an individual planning case, so I will be careful about what I say.
What I will say to the hon.
Lady is that the last Government made an unlawful decision, according to the court.
We are going to follow due process.
GB Nuclear is about to make two decisions on small modular reactors, and I know my right hon.
Friend will agree that those SMRs and their supply chains should be built here in the UK.
Although we have the capability in Sheffield, we do not necessarily have the capacity, so will he work with me, my colleagues and businesses in Sheffield to look at proposals for a nuclear manufacturing centre of excellence?
