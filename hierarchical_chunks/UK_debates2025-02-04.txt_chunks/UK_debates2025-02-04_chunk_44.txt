As my hon.
Friend says, tackling health inequalities is a key priority for this Government, in relation to our health mission but also more generally, when it comes to some of the big conditions such as cancer.
In areas such as his and mine, the prevalence of cancer is greater, because of the industrial legacy, and also because the prevalence of smoking is still much higher than the national average.
I commend the work of his local diagnostics team, and we need much more of that best practice to be spread across the areas that need it the most.
