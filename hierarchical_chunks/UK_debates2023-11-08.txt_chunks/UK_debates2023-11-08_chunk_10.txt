I thank the Minister for his answers to our questions.
Last time, I asked him about a specific family, and we sent the information through.
I want to reinforce the point about the forced deportation of that gentleman and his family, who are also Hazaras.
In his job, he assisted the British Army for seven to eight years.
For 18 months, I have been endeavouring to get them into the United Kingdom because of the risk of harm to them as targeted attacks continue.
Just this morning, it has been reported that there was an attack on a bus taking people from Pakistan back into Afghanistan—it was blown up.
The danger is clear—for me, anyway; I see it very simply.
This cannot continue for that gentleman, his wife and their four children.
We have a job for them, a house for them and a future for them.
We just need the Minister’s help.
Will he help me?
