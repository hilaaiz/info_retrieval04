I welcome the Minister’s comments and the work that he has done on this topic over the past few years, but I am trying to  understand the resources that he has available to him.
It would be helpful if he could update the House on that point.
May I also ask whether any proportion of the aid budget is likely to be allocated to him for this specific issue?
