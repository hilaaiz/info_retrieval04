The Minister will know that Shotton steelworks rely on steel from Port Talbot.
What assurances can she give on the supply of steel between the closure of the blast furnaces and the installation of new electric arc furnaces?
While negotiations were ongoing and support was being provided, we had a conversation to ensure that the supply chain continues to be resilient.
A taskforce has been set up to ensure that supply chains continue to get support, working with the unions, Tata and the local community.
We have been assured that supply chains will continue to secure the contracts that have been in place.
Supporting British Steel need not be just about money; it can be about ensuring that the Government are joining the dots for industry and explaining the pipeline of work available to it.
With the Dreadnought and SSN-AUKUS programmes, we have generations of need for virgin steel.
The same goes for the new nuclear programme.
Will my hon.
Friend confirm that the Government are doing that work and signalling to British Steel that the demand is there?
Also, where we have control over procurement, are we ensuring that we lean towards the British market?
Absolutely.
That is why procurement went up by £97 million recently.
I was looking at what the industry group UK Steel reflected on when it came to  steel produced by electric arc furnaces—the reality is that a substantial amount of speciality military-grade steel can be manufactured using electric arc furnaces.
We are working very closely with the steel sector to do everything we can to ensure that it secures UK contracts.
