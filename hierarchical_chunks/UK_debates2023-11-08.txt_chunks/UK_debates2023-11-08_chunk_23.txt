With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to update the House on the humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
A tragedy is unfolding.
Israel has suffered the worst terrorist attack in its history.
Palestinian civilians in Gaza are experiencing a devastating humanitarian crisis and violence is rising in the west bank.
The best estimates emerging from a confused situation are that 2.3 million people need access to safe drinking water, food supplies are running out, one third of hospitals have been forced to shut down and 1.5 million people are displaced.
I know that the whole House shares my pain at seeing so many innocent lives destroyed on and since  7 October .
