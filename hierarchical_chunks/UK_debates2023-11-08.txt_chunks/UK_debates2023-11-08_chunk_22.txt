That is why the support was so substantial to Port Talbot, to ensure that the steel sector could continue to thrive here in the UK.
Manufacturing in the  UK is booming.
We are the eighth largest manufacturer in the world and we need to get our goods fundamentally from the UK, including steel.
The hon.
Gentleman is right to say that we cannot achieve net zero without steel, but we can help steelmaking to become even more green and clean than it is at the moment.
Does the Minister accept that this news gives up on the UK’s capability to produce primary steel?
I do not, because it was a plan or proposal put out by British Steel.
We have not concluded negotiations.
This is a question of national security.
It is not just a commercial decision.
A specific question was asked of the Minister by the shadow Secretary of State on job losses specifically in Scunthorpe.
Is that figure of 2,000 correct?
Negotiations have not concluded.
We are continuing to be in intensive talks with British Steel.
We wish to provide the support that is needed to support the steel sector and steel jobs but negotiations will continue.
We need to make sure that due diligence is done and that we get value for money for taxpayers, whose money we are going to put on the table.
But look at what we achieved at Port Talbot—a sector that was unable to confirm its future until we provided it with the financial support that it needed.
