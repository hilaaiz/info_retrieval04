Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life and legacy tragic experience to effect meaningful change in the name of Justice here in North Texas.
On July 24, 1973, Bessie's life changed forever, when her 12-year-old son, Santos, was fatally shot by Dallas law enforcement.
Santos meant everything to Bessie.
However, she turned tragedy into action.
She used the death of her son to start a movement to boost accountability and transparency in the police and community relations here that is still being felt in North Texas today.
Just this year, Dallas commemorated the 50th anniversary of Santos' murder by holding multiple events to push for justice.
The commemoration of this solemn anniversary would not have been possible without Bessie's work.
I once again rise today to commemorate Bessie's legacy.
I am praying for her extended family during this time.
