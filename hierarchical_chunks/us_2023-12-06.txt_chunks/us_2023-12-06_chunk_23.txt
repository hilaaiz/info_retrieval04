and preserves the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in Tullahoma, Tennessee and to facilitate interaction and cooperation between the complex and surrounding communities.
Claude and many of his colleagues would spend time every year visiting the Tennessee Congressional delegation, other key members of Congress, members of the Tennessee General Assembly, and officials with the Department of Defense to advocate for and advance the mission of the facility.
His group would also sponsor awards for AEDC personnel, the annual AEDC veteran's picnic, the ACC job fair, the Honor Flights and the AEDC children's Christmas party.
Claude was also a committee member for Wreaths Across America, an organization that places wreaths on fallen veterans' graves during Christmas.
He was also a natural candidate for public service and was selected as a Commissioner for the Coffee County Government.
He was a recipient as an AEDC lifetime achievement fellow.
I am proud to represent a community that has the utmost respect for all the men and women who have served our country with valor and honor as members of our armed forces.
Claude never took a day off in making sure that we always prioritized that commitment to all of those who have served, are serving, and will serve.
I will miss Claude and his hard work, and most importantly, his friendship and support.
I ask all Members of Congress to join me in paying respect to Claude Morris for a lifetime of service to country and community, and I ask this institution to join me in sending the deepest sympathies to all his family and friends.
