Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William ``Billy'' Cooke, who passed away peacefully in his home in Tappahannock, Virginia on November 26, 2023.
Billy was born in Tappahannock, and attended Tappahannock High School, where he played centerfield on the baseball team.
He served two years in the U.S. Army before returning to baseball at Randolph-Macon College.
He earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1959 before returning to Essex County, where he became a prominent member of his community.
Throughout more than 30 years, he served as a deacon, clerk, and Adult Sunday School teacher at Howard's Baptist Church, helped found the Tappahannock Little League, and served four terms on the Essex County Board of Supervisors, among countless other achievements.
Billy was a kind and easygoing man who enjoyed watching PGA tournaments and Atlanta Braves games with his family.
He was often found in his office at the Essex Concrete Main Office, where he worked, or at the Hobbs Hole Golf Course.
He never missed an opportunity to catch up with family and friends, or to dance with his wife whenever they found an open floor with music.
Billy is preceded in death by his brother, Frank and dear friends Willie Cleaton.
Alec Dillard, and James Moore
He is survived by his loving wife of 66 years, Betty Cooke; his brother, Gene Cooke; his sons, William Cooke and Stephen Cooke; several nieces and nephews, and his devoted caregivers from Riverside Hospice
