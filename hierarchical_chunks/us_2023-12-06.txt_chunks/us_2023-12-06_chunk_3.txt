Mr. McCORMICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my gratitude to the Red, Blue and You initiative that celebrates and honors the first responders of Gwinnett County, Georgia.
The community event, organized by local business owners, held its 8th annual celebration on November 16, 2023.
The brave men and women first responders honored at the event are the first line of defense for people in distress, and often do not receive the recognition and support they deserve.
I want to thank these dedicated public safety heroes for serving their communities every single day.
Their work makes a difference and impacts all those in our community.
God bless each and everyone of them.
Semper Fidelis.
