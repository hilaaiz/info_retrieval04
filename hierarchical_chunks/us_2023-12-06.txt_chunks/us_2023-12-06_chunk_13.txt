Mr. Thornton left an indelible mark on his students, community members, and our Commonwealth.
In 1987, 
Mr. Thornton initially sought election to represent the Fairfield District, and though unsuccessful, he played a pivotal role in a successful federal lawsuit alongside the Henrico Civic League and the American Civil Liberties Union.
This lawsuit challenged and overturned Henrico's magisterial district lines, with the court ruling against county officials who had ensured that Black residents were the minority in every district.
As Henrico County Supervisor, 
Mr. Thornton demonstrated unwavering commitment to the residents of the Fairfield District.
Under his leadership, initiatives were implemented to expand the Greater Richmond Transportation Company (GRTC) bus service to Short Pump, construct several libraries and recreation centers in the county, and expand access to public health services.
Beyond his local responsibilities, 
Mr. Thornton extended his public service to various organizations, including the Richmond Regional Transportation Planning Organization, the Capital Region Collaborative Organizing Council, and the Maymont Foundation Board of Directors, among others.
Virginia's Fourth Congressional District has been privileged to benefit from the passionate and devoted advocacy of 
Mr. Thornton for civil rights and social change.
Mr. Speaker, I commend 
Mr. Thornton for his outstanding leadership and extend my best wishes for a fulfilling retirement from the Henrico County Board.
His legacy, marked by tireless dedication, will undoubtedly endure.
