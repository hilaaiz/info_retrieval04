Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr Speaker, today I pay tribute to a remarkable woman who dedicated her professional career to making the state of Michigan, its government, its institutions, and its character stronger and better.
Kathy Wilbur was a fierce advocate and a devoted public servant in both government and higher education, and brought her two passions together in the role she held for the past five years at her alma mater, Michigan State University.
I was fortunate enough to call her my friend, and as her sudden passing leaves a deep hole of grief for so many, it is fitting that we pause to reflect on all she gave to our state.
Kathy began her career in the Michigan Legislature, where she served as chief of staff to former 
Senator Bill Sederburg.
From the start, she was known for her prowess in communications and policy issues, and she went on to serve in the administration of former Michigan Governor John Engler, heading up three different departments during her tenure--the only woman in Michigan history to do so.
In the early 2000s, she began the next chapter of her career with our state's public universities, first at Central Michigan University where she served as interim president, vice president of advancement and external relations, and vice president for government relations.
