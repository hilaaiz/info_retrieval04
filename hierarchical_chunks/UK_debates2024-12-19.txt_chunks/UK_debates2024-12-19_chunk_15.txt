I thank the Minister for her reply.
We are all keen to increase recycling, but too often the opportunities for recycling electronic waste are very limited, meaning that it goes into mainstream waste, leading to increased pollution and hazards.
We are seeing an increasing number of bin fires starting with vapes, which, as she has highlighted, are a particular problem.
Will the Government consider what opportunities there are to work with local authorities to increase recycling opportunities and, in particular, to ensure that the public are aware of the downsides of not disposing of electronic waste properly?
