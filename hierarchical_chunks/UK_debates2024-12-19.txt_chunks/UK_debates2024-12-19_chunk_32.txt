I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
Representing a rural constituency, I am aware of the ongoing problem of agricultural vehicle theft.
In Calder Valley, vehicle crime counts for one in every 20 crimes committed.
The Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023, passed by  the hon.
Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith)  as a private Member’s Bill, was restricted to the re-sale of specified equipment.
However, 18 months since it received Royal Assent, the statutory instrument needed for it to be enacted has yet to be laid.
Will my hon.
Friend act where the previous Government did not?
