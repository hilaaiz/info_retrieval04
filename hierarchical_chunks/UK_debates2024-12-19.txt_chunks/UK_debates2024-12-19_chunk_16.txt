I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
My own city council in Coventry has introduced small electrical item take-back points in its libraries, which is an example of an excellent council innovating.
I recently visited the Currys recycling plant in Newark, which shows the importance of recycling electricals to ensure  that the gifts of Christmas past can be conserved and used for many Christmases to come.
More importantly, last-minute Christmas shoppers will get £5 off a new product—I hear that air fryers are very popular.
