If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
I share customers’ anger about the water bill rises announced by Ofwat this morning.
Customers have been left to pay the price of Conservative failure after the previous Government let companies spend millions of pounds on bonuses and shareholder payouts instead of investing in our crumbling sewerage infrastructure—if you find cracks in your house and do nothing about it for over a decade, the problem gets worse and the cost of fixing it escalates, and that is exactly what has happened to our sewerage system.
We have introduced the Water (Special Measures) Bill to curb unjustified bonuses.
Money earmarked for investment will be ringfenced so that it can be spent only on infrastructure, rather than bonuses and shareholder payouts, as happened under the Conservatives.
I have appointed Sir Jon Cunliffe to lead a commission into the regulation of the water industry so that the failures that led to today’s bill rises can never happen again.
This Government will end the Tory sewage scandal once and for all.
Recent investigations have shown that a lack of investment in drainage infrastructure has contributed to significant flooding in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.
How will water companies including Thames Water be held to account where their lack of investment blights communities through repeated flooding?
The Government of course recognise the importance of and need for a robust drainage system, but my hon.
Friend will be aware that the previous Government failed to ensure adequate investment to maintain and upgrade it.
Water companies have a duty to ensure that the area they serve is effectively drained.
This includes drainage of surface water from the land around buildings as well as the provision of sewers.
