Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I take this opportunity to wish you and all in the House a very merry Christmas.
Many customers are rightly concerned about Thames Water and the situation that company finds itself in.
For the third time of asking the Secretary of State in this Chamber, will he confirm that he will not issue any regulatory easement to Thames Water in his discussions with that company, so that its environmental obligations and service commitments to its customers will not be reduced?
The Government continue to monitor very closely what is happening in Thames Water, and indeed in all the other water companies.
The only easement I have ever seen given to water companies over pollution was that of the previous Government, who turned a blind eye as sewage was flooding through our rivers, lakes and seas.
This Government are putting the water companies under tough regulatory special measures—measures that the previous Government could have enacted, but failed to enact.
What progress he has made on reducing electronic waste.
As my hon.
Friend knows, each week 8 million vapes—such as single-use, pod and big puff—are thrown away or recycled incorrectly, which is 13 vapes a second.
That is why we have already banned single-use vapes and created 10,000 extra vape recycling points in store.
We will ensure that online marketplaces and vape producers pay their share of electronic recycling costs in order to avoid the fires, which we know are so devastating.
Mr Speaker, I wish you and your team a very happy Christmas.
