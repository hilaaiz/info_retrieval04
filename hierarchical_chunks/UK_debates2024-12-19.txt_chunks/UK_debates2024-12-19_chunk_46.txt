I thank my hon.
Friend for making that point, and wish the volunteers well in their weekend activities.
She is right to highlight not only staff but the hundreds of thousands of volunteers across the country who work to support the hospice sector and others with end of life care.
That support is so important for people receiving end of life care and their families.
It is something that I have experienced; my father died over the Christmas period a number of years ago.
It is a hard time of the year to have a death, and I warmly support what those volunteers are doing this weekend.
