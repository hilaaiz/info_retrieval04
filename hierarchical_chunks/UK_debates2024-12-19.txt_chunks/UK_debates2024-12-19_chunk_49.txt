Hospices such as St Ann’s in Stockport provide really high-quality care to my constituents and others at what is often the toughest point in their lives, but they are struggling in a system that is no longer fit for purpose.
It is of course welcome that the Government are providing additional funding for them.
One of the challenges that the hospice sector faces is a really high rate of staff vacancies, so I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm whether the 10-year plan for the NHS includes a specific workforce plan for our hospice sector, so that it continues to care for our constituents at the toughest point in their lives.
The hon.
Lady makes an excellent point about the stability of the workforce across the piece, from diagnosis to the end of life.
We absolutely need to consider support for all parts of that through the 10-year plan.
I encourage hon.
Members and others to ensure that they keep making those points.
We are getting excellent contributions from the public, patients and staff, and we look forward to developing the plan over the next few months and years.
