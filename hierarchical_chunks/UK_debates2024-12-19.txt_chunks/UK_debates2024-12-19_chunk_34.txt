I thank the hon.
Lady for that reply and I appreciate the additional resources, but what my constituents, and I am sure constituents up and down the country, want to see is robust effective policing and prosecution of what is low-level crime in the great scheme of things, but which can be a real curse, particularly on our housing estates.
Can the hon.
Lady give an assurance to my constituents that there will be real robust and positive action?
