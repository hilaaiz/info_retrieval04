My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
It was extraordinary, was it not, that the last Government managed not to spend £300 million of the farm budget.
We are determined to ensure that we do better.
I wish him and his farmers a very merry Christmas.
In my constituency we have an incinerator that regularly breaches its air pollution limits, but the Environment Agency does nothing about it.
Will the Government tell us what they are doing to give the EA teeth?
Incineration permit breaches are a matter for the regulator, the Environment Agency, but we are reviewing energy-from-waste capacity across the country and will be making a statement imminently.
Merry Christmas, Mr Speaker, and happy Hanukkah to those who are observing.
What action are this Government taking to promote the purchasing of British-grown and seasonal produce through their public procurement framework?
We are absolutely determined to ensure that we see more British produce bought across our public sector.
We will come to the House with our plans in due course.
