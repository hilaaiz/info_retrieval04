I thank the hon.
Lady for raising such an important issue, and I recognise that over 40% of pollution in our waterways comes from agricultural run-off.
Sir Jon Cunliffe and the commission he is leading will look at all sources of pollution into our water.
The budgets for more sustainable forms of agriculture that we have committed to will seek to reduce the use of fertiliser, so that there is less run-off into our water.
The farming road map that we are working on with the farming community is also intended to reduce the amount of run-off from agriculture into our waterways, and we are  looking at moving to a whole catchment-based model.
We are looking at all sources of pollution into water so that we can clean up all of our rivers, lakes and seas, from whatever source the pollution comes.
