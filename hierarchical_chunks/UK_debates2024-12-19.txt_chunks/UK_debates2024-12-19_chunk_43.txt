I thank the hon.
Lady for her questions and for welcoming the announcement.
She will know that, in the past 14 years, the sector has been neglected, like the rest of the NHS and social care system.
As we have repeatedly said, to govern is to choose.
We have improved the settlement for the sector this year.
Today’s welcome announcement can be used by the sector to manage some of those pressures and deliver the sorts of services it wants for the future.
