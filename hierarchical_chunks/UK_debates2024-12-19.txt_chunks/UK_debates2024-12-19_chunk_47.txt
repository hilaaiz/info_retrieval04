The fact that the Minister has come here expecting us to welcome her announcement and congratulate her on giving money that her Government took away in the first place really beggars belief.
Mountbatten hospice in my constituency needs an extra £1 million because of the NICs increase that her Government have brought forward.
Will she guarantee to Mountbatten and the charitable sector, including hospices—which the last Government increased funding for, before she comes back to me with that answer —that today’s announcement will cover the £1 million that her Government have taken away in NICs?
What beggars belief is that person after person—man after man—on the Opposition Benches still feels able to get up and defend their record in  government.
Not once have we heard that they agree with Lord Darzi’s diagnosis, or that they welcome the extra investment that the Chancellor found by choosing to support the health sector in the Budget.
I am afraid that, until they reach that conclusion, they are destined to be on the Opposition Benches for a very long time.
Merry Christmas to you and your team, Mr Speaker.
Compton Care hospice in my constituency provides specialist palliative and bereavement care, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Having previously discussed the lack of funding with the hospice, I am sure that it will welcome the extra funding that has been announced today.
Will the Minister please join me in thanking Compton Care hospice and its incredible staff for the care that they will continue to provide throughout the Christmas period?
