I welcome the landmark £5 billion agriculture budget announced in the Budget, which is the biggest-ever budget for sustainable farming.
My farmers in North Northumberland desperately need that money.
In that context, what more can the Secretary of State do to push for his Department to get that money out the door in a way that the previous Government did not?
