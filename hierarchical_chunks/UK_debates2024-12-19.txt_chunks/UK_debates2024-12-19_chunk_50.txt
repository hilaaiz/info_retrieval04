I welcome the largest funding increase for hospices in a generation.
If that cannot bring some Christmas cheer to the Conservative Benches, it will in my constituency of Wirral West where Claire House hospice does such important work all year round.
I was there just last week for their Christmas carols.
Will the Minister take the opportunity to thank them for the important work they do in my constituency of Wirral West?
