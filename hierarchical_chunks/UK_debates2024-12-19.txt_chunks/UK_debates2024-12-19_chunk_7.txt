The autumn Budget put family farms in jeopardy.
Those farms also need biosecurity to protect their futures.
With avian influenza spreading, bluetongue still with us and African swine fever at our doorstep in Europe, biosecurity is national security.
Central to that is the Animal and Plant Health Agency, whose headquarters in Weybridge needs a £2.8 billion redevelopment to protect farming and animal, plant and public health.
The Conservative Government rightly started that work with £1.2 billion committed in 2020.
I note that Labour has committed £200 million to support that transformation, but that will not touch the sides.
Will the Secretary of State confirm that the Government will complete the project in full, as the Minister for Food Security and Rural Affairs called for in opposition, and commit the remaining £1.4 billion to protect our nation’s biosecurity and prevent an animal disease outbreak catastrophe?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman, who raises an important point.
However, I find it a little ironic that Conservative Members are calling for this Government to commit to spending that their Government never committed to.
The Weybridge biosecurity facility is so dilapidated that it faces obsolescence by the early 2030s—that is the legacy that the Conservatives left.
The £208 million that we have committed will start the process of improving those facilities, and through the spending review phase coming forward, we will consider how we can commit further funding to ensure biosecurity for farmers, which the Conservatives absolutely failed to do.
