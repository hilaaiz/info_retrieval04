It would be helpful if the Secretary of State encouraged Sir Jon to engage with parliamentarians across the House.

The truth of the matter is that if those who currently have responsibility were to change their culture and focus on outcomes for customers, rather than their own internal processes, we might see earlier improvements.
There will be an opportunity for Members to engage with Sir Jon Cunliffe’s commission in January, and I am sure that the right hon.
Member’s Committee will want to do precisely that.
The Water (Special Measures) Bill, which is going through Parliament right now, is intended to make quick changes to the system.
Sir Jon’s review will give us the chance to reform regulation and governance for the long term.
I recently met the Alde and Ore Estuary Trust, which has long been campaigning and fundraising to refurbish and secure flood defences on the Alde and Ore estuary.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss the trust’s projects and the barriers to progress?
Each time I come here for questions, I promise that I will not arrange to meet as many Members, and each time I fail.
I would of course be happy to meet my hon.

Last year I visited the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust’s Allerton project in Loddington.
May I commend the contribution that it can make to defining sustainable intensification of agricultural food production?
Perhaps it would be a suitable place for a DEFRA ministerial away day early in the new year, to help with the use strategy.
