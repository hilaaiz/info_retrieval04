That is absolutely what we want to do, and today’s announcement is a step towards it.
As my hon.
Friend highlights, hospices are very special places, but most people want to die at home with their loved ones, in the place they know well, and many parts of the sector will be able to use this money to help more people to die peacefully at home.
This additional funding will benefit hospices serving Westmorland communities—St Mary’s, St John’s, Eden Valley and the children’s hospice, Jigsaw—only if two things happen.
First, the Government must provide additional funding to match the national insurance increases that those hospices will have to bear, and secondly, the Government must ensure that the integrated care boards in south Cumbria and north Cumbria pass on that money in full and on time.
Will the Minister press them to do so?
On the Morecambe bay end, will she press them on the closure of the Abbey View ward at Barrow hospital?
The trust is planning to close that end of life ward, which will put additional pressure on our local hospices but without any additional funding to support them.
The commissioning of those services is the responsibility of the ICBs, and we expect them to do that.
They are responsible from diagnosis to end of life.
In the past few months, I have met many hon.
Members from across political parties to discuss issues in their ICBs.
I know that he will, like others, be assiduous in pursuing the ICB to ensure that funding goes to the right place.
I wish you, Mr Speaker, and the fantastic staff across the estate a happy Christmas.
