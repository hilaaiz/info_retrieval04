I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his points and refer him to my earlier comments: we see more and more pressure, and there are so many things we need to do on our land to house and feed people, so it is important that we have a proper structure in place.
It is widely acknowledged that the current planning system does not necessarily do that.
The previous Government promised a land use framework; we will actually deliver it.
