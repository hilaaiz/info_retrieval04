and reliable news to keep the public informed and entertained.
They have brought a personal and powerful form of communication to their audience.
The Greg and Dan Show serves as a bridge between communities, providing a unique space where local stories, issues, and voices can be heard.
Greg and Dan have played a significant role in amplifying the voices of politicians, local leaders, and members of the community to ensure their listeners are informed on public events and both national and local issues.
WMBD is the oldest commercial radio Station in Peoria, and for 20 years of its rich history, Greg and Dan have been working together to better the lives of listeners and give back to communities and organizations across Central Illinois.
This is a monumental moment for the Greg and Dan Show.
I congratulate them on their 20 years of success.
I look forward to listening to their show for many more years to come.
