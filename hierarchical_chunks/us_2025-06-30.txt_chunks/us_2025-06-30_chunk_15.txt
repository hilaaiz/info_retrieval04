Representatives has a duty under the Constitution to hold a president accountable for illegal conduct.
This obligation begins with an open, transparent process of Congressional hearings, investigations, and subpoenas.
The Republican majority controlling this Congress will not allow that work to move forward, but a premature and poorly reasoned resolution like this hurts our ability to progress on the path to accountability for President Trump.
My constituents can count on me to hold 
Mr. Trump accountable in a manner that is fully transparent and clearly documents his malfeasance as the President of the United States.
