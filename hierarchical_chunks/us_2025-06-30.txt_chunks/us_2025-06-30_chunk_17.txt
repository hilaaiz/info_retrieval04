Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of Robert ``Bob'' Lechtreck, Sr., a decorated Navy veteran away recently, just months after celebrating his 100th birthday.
His remarkable life reflects a century of service and deep devotion to both his country and his community.
Born on April 2, 1925, Bob Lechtreck joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 17.
He served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and saw combat in some of the most pivotal battles of the war, including the Battle.
Just three days before his death, we marked the 80th anniversary of that battle, which serves as a reminder of the high cost ship later guarded Tokyo Bay during the signing of Japan's formal surrender, helping to usher in the end of the war.
In 1948, Bob returned home and joined the Kern County Fire Department.
Over the course of a 30-year career, he rose through the ranks to become the department's fifth fire chief.
Having worked alongside Kern County's very first fire chief, Harold Boway, he was a bridge between generations and remains the only known person to have driven the department's first fire engine, a 1929 Moreland, on active calls.
In his later years, Bob remained an active and honored member of the community.
He was part of the very first Kern County Honor Flight to Washington, D.C., where he visited the World War II Memorial and the U.S. Capitol in recognition of his service.
On his 100th birthday, he was celebrated by friends, neighbors, veterans, and members of the Kern County Fire Department, who gave their former chief a ceremonial ride in a working fire engine--a fitting tribute for a life of courage and leadership.
