Ms. STEVENS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the honorable life of my dear friend, Michael Kramer, a passionate legal professional and a champion of access to education and healthcare.
Mr. Kramer centered his life around service.
Among his many contributions, his creation of scholarships for students at Oakland University and support Center will be remembered for their ongoing impact.
