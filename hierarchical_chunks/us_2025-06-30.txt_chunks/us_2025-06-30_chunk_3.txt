Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the outstanding interns who have devoted their summer to serving the people of California's 20th District.
From my offices in Washington, D.C., and Bakersfield, these students have demonstrated maturity beyond their years, contributing their time, intellect, and drive to support our work in meaningful ways.
They brought fresh insight, a willingness to learn, and an admirable commitment to public service.
Their presence has been a welcome reminder of the promise and potential of the next generation.
At a time when many young Americans are navigating questions about their role in civic life, these interns chose to engage directly with purpose and passion.
As their summer internships come to a close, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Isaac Chipres, Luke Fernandes, and Margaret Woolf for their contributions to my Washington, D.C., office and to Gianna Gatson for her service in my Bakersfield, California office.
Their hard work has been instrumental to my team's efforts, and I trust that the skills and educational experiences they have gained will guide them toward continued success in their future endeavors in public service.
I look forward to seeing where their paths lead, and I hope those paths include a continued dedication to serving others.
