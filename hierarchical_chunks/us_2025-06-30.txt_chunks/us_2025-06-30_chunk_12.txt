Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the National Capital Planning Commission District.
This bill would remove the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), a federal agency, to review or approve the development of District of Columbia-owned real property.
This bill would also remove the requirement that the D.C. Mayor get NCPC's approval before selling D.C.-owned real property and allow D.C. agencies to transfer jurisdiction over D.C.-owned real property among themselves without NCPC's approval.
Under federal law, NCPC has approval authority for the development of D.C.-owned buildings located in the ``central area,'' including the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of such buildings.
D.C. is required to consult with NCPC on the development of D.C.-owned buildings outside the central area, but NCPC has only advisory authority in those areas.
The central area is defined by the concurrent action of NCPC and the D.C. Council and currently consists of the Downtown and Shaw Urban Renewal Areas.
NCPC's authority over D.C.-owned real property violates D.C. home rule and is unnecessary, as demonstrated by the virtual absence of its use to disapprove sales or development.
The federal government should not be able to slow, block or add to the cost of the development of D.C.-owned real property.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
