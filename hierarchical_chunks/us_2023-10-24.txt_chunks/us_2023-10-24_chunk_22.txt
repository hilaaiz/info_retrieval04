Mrs. TRAHAN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of the 32nd Anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement that ended the Cambodian-Vietnamese War.
As the Chair of the Congressional Cambodia Caucus and the 
Representative of a district with one of the highest populations of Cambodian-Americans, I rise to honor the anniversary of the peace agreement and call on the United States to do everything possible to help Cambodia realize its full democratic potential.
This historic agreement ended a horrible war that stretched over three decades and caused the deaths of countless soldiers and civilians.
One of the promises outlined in the accord was for free and fair elections.
Unfortunately, that aspiration was never realized, and the current state of Cambodia's government personifies the challenges that remain to achieving a truly democratic nation.
For thirty-eight years, Cambodia was ruled with an iron grip by Prime Minister Hun Sen.
The democratic promise of free and fair elections was shattered by his weaponization of government power.
Over the years, Hun Sen took steps to eliminate his opposition, ban independent media outlets, and jail peaceful protesters.
In depriving the Cambodian people of their human rights, Hun Sen moved Cambodia closer to an authoritarian state and robbed them of the representative government promised in their Constitution and the Paris Peace Agreement.
