Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Carla Scruggs, the Director of Parks and Recreation for the City of Saline, on the occasion of her retirement.
Her contributions to the health and wellness of the Saline community over the last three decades are worthy of commendation.
Born and raised in Ann Arbor, MI, Carla graduated from Pioneer High School before attending Central Michigan University, where she spent four years on the softball team.
After earning both her bachelor's and master's degrees, she set out on a career in public service throughout Southeastern Michigan.
In 1988, Carla began at the City of Hazel Park as a graduate intern specializing in senior programming and youth and adult sports.
She then went to Novi, where she took on the position of Recreation Coordinator for the city's Parks and Recreation Department.
In 1991, Carla was brought on as the Director of Parks and Recreation for the City of Saline, where she has been serving ever since.
Carla's tenure at the head of the Saline Parks and Recreation Department has seen countless improvements to Saline's green spaces.
These include, but are certainly not limited to, the Recreate Our Mill Pond Park play structure, multiple dog parks, and the creation of Salt Springs Park.
As well as being the Director, Carla also acts as the Staff Liaison to the Parks Commission and the Youth Council.
She has been an active member for the Michigan Recreation and Parks Association for the entirety of her tenure and is currently the Chair of their Awards Committee.
In her free time, Carla volunteers every year for the Punt Pass & Kick State Competition, Saline's DARE golf outing, the PPSA golf outing, and the University of Michigan Softball Academy to raise awareness for breast cancer.
