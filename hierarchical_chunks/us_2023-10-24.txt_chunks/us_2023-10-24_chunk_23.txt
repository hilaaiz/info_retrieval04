Earlier this year, Cambodia held a sham election that made a mockery victory for Hun Sen who in turn announced an immediate transfer of power to his son, Hun Manet.
Let me be clear, these most recent elections violated the Cambodian Constitution, a document that Hun Sen helped draft and signed three decades ago, and his unprecedented decision to unilaterally transfer power to his son indicates Cambodia will be subject to authoritarian rule for another generation.
As we recognize the 32nd anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement, the Congressional Cambodia Caucus stands firmly against the rising tide Manet picks up where his father left off.
Instead, we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to push for a free, democratic Cambodia.
I am a proud co-lead of the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act (H.R. 4659), legislation that promotes free and fair elections, democracy, political freedoms, and human rights in Cambodia by applying sanctions on Cambodian officials who denigrate those rights.
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Cambodian Caucus to pass this bill and with the Biden Administration to ensure that these sanctions are imposed effectively.
Passing the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act will help ensure that the principles of the Paris Peace Agreement are upheld and that Cambodians can move closer to achieving the self-determination and dignity they deserve.
