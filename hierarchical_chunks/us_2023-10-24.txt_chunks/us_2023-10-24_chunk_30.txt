Mrs. Cindy Castello for the vital role she has played in the development of Cherokee County, Georgia as a stronghold of conservative values.
Cindy and her husband, Pete, have been friends of my family for many years.
We have witnessed her character and dedication to our shared cause in all of her numerous roles as a community servant.
As a dedicated leader, Cindy has been instrumental in recruiting and developing many community activists to become public servants and run for public office.
She has utilized her extensive network of relationships and years of experience within the Georgia Republican Party, the 11th Congressional District, and the Cherokee County Republican Party to lay a foundation which will impact Cherokee County for years to come.
She has devoted countless hours volunteering her time, talents, and energy to serve eleven years on the Zoning Board of Appeals; and, during her eighteen years of service on the Tax Equalization Board, she played a vital role for Cherokee County in steering the future of the county by applying commonsense conservative values.
In her thirty-three years of dedicated service on the Cherokee County Board of Elections, Cindy has helped to set a standard of excellence, and helped develop the Board into one of Georgia's finest and most innovative entities.
She has provided invaluable support and has been instrumental in the development of the Cherokee County Republican Party for the past forty years.
She exemplifies the very best of public service and is truly an inspiration to so many.
It is abundantly fitting and proper that Cindy's dedication to the cause of faith, family, and freedom be appropriately recognized in the U.S. House.
On behalf of the citizens of Cherokee County, Georgia's 11th Congressional District, and myself and my family, I offer my sincere appreciation to 
Mrs. Cindy Castello for her decades of faithful public service to our community.
