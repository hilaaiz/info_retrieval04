Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished South Carolina bank for its unwavering commitment to advancing minority-owned businesses.
Optus Bank of Columbia, South Carolina was recently awarded the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) 2023
Robert J. Brown Minority Business Enterprise of the Year Award.
Their steadfast support of businesses in distressed areas has uplifted communities and the lives of many.
To recognize the important role of entrepreneurs and institutions in advancing minority-owned businesses, the Minority Business Development Agency at the United States Department of Commerce established Minority Enterprise Development Week in 1983.
Since then, the Department of Commerce has commenced numerous awards to celebrate the outstanding achievements of minority entrepreneurs.
The Robert J. Brown Minority Business Enterprise Award recognizes companies that have exceeded industry standards and achieved phenomenal financial success while showing a commitment to social responsibility and strong community involvement.
The award is among the highest levels of recognition that a U.S. minority business enterprise can receive from the U.S. Department.
Optus Bank was selected because of its commitment to closing the racial wealth gap, exacerbated by systemic disparities in the financial industry.
Following in the footsteps of Victory Savings Bank, the first Black-owned bank in South Carolina, Optus is committed to providing access to capital to individuals and businesses excluded from the banking system.
By turning deposits from community members into loans that serve local businesses, Optus provides funding for enterprises that may not be approved for traditional loans.
Their unique community driven mission has allowed them to achieve great success while helping scores of minority-owned enterprises succeed in South Carolina.
