Mr. BUCK.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the All Veterans Honor Guard, who provide the final Military Honors at Fort Logan National Cemetery in Colorado.
Only those who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces are permitted to provide such services but in 1993, the U.S. Military ceased to perform these final rites for deceased veterans.
That's why approximately 100 Colorado veterans formed the All Veterans Honor Guard in 1994 to carry on this sacred duty for their late comrades in arms.
Aside from a small stipend from the state of Colorado, the organization receives no additional funding or compensation to maintain and repair the World War II-era weapons or to purchase uniforms for their volunteers.
During their first year, the All Veterans Honor Guard provided Military Honors for 63 veterans at Ft. Logan National Cemetery--and since 1994, they have stood as the Honor Guard for over 23,400 military funerals; with Chief Master Sergeant Retired Morris Smith serving as the backbone for over two decades.
But as time has gone on, the number away.
The number of volunteers, however, has diminished.
In 2021, the All Veterans Honor Guard had less than 80 veteran volunteers, who provided the final honors for 1,554 veterans.
Despite these challenges, the Honor Guard remains as dedicated to serving their late brothers and sisters in their afterlife as they were in serving alongside them in life.
That is why, 
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, on behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Colorado, it is a distinct privilege to recognize and commemorate the tireless efforts of the All Veterans Honor Guard over the past 29 years.
Our country is blessed to have such heroes who care enough to honor their comrades as they are laid to rest.
