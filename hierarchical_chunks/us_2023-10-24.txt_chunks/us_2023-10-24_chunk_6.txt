Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of Mark Pelletier, a New Hampshire resident who was recently named the 2023 Young Professional of the Year by the Cooperative Credit Union Association.
The Cooperative Credit Union Association annual awards recognize individuals across Delaware, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire that make the extra effort to empower their coworkers, company, and community.
As the Young Professional of the Year, Mark has been recognized for his experience, enthusiasm, and strong work ethic at St. Mary's Bank in Manchester.
A senior data analyst lead for St. Mary's, Mark was nominated by the credit union's leadership team and employees because of his inclusive leadership style, his skills in devising data-driven solutions, and his extensive volunteer record.
For the past two years, Mark has served as Chairperson.
Mary's Young Professionals Group.
In this role, Mark has taken to guiding, influencing, and supporting other young professionals.
Mark's time as leader of this Group is a testament to his talent and passion for promoting young business leaders across New Hampshire.
Outside of the office, Mark has committed himself to addressing the needs of his community.
In his free time, Mark volunteers with organizations such as Families in Transition and Habitat for Humanity.
Dedicated to empowering young leaders and committed to supporting the local community, Mark has enriched the lives of all those around him.
I look forward to seeing all that Mark accomplishes in the years to come, and I am confident that he will continue to serve as a guide for all those looking to make a difference at their workplace and in their community.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I applaud Mark for his commendable leadership and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.
