Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I am honored to recognize the life of a quintessential West Side of Buffalo resident, Robert Lipp.
Often referred to as ``The Mayor of Fifteenth Street,'' Robert left an indelible mark on a community that will be mourning his loss for a long time to come.
Born in 1965, Robert graduated from Maryvale High School in Cheektowaga, and Bryant & Stratton College in Buffalo, where he obtained a degree in Electronic Technology.
A longtime employee with the New York State Thruway Authority, an on-the-job accident meant that Robert entered retirement earlier than he had planned.
Instead of approaching this situation with negativity, Robert began to dive into some of his passions.
As a man that understood the value of community and neighborhoods, he would plant flowers each year for Buffalo's annual Garden Walk.
Robert did not simply hope that someone would take steps to beautify the West Side of Buffalo; he did it.
Whether it result from confrontation of absentee landlords or fixing the electrical issues of his neighbors, there was no limit to the level of love that Robert displayed for the City.
Of course, Robert enjoyed many other activities, as well.
He loved to camp, go to concerts and weddings, and (in typical Buffalo fashion) watch his beloved Bills and Sabres.
He spent time with his many dogs, sought to make each year's Garden Walk better than the last, and served as a dedicated member of the Democratic Committee.
Survived by his husband, Bobby Graber, and countless loving family members, Robert's sudden passing will undoubtedly be difficult to endure.
Nevertheless, to all of those who knew and loved Robert, his legacy will remain.
Robert served as a model citizen in so many ways, and our community will forever be a better place because of him.
