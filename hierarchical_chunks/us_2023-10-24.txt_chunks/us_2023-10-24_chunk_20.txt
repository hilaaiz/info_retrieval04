Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to congratulate Shakopee Brewhall--Taproom & Coffeehouse as the Midwest regional finalist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's America's Top Small Business Award.
Shakopee Brewhall was selected as one of seven finalists out of a total of over 15,000 small business applicants for the annual Top Small Business Award.
At its inception in 2018, the brewhall operated modestly with a nine-member team, opening its doors for just 41 hours across five days each week.
During that time, the team focused on brewing and, as demand grew, distributing its unique beers.
Today, they employ 27 workers, with over half of the original staff still remaining on the team and have grown their customer base and expanded their offerings to include morning coffee and espresso over 86 hours every week.
I'm grateful for co-founders, Ryan Lindquist and Damon Schuler's role in the revitalization of downtown Shakopee by turning their historic space into Scott County's first taproom and coffeehouse.
Their leadership of the brewhall showcased necessary innovation when pivoting to distribution during the pandemic and working with other local small businesses.
I've also appreciated their ``Share More Than A Beer Day,'' which creates awareness and financial support for partnering organizations and has led to more than $50,000 in donations to local non-profits.
It was a special honor to join Shakopee Brewhall's Caitlin Drayna at the Chamber's Awards Gala on October 19th.
It is my privilege to represent Shakopee Brewhall in Congress and I look forward to sharing a beer together soon.
