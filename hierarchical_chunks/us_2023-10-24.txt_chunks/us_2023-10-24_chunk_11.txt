Mr. BUCK.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is my honor today to recognize the accomplishments of three outstanding women.
Ashley Ferris, Yvette Marquez-Sharpnack and Alice Jackson who will be honored by the Northwest Douglas County Chamber & Economic Development Corporation as ``Women Who Soar.''
Ashley Ferris, a law enforcement officer, left an indelible mark in Denver from 2018 to 2023.
Even before her tenure as a dedicated law enforcement officer, her background as a United States Army Intelligence Analyst and project manager showcased her remarkable skills.
Ashley's heroic efforts were exemplified during the critical incident on December 27, 2021,
