Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr, Speaker Pro Tempore, it is with profound grief that I pay tribute to the life of a passionate advocate, a dedicated former Congressional staff member, an organizer, and a true believer in interfaith dialogue, Samantha Woll.
Sam had a brilliant mind, a generous spirit, and was a true light in the community.
While we do not yet know the circumstances of her death, we do know how she lived, so today I ask that we remember the profound impact she had on her community, our state, and the Nation in her short time on this earth.
