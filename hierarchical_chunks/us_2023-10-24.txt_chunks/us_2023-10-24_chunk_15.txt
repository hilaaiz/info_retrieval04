Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 32+ years of public service that Carla Scruggs has been kind enough to dedicate her life to.
She has given our children spaces to play, our dogs spaces to run, and altogether has made Saline a warmer and more welcoming place to live.
Though we are sad to see her go, the families of Saline will be feeling her positive influence for decades to come.
I thank Carla.
