The Minister will be aware of the successful export order for high-value naval electric propulsion technology manufactured by GE in my Rugby constituency.
That order is going to Singapore, and it was achieved with the assistance of the MOD and the Department for Business and Trade.
Does that not show that support for this world-leading British technology enables new business in a fast-developing part of the world, while providing significant, new, high-value jobs for my constituents?
My hon.
Friend asks an excellent question.
I welcome the valuable contribution of GE in his constituency in supplying high-tech motors, including for Royal Navy ships, such as Type 26 frigates and Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.
It is precisely because the Ministry of Defence recognises the importance of GE’s Rugby facility that we were pleased to reach an agreement with the company in 2019 to ensure that those motors continued to be manufactured there.
Finally, he is right about export.
It is such a key part of our new integrated procurement model, because it boosts industrial resilience and prosperity in constituencies such as his, while strengthening international alliances, such as, in this case, with the people of Singapore and the Singapore navy.
