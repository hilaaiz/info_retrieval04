I thank the Minister for Defence Procurement for his procurement review.
It is an excellent document, moving forward in a pragmatic way.
As part of that review, will he reassess where potential gaps might occur between old platforms being retired and new platforms being delayed?
Does he agree that housing procurement—accommodation for our armed forces—is as much an operational capability as a tank?
