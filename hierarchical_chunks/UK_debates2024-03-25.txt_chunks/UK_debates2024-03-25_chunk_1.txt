The question of whether our armed forces are fit for purpose should centre on whether they can carry out the defence tasks set by the MOD, and I believe that they can.
If I may carry on in the same vein as the previous response, does the Minister agree that Labour’s failure to commit to spending more than 2% of GDP on defence presents a much bigger risk to UK security, objectively, than any matter of debate among Members on this side of the House?
The WASPI website has a grim counter of affected women’s deaths and of money saved by the Treasury.
The current figures are 273,000-plus women and well over £4 billion.
They are rising by the minute.
How far have the consequences of the Government’s 2022 disastrous mini-Budget affected their thinking on this matter?
If the Secretary of State will not commit to full level 6 compensation, as the ombudsman recommends, what does he have to offer Linda Gregory, my constituency born in 1953?
She “did the right thing,” as he said.
She did her sums, got her forecasts and was repeatedly assured by the DWP and HMRC that she had contributions to retire at 60 in order to look after her ailing mum—before this surprise was sprung on her, which has so far cost her £40,000.
Before we come to questions to the Secretary of State for Defence, may I just say this to Minister Heappey: you will be missed and I am sorry you are stepping down.
On a personal level, I thank you for your private briefings to ensure that the House was kept informed.
You will be missed and I thank you for that service.
