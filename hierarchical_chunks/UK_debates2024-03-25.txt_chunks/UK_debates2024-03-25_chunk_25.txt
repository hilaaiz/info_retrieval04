I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his statement, and for advance sight of it.
It is a statement about which there has been significant briefing in the press over the past couple of days.
On questions of national security, Labour will support the Government in efforts to counter attempts by China, or any other state, to interfere with or undermine the democratic process, or attempts to stop elected representatives going about their business, voicing their opinions, or casting their votes without fear or favour.
With that in mind, I pay tribute to the efforts made every day by the intelligence and security services to protect the public, and to protect our democracy and way of life.
The economic relationship between the United Kingdom and China can never mean compromising on national security or our democratic integrity.
