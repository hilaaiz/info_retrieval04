Mr. Speaker, the profound loss experienced by the Grayson family in the wake of Joyce's death is unimaginable.
Despite the overwhelming tragedy of this situation however, our state and Nation can take solace in the knowledge that the legacy Joyce has left behind will continue to imbue the world with her kindness and care.
And hopefully the circumstances of her passing will spur meaningful change in our nations workplace rules to protect ``the caring professions'' that she so nobly personified.
Joyce touched thousands of people throughout her life, whether as a nurse working for Connecticut or Elara Caring, or in her capacity as a foster mother.
Her works have inspired two of her children to follow in her footsteps and serve in healthcare.
We mourn with Joyce's family, including her husband Ronald; children Elliot, Kyle, Kaitlyn, Evan, Audrey, Shawn, and their spouses; her four grandchildren; and her eleven siblings.
To these ends, I ask my colleagues to join me in etching the life and legacy of Joyce Grayson further into stone, and enact legislation to better protect health care providers like Joyce from the violence they all too often face.
