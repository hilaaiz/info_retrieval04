with elders like him.
His trials, triumphs, and everything in between are a beautiful testament to a remarkable and full life.
Throughout his life, 
Mr. Thomas has had many blessings.
He is the beloved father of three, a grandfather of 10, a great-grandfather of 21, and great-great-great-grandfather of six.
As a World War II Army Veteran serving in England, France, and Germany, we thank him for his dedication to his family and service to our country.
I am so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate his life because it is an inspiration to so many of us in St. Louis.
I wish 
Mr. Thomas peace and continued joy tending to the best yard in University City throughout his 103rd year.
Happy birthday and bountiful blessings to 
Mr. Willie James Thomas, Sr.
