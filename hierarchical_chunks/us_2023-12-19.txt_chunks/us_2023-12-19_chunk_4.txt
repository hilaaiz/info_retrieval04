Mr. Speaker, I have known Jerry personally for over 30 years and consider myself immensely fortunate to call him a friend.
Representing hardworking, good hearted constituents like Jerry Grabarek is an inspiration to me to stay focused on helping people which is his trademark.
Amazingly Jerry continues to serve even as he surpasses 50 years of hard work for Preston and the southeast region.
I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Jerry for his decades of dutiful stewardship.
