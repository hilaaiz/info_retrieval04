Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking 
Mr. Thomas Branin, whom I am proud to call a friend--except on days when Tucker plays Freeman--for his service on behalf of the Three Chopt District and the entire Henrico County community and for his contributions to making Henrico a safer place for all.
