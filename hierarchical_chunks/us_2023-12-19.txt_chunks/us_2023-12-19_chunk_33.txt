Mr. Speaker, please join me in commending Principal Nally for her extraordinary leadership at Bedford Elementary School.
Great leaders surround themselves with great staff, which in turn inspires greatness in their students.
There is no doubt Principal Nally has been a force for good in the lives of countless young Iowans and the Bedford community.
