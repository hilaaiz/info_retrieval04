Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Central Phenix City football team for winning the AHSAA Class 7A state title.
On December 6, 2023, The Central Phenix City Red Devils left no doubt as to who deserves to be state champion, prevailing in a close game against four-time-champion Thompson 21 to 19 to secure their title win.
The game was played at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
The Central Phenix City Red Devils finished their championship season undefeated.
This was head coach Patrick Nix's first state title victory at Central Phenix City and the Red Devils' third football state title in school history.
