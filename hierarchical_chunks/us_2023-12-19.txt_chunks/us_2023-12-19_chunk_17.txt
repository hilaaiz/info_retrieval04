Mr. Talley was in the Pentagon during the September 11th terrorist attacks that shook our Nation before he deployed to Afghanistan to fight against those same attackers.
He served his country with distinction and rose through the ranks before his retirement in 2018 as a Chief Warrant Officer Four.
Now, he uses his specialized skills and years of experience in the Army and as an American Culinary Federation Certified Executive Chef to serve as the Quality Assurance Manager for the Joint Culinary Center of Excellence at Fort Gregg-Adams.
In this capacity, he works to assess and improve the food for the entire U.S. Army in the battlefield environment.
He also continues to serve and give back to our community as the current president of the Nu Omicron Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, where he organizes service events in Petersburg and the surrounding areas.
He devotes his time to lecture Warrant Officers every year and young aspiring professionals at Virginia State University.
As we celebrate Veterans Day this weekend, I am proud to name Chief Warrant Officer Four Charles H. Talley, Jr. as Virginia's Fourth Congressional District Veteran of the year.
