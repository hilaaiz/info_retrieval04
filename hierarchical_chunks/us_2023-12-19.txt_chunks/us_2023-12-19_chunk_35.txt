Mr. POSEY.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to recognize Robert Cabana for his years of service in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Mr. Cabana is retiring at the end of this year after serving as the agency's associate administrator, making him the highest-ranking civil servant.
Robert Cabana acts as the agency's chief operating officer and manages more than 18,000 employees.
Before serving in his position, Mr. Cabana served as the director of NASA's John F. Kennedy Space Center in my district.
There, he oversaw all NASA facilities and activities at the spaceport.
Robert has spent countless years serving his country, graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1971 and commissioning as a second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Robert Cabana retired from the U.S. Marine Corps in September 2000 as a colonel.
Robert Cabana has recorded four space flights, logging a total of 38 days in Space.
Cabana was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame and named an Associate Fellow in the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and a Fellow in the Society.
He also received the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Presidential Distinguished Rank Award, and the National Space Club Florida Committee's Dr. Kurt H. Debus Award.
Col. Cabana is also a recipient of the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement's National Space Trophy.
I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in recognizing Col. Robert Cabana and his dedication to serving his country.
While he will be sorely missed, I would like to wish him well in his retirement.
