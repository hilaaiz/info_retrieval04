Mr. Branin, known to everyone in the community as Tommy, has represented thousands of community members--including me--over the last eight years with distinction--and with his beloved dog Newman, by his side.
He has been a strong advocate for growing Henrico's economy, increasing pedestrian and cyclist safety, and bringing Henrico together.
After his election to the Henrico County Board of Supervisors, Tommy became the first Henrico Supervisor to place crosswalks throughout the entirety of his district.
His focus on safety made it possible to install 14 miles of sidewalk in his communities--making it safer for pedestrians, runners, and bikers alike.
His focus on community building made it possible to bring pickleball courts, bike tracks, and cricket games to his district.
And his focus on the betterment of Henrico County drove his work to help facilitate the construction of two new high schools, replacing aging structures to provide Henrico students with a strong and healthy learning environment.
Tommy has proven to be a strong collaborator and leader.
He has worked hard with regional partners to connect Henrico County and has encouraged partnerships at all levels to provide his constituents with better parks and trails to promote healthy, active lifestyles.
Tommy has been a strong, passionate advocate for safety and his work to improve walkability throughout Henrico will continue to have a positive impact in the community.
