Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding academic accomplishments of a constituent from my district, Deborah Gym.
Deborah is a sophomore at Central Bucks South High School who regularly demonstrates a commitment to academic excellence, with this dedication culminating in her achieving a perfect score of 1520 on the Preliminary SAT (PSAT).
Deborah demonstrated a proficiency in various focuses of reading, including information and ideas, craft and structure, and expression of ideas, and mathematics, including a remarkable understanding of algebra, advanced mathematics, problemsolving and data analysis, and geometry and trigonometry.
Deborah's performance on the PSAT should serve as a testament to her character as an intelligent and motivated young woman.
I am encouraged by her motivation to perform incredibly in her academic career, and I am proud to represent such remarkable young people in my district.
It is my hope that, by Deborah's example, students throughout my district and throughout the country are encouraged to challenge themselves academically, and endeavor to strive for excellence in every facet of their lives.
Moreover, the example provided by young men and young women, like Deborah, should serve as inspiration to challenge ourselves and strive for excellence in every facet of our lives.
I would like to wish Deborah the best in her future endeavors, both academically and professionally, and once again congratulate her on her incredible performance on the PSAT.
