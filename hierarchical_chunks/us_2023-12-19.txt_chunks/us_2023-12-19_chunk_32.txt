Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Dana Nally, Principal of Bedford Elementary School, for being selected as the 2023 National Distinguished Principal in Iowa.
In her 16 years as Principal at Bedford Elementary, Principal Nally has touched the lives of countless children and faculty.
She has advocated for student wellbeing and academic growth, and worked to create a high-quality, student-first learning environment.
