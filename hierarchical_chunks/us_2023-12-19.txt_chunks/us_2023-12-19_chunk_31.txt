Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career and service of retiring Houdini Elementary School crossing guard, 
Ms. Cheryl Latza.
For 44 years, Cheryl has dedicated her time and efforts to protecting children throughout the Appleton School District at Houdini Elementary School.
Given Cheryl's kindness and sincere care, she became more than just a crossing guard for many students; she also became a friend.
Cheryl was the first hello in the morning and the last goodbye to students on their way home, something that families throughout the Appleton area are surely thankful for.
Cheryl exhibits the qualities of a true community leader, and I thank her for her continued service.
Her actions will be remembered for many years to come throughout the Appleton community.
Cheryl has dedicated decades of unwavering service to the Appleton community, and I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing her.
Goodbyes can be difficult, but I wish Cheryl the best in her welldeserved retirement.
