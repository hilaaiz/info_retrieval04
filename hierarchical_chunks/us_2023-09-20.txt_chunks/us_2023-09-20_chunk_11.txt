Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to posthumously honor the late Corporal Danny K. Allen for his valiant military service during the Vietnam War Era.
Drafted in 1970, Corporal Allen proudly served in the United States Army for 3 years, where he was assigned a tour of duty on the Korean peninsula.
He is survived by his loving daughter, Retha Allen; son, Andrew Allen; and 5 grandchildren, LeAnna, Maycan, Anaya, Clay, and Tayte.
As a devoted family man, his children remember him for his kindness and down-to-earth nature.
They fondly recall how attentive he was to his daughter, then only 13, when she was hospitalized for an entire month; how he would hike 3 miles through the wintry snow just to feed the livestock; and all the fun they shared on the family's one and only camping trip.
Corporal Allen was a man of few words, but his words carried weight and respect from all who knew him.
Please join me in thanking Corporal Danny K. Allen for his distinguished military service to the United States.
