Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of World War II veteran Lyle Tennis' honorable service to our Nation and to wish him a happy 100th birthday.
Lyle Tennis was born in Unity, Wisconsin on September 18, 1923, and resides in Racine, Wisconsin.
Lyle joined the United States Navy as a Lieutenant during World War II.
During his service in the Navy, his ship was the target of frequent and deadly Kamikaze attacks.
During an attack, Lyle saved his crewmates' lives by notifying the crew to abandon the ship before sinking and returning to the ship to rescue the remaining crew.
Lyle was awarded the distinguished Navy Cross for his heroic actions.
In addition to his Navy Cross, Lyle was awarded a Purple Heart, American Defense Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, WWII Victory Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Combat Action Ribbon, and the Navy Unit Commendation.
After WWII, Lyle served an additional 28 years in the Naval Reserves and had a career in education for 31 years.
Lyle Tennis is a genuine American hero.
On behalf of Wisconsin's First Congressional District, I am honored to wish Lyle Tennis a happy 100th birthday and recognize his distinguished service to our Nation.
