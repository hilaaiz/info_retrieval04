indicator of a man's heart and his generosity is consistency--and Michael is widely recognized as one of Arizona's most generous business leaders both in times of plenty and times of hardship.
I thank Michael for his tremendous example.
Michael's enduring legacy is one of inspiration, renewal, and compassion.
He has set new standards in his industry and his community, and he has made an immeasurable impact on the lives of countless Arizonans who work, shop, and live in the communities he has worked hard to reinvigorate.
On behalf of Arizona's 5th Congressional District, I thank Michael for inspiring others by his unwavering commitment to making our communities better than he found them--one development at a time.
