Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor a Lansing, Michigan-based institution that for 30 years has been dedicated to revitalizing communities across our great state and around the country.
Guided by the belief that every community needs affordable housing, job opportunities, high-quality healthcare, and childcare, Cinnaire has, since 1993, strategically invested in economically and racially marginalized communities that have historically been denied access to Capital.
As this vibrant non-profit organization celebrates its 30th anniversary, I applaud Cinnaire for the systemic change it is helping to bring about.
Armed with a dream and vision to change lives and transform struggling neighborhoods, Cinnaire's founder and CEO Mark McDaniel sat down in 1993 at a table with a phone and a Rolodex of names and contact information.
From those humble beginnings, he launched a new tax credit fund in Michigan, which over the past 3 decades has become a nearly $6 billion investment.
As a community development financial organization, Mark and his team, which has now grown to 130 dedicated employees, have found creative ways to leverage existing financial resources from public and private sector organizations to provide access to investment funding, lending options, and other services that support economic development in the communities they serve.
The result has been profound: since 1993, Cinnaire has supported more than 1,000 housing developments, provided more than 63,000 affordable apartments, and created or retained more than 92,000 jobs.
I have seen firsthand the transformative work Cinnaire is doing in Lansing, and I am so thankful for its commitment to systemic change and problem-solving.
I salute Cinnaire for a 30-year commitment to ensuring everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us, can lead lives of dignity and opportunity.
May the good work of this organization continue long into the future.
