Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Donald Woodfield.
Sadly, 
Mr. Woodfield passed away on September 3, 2023, at the age of 81.
Donald Woodfield was born in Buffalo, New York on November 24, 1941.
A lifelong patriot, 
Mr. Woodfield joined the U.S. Air Force, where he proudly served for 8 years, including during the Vietnam War.
Among his many awards were the Vietnam Service Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal and the National Defense Service Medal.
Shortly after leaving the military, he was called again to a life of serving others and he pursued his passion of being a teacher.
He served as an educator for over 30 years, both teaching and coaching at B'Nai Shalom, Ballinger Academy, Greensboro Day School in Greensboro, and finally The O'Neal School in Southern Pines.
