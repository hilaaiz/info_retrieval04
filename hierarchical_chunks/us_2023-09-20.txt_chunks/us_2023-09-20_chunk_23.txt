Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Lavinia Perkins Mathis on the occasion of her 100th birthday.
Born on September 24, 1923, in Jacksonville, Florida, 
Ms. Mathis is the proud daughter of Camilla Bolton Perkins, a Jacksonville elementary school teacher, and Daniel W. Perkins, a prominent lawyer in Jacksonville.
Ms. Mathis and her 2 sisters grew up in the Lavilla neighborhood of Jacksonville where she attended a wooden 2-story schoolhouse.
She graduated from Old Stanton High School in 1942.
