Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Vietnam Era veteran and Purple Heart Recipient, Haskel Joe Hill (1947 through 2022) for his distinguished service in the U.S. Army.
Hailing from Harriman, Tennessee, Haskel Hill served in the Army from October 1964 to October 1973.
He fought in Vietnam and was captured by enemy troops, being held as a prisoner of war.
His bravery and heroism during the conflict and throughout his capture earned him the Purple Heart.
Haskel Hill also received the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, awarded to him by the former government of South Vietnam, in recognition of his valor in combat with the enemy.
While he safely returned to America, he passed away due to complications resulting from exposure to Agent Orange during the conflict.
Haskel Hill is survived by his proud daughters, Ida L. Hendrix of Jacksonville, Florida, Helana J. Cormier of Green Cove Springs, Florida, and Alice Hill of Kingsport, Tennessee.
Vietnam Era veterans and their surviving family members deserve our deepest gratitude for their service and sacrifice, and it is long past due.
Please join me in remembering American hero and patriot, Haskel Hill for his strength, courage, and bravery.
We are eternally grateful to him and his valiant military service to our great country.
