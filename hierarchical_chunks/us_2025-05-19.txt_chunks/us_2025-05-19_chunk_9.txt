Mr. LUCAS.
Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong Oklahoman, Jimmy Emmons has spent years working around the state and across the country promoting innovative and voluntary conservation practices.
Having someone like Jimmy in a position to lead farm policy isn't just beneficial for Oklahoma, but the entire country and the world.
I am proud of my longtime friend and fellow Oklahoman for his willingness to serve the Nation at the Natural Resources Conservation Service and his commitment to the American farmer.
