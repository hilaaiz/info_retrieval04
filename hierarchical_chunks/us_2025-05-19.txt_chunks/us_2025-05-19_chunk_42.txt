Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, South Carolinians are grateful that the Kimberly-Clark Corporation is expanding within the Second District.
As a producer of personal care products, Kimberly-Clark produces well-known brands such as Cottonelle, Huggies, Kleenex, Scott, and more.
Since its establishment in 1968, the Beech Island facility, with the leadership of plant manager, Jeff Hutter, has grown to become the company's largest manufacturing site globally.
The planned addition of 1.1 million square feet in 2027 will further expand its capabilities and impact.
The $200 million investment will create more than 150 new jobs, strengthen the local economy, and enhance career opportunities across the state.
The expansion will also incorporate advanced robotics, artificial intelligence powered logistics systems, and high-density automated storage to improve operation efficiencies.
With a workforce of over 40,000 and a presence in more than 175 countries, Kimberly-Clark continues to demonstrate a commitment to innovation and growth.
I appreciate the dedication and leadership of President Russ Torres.
Best wishes to Kimberly-Clark for success in their future endeavors.
