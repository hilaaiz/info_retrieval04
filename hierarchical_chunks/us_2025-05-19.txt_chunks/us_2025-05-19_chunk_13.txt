Mr. Speaker, Mary Vollink exemplifies the spirit of selfless service that strengthens communities across Michigan's First District.
Her selection for the Distinguished Service Award is well deserved, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary Vollink on this outstanding achievement and thanking her for her decades of exemplary service to the people of Traverse City and Northern Michigan.
