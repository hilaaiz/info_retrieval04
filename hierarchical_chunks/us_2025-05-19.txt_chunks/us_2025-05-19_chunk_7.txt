Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and recognize the 1842 Buffalo Creek Treaty, a Landmark agreement that contributed to the history of Native Americans and the United States.
Signed in a partnership agreement between the United States and the Seneca Nation of Indians, the Buffalo Creek Treaty ensured that the culture and heritage of the Seneca Nation remains on their rightful land in the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations.
Signed nearly two centuries ago in Western New York, the Buffalo Creek Treaty reaffirmed the Seneca Nation's right to self-govern and protect their remaining land.
Seneca Nation leaders banded together, ensuring that the various nations of Western New York were not displaced and their culture allowed to survive--a significant victory for the Seneca people.
The unwavering dedication to their heritage and people ensures the well-being, sovereignty, and prosperity of future generations.
To this day, the Seneca Nation territory in Allegany and Cattaraugus counties are sovereign territories.
It is immensely important that the provisions of the Buffalo Creek Treaty continue to be recognized and followed, as it is a symbol of self determination and coexistence.
As we uphold the Buffalo Creek Treaty, we are continuously working toward mending and strengthening the ties between New York State and the Seneca Nation.
Today, as we celebrate 183 years of the 1842 Buffalo Creek Treaty, we look forward with hope for the future, but also acknowledgment of the past.
The Buffalo Creek Treaty is a promise of sovereignty and respect.
Please join me in recognizing and celebrating the Seneca Nation of Indians for their many contributions to Western New York and the United States.
