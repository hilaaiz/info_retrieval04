Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the remarkable 75-year legacy of Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU), an institution that has profoundly impacted the Mississippi Delta and the state of Mississippi as a whole.
Founded in 1950 as Mississippi Vocational College, MVSU began with a mission to train teachers for rural and elementary schools and to provide vocational training.
Over the decades, it has evolved into a comprehensive university offering a diverse range of undergraduate and graduate programs, including degrees in environmental health, criminal justice, business administration, and education.
MVSU's commitment to academic excellence and community service has remained steadfast throughout its history.
Under the leadership of its eighth and current president, Dr. Jerryl Briggs, Sr., MVSU continues to advance its mission with the mantra: ``ONE GOAL.
ONE TEAM.
ONE VALLEY... IN MOTION.''
The university has expanded its reach through off-campus centers such as the Greenwood Center and the Greenville Higher Learning Center, enhancing access to education in the Mississippi Delta.
As we commemorate this significant milestone, let us recognize the contributions of MVSU's students, faculty, alumni, and administration.
Their dedication and hard work have ensured that Mississippi Valley of State University remains a beacon of opportunity and a catalyst for positive change in our community.
