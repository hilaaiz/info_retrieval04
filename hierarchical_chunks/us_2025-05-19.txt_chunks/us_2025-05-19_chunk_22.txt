Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize and commend the emergency service personnel who responded to the March 9 plane crash in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.
On March 9, 2025, a small plane carrying five people crashed just outside of Lancaster Airport and into the parking lot of Brethren Village, a nearby retirement community in Manheim Township.
