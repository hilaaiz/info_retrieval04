Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life, service, and sacrifice of the brave men and women who served our great Nation.
Memorial Day is a holiday of reverence: a date set for us to come together as a Nation and ensure that we remember our debt of gratitude to those brave soldiers who gave their lives defending our country and freedoms.
On May 26, 2025--this Memorial Day--eighteen names will be added to the Clarence Veterans Memorial Honor Walls.
I am honored to include their names in the Record to be remembered and honored forever.
