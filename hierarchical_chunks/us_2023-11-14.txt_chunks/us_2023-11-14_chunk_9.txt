Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michael D. Cole upon his retirement from the United States Department of State after 22 years of service.
Mike embarked on his foreign service journey in 2001.
Since then, his service has extended from Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to U.S. Embassies and Consulates in Abuja, Bangkok, Budapest, Mumbai, San Salvador, and Vienna.
Mike assumed the role of Director of the Los Angeles Passport Agency in September 2020, facing head-on the arduous challenges and travel restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As international travel has resumed in the years since, Mike's leadership in Los Angeles was critical in the agency's return to pre-pandemic productivity, processing passports for nearly three-quarters of a million U.S. citizens during his time as Director.
In this position, Mike was a reliable, affable, and professional partner to my District Office as caseworkers processed passport casework brought to them by my constituents.
Mike and his team provided prompt and satisfactory guidance in navigating these often tricky and changing requests.
Mike's dedication to public service is further exemplified by his service in the Consular Corps, where he has utilized his experience and expertise to mentor the next generation.
His work to assist U.S. citizens during crises, offer support in disaster relief, aid bereaved families, and protect vulnerable children stand as a testament to his commitment to the American people domestically and abroad.
I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mike for his service to our constituents of the 39th Congressional District and our country, and I wish him a well-deserved retirement.
