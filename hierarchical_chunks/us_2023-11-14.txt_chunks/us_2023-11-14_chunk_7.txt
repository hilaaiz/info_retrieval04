Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant Blaine Klein of Josephine, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
Sergeant Klein honorably served in the United States Army during the Iraq War.
At the age of 18, Sergeant Klein followed his father's footsteps and enlisted in the Army in defense of our nation.
His duties took him across the continental U.S., and later to Iraq and Korea.
In Iraq, Sergeant Klein served as a Human Intelligence Collector and managed teams of intelligence sources to strengthen the Army's informational capabilities throughout the region.
In one instance, he saved the lives and helped bring them to safety at great personal risk.
For his distinguished service, he was bestowed the Army Commendation Medal, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, and many more awards.
After returning to civilian life, Sergeant Klein has continued to positively influence his community while overcoming his service-related disabilities.
He is no stranger to helping others.
On a number of occasions, Sergeant Klein has stopped to assist those involved in vehicle accidents or medical emergencies.
I commend him for continuing to be an upstanding role model for his community and family.
I am honored to represent Sergeant Klein in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas.
