Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Ron Sapp for his decades of dedication and service to Fernandina Beach.
Mayor Sapp's 24 years of civic service as Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Commissioner spanned four decades and displayed an unwavering commitment to bettering our hometown.
I was proud to serve alongside him on the Commission, as did my father.
Fernandina is proud of Ron Sapp not only because of his dedication to his community, but also for his military service as an Air Force veteran.
But no true biography of Ron would be complete without a chapter on 
Mr. Sapp--the teacher.
Mr. Sapp didn't just teach students what to think, he taught them how to think, and that is something special.
Generations of Pirates developed an in interest in--and love for--public service--and for that inspiration, we are grateful.
