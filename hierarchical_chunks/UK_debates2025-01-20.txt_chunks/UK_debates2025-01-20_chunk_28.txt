With permission, Mr Speaker, before I turn to Ukraine, I want to begin by welcoming the release of Emily Damari.
After 471 days of captivity, she has been brought home.
It was deeply moving to see the pictures of Emily and her mother Mandy reunited.
I pay tribute once again to all those who campaigned so tirelessly for this moment.
The Government will continue to work closely with our partners to secure the release of all the hostages, get aid into Gaza and see the deal implemented in full.
