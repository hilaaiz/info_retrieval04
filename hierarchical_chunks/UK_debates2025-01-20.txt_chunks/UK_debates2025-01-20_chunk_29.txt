With permission, Mr Speaker, I will now make a statement on Ukraine.
Last week, my right hon.
and learned Friend the Prime Minister visited Kyiv.
It was his seventh meeting with President Zelensky, but this visit had a special purpose: to sign a historic 100-year partnership with Ukraine.
The partnership enshrines both sides’ commitment to a relationship benefiting the whole of our nations: businesses as well as the Government, communities as well as our military.
It consists of a legally binding treaty and a political agreement outlining our co-operation in greater detail.
We will lay the treaty before this House for scrutiny in the usual way.
