I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s statement on this 100-year partnership with such an important European ally.
We absolutely understand how our futures are linked.
I want to recognise the Ukrainian community in Milton Keynes, which has established the Sunflower school and held the first Holodomor memorial event.
These communities are very worried.
They are coming to the renewal of their visas because they never thought that they would be here this long.
They have built new businesses, family connections, and friends and community connections.
Can we reassure Ukrainians in the UK that they will continue to have our support for the duration of the war, and potentially support afterwards for some of them to continue their lives here?
