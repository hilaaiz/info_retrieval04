I welcome the Prime Minister’s commitment last week to a 100-year partnership with Ukraine, and today I am thinking of those in Ukraine who have faced 35 months of continuous conflict since Russia’s illegal invasion in 2022.
I am also thinking of the many communities across the UK that have welcomed thousands of Ukrainian families since that time.
The courage and resilience of our Ukrainian guests has been matched by the solidarity and generosity of British communities.
Cross-party support for our ally Ukraine has been unwavering.
