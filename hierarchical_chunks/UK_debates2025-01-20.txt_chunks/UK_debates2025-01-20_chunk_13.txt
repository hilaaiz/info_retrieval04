My hon.
Friend makes a really important point about the impact on children and young people.
It is an absolute scandal that nearly 160,000 children are in temporary accommodation, and we are determined to ensure that the Government’s long-term strategy addresses the underlying issues affecting youth homelessness.
We are working with mayors, councils and key stakeholders, including in the charitable sector, to get us back on track to ending homelessness.
