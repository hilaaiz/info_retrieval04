I thank the Minister for his reassurance to leaseholders, but what message does he have for freeholders, such as the residents of the Wolds View development in Driffield, who are trapped at the mercy of an unaccountable management company?
Will he legislate to protect not just future homeowners but those currently stuck in these contracts?
