That was a very good question.
I reassure my hon.
Friend that the subject remains under active discussion with our colleagues, particularly in Europe.
We have made progress in relation to interest.
We recognise that more funds need to be found to keep Ukraine in the fight.
There are differences of opinion about the lawfulness and legality of doing this, and the implication for the markets particularly at this time.
Those discussions are live and active, and I was with the Weimar group of not just Foreign Ministers, because Prime Minister Meloni and Chancellor Scholz were there as well, discussing these very issues just before the Christmas break.
It is welcome to hear that this partnership agreement is a binding treaty.
As such, it contrasts with the Budapest memorandum, which was non-binding and not worth the paper it was written on.
There is a lot of talk about how Ukraine is on an irreversible path to NATO membership, but it will be difficult to get a consensus for that anytime soon among the 32 NATO members.
In lieu of NATO membership, what security guarantees might the UK seek to develop for Ukraine with European allies?
This is a very live issue.
As I said in my statement, we do not see Putin ready to halt his aggression and come to the table for serious negotiations, but just as this country has stood by Ukraine throughout, and provided very important intelligence in the run-up to this war, we will recognise our part in working with others on security guarantees.
