I welcome the Government’s tripling of the emergency housing budget, but one of my constituents is about to be made homeless because debt incurred as a teenager means that she is not eligible for social housing.
Are the Government willing to look at that?
I am sure that they do not think that debt should be a reason for homelessness.
