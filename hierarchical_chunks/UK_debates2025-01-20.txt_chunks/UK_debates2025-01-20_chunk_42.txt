I reassure Ukrainians in the strongest terms—I hope that they might see the 100-year partnership as a signal of this—that the UK will stand with them long after none of us are in this Chamber.
That is the nature of the partnership.
They should be reassured, and remember that war strikes indelible bonds; just as it did between us and the United States after the second world war, it will do so between us and Ukraine.
I am sure that the Foreign Secretary’s statement will be as welcome in Kyiv as it is in this House.
He referred to the 200,000 refugees in this country.
Further to the point that  the hon.
Member for Milton Keynes Central (Emily Darlington)  made, many of those people would like to return home, but home is a war zone, particularly in the east, and they cannot do so.
They therefore have children in school here, and have built lives here.
It would reassure them to know that they are safe and secure in the United Kingdom for not just the future but the immediate future, and will be able to be here for as long as it takes.
None of us knows when the war will complete, but across our constituencies we all recognise communities that continue to be here, coming out of other conflicts.
I am thinking of Kosovan communities, for example, which exist right across the country; I can think of a significant community in south London in particular.
Many Ukrainians want to return, and we should make it possible for them to do so, but in some areas there will have to be a lot of de-mining, let us face it, in order for them to go back to their homes.
Let us see where we get to at the end of the conflict.
