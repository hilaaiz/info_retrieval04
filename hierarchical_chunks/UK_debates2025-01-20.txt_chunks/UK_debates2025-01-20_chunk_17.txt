I thank my hon.
Friend and the many other MPs with whom I have had meetings to talk about devolution—at the last tally, about 140 one-to-one meetings with MPs have taken place, such is the interest being shown in devolution for the right reasons.
I am more than happy to continue those conversations and to welcome the local leadership being shown.
