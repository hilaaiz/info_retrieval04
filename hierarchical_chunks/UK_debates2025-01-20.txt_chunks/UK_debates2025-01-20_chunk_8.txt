I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his kind points.
I have a strong personal enthusiasm for Northern Ireland—its potential is huge.
I speak frequently to Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive and will continue to do so.
As part of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister’s reset of our relationship with the devolved Administrations, we meet them regularly and plan together so that our investments and their investments get the best value.
I will continue to do that, and I look forward to working with the hon.
Gentleman as well.
