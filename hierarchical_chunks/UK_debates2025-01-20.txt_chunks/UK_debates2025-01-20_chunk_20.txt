Does the Secretary of State agree that everyone should be treated equally and be seen to be treated equally before the law, including planning law?
I do not know where the shadow Secretary of State is going with this, but yes, I think people should be treated equally.
Great.
Why, then, is it that the Secretary of State, the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister have all intervened in the planning application for the Chinese super-embassy, overriding the wishes and concerns of local residents, the local planning authority, the Metropolitan police, the security services and, most likely, the incoming US President?
These are live issues, but the security of our country and nation always comes foremost, and that is always what this Government think of first.
Constituents of mine in High Green were told that a social housing repair project for their home would take 12 weeks.
The project has now been ongoing for 64 weeks, with contractors leaving the works in a disgraceful condition.
I welcome the Government’s boost to the building of more social housing and the extra £350,000 of homelessness funding announced for Sheffield this week.
How does the Minister plan to empower local authorities to ensure that contractors deliver social house building and repairs to a high standard and on time?
All social housing tenants deserve to live in decent homes, to be treated with fairness and respect and to have their problems quickly resolved.
Under the Regulator of Social Housing’s safety and quality standard, housing associations and councils must provide an effective, efficient and timely repair service for their homes, including setting timetables for completion and clearly communicating with residents.
As my hon.
Friend knows, we will also introduce Awaab’s law and a new decent homes standard to set the minimum quality that social homes must meet.
