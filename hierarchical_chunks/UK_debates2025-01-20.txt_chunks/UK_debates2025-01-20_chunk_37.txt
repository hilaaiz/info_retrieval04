I welcome the Prime Minister’s tour of Ukraine and eastern Europe last week, but it leaves some questions that I now put to the Foreign Secretary.
What new actions and investments will the UK take to support security in Europe?
How will the UK demonstrate the strengthened leadership in the joint expeditionary force that our European partners expect?
And did the Prime Minister raise with our allies the support expressed by Members across this House for mobilising the frozen Russian assets held in the UK and Europe to support our Ukrainian allies?
