Mr. HERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a very special veteran from Oklahoma's First Congressional District, U.S. Army Air Forces Corporal, Ralph M. Simoni.
Born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on July 6, 1923, Cpl.
Simoni is celebrating his 100th birthday today.
In 1943, Cpl.
Simoni began serving our Nation during World War II at one of the most consequential moments in human history.
He bravely served in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater of the war from 1943 to 1946 and received a Victory Medal for doing his part to secure Victory Over Japan Day, better known as ``V-J Day'', that marked the end of the war on September 2, 1945.
Cpl.
Simoni served as an airplane propeller mechanic in the pioneering 4th Glider Section of the U.S. Army Air Forces.
Cpl.
Simoni's work helped U.S. glider aircraft drop paratroopers and light artillery into enemy territory.
Glider missions were dangerous and designed for a single purpose that resulted in very few of the aircraft ever being recovered.
Cpl.
Simoni and the 4th Glider Section conducted several successful missions in New Guinea, Luzon, and the South Philippines liberation campaigns of World War II.
Cpl.
Simoni now lives in my hometown of Tulsa and is deservedly being recognized today as the precious American hero that he is by his friends and family.
Following the recent celebration of Independence Day, it is my honor to thank Cpl.
Simoni on behalf of a grateful Nation for his remarkable military service and wish him a very happy birthday.
