NABI brings together thousands of students each year to compete, but its legacy goes far beyond the basketball court.
NABI inspires our youth through education and empowerment programs that instill the values of being a good teammate, friend, and citizen.
This minority and women-led organization has created opportunities for Native American athletes to shine at the collegiate and professional levels.
NABI's advocacy on and off the courts has resulted in nearly half a million dollars in scholarships for youth through its College Scholarship Fund--breaking down barriers to allow students to pursue their highest ambitions.
I thank the NABI founders GinaMarie Scarpa and Mark West, its community partners and those involved in this commendable endeavor.
Our community is stronger because of them.
I am confident that their passion and service will continue to empower and inspire generations to come.
