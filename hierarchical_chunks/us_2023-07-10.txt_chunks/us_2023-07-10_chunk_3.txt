Mrs. Huff is known for many things and one of them is her pineapplecoconut cakes, her gift giving spirit that she shows to all, and hosting the best Christmas parties and cookouts for her entire family.
She is also known for her sharp sense of style, with the hats, furs, and suits to match her signature Obama purses and Cadillac.
Above all else, Willie Ann Huff is a brave fighter, surviving multiple bouts with cancer.
I hereby take official note of the joyous occasion of 
Mrs. Willie Ann Huff's 90th Birthday and invite all citizens to join me in wishing her the happiest of birthdays.
