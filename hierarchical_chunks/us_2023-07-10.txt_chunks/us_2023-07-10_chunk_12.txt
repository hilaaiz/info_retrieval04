Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Restroom Access Act of 2023, which would require retail establishments to provide individuals with medical conditions requiring immediate use of a restroom, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, access to employee-only restrooms when such establishments do not have public restrooms.
Individuals would have to present a Department of Laborissued identification card certifying such a medical condition.
Individuals with certain medical conditions need immediate access to a restroom.
When public restrooms are not available, these individuals may experience uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
As long as there are no safety concerns, which this bill addresses, these individuals should be able to use employee-only restrooms.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
