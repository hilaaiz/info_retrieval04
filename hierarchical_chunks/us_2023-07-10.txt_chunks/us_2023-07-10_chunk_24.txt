Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Rappahannock High School Girls Tennis Team for capping off their undefeated season with the VHSL Class 1 State Championship.
On June 8th, the Raiders ended their season on a high note.
At the Burrows-Burleson Tennis Center at Virginia Tech, each member of the Rappahannock High School Girls Tennis Team had high level performances, defeating George Wythe 5-3.
Leading up to the title match, the team had a 5-1 win over Buffalo Gap in the state semifinals and a 5-0 win over Riverheads in the state quarterfinals.
I would like to recognize Head Coach 
Ms. Taylor Yeatman for her great leadership throughout the season.
Next, I would like to recognize the student-athletes themselves for their hard work: Mackenzie Ferguson, Layla Gaines, Haley Haydon, Ciera Mundie, Sadie Packett, Virginia Trible, Averil Vaughan, Addison Vaughn, Laney Williams, and Maggie Wonderling.
And finally, I would like to recognize the assistant coaches: Mr. Jamie Pritchard and 
Mr. Jackie Morris.
