Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the service of one of the New Democrat Coalition's most exceptional staffers, Kevin Klinkenberg.
Kevin recently left the Coalition to begin his tenure as a Senior Advisor and Congressional Liaison at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
I can truly say that HHS and all Americans are lucky to have him in this role.
In his 2 years with the Coalition, including my tenure as Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Kevin proved himself to be an invaluable asset who shaped our policy work and outreach efforts.
From health care and trade to immigration, Kevin's work was exemplary.
We would not have been able to accomplish all that we have without Kevin's presence on our team.
Kevin also led the New Dems' outreach work, forming critical relationships with important stakeholder groups, from labor to the business community.
His commitment to expanding the reach of the New Dems has positively impacted each of our nearly 100 members, including me, and his work will continue to benefit the Coalition long after his departure.
Kevin has not only contributed to the Coalition through his superb work but also through
