Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the Native American Basketball Invitational on 20 years of commitment to youth empowerment and fostering athletic talent within Native American communities.
Since 2003, NABI has been the largest and most prestigious all Native American Basketball tournament in the nation, cultivating the spirit of competition and camaraderie among our youth.
