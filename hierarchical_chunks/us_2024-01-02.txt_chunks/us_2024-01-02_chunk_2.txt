Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the many contributions of Sherri Sager, SVP and Chief Government Relations Officer at Stanford Medicine's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH) at Stanford.
After over 29 years of outstanding service with LPCH, Sherri has retired.
Our community is grateful to her for her many years of advocacy and dedication to making our government's healthcare system work better for our most vulnerable patients and their families.
During her time at LPCH, Sherri organized and managed the government relations program, monitored proposed laws and public policy that could impact the Hospital, and oversaw the community partnerships and volunteer services departments.
She served on numerous nonprofit boards and statewide task forces and was recognized for her knowledge of public policy, especially related to healthcare, organizing ability, and political acumen.
Sherri believed that we could work to keep kids from having to come to the hospital in the first place by investing in improving the health of all children in the community.
