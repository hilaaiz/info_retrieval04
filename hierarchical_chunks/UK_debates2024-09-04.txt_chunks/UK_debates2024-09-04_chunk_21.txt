I welcome the Secretary of State to his position.
We watched him for many lonely years as he held the fort on his own.
He was always outnumbered, but never outgunned.
Will he now use the full firepower of the Scotland Office to convince Cabinet colleagues and industry players of the vital role and potential of the Arnish fabrication yard in Stornoway and its sister yard in Methil, both of which are coming up for sale as part of the going to market of Harland & Wolff?
Will  he assure workers at the Arnish yard and at Stornoway port that they will play a big role in the renewables future and in GB Energy?
