I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I am really sorry to hear of the difficulties facing Mitsubishi Electric’s workforce, and of the uncertainty those workers face during this difficult time.
I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend for his efforts to support the workers in his constituency, and we have talked about this issue already.
I will commit as a matter of priority to a meeting with the company and its workforce in the coming weeks.
