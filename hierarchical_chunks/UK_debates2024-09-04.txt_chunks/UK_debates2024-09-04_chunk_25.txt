May I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place and congratulate him on winning his seat?
The Foreign Secretary is sitting two seats along from me, and I am sure that he will have heard what the hon.
Gentleman said.
I am sure that the issue is a concern to everyone in the House, and we will make sure that a written response is given to the hon.
Gentleman as soon as possible.
