I thank my hon.
Friend and congratulate him on his wonderful victory in Glasgow North.
Scotland’s 19 world-class higher education institutions are an essential part of our economy, culture and global reputation, and they are paramount to the successful delivery of our missions.
We punch well above our weight in Scotland, which is something that we need to protect and nurture.
By the end of next week, I will have met the principals of all of Scotland’s universities.
I want to deepen and strengthen those relationships, and I believe that the knowledge and expertise of those institutions will be crucial to delivering a new industrial strategy and the goals of this new Government.
