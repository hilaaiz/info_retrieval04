I thank my hon.
Friend and congratulate him on winning Coatbridge and Bellshill.
Scotland and its world-class industrial workforce will play a driving role in our ambition to become a green energy powerhouse in this country.
For example, my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Scottish Government and I met representatives of Petroineos earlier this week to discuss what support can be provided to ensure a sustainable future for the industrial clusters in the wider Falkirk and Grangemouth region, which is crucial to the entirety of Scotland and the UK.
That includes our commitment to fund Project Willow with the Scottish Government.
