I, too, welcome the Secretary of State to his new position and congratulate him on his appointment to what I can tell him is a splendid job to hold in government.
On an industrial strategy, will he focus his ministerial colleagues’ minds on the potential development of tidal stream generation?
That provides an enormous opportunity for our manufacturing sector to create a supply chain that is based here in the United Kingdom, rather than having to bring capacity from overseas.
I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman and congratulate him on his role when he was in the Scotland Office.
We hope to emulate much of the work that he did.
I have met the European Marine Energy Centre and those involved with tidal resources in his constituency.
This is critically important to our net zero ambitions and in getting to clean power by 2030.
I am due to meet them when I visit his constituency in the coming weeks, and I will make sure that this is top of the agenda.
