What discussions he has had with the Scottish Government on steps to help promote economic growth in Scotland.
I am committed to working with the Scottish Government and have already met the Deputy First Minister four times in eight weeks.
Resetting the relationship between Scotland’s two Governments is crucial to driving economic growth.
Just last week, my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in Glasgow and met the First Minister.
The Prime Minister has made resetting the relationship a key part of his new way of working in government.
He has met with the First Minister to have those discussions and with members of the business community to discuss growing the Scottish economy.
It is the choice of all of us to grow the Scottish economy and something we all need to do together.
