Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise to recognize the exceptional work of the Urban League of Broward County on its 50th Anniversary.
The National Urban League is a historic civil rights organization dedicated to elevating the standard of living in historically underserved urban communities.
The Urban League of Broward County was founded in 1975 as an affiliate of the National Urban League, and since then, this community-based organization has been dedicated to empowering communities and changing lives.
The League helps communities in need gain power and independence by promoting civil rights, economic self-reliance, and social equality.
They offer programs in education, job training, housing, and entrepreneurship to empower residents.
The League helps our community achieve these goals through a variety of programming--from their Summer Enrichment Program, which offers students the opportunity to create, discover, and learn, to ADVANCE-U, which offers a full range of essential economic resources for residents to help them succeed in the workforce, stabilize their finances and build assets.
The Urban League of Broward County's commitment to the health and wellness of Broward's families is extensive and impressive.
And the pivotal role it plays for South Florida families is invaluable.
I am grateful to the leadership and staff for their tireless efforts to fight for the rights of my constituents and all Americans to live with freedom, dignity, and prosperity.
I thank President and CEO, Dr. Germaine Smith-Baugh, and everyone at the Urban League of Broward County for improving the lives of those in Florida's 25th Congressional District and across Broward County.
I congratulate them on 50 remarkable years.
