Mr. RUIZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the marriage of Alexandra Heller and Joshua Narciso.
It is with profound joy and admiration that I extend my heartfelt congratulations to them on this special occasion.
Their wedding day is not only a celebration of their love but also the beginning of a journey built on partnership, resilience, and shared purpose--their own love story, written in real time.
I have had the privilege of watching Alexandra grow both personally and professionally during her time in my office.
I have seen firsthand the determination and resilience she brings to every challenge and the compassion and thoughtfulness with which she approaches each task.
She has consistently shown an unwavering commitment to serving others, and I could not be prouder of the leader and the person she has become.
Truly, she has shown us all what it means to be fearless.
I will always remember the pivotal moments she helped us achieve together.
Her dedication and persistence were instrumental in advancing the designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, ensuring the protection of our desert lands for future generations.
She also contributed greatly to the passage of the PACT Act, landmark legislation that delivers long-overdue health care and justice to our Nation's veterans.
These accomplishments are historic--proof that she has always had the courage to speak now and fight for what matters.
What has impressed me most, however, is not only her professional success, but also her strength of character.
She lifts others up, she brings people together, and she embodies a spirit of service and compassion that is rare and deeply inspiring.
These are the same qualities that will sustain her in marriage--the kind of love that makes every day feel like daylight.
I also want to share a bit about how Alexandra and Joshua's story began.
On their first three dates, Joshua playfully ``swept Alexandra off her feet'' with what sounded like a whirlwind world tour to Barcelona, France, and Italy.
In reality, the story is just as charming: they first met at a restaurant called Barcelona, then attended a wine event at the French Embassy, followed by a holiday party at the Italian Embassy.
When the world shut down, Joshua showed up at Alexandra's apartment with a suitcase... and never left.
It seems they knew then that they were enchanted to meet each other.
Marriage, like public service, is rooted in trust, resilience, and love.
It is about showing up for one another through both triumphs and challenges, through sunshine and midnights, and walking forward together.
The compassion, joy, and strength she brings will help build a solid foundation for her and Joshua.
I am excited to see the life they will create together, grounded in respect, laughter, and shared vision.
May their marriage continue to inspire, bringing joy to themselves and those around them.
As they start this new chapter, may they cherish the small moments as much as the milestones.
May they celebrate laughter, lean on compassion in tough times, and nurture a love that grows deeper with each year.
Just as her service has touched many lives, her partnership will be a reminder to us all that ``You Belong With Me'' isn't just a lyric, it is a promise.
It is a true honor to witness this day and to celebrate their union.
Please know that they carry with them not only my warmest congratulations but also my deepest admiration and pride.
May their marriage be blessed with health, happiness, and a love that truly never goes out of style.
