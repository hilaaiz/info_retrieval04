Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Mrs. Katie Blount for her steadfast commitment to preserving the heritage of Mississippi and for her outstanding service to our communities.
Her leadership has endured that future generations will better understand and appreciate the rich and complex history of our state.
