Mr. LANGWORTHY.
I rise today to solemnly honor the courage and sacrifice of the correctional officers and civilian employees who lost their lives at Attica Correctional Facility during the prison riot 54 years ago this week.
The events that began on September 9, 1971, represent one of the most tragic chapters in our state's history and serve as a solemn reminder of the extraordinary risks borne by those who serve behind prison walls.
These men and women went to work that day committed to doing their duty--protecting their colleagues, maintaining order, and serving the public good.
Their lives were cut short in an instant of violence, but their legacy endures.
Today, we formally recognize and honor their memory.
Their sacrifice stands as a testament to the professionalism and courage of the thousands of correctional officers and civilian staff who serve every day under challenging and often dangerous circumstances.
We owe these fallen heroes our deepest gratitude.
May their names be remembered, their service honored, and their families comforted in knowing their loved ones' sacrifices will never be forgotten.
I ask that the United States House of Representatives join me in paying tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice at Attica Correctional Facility and in recognizing the ongoing commitment of our Nation's correctional workforce.
