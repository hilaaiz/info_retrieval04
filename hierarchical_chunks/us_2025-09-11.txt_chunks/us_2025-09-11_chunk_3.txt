Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and global leadership of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.
He is the spiritual leader of more than 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and a tireless advocate for peace, human rights, and interfaith dialogue.
As the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, recognized as the senior primate of the Orthodox Christian world, His All-Holiness has dedicated more than three decades to advancing religious freedom, protecting our planet, and fostering understanding across faiths and nations.
This month, he visits Washington, D.C., following his acceptance of the prestigious Templeton Prize in New York City, joining the ranks of past recipients such as Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Throughout his tenure, Patriarch Bartholomew has met with presidents, popes, and parliaments across the globe, including multiple visits to the White House and the United States Congress.
He has worked courageously to defend religious liberty despite ongoing challenges in his native Turkey.
His commitment to peace and reconciliation, despite significant challenges, embodies the highest ideals of global religious leadership.
Known also as ``the Green Patriarch,'' His All-Holiness has been a pioneering voice on environmental issues, organizing international interfaith summits to confront climate change and ecological degradation as spiritual and moral imperatives.
His leadership has inspired generations to see care for the Earth as a sacred responsibility.
