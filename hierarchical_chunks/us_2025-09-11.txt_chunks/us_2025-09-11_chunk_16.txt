Mr. SCHNEIDER.
Mr. Speaker, though I was present on the floor, I missed Roll Call vote No. 246, on Congresswoman Mace's Amendment No. 14 to the defense authorization bill.
I intended to and would have voted no.
This amendment cruelly denies transgender service members access to gender-affirming medical care through TRICARE.
Every sailor in our Navy begins at Naval Station Great Lakes in my district, and they deserve the best care this country can provide.
To deny them that care is to betray their service and lose our moral compass.
