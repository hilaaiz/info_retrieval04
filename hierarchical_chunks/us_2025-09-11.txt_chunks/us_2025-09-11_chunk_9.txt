Ms. CROCKETT.
Mr. Speaker, it brings me great joy to congratulate Pastor Stephen ``Chuck'' Nash, Jr. on celebrating five years of pastorship and ministry at the Mount Horeb-Belt Line Baptist Church in Lancaster, Texas.
What began with an answered call by father and son has grown and flourished into a vast congregation between two locations.
Pastor Nash, Jr.'s steadfast leadership has provided his congregation a place of peace and support in North Texas.
A Dallas native, Pastor Nash.
Jr. began as an assistant youth pastor after graduating from Booker T. High School of the Engineering Professions in Houston.
He earned his degree in Religion with a minor in Social Work from Texas College in Tyler.
Together, he and his father, Dr. Nash, founded Mount Horeb Missionary Baptist Church-DeSoto, later expanding to Lancaster, offering spiritual guidance to the communities of DeSoto, Lancaster, and Cedar Hill.
With honors like Young Minister of the Year and his role as Assistant General Secretary of the Baptist Missionary and Education Convention, Pastor Stephen Nash, Jr, has proven himself a dedicated leader to the North Texas community.
Being entrusted with caring for God's children is no easy feat.
It is evident that the leadership of Pastor Nash, Jr. is God-fearing and operates with a community-focused mindset through weekly services and the Horeb Student Ministry.
I thank him for his selflessness and for doing the work to care for the constituents of the 30th Congressional District.
I congratulate him again on five years of ministry.
