Mrs. Blount began her career at Mississippi Department of Archives and history in 1994 as a public relations coordinator and steadily rose through the ranks.
She served as assistant to the director for communication, working under former directors Elbert R. Hilliard and H. T. Holmes.
In 2015, she was appointed as the agency's seventh director, becoming only the second woman to lead MDAH since its founding on 1902.
Over the course of more than three decades of service, 
Mrs. Blount has provided steadfast leadership and vision, culmination in her announced retirement effective June 30, 2026.
Under her stewardship, MDAH has grown into a nationally recognized institution.
Mrs. Blount guided the creation of the Two Mississippi Museums, preserving and sharing the diverse storIes of our state, and she championed the public engagement that supported adoption of Mississippi's new state flag.
She also worked tirelessly to strengthen relationships with Tribal partners through repatriation and advanced preservation projects across the state, including the new Vicksburg Civil War Visitor Center, the stabilization of Windsor Ruins, enhancements at the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians, and the development of Margaret Ann Crigler Park in Jackson.
Her vision for inclusive storytelling reshaped programming and interpretation at MDAH, ensuring that the voices and histories of all Mississippians are represented.
Earlier this year, the American Association for State and Local History honored 
Mrs. Blount with a Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing her extraordinary dedication to public history.
