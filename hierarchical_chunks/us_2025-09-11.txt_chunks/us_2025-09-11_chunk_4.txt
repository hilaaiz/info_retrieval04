Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing His AllHoliness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew for his profound contributions to global peace, interreligious cooperation, and the advancement of human dignity.
His presence in our Nation's capital is a powerful reminder of the vital role that faith leaders play in building a more just, compassionate, and united world.
