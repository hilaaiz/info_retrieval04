Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and celebrating the courageous men and women who came together--from volunteers to first responders--to help their neighbors and provide support to one another as they fought to contain the Quaker Run fire.
Their unwavering commitment to helping their community during this time in Congress.
