Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Supervisor Keith Carson, who has represented the 5th District on the Alameda County Board of Supervisors since 1992.
Supervisor Carson has been a fearless leader in Alameda County, fighting for access to health care, improving business retention, addressing the scarcity of jobs in our communities, and ending poverty and homelessness.
He approaches his role as Supervisor with the goal of creating a more inclusive and accessible government for the people of Alameda County.
