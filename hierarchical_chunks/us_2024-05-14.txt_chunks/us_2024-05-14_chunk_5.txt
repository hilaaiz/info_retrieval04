Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Mary Yvonne Myers, a beloved wife, mother, and grandmother, and cherished Oakland community member.
She was born on October 29, 1937, in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as the eldest child to parents James Calvin and Nancy Stewart Slaughter.
Mary, later known as `Yvonne' moved from Mississippi to San Diego, California in 1953 with her family.
Her family flourished in their business ventures and elite social circles in California.
In San Diego, Yvonne was mentored by her Aunt Mae, who was part of a group of African American entrepreneurs and community leaders in the area.
After completing her high school education at San Diego High School, Yvonne and her family moved to Northern California in 1959.
Yvonne began a fellowship with the Faith Chapel Church of God in Christ, where she met Minister Levi Young.
They were married in August of 1961, and had three wonderful children together, along with Levi's son from a previous union.
Through this marriage, Yvonne developed a love for ministry as she walked in the office of First Lady of the Revelation Church.
Under the leadership of her husband and pastor she was licensed as a Missionary in the Church of God in Christ, and as the First Lady, Yvonne mentored many young women as they began their Christian journey.
As the Executive Administrator of Charles Harrison Mason Bible College, Yvonne ensured that students were successful in their quest to get a deeper understanding of the Word.
In the late 70s, Yvonne and Levi amicably took separate directions in life, dissolving their union.
Yvonne remained very involved in Christian churches and continued to mentor young women in the church.
In the late 1980s, Yvonne met the love of her life Reverend Clayton Myers, Jr.
In July of 1989 the two were united in holy matrimony, a match truly made in heaven.
Together, they led the auxiliary ministry of Evergreen's senior living facility, The JL Richards Terrace.
