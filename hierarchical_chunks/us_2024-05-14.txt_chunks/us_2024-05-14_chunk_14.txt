Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr Speaker, I rise to recognize the Madison County community for its valiant and courageous spirit.
On October 24, 2023, Madison County first responders began the difficult task of containing the Quaker Run fire.
The following day, Madison County declared a local emergency after the fire continued to burn and eventually spread into Shenandoah National Park.
As the fire continued to grow and weather conditions continued to work against first responders, it was inspiring to watch local residents and volunteers come together--soon, local news stations and articles began to highlight these efforts and the contributions made by these brave individuals who assisted first responders in navigating the steep and difficult terrain to contain the fire.
Unreliable cellphone service added to the uncertainty.
In response to this, Verizon provided a mobile site for emergency personnel to use to facilitate and coordinate communication.
It also allowed the Virginia Department of Forestry to generate maps on site that proved useful in helping organize the efforts on the ground to contain the fire.
In the face of adversity, the community came together to protect neighboring areas
