I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that important point.
I will certainly write to the Secretary of State, and to other Secretaries of State who will have an interest, to ensure that they have heard what he said.
I recently visited Birmingham to show support to the Jewish community there in the wake of some of the attacks that they were having to endure.
I was struck by the fact that the local Muslim community had come over to the Hebrew centre to show support, to condemn Hamas, and to stand with the Jewish community in the wake of those attacks.
When I inquired why they had done that, they told me that as well as being the right thing to do, in the wake of 9/11, when the Muslim community had come under attack and been associated— wrongly—with those terrorist atrocities, the Jewish community came and stood between them and an angry mob, to protect them.
What is often lost in the recent scenes we have seen is the decades of quiet work between different faith communities who all believe in the same God.
