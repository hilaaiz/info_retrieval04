I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this point.
I think standing charges should get scrutiny from this House.
I know that many hon.
and right hon.
Members will have concerns in all parts of the UK about fairness and how some charges are being applied.
I will make sure that the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero has heard what the hon.
Gentleman has said.
I am sure that, if he were to apply for a debate, it would be well attended.
