I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that issue.
He has great experience in this area.
He is right, and I think the view was expressed well last night that in calling for a ceasefire, what people have been asking is for Israel to deviate from its duty to protect its citizens and defend itself.
If Israel puts down its arms, it ceases to exist.
That is the situation now, and only the end of Hamas, or whatever might try to take their place, and a long-term solution that guarantees peace, will enable it to do that.
That is very important.
We have a proud track record of protecting international humanitarian law and protecting citizens.
We monitor closely what goes on not just with this situation but with others, including the attention to detail and care that Israel is taking in ensuring that it is the right side of that line.
My right hon.
Friend will know that on recent operations, the Israeli Defence Forces will have had humanitarian and medical professionals embedded in its forces to ensure that that happens.
I repeat what I said at the start of this question: whatever hon.
Members decide to do in this place, based on their conscience, they should be allowed to do it.
We can all take care of each other in this place when hon.
Members, inevitably and sadly, come under threat for doing so.
