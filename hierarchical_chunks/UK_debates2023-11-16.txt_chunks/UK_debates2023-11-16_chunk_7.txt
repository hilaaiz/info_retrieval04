I thank the Minister for his response.
The terrible weather conditions in the last three or four weeks has had an impact on the horse- racing sector.
The races at Down Royal, on the edge of my constituency, were cancelled because the flooding was of biblical proportions.
Horseracing is very important to my constituents, and many people are involved in it.
That had an impact on their ability to attend.
Has the Minister had discussions with other Departments to ensure that any help that can be given to the horseracing sector for those races that were lost is given?
