I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important point.
He is correct that it is now clear that hospitals and other civilian places have been used by Hamas.
That is not news: a 2015 report by Amnesty International alleges that the Shifa Hospital has served  as a Hamas interrogation and torture centre for some time.
To reassure the House, Members will know that the Israel Defence Forces are doing a huge amount and taking great care with regard to civilian lives, as they do the very difficult job of clearing these areas out and trying to destroy Hamas and their network.
The IDF transferred incubators, baby food and additional medical supplies to hospital compounds, and on Sunday they opened up additional humanitarian corridors from various hospitals for civilians and patients to evacuate—on foot if they could, or via ambulance—to the south.
