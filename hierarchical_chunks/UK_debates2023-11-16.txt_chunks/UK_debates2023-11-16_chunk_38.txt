I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this matter, which I know is a concern for many Members across the House.
We have given the police new and updated powers, and we will continue to look at what further support they can be given to tackle this appalling situation.
There can be absolutely no tolerance for anyone who facilitates or supports terrorism—that is very clear, and I think that view is shared on all sides of this House, even if some Members sometimes find it hard to articulate it.
