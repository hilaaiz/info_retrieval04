I thank my hon.
Friend for his answer.
It is the 20th anniversary of MusicShare, which started in Lichfield.
Over 150 schools are engaged each year.
I went to the anniversary concert in Lichfield cathedral last Saturday and saw “Noye’s Fludde”, which was written by Benjamin Britten.
It was a spectacular occasion, with all the schoolchildren taking part.
What more could Lichfield do to advise other cathedrals on how it ought to be done?
