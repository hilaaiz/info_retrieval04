The House and my right hon.
Friend will know of my personal and political interest in residential leasehold reform.
When might the leasehold and freehold reform Bill come to the House, and will she join me in giving more publicity to the consultation, “Modern leasehold: restricting rents on existing leases”, which started a week ago and will last for another five weeks?
The ground rent issue affects up to 6 million households.
Most people do not know that the Government are considering five alternatives for restricting it.
Will she help to publicise that, and say when the Bill might be introduced so that the House can consider the issue?
My hon.
Friend, who is very experienced, has already provided a solution to one part of his question by getting that on the record and advertising it to all hon.
Members.
I will certainly ensure that the Secretary of State has heard of his particular interest.
He will not be surprised to hear me say that further business will be announced in the usual way, but I shall endeavour to ensure that he is kept informed by the Department of progress on the Bill.
