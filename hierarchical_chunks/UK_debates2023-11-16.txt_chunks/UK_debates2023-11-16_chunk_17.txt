I thank my hon.
Friend and the cathedral chapter at Lichfield for their warm welcome on my recent visit, which I greatly enjoyed.
The Lichfield cathedral summer school is indeed an inspiration to the wider Church in supporting children, many of whom are on free school meals, to socialise and learn before the new school year begins.
It has expanded with county council support and the Government’s holiday activities and food programme, and it would like to operate throughout the school holidays.
I warmly commend it.
