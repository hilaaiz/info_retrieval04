I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising this important matter.
It is quite right that Members of Parliament and their staff should be able to go about their business in safety and security, and should not be disrupted in doing so.
Mr Speaker was particularly concerned about this even prior to yesterday’s incidents, and has been working with Palace security and other organisations to ensure the safety of Members of Parliament in particular.
Since the Deputy Speaker is in the Chair, I shall make sure that Mr Speaker has heard my right hon.
Friend’s concerns, and I will ask that my right hon.
Friend be kept informed of progress on such matters.
