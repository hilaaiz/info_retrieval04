As the Leader of the House may be aware, I am co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for access to medical cannabis under prescription.
Currently, young Teagan Appleby, who is a constituent of  the hon.
Member for Dover (Mrs Elphicke) , is in hospital in London and very poorly.
The former Minister made every effort in his role to break down the barriers for medicinal cannabis under prescription to children with epilepsy.
Will the Leader of the House please urge the new Minister to call a roundtable of all the stakeholders, so that those children can get the medicine they deserve?
