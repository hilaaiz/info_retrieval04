I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this important point.
I am sure he has met the Home Secretary about his first point.
If he has not to date, I would encourage him to do so.
I am sure that if we were to hold a debate on this matter, it would be very well attended.
I would like to use Government time to bring forward further legislation that enables us to get the Rwanda scheme working, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman would support that.
He will know that the Minister for Immigration has announced the closure of the first wave of asylum hotels.
I do not know if any of those are in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, but he will know that that is the first tranche of several.
