I understand my hon.
Friend’s concerns.
It is really important that football comes to a deal in relation to distributions.
I support him in encouraging the football associations to do so, and I continue to urge them to reach an agreement in that area.
Although our preference is a football-led solution, given the importance of distributions to financial sustainability, the independent football regulator will have targeted statutory powers to intervene on financial distributions as a last resort, if necessary.
If football fails to deliver a solution, the regulator will deliver one.
Like many people across the House, I love football—I always have done.
It is more than just a game; it is the social fabric that runs through communities, and it can make our weekends or break them—but enough about United’s current form.
The England manager, Gareth Southgate, has warned that the regulator is “another VAR waiting to happen”, with the Government possibly looking to solve complicated questions with simple answers.
Will the Secretary of State explain how we will get this right, and will she ensure that the regulator is implemented swiftly, so that more clubs do not go the way of Bury in the meantime?
I understand the hon.
Member’s concerns: Bury has suffered in the past, as have many other clubs across the country.
That is why we are bringing in a  regulator.
I have had a number of conversations with the leagues, my parliamentary colleagues and fans to make sure that we get the regulation right.
We committed in our manifesto to bring forward a fan-led review White Paper.
We have done so, and we are at a very advanced stage, having announced the football governance Bill in the King’s Speech.
I note that Labour did nothing in its 13 years in office.
