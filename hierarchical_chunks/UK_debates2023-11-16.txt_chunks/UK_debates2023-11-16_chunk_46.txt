I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Madam Deputy Speaker was smiling at me to remind me, I think, of my responsibilities.
I cannot ask  the other place to change its scrutiny arrangements: it is responsible for those.
However, my hon.
Friend makes a good point about economy of effort, and I will certainly be able to make sure that the Lords has heard what she has said today.
I hope that a way forward can be found that is in the interests of both Chambers.
