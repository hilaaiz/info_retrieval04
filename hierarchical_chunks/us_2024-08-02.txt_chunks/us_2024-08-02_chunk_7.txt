Mr. WEBER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a remarkable couple who have been pillars of our community in Friendswood, Texas.
The Glines Family, as some of the earliest residents of our beloved town, have left an indelible mark on the fabric of our society.
Billy and Jackie Glines share a love story that reads like a fairytale.
They met in 1957, and it wasn't long before sparks flew.
Their first date in July of that year set the stage for a lifelong romance.
By late October, Billy was called to serve our great country.
Knowing he had found his soulmate, Billy was determined to marry Jackie before someone else did, for he knew he would ``never find another girl like her.''
On Christmas leave from basic training, Billy and Jackie had a quaint ceremony on December 23, 1957.
Their love was tested early on, as Billy soon departed for Germany to serve as an Advanced Weapons Support Commander.
Their bond only grew stronger over the miles and years.
In November 1960, they welcomed their first child, Kimberly, followed by Britt in April 1964.
Kimberly and her husband, Stan, have two children, while Britt and his wife, Shannon, have three.
The Glines family legacy continues to thrive through these wonderful families.
Billy's career journey led him to establish the Mustang Auto Shop with his brother-in-law, a business that remains in operation today, serving the Friendswood community.
Jackie, after initially working at a weight loss facility, found her calling as a secretary at Accident Insurance Company from 1958 to 1960.
She paused her career to raise her children, then dedicated 30 years as a beloved school secretary at her son's elementary school.
Last Christmas, Billy and Jackie celebrated 67 years of enduring love and commitment.
Their contributions to Friendswood are immeasurable, and their story is an inspiration to us all.
