Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable career and dedicated service of 
Mr. Farris ``Carlos'' Hill, a pillar of our Ninety Six, South Carolina community, as he retires from the Department of the Air Force.
Carlos' journey is a testament to dedication, perseverance, and commendable service to our Nation both in uniform and as a civilian leader.
Born in 1964 to a working-class family in Greenwood, South Carolina, he learned the values of hard work and determination from a young age.
Notably, he attended the first integrated first grade class in our state, an experience that undoubtedly shaped his character and resilience.
Following his graduation from Ninety Six High School in 1982, Carlos, fueled by his work ethic, secured an Air Force ROTC scholarship to Clemson University.
This marked the start of his lifelong dedication to our Nation.
Earning a degree in Civil Engineering in 1986, he embarked on a distinguished military career.
His assignments spanned Chanute AFB, Mather AFB, and Dyess AFB, where he excelled as an aircraft maintenance officer.
He further served as an Assistant Professor of Aerospace Studies at Rutgers and Princeton Universities, inspiring future Air Force leaders.
Transitioning to the Air Force Reserve after nine years of active duty service, Carlos balanced his military responsibilities with a successful civilian career at General Electric.
His unwavering commitment extended to deployments in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
During his second mobilization, he sought opportunities to further his military career through the Air Force Legislative Fellowship Program.
This prestigious program allowed Carlos to work closely with congressional members and staff, providing him with invaluable legislative experience and insights that would shape his future career in legislative affairs.
In 2013, Carlos assumed the crucial role of Mobilization Assistant to the Director of Legislative Liaison at the Pentagon, while concurrently serving as the Director of Air Force Reserve Policy Integration in a civilian capacity.
He became a vital bridge between the Air Force and Congress, securing vital resources and advocating for both the active force and Reserves.
His promotion to Brigadier General in 2015 was a fitting culmination of his outstanding military career.
Retiring from the Reserve in 2019, Carlos remained dedicated to his civilian role, shaping policies as Director of Air Force Reserve Policy Integration at the Pentagon.
Here, he continued to serve with distinction, shaping policies that directly impacted the lives and careers of thousands.
Carlos' civilian tenure was marked by his unwavering commitment to improving the operational readiness and quality of life for Airmen.
He was instrumental in identifying and resolving issues affecting the Air Force Reserve, developing legislative strategies, and coordinating with Congress on significant policy matters.
His efforts included formulating Air Force Reserve strategic goals, managing policy initiatives, and maintaining liaison with Congressional Defense Committee Chairs and a wide range of other members.
He also ensured that Air Force senior leaders were fully prepared for Congressional testimonies and engagements, significantly contributing to the successful navigation of complex legislative landscapes.
Beyond his military and government service, Carlos has remained deeply involved with Clemson University where he actively serves on the Alumni Association Board.
His dedication to mentoring and supporting students, especially those in the ROTC program, has left a lasting impact.
Carlos frequently returns to Clemson to speak with and mentor current students, including Air Force ROTC cadets.
In recognition of his significant contributions, Carlos was honored with the Clemson University Distinguished Service Award in 2023, highlighting his exceptional service and commitment to the university and its community.
As Carlos embarks on a well-deserved retirement, I extend my deepest gratitude for his unwavering commitment.
His exemplary service has been a true inspiration for future generations.
