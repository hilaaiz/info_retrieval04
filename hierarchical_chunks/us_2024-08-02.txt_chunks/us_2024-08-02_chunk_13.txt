Mr. Speaker, Felix Fraga was a tireless champion for justice and a better life for all, and he never ceased to smile even through his final days.
He put hope over hunger, care over cynicism, and people over politics.
Our prayers are with his wife, Nelly, his brother, Tom; his sons, Carlos and Bolivar; and his bright grandchildren, Nicolas, Damian, and Amanda.
