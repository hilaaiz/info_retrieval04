Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to the legacy of the legendary Juan Jose ``Johnny'' Canales, who passed away on June 12, 2024.
Johnny was a cultural icon whose influence on the Latino community, particularly in South Texas, is uncontested.
Beyond Johnny's beloved music and television host careers, he was a beacon of hope and inspiration for countless aspiring Hispanics and Latinos.
Canales was born in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and raised in Robstown, Texas.
He's best remembered today for his groundbreaking bilingual variety show, The `Johnny Canales Show.'
This show began in 1983 in Corpus Christi and provided an unprecedented stage for Tejano and Latino artists when such opportunities were scarce.
It became a vital part of the cultural fabric of South Texas and beyond, showcasing emerging talents and giving them a chance to shine.
Johnny's enthusiastic support of young artists helped launch numerous careers, fostering a sense of pride and accomplishment within the Latino community.
His catchphrase, ``You got it!
Take it away!''
symbolized encouragement and empowerment.
His show was more than entertainment; it celebrated Latino culture and identity.
Beyond his contributions to music, Johnny served in the Army and was an avid supporter of civil rights and veterans' issues.
During his three years of active-duty service, he formed the foundation of his advocacy for the troops and veterans, a dedication that made him a cherished community figure.
Despite facing health challenges later in life, Johnny continued influencing and uplifting his community.
Alongside his wife, Nora, he returned to television with ``El Show de Johnny y Nora Canales,'' ensuring that the voices of Latino artists remained heard and celebrated.
Johnny is survived by his two daughters, Nora Seleste Canales and Miroslava Canales.
