Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize PointBank as it celebrates the 140th anniversary of its founding.
I'm honored to congratulate PointBank on reaching such a significant milestone.
As an independent bank located in Denton County, PointBank has served North Texas since its founding in 1884.
Over the last 140 years, PointBank has expanded across Denton County, providing locally owned, full-service, community banking.
It is an honor to recognize the dedicated and steadfast service that they have provided to Denton County citizens and businesses over the past 140 years.
After James Pierson fulfilled his vision in 1853 of establishing the town of Pilot Point, he and other residents realized they needed a bank to serve their hometown's needs.
Less than 40 years after the organization of Denton County, the Pilot Point Bank opened its doors in 1884, serving as the forerunner of PointBank.
Just eight years later, on July 13, 1892, the bank received its charter as Pilot Point National Bank.
On November 15, 1995, more than 100 years after its founding, Pilot Point Bank shortened its name to PointBank, as it is currently known today.
Since its inception, PointBank has had seven presidents and the bank's ownership has been passed down through multiple families.
In 1981, 
Mr. J. Raymond David, Sr. became President of the bank and served in that role until 2004 when he was succeeded by his son, 
Mr. Ray David, Jr.
Today, PointBank serves their Denton County customers from their nine bank locations in Argyle, Denton, Lewisville, Little Elm, Flower Mound, the Lake Cities, and its first location in Aubrey.
PointBank has exciting plans for future growth and expansion to additional North Texas communities.
Since its founding, PointBank has remained a locally owned, independent Denton County based bank that knows the area and the people that they serve, taking pride in being a ``people bank.''
I stand here today to celebrate with the David family and their employees, looking back at an exemplary 140 years of service to our community and looking ahead to many more years to come.
