Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the military service of Sergeant Irby ``Corky'' Dyer III.
He served during the Vietnam War as a member of the U.S. Army's elite Green Berets.
Sergeant Dyer is a native Texan born in Sweetwater--where my father was born--on December 6, 1943.
He grew up and attended public school in Midland.
Sergeant Dyer went on to attend Schreiner Institute in Kerrville.
He graduated from Schreiner's military preparation program in 1961.
Four years later, he married Bonnie K. Little.
They have one daughter together, Deborah Denise.
Before enlisting in the military, Sergeant Dyer attended college in Odessa and later at the University of Texas at Austin.
He trained as an Army medic and eventually became a member of the 5th Special Forces Group, Detachment B-52 under Project DELTA.
Their top-secret assignments brought Sergeant Dyer into dangerous situations in Vietnam and neighboring countries.
While conducting Operation Hawkeye in December 1966, Sergeant Dyer and his fellow soldiers were shot down in a helicopter over Laos.
This occurred one and a half miles west of the Demilitarized Zone.
As a result, Sergeant Dyer was declared missing in action and his body has not been recovered.
He has been awarded a Purple Heart, the Bronze Star with V device, and other commendations.
Schreiner University in Kerrville will be honoring Sergeant Dyer in September, and I am honored to recognize Sergeant Dyer for his heroism and honorable service to our country.
May all those who serve our Nation know how grateful we are for their dedication to securing the blessings of liberty.
May God bless Sergeant Dyer and his loved ones, and may God bless America.
