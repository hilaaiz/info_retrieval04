Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the dangerous issue of deepfake pornography, which is incredibly destructive and can have life-altering impacts on its victims.
Almost 96 percent of all deepfakes online are pornographic in nature, and nearly every single one targets women.
It takes no special knowledge or technical expertise to create these images, and more women are being targeted each and every day.
High school students, young girls who should be worried about their homework, not whether a classmate is using their image to make an explicit video that has the potential to do serious and irreparable harm.
Deepfakes are abhorrent, and the developers of these systems should be held liable.
I've introduced legislation to bring strong criminal and civil penalties against those who create them.
I urge my colleagues to join me in demonstrating our shared commitment to fighting the dangerous misuse of artificial intelligence.
