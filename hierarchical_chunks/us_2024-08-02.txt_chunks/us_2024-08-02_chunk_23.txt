his final year on his plantation at Mount Vernon; and Whereas, the Star Democrat--originally the Republican Star--was a staunch supporter of Jeffersonian democracy and the ideas of The Honorable Thomas Jefferson; and Whereas, the newspaper's original philosophy of individual liberty, local autonomy and limited central government continues to this day; and Whereas, the Star Democrat has seen the Nation survive and live through numerous wars and conflicts with its offices twice destroyed in fires and once wrecked by a mob of vandals, while one of its editors arrested and exiled by Federal troops during the Civil War; and Whereas, on August 21, 2024, the Star Democrat will celebrate its 225th anniversary of publication.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andy Harris, Member of Congress, do hereby proclaim and celebrate The Star Democrat for its role and service to the Maryland community and our country on its 225th anniversary.
