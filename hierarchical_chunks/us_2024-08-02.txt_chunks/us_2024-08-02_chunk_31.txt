Mr. CROW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th Annual Taste of Ethiopia and its organizers.
The Taste of Ethiopia is an annual event that highlights the culture and community service of many in Colorado's Ethiopian immigrant community.
Colorado families of all backgrounds attend this event to experience Ethiopian culture, music, food, art, crafts, games, and dance.
Organizers and volunteers share these vibrant facets of their lives with the community, and attendees embrace and learn about the many ways the Ethiopian diaspora community enriches our district.
My district has one of the largest Ethiopian populations in the State of Colorado, a characteristic that I consider among our strengths.
I have had the privilege of attending the Taste of Ethiopia several times over the last ten years, and I know firsthand how meaningful this event is to our community.
It is an honor to be included in this celebration.
I recognize the leadership of the Taste of Ethiopia's organizers, the contributions of Ethiopian individuals, families, and organizations, and the support of volunteers and our community who make this one of the district's popular annual events.
