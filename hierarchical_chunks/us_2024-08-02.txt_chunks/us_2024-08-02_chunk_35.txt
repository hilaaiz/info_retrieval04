Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Memphis and national rock 'n' roll legend Jimi Jamison as we approach the 10th anniversary of his death in 2014.
Mr. Jamison is best known as the frontman of the band Survivor and for hits that placed him at the top ``I'm Always Here,'' the theme song for the television series ``Baywatch,'' and performed ``Burning Heart'' with Survivor for the film ``Rocky IV,'' but is best known in Memphis for his performances of ``Eye of the Tiger'' at University of Memphis Tigers sporting events.
Born in Durant, Mississippi, he moved as an infant to Memphis and considered our city his home.
In 2022, a stretch of Highland Street between Central and Southern avenues was named Jimi Jamison Street.
Acclaimed for his rich vocal skills, Jimi Jamison will be long remembered for his contributions to American music.
I join his many fans and friends in remembering him as we near the September 1 tenth anniversary of his passing.
