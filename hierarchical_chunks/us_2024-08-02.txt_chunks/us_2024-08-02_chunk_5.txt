As we celebrate these significant milestones, I'm pleased to recognize another individual who has contributed to strengthening the diplomatic and cultural ties between our nations.
I extend my heartfelt appreciation and recognition to 
Mr. Sribhongse Bunnag, who has rendered invaluable service to my constituents and my office this year in his capacity as a Foreign Affairs Fellow.
Through 
Mr. Bunnag's diligence and compassion, we have gained a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Thai people's rich culture, history, and aspirations.
But perhaps most importantly, we have gained a dear friend.
As we look ahead, I am confident that the enduring friendship between our two nations will continue to prosper and grow as we rise together to meet the challenges of tomorrow.
Today, I extend to His Majesty King Rama X of Thailand my sincerest best wishes for his good health, happiness, and long life.
