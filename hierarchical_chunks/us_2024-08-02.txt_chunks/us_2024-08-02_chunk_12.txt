Ms. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a friend and a hero of the East End, Felix Z. Fraga, who passed away last week at the age of 94.
Born one day after the market crash on Black Tuesday, Felix's life was defined by his fight to end poverty in all its forms.
Growing up in the East End, one of Felix's foundational memories at the start of the Depression was going to the Rusk Settlement House, a community center, for a daily meal.
But the Rusk House, and later Ripley House would become so much more than a place for food.
In 1946, at the age of 16, Felix started as a youth social worker at Rusk, in what would become his life's calling.
The first in his family to graduate from high school and college, and later graduate school for social work, Felix went on to lead Ripley House for two decades as director from 1970 to 1990.
I still remember walking into Ripley House in 1972, when I first arrived in Houston, a young social worker ready to save the world.
I went there looking for a job--that's when I met Felix and we were friends ever since.
We fought many battles together--hunger, homelessness, redistricting, poverty-- you name it, Felix was there.
Felix was always a public servant, but he didn't seek out politics.
In 1990, it was the public who chose him to be their champion, to be their voice.
And champion them he did, 
Mr. Speaker.
He would serve on the Houston Independent School District School Board and then on the Houston City Council, always fighting to uplift Latinos, and building for a better day.
