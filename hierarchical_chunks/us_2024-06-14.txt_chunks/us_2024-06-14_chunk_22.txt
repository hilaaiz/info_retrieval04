Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce the bipartisan Eid Day Act, which would create a federal holiday for Eid.
I thank Rep. Grace Meng and my other House colleagues that joined me to support this bill.
Eid al-Adha is an Islamic holiday which commemorates Abraham's symbolic sacrifice of his son to God, as referenced in the Quran, Old Testament, and New Testament.
Eid al-Adha also marks the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, called Hajj.
Eid al-Fitr is an Islamic holiday which commemorates the sighting of the new moon, signifying a monthlong end to fasting and reflection for all Muslim followers.
Eid is a holiday of great importance to over 3.5 million American Muslims.
Whether it be in the military, government, health, business or other leadership positions, Muslim Americans have always contributed to our country.
Eid is a meaningful occasion for the Muslim community to reflect and celebrate on the importance of faith, sacrifice, freedom, and justice--the same values that all Americans hold dear.
This year, Eid al-Adha will be celebrated on June 16th.
We must continually strive to create a more inclusive nation and honor the diverse tapestry that makes up this country.
Muslim Americans have meaningfully contributed to the American society since the nation's early history.
They cherish American values, take pride in the country's pluralism, multiculturalism, and its embodiment as the land of liberty and opportunity.
Recognizing Eid as a Federal Holiday will allow them to not only freely practice their faith, but also help them feel more at home and connect better with America's spirit as a religious minority.
This bill is particularly timely given the alienation that parts of the Muslim American community feel after years of anti-Muslim sentiments as well as recent developments in the Middle-East.
As Members of Congress, we need to uphold the values that our nation was founded on, including freedom of religion and equality for all.
