Ms. MALLIOTAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to include in the Record the following Proclamation honoring the Black Angels of Staten Island:
Whereas Staten Island Sea View Hospital opened in 1913 specifically to treat patients with Tuberculosis and, at its peak, Sea View Hospital saw nearly 2,000 patients and was one of only four municipal hospitals in New York City that did not discriminate against Black nurses; Whereas the Black Angels, as they are known, were courageous, dedicated, and bold in answering the call to come to Sea View and risk their lives caring for the grievously sick and ``indigent consumptives'' of New York City, who had been banished to this woefully understaffed sanatorium; Whereas the Black Angels' caring demeanor, and years of expertise played a significant role in the first ever human trials of Isoniazid, the first drug to cure tuberculosis.
Since its discovery in 1952, tens of millions of lives have been saved; Whereas the Black Angels were activists and active members of the NAACP, neighborhood churches, and community groups, and became founding members of the Lincoln Hospital Alumni Association, the Urban League Guild, and the Women's Civic and Political Union.
They were fierce advocates for the integration of Black nurses into the U.S. military and American Nurses Association, and in New York City they worked toward desegregating the hospital system; and Whereas the people of Staten Island are grateful for the years of service by all the Black Angels who selflessly served on the front lines at Sea View Hospital to treat tuberculosis patients.
