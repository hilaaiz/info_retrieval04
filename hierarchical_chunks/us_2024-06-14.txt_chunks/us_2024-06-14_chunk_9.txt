Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and honor the Tuskegee Airmen as we celebrate their 83rd anniversary.
As the United States fought to defend freedom with our allies in World War II, exceptional pilots in the fight for air superiority made the difference between victory and defeat.
The Tuskegee Airmen stand out in history, as they not only had to carry the immeasurable weight of battle, but also had to fight racial discrimination.
Prior to the Tuskegee Airmen's incorporation in 1941, the military was segregated, and the Army Air Forces did not accept African American pilots.
In the face of this discrimination, these brave men stood up when their country and the world needed them most.
They flew with skill and courage on critical missions, demonstrating that excellence knows no color, and that discrimination had no place in our military.
The Tuskegee Airmen were among the most talented and decorated squadrons of World War II, earning 3 Presidential Unit Citations, 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 1 Legion of Merit, 1 Silver Star, 2 Soldier Medals, 8 Purple Hearts, 14 bronze stars, 744 air medals, and 1 Red Star of Yugoslavia.
Their heroism, bravery, and remarkable achievements contributed directly to the desegregation of the United States Military.
On Saturday, May 25, 2024, veterans, officials, airmen, and their decedents gathered at Wings of Eagles Discovery Center to remember these amazing heroes and commemorate their significance nationally and their deep local ties to our community here in the Finger Lakes, Southern Tier, and Western New York.
Their story will forever serve as a symbol of courage in the face of adversity.
On Memorial Day and every day, we thank the men and women in uniform who have sacrificed so much so that we may live free.
We owe them a debt of gratitude that cannot be repaid, both for defending our Nation's freedoms and advancing them for generations to come.
