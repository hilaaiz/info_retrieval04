Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Clair Rotary Club and the occasion of their 100th anniversary.
Since its founding on April 22, 1924, the St. Clair Rotary Club has served as an emblematic example of the Rotary's motto, ``Service Above Self.''
Throughout the last century, the St. Clair Rotary Club has focused on a lot of community projects benefitting the St. Clair community.
Notably, during the 1930s, the club began a student assistance program, helping high school graduates work towards higher education.
In 1964, the club started the ``Preparation for Employment'' program with St. Clair High School and soon after in 1965, the ``Seminars for Tomorrows Leaders'' which continues to this day.
The club has managed to preserve their accomplishments and history at the St. Clair Historical Museum, dating back to its founding in 1924.
Their team has a remarkable devotion not only to the improvement of the St. Clair Community, but the preservation of the club's rich history.
More recently, the club has also notably raised over $150,000 for the St. Clair Little League Park, donated 32 Chromebooks to the St. Clair High School, and led efforts for community spaces throughout St. Clair.
As the club celebrates its centennial, it continues to make a difference through projects like the Storybook Walk in Klecha Park and the renovation of Rotary's Wildlife Landing.
