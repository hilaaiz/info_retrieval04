Mr. Lecik has presented to numerous audiences such as retirement groups (City of Chicago, Cook County Courts system, and AFSCME), case managers, caseworkers, and advocates from every area of the state.
During his career at SHIP and has attended and spoken at national conferences, the Age + Action conference, and has worked with legislators to bring Medicare/Medicaid education to beneficiaries in many local areas of the state.
He has worked closely with Social Security outreach staff, liaisons with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the state agency--Healthcare and Family Services.
Dave is known throughout the country for his knowledge and expertise with SHIP.
He never steers away from a challenge, and he sticks with an issue until it is solved to a successful end.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I thank David Lecik for all the work he has done for the citizens.
We are so grateful for his invaluable service and wish him the best of everything in his future endeavors.
