careful to maintain the organizational commitment to democratic selfgovernance within each house, which has empowered generations of Oxford House residents to navigate the inevitable obstacles of life with persistence and patience.
After his recovery, Paul and his wife, Jane, decided to remarry, and enjoyed another 34 years together.
When he passed away two years ago, Paul left behind not only his beloved Jane but his five children and eight grandchildren.
He is sorely missed, but his legacy of good humor and incomparable compassion lives on among his family and Oxford House family.
I join the people of Maryland's beautiful Eighth District and people across the United States in expressing the warmest gratitude for Paul's work as we celebrate his life.
