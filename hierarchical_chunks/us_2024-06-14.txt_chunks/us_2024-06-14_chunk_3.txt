Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the Arnold Volunteer Engine Company No. 2 on its 100th anniversary.
The Arnold Volunteer Engine Company No. 2 held its first meeting at Arnold High School on May 12, 1924.
Shortly afterward, Westmoreland County granted the company an official charter on June 14, 1924.
It's 17 founding members dedicated their lives and work to the people of the Allegheny-Kiski Valley.
Company No. 2 quickly became a pillar in its southwestern Pennsylvania community.
The company constructed its first fire hall in 1928, which is still in use today.
Additionally, the firefighters, efforts to engage with the community extended beyond protecting citizens and responding to emergencies.
In 1949, they built a clubhouse for members, their families, and the community to gather and socialize.
Due to continued outreach and service, they assumed the responsibility of transporting Santa Claus through Arnold, Pennsylvania, during the annual Christmas parade.
This tradition continues today.
Over the past hundred years, Company No. 2 operated with professionalism, speed, and dedication.
After a destructive fire took the lives of three first responders in 1995, the firefighters began training in rapid intervention tactics and protocols.
Company No. 2 still provides this rapid intervention training to fire companies around the Allegheny-Kiski Valley area.
The volunteer firefighters of Company No. 2 remain focused on sharing their expertise and working with other fire companies to ensure all first responders are trained and ready to respond to emergencies effectively.
There are 42 active members of the Arnold Volunteer Engine Company No. 2.
Notably, five charter members of the inaugural Junior Firefighter Program are celebrating 50 years of volunteer service.
I want to thank and honor James Duncan, Donald Ferrante, Joseph Puet, John Tort, Jr., and William Weber for their devotion to the people of southwestern Pennsylvania.
