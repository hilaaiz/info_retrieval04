Mr. TRONE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and celebrate the remarkable tenure of Hood College President, Andrea E. Chapdelaine.
For nine years, Dr. Chapdelaine has dedicated her career to the advancement of higher education, enriching the lives of students and bolstering local communities throughout her career.
Under her leadership, Hood College experienced growth in both undergraduate and graduate enrollment and improvement in student retention.
Dr. Chapdelaine spearheaded the completion of the strategic plan, ``Moving Together Beyond Boundaries,'' which introduced new academic programs, expanded strategic partnerships, and enhanced employee compensation.
She oversaw nearly $100 million in campus investments, including major renovations and new construction, led the successful ``Forging the Future'' campaign, and raised nearly $75 million for scholarships, experiential learning, and the Hood Fund.
Her tenure also saw the receipt of a historic $54 million gift from The Hodson Trust, marking the largest donation in Hood College's history.
It is a privilege to acknowledge Dr. Andrea E. Chapdelaine's service and support for higher education.
Her legacy will undoubtedly inspire future leaders and continue to benefit Hood College students and the broader community for years to come.
