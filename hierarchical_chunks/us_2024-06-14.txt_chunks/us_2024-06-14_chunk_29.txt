Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished career.
After 37 years of dedicated service in state government, 12 of which were spent working with the Illinois Department on Aging's Senior Health Insurance Program, 
Mr. Lecik will be retiring as Education Specialist and technical expert on Medicare and Medicaid, and he will be missed by many.
