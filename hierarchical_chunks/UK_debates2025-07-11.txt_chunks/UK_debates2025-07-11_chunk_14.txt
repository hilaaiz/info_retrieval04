The Minister will go through the amendments in turn, so I will focus on three key ones.
The review of orphan drugs was one of the hardest-fought things in the negotiations with the Department and charities, but we found a point that we could all agree on.
I appreciate that the hon.
Member wants it to go further, and perhaps we could speculate about the outcome and better prepare for it, but it is much awaited by the charities and they are grateful for it.
I do not want to speak on their behalf, but that is what I have heard from them.
That covers amendments 1 and 2.
Amendment 5 is about the definition of a rare cancer, which is an aspect of the Bill that I have not spoken about in any great detail, so it is worth touching on here.
The Bill sets the definition of a rare cancer in  statute and aligns it with the definition of a rare disease, which is a useful simplification.
In future, let us hope that some conditions fall out of that “rare” specification and need less emphasis, and let us also hope that people in the Department look at the treatments that are being developed inside and outside the UK.
It is right that there should be a bit of flexibility at the edges of what the Department considers a rare cancer.
The timeline of the review is three years.
Again, we spent a great deal of time talking about that.
For some while, it was going to be much longer than three years, and all of us want it to be much shorter, but that was the compromise we reached—it was like “Goldilocks and the Three Bears”.
We reached that compromise together, so I urge the hon.
Member to respect our negotiations on that issue.
I hear what the hon.
Member is saying, but why does the impact assessment say that the costs are for staff for only one year?
If the review will take three years, why are the staff funded for only one?
