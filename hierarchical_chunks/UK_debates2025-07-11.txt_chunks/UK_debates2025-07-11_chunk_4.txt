It is absolutely essential that the Bill explicitly covers both attempted and successful unauthorised entry.
We have seen widespread issues involving ticketless fans at football matches attempting to force entry and tailgate at high-profile matches, including the 2024 champions league final, premier league fixtures and at the Euro 2020 tournament.
These forms of attempted entry place significant demands on stadium safety and security personnel and, at times, require police intervention.
Maintaining provisions for attempted unauthorised entry ensures that law enforcement can act before a breach occurs and thus maintain safety and security at football matches across the country.
It also enables the imposition of preventive football banning orders against persons involved in attempted entry.
Banning orders are an effective deterrent against those who may seek to compromise public safety.
I turn to amendment 6.
The Bill is designed to allow the measures to come into force by regulation on a date shortly before the start of the domestic football season.
This approach will ensure that all organisations involved in safety and security operations are prepared to implement the new offence.
A fixed date two months after Royal Assent may not coincide with the football calendar or allow sufficient time for training, communication and co-ordination.
I therefore respectfully ask the hon.
Member for Christchurch to withdraw his amendments.
