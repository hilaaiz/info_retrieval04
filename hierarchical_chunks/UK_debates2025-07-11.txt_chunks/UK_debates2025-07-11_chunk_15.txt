I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
Of course, the review will not start on day one after passing the Bill.
It will take time to get up and running.
The existing workload of those staff members will have to be reallocated, and I hope and expect there to be some initial engagement with the sector—both charities and pharmaceutical companies—so a bit of flexibility is required.
To be honest, I would love more money to be spent on that review so that we can get more depth and it can have a greater impact.
I am sure other hon.
Members present would agree.
