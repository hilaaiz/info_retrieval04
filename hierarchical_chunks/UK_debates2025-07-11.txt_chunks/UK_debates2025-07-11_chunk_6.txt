I thank  the hon.
Member for Amber Valley (Linsey Farnsworth)  for bringing the Bill forward.
For many in this Chamber, the Euro 2020 final was a rollercoaster of ecstasy and disappointment, though I appreciate that certain Members from other parts of our United Kingdom may have felt a little less devastated at the result.
Beyond heartbreak on the pitch, the Euro 2020 final was a day that nearly ended in catastrophe.
Thousands of ticketless fans forced their way into Wembley, creating chaotic and dangerous scenes.
When disaster is so narrowly avoided, it is reasonable to ask whether anybody made a mistake.
