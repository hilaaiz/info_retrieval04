I thank  the hon.
Member for Amber Valley (Linsey Farnsworth)  for bringing the Bill forward and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Christchurch (Sir Christopher Chope)  for his amendments.
At this stage, is it correct that you wish us to speak only to the amendment, Mr Speaker?
[Interruption.]
Yes.
We the Opposition have nothing further to add to the debate that we have had this morning.
