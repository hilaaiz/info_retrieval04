I thank  the hon.
Member for Christchurch (Sir Christopher Chope)  for tabling these amendments, which propose two changes.
First, amendments 1 to 5 would remove attempted unauthorised entry from the scope of the offence.
Secondly, amendment 6 would bring the Act into force two months after it receives Royal Assent, rather than by commencement regulations made by statutory instrument.
