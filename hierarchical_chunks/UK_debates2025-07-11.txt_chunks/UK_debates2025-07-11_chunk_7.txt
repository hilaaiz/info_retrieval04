Sadly, this was not a one-off incident.
Tailgating was reported again at both the 2024 champions league final and the 2025 league cup final.
Of the 91 arrests made on that day, 68 were related to fraud—people trying to get in without a ticket.
We heard from  the hon.
Member for Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch (Katrina Murray)  about a particularly upsetting and fatal day.
These incidents put genuine fans at risk and erode the trust that is necessary to police events of this scale properly.
For many people in this country, a trip to the football is the highlight of their year.
For many families, it is a hard-earned outing or rare treat for their children—something they scrimp and save for.
What must they think when they see hooligans jump the barriers and get in for free?
They must think that they are the mugs for having paid and followed the rules in the first place.
It is therefore right that we give police and organisers the tools they need, not just to remove people in the moment but to prevent repeat offences through banning orders.
That builds on steps taken by the previous Government that saw drug-related offences in football stadiums likewise result in stadium bans.
