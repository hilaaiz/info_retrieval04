wasn't right, and, in 1968, she hired her very first woman bartender and served a woman seated at her bar--her own adult daughter, in fact.
The Kentucky Alcohol Beverage Control Board came down hard and fast, incensed not only that she was breaking the law but also that she openly advertised her rulebreaking in the hope that other bar owners would join her fight, but no one did.
Though the ABC shut her down and took her liquor license, Dixie did not give up the fight.
Found guilty of violating the antiquated state law, Dixie appealed her sentence and brought her case to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, who decided in her favor in 1972, calling the law ``invidious and arbitrary.''
Her quiet revolution behind the counter became a landmark victory for women's rights in the commonwealth and across the country.
At 100 years old, when asked why she decided to take her bold stand, Dixie remembered: ``I said this is ridiculous, I'm going to change that, so I did.''
Dixie died in 2020 at the age of 102, but her legacy lives on.
In 2023, she was inducted into the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame, which recognizes sacrifice and determination in the bourbon industry.
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg recently unveiled a new historical marker, part of the Louisville Metro Historical Marker Program, placed where her bar once stood, ensuring that future generations will learn about Dixie's fight and victory.
As a co-chair of the Congressional Bourbon Caucus, and as a proud son of Louisville, I am grateful for the path Dixie paved for the bourbon industry and the many women who work in it.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life and legacy of Dixie Demuth, as well as to celebrate the unveiling of the historical marker that enshrines her in our city's history.
