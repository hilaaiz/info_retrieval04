Stable Recovery's metrics exceed national norms.
As of today, 80 percent of Stable Recovery's legacy graduates remain sober and are employed in the equine industry.
Generous individuals and organizations, like HISA and Jockeys' Guild, believe in their mission.
Their support has given residents a chance to recover at Taylor Made Farm and strategic partners have provided stable employment, allowing graduates to build lives of independence and purpose.
I am honored to recognize the work of Stable Recovery as we consider their incredible work for our community and what more can be done to prevent suicide in our Nation.
We can heal people through horses, and in the process, create better lives, stronger families, and the opportunity of a bright future.
