Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember 
Mrs. Kathy Chester Luke of Philadelphia, Mississippi.
Mrs. Luke spent most of her life living in Philadelphia with her husband, Bob Luke, and always considered it home.
Kathy was a devoted teacher who poured patience, encouragement, and a belief that the children she encountered would help shape a better future for their families and communities into every student who entered the doors of her classroom.
The love Kathy showed to her students was a small glimpse into the selfless matriarch her family remembers her to be.
Nothing brought Kathy more joy than seeing all her family gathered in one room.
She loved to decorate for the holidays, travel with her husband, and play mahjong weekly with her friends.
Kathy's time as an educator impacted countless lives as she served as a selfless pillar of strength to her students and coworkers.
Her life and legacy are forever marked with generosity, wisdom, and a deep love for others.
I am honored to remember her legacy here today.
