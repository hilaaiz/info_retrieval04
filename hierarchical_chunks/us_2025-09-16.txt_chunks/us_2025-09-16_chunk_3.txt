Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Hallie Coyne and her service and contributions to Virginia's 1st District and the Nation.
Hallie joined my office in 2022 and quickly became one of the most effective and recognized personal office defense staffers in the House.
As my National Security Advisor, Hallie has spearheaded numerous legislative efforts that delivered tangible results to the constituents of my district, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the country.
Among her many accomplishments, Hallie spearheaded efforts to bolster the shipbuilding ecosystem in Virginia, strengthen commercial space launch infrastructure, bridge the gap between new defense start-ups and the Pentagon, and was a champion of defense technology and innovation.
Hallie has served as a mentor and leader for my legislative staff and the entire office, sharing her expertise and experience with the rest effective and successful team on Capitol Hill.
I would like to thank Hallie for her many contributions and dedicated service over the last three and a half years.
She is thorough, a true team player, and a spark in my office that will be dearly missed.
Hallie has been an invaluable member of my team, and I wish her the best of luck as she moves on to the next chapter of her professional career.
