Mr. GOMEZ.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Josefina Lopez, a playwright, artistic director, and community leader.
The daughter of a bracero, Josefina Lopez immigrated to the United States from Mexico at the age of 5.
Her family settled in Boyle Heights, where Lopez grew up as an undocumented individual for 13 years until she was granted amnesty.
Lopez's experience as a Mexican, undocumented woman is what inspired her to write her acclaimed play Real Women Have Curves.
The play, which was later adapted into a film, is based on Lopez's lived experience juggling her family's expectations to work at their sewing factory, her dream of pursuing an education in New York, and the ever-present fear of immigration authorities entering their communities.
Along with her other works, Lopez has had over 100 productions of her plays performed in the United States.
At the start of her writing career, Lopez was often the sole woman of color in the room, inspiring her to create a path for Latinos like herself to achieve success in the arts.
In 2000, Lopez founded CASA 0101 to, make this dream a reality by bringing theater and arts programs to the community she grew up in.
For the last 25 years, the organization has produced hundreds of plays, provided free arts classes for young Angelenos, and supported the next generation of storytellers and artists.
The impact of Lopez's work can be felt from Boyle Heights to Broadway.
