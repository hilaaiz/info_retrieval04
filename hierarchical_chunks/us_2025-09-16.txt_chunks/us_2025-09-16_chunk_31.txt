Mr. Speaker, His All-Holiness is not only a voice of principle, but a leader of action.
He presided over the historic Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church in Crete in 2016, granted autocephaly to the Church of Ukraine in 2019, and continues to strengthen unity within the Orthodox world while opening channels of dialogue with the Catholic Church and other Christian traditions.
His leadership is defined not by power or coercion, but by example--the examples of service, sacrifice, and fidelity to Christ's command to love our neighbor as ourselves.
As we welcome him, we are mindful that the challenges he faces are immense.
Religious freedom is often denied to Orthodox Christians--and under constraint in many of the lands they have inhabited for centuries.
Christians and other minorities in many regions still face persecution.
I thank His All-Holiness for his witness, courage, and example.
Washington welcomes him, not only as a guest, but as a brother, a teacher, and a peacemaker.
May his visit strengthen the bonds between our peoples, and may his ministry continue to inspire us all to walk humbly, act justly, and love mercifully in the service of God and one another.
