Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Jury Duty Exemption for Breastfeeding Act of 2023, which would allow breastfeeding individuals summoned for jury service in the federal courts and in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to be excused from service upon the individual's request.
The benefits of breastfeeding are welldocumented, and individuals should not be deterred from breastfeeding by jury service.
This bill would apply to the D.C. Superior Court, in addition to the federal courts, because the D.C. Home Rule Act prohibits the D.C. Council from enacting any law relating to title 11 of the D.C. Code.
Title 11 governs jury service in the D.C. Superior Court.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
