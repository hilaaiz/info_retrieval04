Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Apostle Albert D. Wilson, Jr. of The Greater Royal Worship Center on his 13th pastoral anniversary.
A devoted man of God and a remarkable leader, Apostle Wilson has uplifted our community through his faith.
Apostle Wilson began his service to the church at the young age of six.
He became an ordained minister in the early 2000s.
In 2011, under the guidance of his grandfather, Apostle Wilson was appointed as the pastor of the church.
Later, in 2019, he embraced the Lord's call and was installed as an Apostle.
Throughout his service, Apostle Wilson has expanded the church's reach and spread his message of faith throughout the community.
He renamed the church to the Greater Royal Worship Center, inspired by the vision of his forefathers.
Continuing to build out the church's community engagement, Apostle Wilson established the Royal Body Shop Outreach Ministries in Albion, New York.
Above all, Apostle Wilson leads with the principle of the three L's--We love, we lift, and we liberate.
In addition to his pastoral work, Apostle Wilson has dedicated himself to serving our community in multiple capacities.
He is the director of the Martha Mitchell Community Center, which provides Buffalo residents with vital resources and services.
During the COVID19 pandemic, Apostle Wilson led efforts to combat vaccine misinformation and hosted numerous vaccination clinics at the center.
Further, Apostle Wilson has been a leading figure with Voice Buffalo, participating in rallies calling for police reform.
Standing alongside other faith-based leaders and community activists, Apostle Wilson called for unity and protection of all people.
Today, Apostle Wilson is a loving husband to his wife, Ykeeta Wilson, and a father to his seven children.
Please join me in congratulating Apostle Albert D. Wilson, Jr. on thirteen years of pastoral service and celebrating his remarkable dedication to his faith and service to the community.
