Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with the people.
Louis, to honor and celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Ices Plain & Fancy Ice Cream Parlor, a beloved institution in our community located in the Shaw neighborhood.
Louis.
Founded in 2014 by visionary entrepreneurs, Ices Plain & Fancy has become a cornerstone of our local culinary scene, renowned for its innovative approach to ice cream making.
By utilizing liquid nitrogen to craft their unique flavors, they offer not just a treat but an extraordinary experience for all who visit.
It is with great pride that I recognize and celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Ices Plain & Fancy Ice Cream Parlor.
Over the past decade, Ices Plain & Fancy has continually demonstrated a commitment to quality and creativity.
Their dedication to sourcing local ingredients and supporting sustainable practices has garnered admiration and loyalty from their patrons.
Ices Plain & Fancy ice cream has brought many St. Louisans welcome respite on hot summer days.
Their contributions to the local economy, culture, and culinary heritage cannot be overstated.
As they celebrate this remarkable ten-year milestone, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the entire team at Ices Plain & Fancy.
Their passion and hard walk have made a lasting impact on our community, and I look forward to seeing their continued success in the years to come.
