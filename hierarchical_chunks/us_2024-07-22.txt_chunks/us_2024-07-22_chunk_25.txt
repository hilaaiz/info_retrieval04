for their new town--a tribute to their residents achieving their goal Lake has allowed the town to be a gateway between New Hampshire's Lakes Region and the White Mountains.
Old Home Week is a New Hampshire tradition that allows us to celebrate the places we call home.
Created by New Hampshire governor Frank W. Rollins in 1899, Old Home Week was inspired as a way to encourage New Hampshire natives to return to their hometown after many younger New Hampshirites had moved west in search of economic opportunities.
In the 21st century, globalization and technological advances have reduced social distance throughout the world, but the importance of strong, close-knit communities has remained the same.
By proudly continuing the tradition of Old Home Week, Freedom envisions a community where current and former residents alike can be proud of their hometown.
Thank you to the town of Freedom for inviting me to experience their community as a part of the Old Home Week Parade.
I admire all of the volunteers who made this experience possible for the 125th straight year.
I hope everyone enjoys themselves in celebrating this wonderful town.
To understand the importance of small towns building a proud community for their current and former residents, we all need to hear Freedom ring.
