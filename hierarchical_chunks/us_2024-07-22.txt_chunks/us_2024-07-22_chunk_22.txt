Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Ken Hayward and all the accomplishments he achieved on behalf of our Wolverines and the entire State.
A consummate professional, we couldn't have asked for a better representative of our great state.
I thank Ken and congratulate him on this tremendous achievement.
