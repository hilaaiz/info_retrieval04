Mr. LaMALFA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Aldo Pineschi, Jr., who recently passed away in Roseville, California.
His loss is felt throughout Northern California, and very personally to myself.
My deepest condolences to his wife Lesli, their children, and to his extended family and many friends.
Aldo was a quiet leader with tremendous influence, and also had a most caring spirit.
There was little in Placer County that didn't have his wise advice and fingerprints on it.
Aldo was a humble man who loved his community and did everything in his power to make it better.
Never wanting to be in the limelight, he indeed was a light and help to dozens of charities, as well as encouraging all levels of government to come together to solve issues.
Putting aside differences and finding areas of agreement was one of his specialties.
I value and will cherish the friendship that I shared with Aldo and will look back fondly at the times, over dinners, local events, we shared.
No matter how far he had to travel, Aldo would be there giving me a smile from the back of a crowded town hall or business round table.
God Bless Aldo.
I thank him for all he has done and the kindness that accompanied him every step on this earth.
He will be missed.
