Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Winners Church of Dumfries, Virginia and extend my congratulations to them on the completion of their new church building.
This expansion will enable them to continue their mission of service to the community.
Winners Church has served the people of Virginia's Seventh Congressional District for more than 13 years.
Under the direction of Senior Pastor Henry Godwin, Winners Church has enriched the lives of Dumfries residents by fostering a sense of community and providing invaluable support to their congregants.
This new building serves as a symbol of the continued dedication to service that Winners Church nurtures in their community and will continue to grow through their love and faith.
The mission of Winners Church is to be a place where overcomers are raised, hope is restored, purpose is realized, and potential is maximized.
Since the church's founding in December of 2010, they have continuously provided for their community through annual events such as the turkey giveaway, back to school giveaway, tissue drive, and quarterly visits to shelters and assisted living homes throughout Dumfries.
I applaud Pastor Godwin and the entire Winners Church family for their tireless work to develop a welcoming environment for the people of Dumfries and beyond, and for the support they have provided to our community.
