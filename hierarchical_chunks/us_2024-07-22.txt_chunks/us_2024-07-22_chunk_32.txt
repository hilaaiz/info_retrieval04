Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Major Willey for his unwavering dedication to our country.
His service before self, exceptional military achievements, and steadfast roles as a spouse, father, and friend have not only enhanced our national security but also stand as a testament to the values of bravery, devotion, and compassion.
I join Major Willey's family, friends, and colleagues in celebrating his retirement and extend to him my heartfelt best wishes for the future.
