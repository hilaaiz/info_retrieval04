Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, today it is my great honor to rise in recognition of the countless invaluable contributions of the Naval Air Development Center (NADC) in Warminster, Pennsylvania, to the aerospace heritage of my community and our entire country.
For six decades, the NADC has been the cornerstone of United States Naval aviation research.
Before the era of Silicon Valley and Research Triangle Park, NADC was the premier aviation research center and cradle Originally acquired from the Brewster Aircraft Corporation by the United States Government during World War II, the NADC transitioned to United States Navy management in 1947 and quickly became synonymous with innovation, pioneering advancements in pilotless aircraft, modern aircraft design, propulsion systems, electronics, surveillance technologies, acoustics processing, communications, navigation (including Global Positioning System (GPS)), and weaponry.
Its mission was clear: to be a global leader in naval aviation research and development, and it accomplished this mission successfully.
The NADC housed over thirty laboratories, each focusing on various critical aspects of naval aviation.
These hubs of innovation drew visionary engineers, scientists, technicians, and support staff from across the nation to take part in this groundbreaking research that pushed the boundaries of aerospace technology.
Their collective efforts yielded numerous breakthroughs crucial to securing our national defense and advancing global aerospace capabilities.
Among their countless achievements, one of the most significant was the establishment of the Aviation Medical Acceleration Laboratory (AMAL).
Central to this laboratory was the world's most powerful human centrifuge.
Famously known as the ``Johnsville Centrifuge'', this facility played a critical role in advancing the understanding of highperformance jet aircraft's effects on pilots, significantly contributing to the training and safety protocols of pilots in groundbreaking programs like the North American X-15, Mercury, Gemini, Apollo Spacecrafts, and Space Shuttle missions.
In addition, the Anti-Submarine Warfare Laboratory was instrumental in developing cutting-edge technologies vital to the Navy's Cold War efforts.
Innovations like the Lockheed P-3 Orion and S-3 Viking aircraft, Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) helicopters, and advanced sonobuoys significantly enhanced their capability to detect and counter Soviet submarine threats.
Furthermore, the NADC served as the lead laboratory for several iconic aircraft, including the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet tactical fighters, the Presidential Helicopter fleet, and the Take Charge and Move Out (TACAMO) communications platforms.
Its influence extended beyond aircraft to encompass the entire spectrum of navigation systems used by Navy aircraft, submarines, and surface vessels.
The NADC crew systems office was also responsible for pioneering advancements in aviation life support, life sciences, and crew station technologies.
From the Navy Common Ejection Seat (NACES) to flight helmets and flame-retardant NOMEX flight suits, the innovations and initiatives born out of this office underscore the profound impact the NADC has had in enhancing pilot safety and mission effectiveness.
