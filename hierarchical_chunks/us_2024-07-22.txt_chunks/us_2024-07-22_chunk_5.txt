Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the #OneWorld Soccer Tournament of WNY, an incredible community initiative led by the Buffalo Maendeleo Soccer Club and Bridges from Borders.
This inaugural event brought together underrepresented youth in Buffalo's Lower West Side for a soccer competition.
The organizations leading this project, the Buffalo Maendeleo Soccer Club and Bridges from Borders, work to support our local refugee and immigrant populations.
The Buffalo Maendeleo Soccer Club provides safe community spaces for underserved children to play in a soccer league with their peers.
Bridges from Borders is a nonprofit organization promoting mental health and wellbeing for immigrant families moving to Western New York.
Together, these organizations dedicated nine months to organizing the #OneWorld Soccer Tournament, with the goal of fostering unity and combating negative stereotypes placed onto minorities.
The tournament took place on Saturday, July 13, 2024, with four teams competing in spirited and fun soccer games.
Parents and players alike had a great time engaging in friendly competition and connecting with their community.
Following the tournament's great success, Maendeleo Soccer Club and Bridges from Borders plan to make the #OneWorld Tournament an annual event.
They hope to expand their programming to more neighborhoods, continuing to bring young people together and build unity through soccer.
Please join me in congratulating the Buffalo Maendeleo Soccer Club and Bridges from Borders on the incredible success of the #OneWorld Soccer Tournament.
Today, we thank these organizations for their dedication to serving our community and uplifting our youth.
