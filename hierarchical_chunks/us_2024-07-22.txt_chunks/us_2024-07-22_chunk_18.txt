501(c)(3) organizations and 501(c)(4) organizations that applied for that status--and self-declared 501(c)(4) organizations.
This discrepancy appears to have been inadvertently created by the PATH Act.
This bill would fix this discrepancy by requiring the IRS to publicly disclose any filed Form 8976 upon request, thus allowing the public to know which organizations operate under 501(c)(4), as they do with organizations that operate under 501(c)(3).
In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited expenditures in political campaigns by these ``social welfare'' organizations, greater transparency is needed.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
