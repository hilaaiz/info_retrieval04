From grassroots to professional, the number of women’s teams has more than doubled over the past seven years.
Cheltenham Town Women have a thriving team, with junior and adult sections.
Sadly, one place above them in the table this season are Lewes FC, who are running the “Equal FA Cup” campaign.
Does the Minister agree that it is time for equality of prize money across the men’s and women’s FA cups?
I am incredibly grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for asking such an important question.
The Government are fully committed to supporting and growing women’s sport, and to ensuring that it is on an equal footing with men’s sport.
The ambition to have equal prize money across sport, where possible, is absolutely right.
I know that the Football Association took steps last season to double the prize fund for the women’s FA cup, and we will pay close attention to see what happens next.
What recent assessment her Department has made of the impact of youth services on levels of antisocial behaviour in Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes constituency.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for all her work to support young people in her constituency over many years.
It is a source of national shame that youth funding decreased by 73% under the last Government—one of the deepest cuts made to any of our public services—and that there was no real strategy for a generation of young people.
This Government are determined to get a grip on this issue to ensure that young people in towns such as Grimsby have the opportunities that they deserve.
