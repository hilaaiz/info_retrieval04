I thank the right hon.
Member for raising this important issue.
I am deeply concerned by the number of cases that have been brought to my attention since taking office of women who have fallen foul of this practice.
I have personally had discussions with the BBC leadership about that.
Obviously, the charter review, which we intend to start early next year, offers us an opportunity to look at these issues in the round.
