I join my hon.
Friend in congratulating all those working across all faiths to ensure that there is good, strong community cohesion, and I congratulate the retiring bishop.
That is important across constituencies that, like Reading, have diverse communities with diversity in faith.
What steps the Church is taking to mark the 30th anniversary of the ordination of women.
What steps the Church is taking to mark the 30th anniversary of the ordination of women.
It is so important that we celebrate women who have been ordinated.
Tuesday 12 March 2024  marked the 30th anniversary of the first ordinations of women as priests in the Church of England, and about 6,500 women have been ordained since 1994.
Women now make up about one third of the clergy in England, and obviously this proportion is growing.
Many services of celebration have taken place across the country to recognise the considerable contributions that these women have made and continue to make to the Church.
However, as we all know, there is still a long way to go and much more work to be done in this area.
