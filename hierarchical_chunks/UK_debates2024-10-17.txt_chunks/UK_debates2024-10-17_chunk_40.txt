I welcome my hon.
Friend to her post; she is doing a fine job.
Will she join me in congratulating the local faith communities across the diverse and tolerant town of Reading on their work to support one another, and to understand one another’s faith?
I associate myself with that tremendous work; it is wonderful to see different faith communities working together for the whole community.
I also put on record my support for the retiring Bishop of Reading, Bishop Olivia, and pay tribute to her for her outstanding work to tackle knife crime in our community.
