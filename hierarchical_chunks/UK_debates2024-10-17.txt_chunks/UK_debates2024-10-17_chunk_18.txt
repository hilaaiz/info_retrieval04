It is an honour to stand at the Dispatch Box for the first time, although I have to admit that it is not how I pictured it.
I will do my best not to be a pain in your neck, Mr Speaker.
In a nutshell, the creative industries are worried that the Government will essentially give away their intellectual property.
I am pleased to hear the Minister’s response, but the growing concerns were raised by the Chair of the Select Committee following comments by a Minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology.
With that in mind, will the Minister confirm that he will not give away IP through an exemption?
Will he assure the House that he will not implement the EU’s approach, given its flaws?
Finally, will he commit to holding a summit between the tech and creative industries to explore licensing and other models?
It is absolutely essential that we protect intellectual property, which is one of the key things this country has to sell.
We have already had two meetings with representatives from the creative industries and tech companies, and we are keen to move forward.
