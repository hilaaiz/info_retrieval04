I welcome the hon.
Lady to her place.
Eastbourne declared a housing emergency last year, and the key thing we need to do to address that emergency is build our way out of it.
The commissioners preside over a perfect brownfield site for housing: the site of the former St Elisabeth’s church on Victoria Drive, just down the road from where I went to school.
It has been derelict for 20 years, and since the church on the site was demolished four years ago, there has been no sign of development whatsoever.
I urge the  commissioners to develop that site into affordable housing, and I appeal to the hon.
Lady for an urgent update on the situation.
