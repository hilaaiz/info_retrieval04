I welcome the Second Church Estates Commissioner to her place, and thank her for her answer to the previous question.
As everyone knows, the purpose of any church is to tell the greatest story ever told—the story of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ—but alongside that they have practical purposes, which  the hon.
Member for Carlisle (Ms Minns)  referred to.
Those purposes include looking after the elderly, as well as children, through childcare and nurseries; and there is also the social media and the events that churches host.
Those are the practical outpourings of the gospel in the lives of those whom we reach.
What will the Church Commissioners do to ensure that those things happen, alongside the telling of the gospel?
