I am the real thing, Mr Speaker.
The creative industries in Strangford and across Northern Ireland are very important.
In responding to the point raised by  the hon.
Member for Congleton (Mrs Russell) , it is important that Northern Ireland has similar consideration.
Has the Minister had an opportunity to speak to the relevant Minister in the Northern Ireland  Executive to ensure that anything that happens here to protect women and ladies also happens in Northern Ireland?
The hon.
Gentleman makes a good point.
Although some of the areas we are discussing are, of course, devolved, we want to make sure that the whole UK moves forward in the same direction.
I am keen to talk to my counterpart in Northern Ireland about this subject.
