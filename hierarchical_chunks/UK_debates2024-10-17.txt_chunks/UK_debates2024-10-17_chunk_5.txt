I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I am absolutely delighted to hear of his enthusiasm for the scheme, which will make a huge difference to communities up and down our country.
We are starting a test-and-learn phase in April; the roll-out will be in September.
We want to learn from that approach, and I would be delighted to work with him on this matter.
