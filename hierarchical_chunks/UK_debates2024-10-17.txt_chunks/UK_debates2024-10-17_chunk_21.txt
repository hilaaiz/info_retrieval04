I thank my hon.
Friend for his important question and congratulate Crewe and Nantwich athletic club on half a century—what a great achievement!
Such sports clubs are crucial to helping our young people to pursue their sporting passions.
I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss the matter, but in the meantime I will ask my Department to link the club up with England Athletics and other bodies for further discussion of the support available.
