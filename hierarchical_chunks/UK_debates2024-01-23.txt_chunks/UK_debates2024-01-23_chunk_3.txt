I thank the hon.
Gentleman for bringing some insight into how we can best reach families.
Of course, it is not just mums, but fathers or carers who can have a huge impact on our children.
That is why the Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom) , is investing so much energy and commitment in our family hubs.
We believe that they can be the centre for families to make the very best start to a child’s life.
