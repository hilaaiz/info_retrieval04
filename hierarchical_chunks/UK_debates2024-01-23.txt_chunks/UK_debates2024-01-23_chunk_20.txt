I thank the Secretary of State for that response.
The Royal College of Midwives estimates that there is a shortage of around 2,500 full-time midwives working in the NHS.
I know that at first hand from Cossham Hospital in my constituency, which has a wonderful birth centre, but it has been closed for most of the last few years, because it simply cannot get the midwives to staff it—they have to go elsewhere where more serious cases need to be dealt with.
What is she doing specifically about the retention of midwives?
I know that student numbers are, thankfully, coming up, but a lot of midwives are choosing to leave the profession because there is not enough flexibility in their work.
