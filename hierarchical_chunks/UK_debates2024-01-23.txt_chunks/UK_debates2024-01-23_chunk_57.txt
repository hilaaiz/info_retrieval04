I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.
As I made clear last week, the Liberal Democrats accept the case for limited strikes against the Houthis, as long as they remain limited.
As the Prime Minister updates the House for the second time on this matter, there is remarkably little clarity about what the next steps are and when the UK’s objectives will be judged to have been fulfilled.
Nor has the Prime Minister sufficiently addressed how he plans to avoid regional escalation in this most fragile of regions.
I thank him for agreeing that the House can debate this matter tomorrow, but will he not give the House the opportunity to vote on this matter, not least given the huge cross-party support for limited strikes?
That would surely strengthen the signal he intends to give.
