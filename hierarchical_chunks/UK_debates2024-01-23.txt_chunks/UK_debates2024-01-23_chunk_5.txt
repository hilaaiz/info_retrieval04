I thank the Minister for his answer.
As he knows, the national health service would completely collapse without the input and expertise of clinical staff from around the world.
One barrier to those people coming to help us are the high fees for applying for permanent residency.
Some nurses from countries such as India and the Philippines are having to take out expensive loans just to feel like they are welcome and able to stay in our country.
I have presented a private Member’s Bill to exempt NHS clinical staff from paying those high fees to become residents.
Will the Minister support the Bill and work with his Home Office colleagues to find a way to make that a reality for those people who work so hard in our health service?
