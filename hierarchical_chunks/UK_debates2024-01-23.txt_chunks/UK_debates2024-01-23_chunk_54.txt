I welcome the airstrikes, which were conducted solely to re-establish freedom of maritime movement.
However, there are a number of Iranian proxies and allied groups operating across the middle east, and the hand of Iran is clear in their activities.
Iran is the fundamental threat to UK security and to stability in the region.
What is the strategic approach and intent to comprehensively reduce the threat that we face from all the proxies and allies, so that we do not end up playing whack-a-mole?
Have we seen any opportunism from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or Daesh, who are also on the ground in Iran?
Finally, as the Prime Minister touched on Gaza-Israel, please may I reiterate my request for the UK to launch a contact group for Palestine, so that we can launch track 2 negotiations to get some progress towards stability and a two-state solution?
