The Prime Minister is right that to do nothing is not an option, but to do something there needs to be a strategy.
If the attacks continue and there is continued disruption to maritime trade, does he have a plan B?
That is why we are working extensively with our allies, broadening the international coalition of support condemning the Houthis’ behaviour, and putting pressure on them in all different ways.
It is important that military action is not seen in isolation: it sits alongside wider diplomatic and economic strategies.
As I said, we will bring forward new sanctions measures, together with our allies, in the coming days.
I express my full support for the action that my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister has approved.
Will he extend his strategic objectives, because it seems that this threat will remain so long as the Houthis have a safe haven to operate from?
It is a question of how we deal with that part of Yemen, which is effectively an ungoverned space.
It is clear that the Houthis’ behaviour is damaging the people of Yemen.
We have talked previously about the importance of the supply of food into Yemen, but the destruction of oil infrastructure also deprives the Yemeni people of key revenue.
These are all topics with which we are engaged with our Saudi partners.
We very much support the negotiations.
As my hon.
Friend knows, a deal was announced in December.
We would like to see a lasting peace and security for the Yemeni people for an inclusive political settlement, and I can assure him that, diplomatically, we are working very hard to achieve that aim.
