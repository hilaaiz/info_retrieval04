I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
We were holding regular meetings with Norfolk and Suffolk MPs, the trust, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England, and with the new management team, that trust did appear to finally be turning things around.
However, I am concerned to hear the points that my hon.
Friend has raised.
I am very happy to restart those meetings and will ask my office to arrange them as quickly as possible.
