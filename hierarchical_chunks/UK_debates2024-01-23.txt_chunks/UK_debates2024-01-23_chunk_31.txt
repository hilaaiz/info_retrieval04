I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that point.
We were all dismayed and upset to see the experiences of residents in those units, and we saw the correct criminal outcomes—if I am allowed to say that—for those involved in those assaults.
A review is going on as to how those issues are affecting the estate as a whole, but we are clear that in-patient stays should happen only when they are strictly necessary.
We must be mindful that clinicians will be taking many situations into account, including not just the safety of the patient but the safety of the wider community.
