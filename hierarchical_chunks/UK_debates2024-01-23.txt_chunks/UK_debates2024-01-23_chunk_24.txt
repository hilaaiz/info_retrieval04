I thank the Minister for that response.
Research and development is very important; it means we can find more cures for cancer.
My father, who is dead and gone, survived cancer on three occasions; that happened because of advances in finding cures.
What is being done to work alongside those in research and development to ensure that even more cancers can be cured and we can go from a 50% rate to perhaps a 60% or even 70% rate for those who live longer?
