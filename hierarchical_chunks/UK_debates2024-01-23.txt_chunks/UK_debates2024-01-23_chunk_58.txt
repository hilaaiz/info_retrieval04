What is escalatory is the Houthis ramping up attacks on commercial shipping, launching missiles and drones against US and UK warships, and threatening allied bases in the region.
I have been very clear that military action was a last resort.
We provided warning after warning, including with allies and at the UN Security Council.
The Houthis had, and continue to have, the ability to prevent this by stopping their illegal attacks.
As I pointed out earlier, there are also risks to inaction because it would damage international security and the global economy, and send a message that British vessels, lives and interests are fair game, none of which I think is acceptable.
I am pleased that the House will have an opportunity to debate the matter tomorrow but, as I said, we reserve the right to take action in a limited, proportionate and legal way in self-defence.
That is the right thing and the country would expect nothing less from the Government.
