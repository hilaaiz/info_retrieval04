Does the Minister agree, however, that the information she has just given about why screening for prostate cancer does not happen for men is based on a study that is 20 years old?
There are 12,000 deaths a year—it is the biggest killer among men, and the second biggest killer among all people—yet here is this evil cancer for which there is no screening programme whatsoever.
Will she take steps to update current NHS guidance to ensure that all those at high risk of prostate cancer receive a targeted early detection service?
I think she has hinted that she may be doing that, but will she finally introduce mass screening for prostate cancer?
It is the only cancer without specifically commissioned early diagnosis work, and men are dying unnecessarily because of the failure to bring this in.
We have more than hinted: we have just announced a £16 million pilot study of prostate cancer screening.
We have a plan to tackle those 12,000 deaths a year, and it will work, because until now  we have not had a diagnostic test.
PSA is not a sensitive test in all prostate cancers: there are many men with prostate cancer who do not express PSA.
That is why the Transform study, using detection tools such as MRI, will be trialled, and if they are effective, such tools will be rolled out across the country.
What steps she is taking to increase the recruitment and retention of NHS midwifery and maternity staff.
We are investing an additional £165 million a year to improve maternity and neonatal care, rising to £186 million a year from April.
This will increase the number of midwifery posts and improve the quality of care that mothers and babies receive.
As of October last year, there were 23,100 full-time equivalent midwives working in NHS trusts and other core organisations in England, which is more than 1,000 more than a year ago and 3,500 more than in 2010.
