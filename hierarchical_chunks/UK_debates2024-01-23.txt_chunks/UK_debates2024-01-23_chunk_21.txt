I think we all agree that a career as a midwife is just one of the most rewarding and fulfilling careers that one can hope for.
That is why we have placed such priority on retention in the long-term workforce plan that we launched last year.
The national retention programme for midwifery and nursing has prioritised five actions to support staff retention, including menopause guidance, because we know that that can be an issue for midwives, and valuing them and their contribution is also a key objective of NHS England’s three-year plan for maternity services.
As well as recruitment and retention, training matters.
Anglia Ruskin University has a campus in Chelmsford and is the provider of the largest number of health and social care degrees in the country, training midwives, nurses and, since the medical school opened, doctors.
Will the Secretary of State back the campaign to expand the medical school in Chelmsford so that we can train even more local people to work in our local NHS?
