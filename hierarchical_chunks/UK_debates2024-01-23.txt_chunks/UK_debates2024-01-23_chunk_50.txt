I welcome what my right hon.
Friend says about diplomatic and humanitarian efforts, and indeed cutting off the supply of arms.
I particularly welcome what he says about the effectiveness of the strikes that have already taken place.
However, does he agree that in order to protect civilian shipping, this may need to be a prolonged and persistent targeted campaign alongside our allies?
