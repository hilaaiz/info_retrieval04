I thank the right hon.
and learned Gentleman for acknowledging that the strikes sit within a wider strategy in the region to bring about an end to what we are seeing.
The Foreign Secretary will be in the region this week, engaging extensively with our partners and allies on all the topics that the right hon.
and learned Gentleman raised, and particularly ensuring that we can continue to make progress on a sustainable peace in Yemen.
No doubt the Foreign Secretary will talk to our Saudi partners about that and, crucially, broaden the coalition of support for the action we have taken.
