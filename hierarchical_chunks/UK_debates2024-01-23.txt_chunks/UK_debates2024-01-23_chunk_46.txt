First, the right hon.
and learned Gentleman asked about the effectiveness of strikes in deterring and precisely degrading capability.
I am pleased to tell him that further evidence, after the initial statement I made last week, has demonstrated to us that the strikes last week were effective in degrading capability and all the intended targets were destroyed.
I am also pleased to say that our initial evidence from last night’s strikes is also that all intended targets were destroyed, which demonstrates to us that, working with our allies, who have the same view, the strikes are working to degrade capability, even though, as the right hon.
and learned Gentleman said, there may be a difference between reducing and eliminating.
We are confident that what we are doing is working to degrade capability.
The targets are specifically selected on the basis of intelligence; they are military sites that impact the security and safety of seafarers and shipping.
To that end, I am confident that, as I said, the strikes are being carried out in a way that is effective in achieving their aim.
