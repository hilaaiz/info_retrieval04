I thank my right hon.
Friend and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bishop Auckland (Dehenna Davison)  for bringing two amazing women to talk to me about the impact of lobular cancer.
For the benefit of Members on both sides of the House, last week we sent out a “Dear colleague” letter and graphics about the women’s health strategy so that we can all help our constituents to understand what this Conservative Government are doing to ensure that the healthcare of women is faster, simpler and fairer.
