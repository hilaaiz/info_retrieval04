I thank my right hon.
Friend and male colleagues on the Government Benches, including my hon.
Friend  the Member for Don Valley (Nick Fletcher) , who are fighting so hard to improve men’s health.
He is absolutely right: 12,000 men a year die from prostate cancer.
That is why we are investing in the £16 million prostate cancer trial called Transform, using methods such as MRI to detect prostate cancer rather than PSA, which can be inaccurate.
Thousands of men will be recruited.
We are hoping that the trial will start in the spring, with recruitment in the autumn, including the recruitment of black men, who are disproportionately affected by prostate cancer.
