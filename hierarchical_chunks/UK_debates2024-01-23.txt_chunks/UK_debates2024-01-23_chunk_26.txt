I thank my hon.
Friend for his invitation.
He has been a tireless campaigner on this issue on behalf of his constituents.
The future of healthcare is about getting people the care that they need, where they need it and when they need it, and Rugby is no different.
New local NHS services are bringing care closer to home in his area, such as the new imaging unit at the Hospital of St Cross that opened in September.
