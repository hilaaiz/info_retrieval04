I thank my hon.
Friend for that contribution, and for the work she has been undertaking on this issue, quite apart from the Bill.
She is absolutely right.
Other countries, including Australia, France and Belgium—I think there are a couple of others—have already shown the way by banning the trade in hunting trophies, and I hope that what we decide here will start to send a message to other countries that this is an international movement.
As we always realise, society and opinions evolve.
This country has the Bullring in Birmingham, but we no longer torment bulls with dogs in a public arena, or engage in bear baiting or cock fighting.
We have moved on from that and we need to move on from trophy hunting, not least because of the decline in species.
