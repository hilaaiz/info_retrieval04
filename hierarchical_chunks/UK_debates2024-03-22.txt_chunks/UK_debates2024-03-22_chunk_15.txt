I am pleased to speak on this important Bill.
The importation to the UK of trophies produced during the barbaric sport of trophy hunting should have ended a long time ago.
I thank my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Warley (John Spellar)  for introducing the Bill, following the earlier Bill from  the hon.
Member for Crawley (Henry Smith) .
We need to get this sorted today, because we have had Warley and Crawley, and I am not sure there is another constituency that rhymes.
