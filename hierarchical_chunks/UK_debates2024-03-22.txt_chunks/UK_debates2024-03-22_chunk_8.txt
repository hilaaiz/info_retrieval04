I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for giving way, and I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith) .
Today feels a bit like déjà vu.
We are back here again, but that sends a message to our friends in the Lords that we will not give up.
This legislation is the right thing to do.
It is an abhorrent act to go to another country and kill an endangered animal in order to stick its head on a wall.
It seems like something from a totally different century.
The fact that we are back again, fighting for the right cause and standing on the shoulders of the giants who have gone before us sends an important message to both the House of Lords and the country.
