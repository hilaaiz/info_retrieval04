However, for all the praise that our campaigners are due, we should not have needed to be here debating this Bill today.
The legislation should have been passed by this Government long ago.
We all know that members of the public, including in my constituency, overwhelmingly support the Bill.
The wider public support for it is reflected in the fact that banning hunting trophies was both a 2019 Conservative manifesto promise, as the hon.
Member for Crawley said, and a Labour manifesto promise.
Why is this measure, promised by the Government, not already in law?
Why did they fail to bring forward their own Bill banning trophy hunting, as they pledged to voters that they would?
Given that an earlier private Member’s Bill seeking to implement a ban progressed through the House last year, why are we here again debating an equivalent Bill?
It is because the Bill we debated last year was deliberately and wholly undemocratically derailed by a small number of mostly hereditary Conservative peers.
As my hon.
Friend  the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)  pointed out, those peers ignored the will of the public, the welfare of animals and their own party’s manifesto commitment, and used the amendment process as a blocking device.
Labour Members think that that is unacceptable, and our party wants this long promised and long overdue legislation progressed as soon as possible.
When that Bill reached the House of Lords, no peer stepped forward to sponsor it.
Why did no Labour peer do so?
