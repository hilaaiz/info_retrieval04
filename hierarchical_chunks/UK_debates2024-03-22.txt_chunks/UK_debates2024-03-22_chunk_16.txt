I thank animal welfare charities nationwide, including FOUR PAWS, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection and Ban Trophy Hunting.
They have worked tirelessly for years to ensure that this legislation is passed, and have produced the most helpful briefing  note for this debate.
I also pay tribute to the former President of Botswana, Ian Khama, who has been a tireless and passionate campaigner on these issues.
