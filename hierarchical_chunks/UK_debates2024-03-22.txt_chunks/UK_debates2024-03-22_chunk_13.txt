I thank the hon.
Gentleman, who sits with me on the British-American Parliamentary Group; we are joint officers.
I consider him a parliamentary friend.
I thank him for highlighting the fact that the Bill was amended to take account of various views.
It was carried forward without dissent in this House, and was forwarded to the Lords.
That is precisely why the Bill should be voted on again, sent back to the other House, and incorporated into the laws of this land.
