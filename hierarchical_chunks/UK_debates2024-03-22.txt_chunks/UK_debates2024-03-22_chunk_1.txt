I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
Often in debates that have had a long genesis and been considered many times in the House, there is that hackneyed phrase: everything that needs to be said has been said, but not everyone has said it.
One cannot even use that phrase now, because everyone has said what they need to say many times over.
Of course, that is not true in this case, not least because of the Bill tabled and pioneered very ably by  the hon.
Member for Crawley (Henry Smith)  in the last Session of Parliament.
The clear and overwhelming view of this House was that the legislation should go forward.
We all know that that Bill was subject to extended delays in the other House—without wishing to cast aspersions, one could almost suggest delaying tactics—and eventually time ran out.
I have to say that in this regard, even if in no other, I welcome the postponement of the general election until the autumn, as I hope that will give us more than adequate time, not only for the Bill to go through its stages in this House, but to ensure that the majority in the other place are not frustrated by the few who take a different view of it.
In some ways, what is happening down there is slightly reminiscent of the debate on the House of Lords in the early part of the last century, when the Lords were very much divided between the hedgers and the ditchers—between those who accepted that some reform was necessary and were therefore going to hedge their bets and allow reform to take place, and those who were going to die in the ditch.
I hope very much that the hedgers in this case triumph in the other House, so that this matter, which is very important not just to us but to the public, makes progress.
About this time last year, on Report, we reached somewhat of a compromise consensus on the Bill that left this place and went to the Lords.
Am I right in thinking that the right hon.
Gentleman has reintroduced the exact same Bill on which this House reached consensus last year?
The Bill technically does not stop hunting; it simply stops the import into this country of any animal protected by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora.
