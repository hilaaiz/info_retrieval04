I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising the Omagh bombing inquiry.
It was a heinous and cowardly terrorist attack, and it shocked the world.
Our thoughts are with the family members who are taking part in commemorative hearings this week.
I welcome the Irish Government’s commitment to co-operating with the inquiry.
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has raised with the Irish Government the importance of working together on addressing these and all legacy issues, and I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this very serious and important issue.
