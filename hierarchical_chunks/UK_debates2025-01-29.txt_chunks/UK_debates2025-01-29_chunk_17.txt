The UK Government have invested £790 million in Wales’s growth deals, including £110 million in the Mid Wales growth deal which aims to leverage up to £400 million of public and private sector investment in the region and create up to 1,400 additional jobs.
In places across the UK, including in my constituency of Wrexham, for too long too many young people have fallen through the gaps, meaning that they can miss out on job opportunities, education and gaining the critical skills essential to getting on in life.

Friend the Chancellor confirmed that we are moving forward with the £160 million Wrexham and Flintshire investment zone, focusing on the area’s strengths in advanced manufacturing, leveraging £1 billion of private investment over the next 10 years and creating up to 6,000 jobs.

This particular issue is devolved to the Welsh Government.
