This week, I heard a story from an elderly resident in Bedworth.
Kolin Basra phoned the GP surgery to make an appointment for his elderly wife and was told that no appointments would be available for three months.
Does the Prime Minister agree that that is utterly shocking and horrifying, and a direct result of 14 years of neglect by the Conservative party?
