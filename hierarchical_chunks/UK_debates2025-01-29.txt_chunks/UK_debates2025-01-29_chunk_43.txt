I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that.
She is absolutely right: the damage that the Conservatives did to the NHS was absolutely unforgiveable.
We are taking steps to ensure that more GP appointments will be available, we are getting the waiting lists down, and we are putting investment into the NHS.
As with everything else, we are clearing up the mess that they left behind.
