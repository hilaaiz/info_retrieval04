Friend for his question, and I wholeheartedly agree with him.
The freeports programme will deliver economic growth and jobs across Wales.
Anglesey freeport’s tax sites have gone live, which is excellent news.
The freeport aims to attract over £1 billion of investment into the green energy sector and to create nearly 5,000 jobs by 2030.
The Celtic freeport is set to attract £8.4 billion of private and public investment, and to deliver 11,500 jobs.
