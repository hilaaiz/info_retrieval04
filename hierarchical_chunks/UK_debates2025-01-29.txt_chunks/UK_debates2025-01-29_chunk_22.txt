May I take this opportunity to solemnly commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz?
We remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children who were murdered.
The Holocaust stands as a unique evil in human history.
Yesterday the Prime Minister set his growth test.
He said that if a policy is “good for growth…the answer is ‘yes’, if it’s not then the answer is ‘no’.”
This morning the Chancellor embraced a series of Conservative policies.
Although many are welcomed, they will take years to deliver.
When the Conservatives left office, we had the fastest economic growth in the G7, but what are the Government doing for growth now?
They are destroying it.
Let us look at the employment Bill.
The Government’s own figures say it will cost business £5 billion a year.

The Leader of the Opposition asked what we are doing.
The Office for National Statistics says that we have the highest investment for 19 years.
PwC says that this is the second-best place to invest in the world.
The International Monetary Fund has upgraded our growth, predicting that the UK will be the fastest-growing major economy in Europe.
Wages are up and inflation is down.
However, there is more to do.
We are reforming planning and regulation, building the new homes that we need, and supporting a third runway at Heathrow.
As the Leader of the Opposition admitted to the CBI in November, “there is no point in me just complaining about Labour when it was obvious that we Conservatives lost the confidence of business.”
We are not taking lectures from them.
