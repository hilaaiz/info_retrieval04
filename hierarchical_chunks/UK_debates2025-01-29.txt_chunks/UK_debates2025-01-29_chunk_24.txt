The Prime Minister forgets that his own Chancellor blocked an airport in her constituency.
They are hypocrites.
Let us talk about the employment Bill.
Part 1 of the Bill means that a new employee could start a job in the morning and take their employer to a tribunal that afternoon.
It is no wonder that this Bill has been called an “adventure playground for lawyers”.
This Bill is terrible for business, but it is great employment for lawyers.
I know the Prime Minister loves the legal profession, but he needs to stop being a lawyer and start  being a leader.
This is another measure in the Bill that fails his growth test.
Will he show some leadership and drop it?
I understand that the Leader of the Opposition likes straight talking: she is talking absolute nonsense.
She knows, and anybody who understands anything about the Bill or any employment law will know, that you cannot start in the morning and go to a tribunal in the afternoon.
We know she is not a lawyer, she is clearly not a leader, and if she keeps on like this, she is going to be the next lettuce.
