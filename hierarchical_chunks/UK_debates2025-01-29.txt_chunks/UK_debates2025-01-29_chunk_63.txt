I thank the Chief Secretary for his statement about investment and growth.
Does he agree with me about the role that new towns will play in tackling our country’s housing crisis and how important it is that, alongside the homes in the new towns, we see the delivery of new social infrastructure?
Can he outline how those plans will work?
