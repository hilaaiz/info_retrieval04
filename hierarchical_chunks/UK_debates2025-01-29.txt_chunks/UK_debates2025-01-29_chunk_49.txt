I thank the Chair of the Treasury Committee for her question.
This is an important test of turning policy into real-world delivery.
Through our infrastructure and industrial strategies, we are engaging right now with businesses and investors across the country so that as we bring forward our plans, we have a skills and training system that creates opportunities for people to take up the jobs that we need them to do in order to help get Britain building.
That will be a crucial part of our approach to infrastructure, so that every person across the country can seize the benefits of this Government’s plans.
