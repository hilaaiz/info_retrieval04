I am glad that my hon.
Friend raised that.
She will know that the Government are fully committed to harnessing AI to improve productivity and efficiency, and to boost economic growth.
I was pleased to hear the Chancellor talking about AI growth zones in her speech.
Like my hon.
Friend, I want to ensure that Wales maximises AI opportunities.
I will be happy to discuss that further with her.
One of the advantages of this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is that every region benefits from the trading opportunities that arise.
Will the Secretary of State reaffirm that there are advantages for Northern Ireland from its economic contact with Wales, as there are for Scotland and England?
As I said, the Government are determined to see growth right across the United Kingdom, in all four nations.
The relationship between Wales and Northern Ireland is very strong, and long may that continue.
