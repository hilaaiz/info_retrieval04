As far as I am aware, Mid Bedfordshire is not in Wales.
The hon.
Member raises objections to the Welsh Government’s policy, but he should perhaps check his own ranks first, because Conservative-run Great Yarmouth borough council has supported a form of tourist levy for years.
Like many of my constituents in Romford, I have always enjoyed visiting Wales.
However, for many, this visitor levy will be a step too far; it is bound to deter tourism to the Principality.
Does the Secretary of State agree with me that we should be encouraging and championing British domestic tourism, not inhibiting it?
There are a number of assumptions in the hon.
Member’s question.
As I say, more than 40 countries and holiday destinations around the world have introduced a form of visitor levy, and many of us have paid levies when visiting other countries.
As I say, one of the Conservatives’ own councils is championing a tourist levy.
They need to do their research better.
What recent discussions she has had with Cabinet colleagues on increasing economic growth in Wales.
Economic growth is the No. 1 priority for this Government.
Our new industrial strategy and national wealth fund will boost economic growth, create jobs and drive up living standards across Wales.
Working alongside ministerial colleagues, I was pleased to confirm £320 million of funding for the two investment zones in Wales, and to give the green light for Welsh freeports.
Together, these will unlock billions in private investment and create over 20,000 jobs in our ports and communities.
I, too, wish Wales luck in the Six Nations, but I wish Scotland more luck.
Scotland, like Wales, is set to benefit from significant tax incentives and investment, under the UK Government’s freeports scheme.
Does the Secretary of State agree that the scheme offers an excellent opportunity for economic growth?
