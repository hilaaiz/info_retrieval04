Investment is what makes us more prosperous; it produces more work, it gets wages rising and it creates good jobs.
I am an East Midlands MP, and we have some of the lowest investment rates in the country, the least transport infrastructure and some of the lowest private investment.
That is why I welcome the announcement today of £1 billion going to the manufacturing and logistics hub at East Midlands airport.
I especially welcome the 2,000 extra jobs that will benefit my constituents in Loughborough, Shepshed and Hathern.
Will the Chief Secretary assure me that this is just the beginning of the investment we can expect in the region and for my constituents?
