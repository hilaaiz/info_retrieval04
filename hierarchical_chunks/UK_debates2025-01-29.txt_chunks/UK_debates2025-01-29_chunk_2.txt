Whether she has had discussions with the Welsh Government on the potential impact of the proposed visitor levy on the economy in Wales.
Ahead of the opening game of this year’s Six Nations in Paris on Friday evening, I know Members right across the House will want to join me in wishing the Wales team good luck in their campaign.
Wales has joined a long list of other countries that have introduced a visitor levy, including Germany, Spain and France.
The Welsh Government’s Bill will enable local authorities to decide whether to implement a small levy locally.
The money raised will be used to invest in Wales’s thriving tourist sector, and develop and maintain attractions for residents and visitors alike.
Hospitality businesses in my constituency of Bridlington and The Wolds are rightly concerned about Labour’s plans for a tourist tax in Wales, so will the Secretary of State confirm to the House today whether it is her Government’s policy to roll out such a tax across the United Kingdom?
As the hon.
Member may know, tourism is devolved, and we work closely with the devolved Governments.
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport—my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for that Department is here—will carefully monitor the proposal by the Welsh Government.
There are currently no plans to introduce a similar tax in England.
