I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend.
What discussions she has had with the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero on meeting net zero targets in Wales.
I am working with the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero to ensure that Wales plays a leading role in reaching our net zero targets and clean power by 2030.
By supporting floating offshore wind, onshore wind, hydrogen, nuclear, tidal and carbon capture, we are seizing the unique economic opportunity of net zero to boost growth and create jobs across Wales.
On floating offshore wind in the Celtic sea, the Secretary of State said: “Floating offshore wind represents a golden opportunity” not just for meeting net zero targets but “for lower energy bills, new jobs and the industries of the future”.
Do the Government think that the opportunities from offshore wind can extend from the Celtic sea into Cornwall and Devon, too?
The economic opportunities of floating offshore wind are significant, and, obviously, the Celtic sea is a big area off parts of both England and Wales.
We are working closely to seize those economic opportunities to deliver jobs and growth, and we want to see economic growth and jobs throughout the United Kingdom.
