I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising the issue.
His constituents will be angry and frustrated at the empty, unfunded promises left by the Conservatives.
Let us be clear, under their non-plan, North Devon district hospital would simply not have been delivered—it was not just delayed; it was never going to be delivered.
Conservative Members know  that, the hon.
Gentleman knows that and his constituents know that.
We have put in place a funded, deliverable plan that will see the hospital built, and we will work closely with the trust to accelerate work.
The Conservative party owes his constituents an apology.
