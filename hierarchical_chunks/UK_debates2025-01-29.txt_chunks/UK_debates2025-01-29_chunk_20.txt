The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 29 January.
Communities across the United Kingdom have been hit hard by Storm Éowyn.
I spoke to the leaders of the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland over the weekend to discuss working with them on the support that is required, and to pay tribute to all those responding on the frontline.
Kick-starting economic growth is the No. 1 mission of this Government.
It will put more money in people’s pockets and will deliver on our plan for change.
Today the Chancellor announced our next steps to deliver that plan: a new Oxford-Cambridge corridor, redeveloping Old Trafford, and supporting a new runway at Heathrow.
We are removing the barriers to investment, supporting innovation, and going further and faster to boost growth.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
This April the state pension will increase by £470 a year, and over the course of this Parliament it will increase by up to £1,900, benefiting millions of  pensioners.
Does the Prime Minister agree that means-testing the state pension would do severe harm, and will he confirm that this Government will always protect the state pension and the triple lock?
Let me be absolutely clear: there will be no means-testing of the state pension under this Labour Government.
We are committed both to the triple lock and to the principle that people should receive pensions based on their contribution, regardless of their wealth.
My hon.
Friend is right: 12 million pensioners will receive a £470 increase in April.
When people such as the Leader of the Opposition say that they want means-testing, that means a cut.
The difference between us is that they would cut pensions and we are increasing them.
