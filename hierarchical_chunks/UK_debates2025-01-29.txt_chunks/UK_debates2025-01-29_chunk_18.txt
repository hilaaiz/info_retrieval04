I thank the Minister for her response.
I am incredibly passionate about animal welfare—I have a dog and a cat—and for the most part we are an animal-loving country.
That is why I find it so shocking that we still have practices such as greyhound racing that treat animals as disposable.
If they do not run fast enough or if they get injured, they get binned off.
Some of them are still spending 80% of their life in kennels.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss this issue further?
