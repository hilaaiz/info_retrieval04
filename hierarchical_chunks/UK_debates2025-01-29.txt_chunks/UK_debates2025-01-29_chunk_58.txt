I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a strong advocate for the economy in the East Midlands and for his constituency.
He will know that I visited the region last week and met businesses and investors with our Mayor, Claire Ward.
The region is doing a brilliant job of securing inward investment, and there is huge untapped potential in the East Midlands.
I am pleased that the Chancellor was able to make those announcements today, and we very much look forward to hearing about more business cases and more potential so that we can unlock growth in the East Midlands.
