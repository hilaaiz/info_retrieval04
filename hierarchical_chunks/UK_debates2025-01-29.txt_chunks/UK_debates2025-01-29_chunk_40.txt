The Prime Minister may know that, this time last week, representatives of those who have been injured seriously  by covid vaccines were giving evidence to the covid inquiry, including my constituent, Kate Scott.
I hope he also knows that the compensation available to those people is not adequate and is not adequately accessible.
I am grateful to the Health and Social Care Secretary for the thought that I know he is giving to how that position may be remedied, but may I ask the Prime Minister to give his personal support to that objective, not just because it is the right thing to do for the people affected, but because it will support the objective that we should all share, which is to maintain public confidence in vaccination?
