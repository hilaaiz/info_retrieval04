Mrs. STEEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Dr. Al Mijares' service to Orange County as the Orange County Superintendent.
Dr. Mijares has served as the Orange County Superintendent of Schools since August 2012, where he led Orange County educators in equipping our students with all the necessary tools to ``lead the nation in college and career readiness and success.''
Under his leadership, the Orange County Department of Education was able to help students from Orange County outperform the state and regional averages.
Dr. Mijares should be commended for all his hard work throughout his career and his dedication to educating the next generation.
