Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen for their deep and abiding allyship to the LGBTQ+ community.
They did so early in their careers, at a time when we were without many allies who would stand with us.
Their courage is to be commended.
Ted Danson is known to many through his leading roles on hit TV shows and movies, like ``Cheers'' and ``The Good Place.''
He has used his platform as a bully pulpit, fervently championing marriage equality and vocally opposing discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.
He has used his star power for good, raising money for LGBTQ+ advocacy groups that fight for a more just and equal society.
By bringing the power of his celebrity to bear, Danson exemplifies the profound impact public figures can have in shaping a more inclusive and accepting society.
Mary Steenburgen has built a career on playing warm and wise characters--winning an Oscar along the way--but also one deeply entwined with advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community.
From ``Philadelphia'' to ``Happiest Season,'' she has found ways to use her public persona to advance the cause of LGBTQ+ rights and visibility.
Rarely has any one person been able to combine their artistry and advocacy into one, complete body of work.
She is a wonder.
