Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Brightmoor Connection, a community food bank and so much more, as they officially open the doors of their new location in Detroit and announce their newest programming and partnerships within this community space.
Brightmoor Connection grew out of a consortium of 9 local churches who came together in 2008 in order to address growing food scarcity concerns for local families.
More than that, their unique client-choice approach affords residents dignity while they receive the help they need.
In their new space, Brightmoor Connection will grow its network will also launch their newest youth programming for young entrepreneurs.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in celebrating the opening of Brightmoor Connection's new location and announcement of its new programs and services to our community.
