Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 36-year-old Minneapolis Police Officer, Jamal Mitchell, who was killed in the line of duty in Minneapolis on Thursday, May 30, 2024.
Officer Jamal Mitchell joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 2022.
Those who knew Officer Mitchell saw him as a community leader, a changemaker and a peacekeeper.
Officer Jamal Mitchell will be remembered for his compassion, bravery, and love of people.
His courageous efforts were apparent early on when he saved an elderly couple from a burning home.
Officer Mitchell showed up to work every day to help keep our communities safe.
He was known to have a big heart and chose to use his love of people to help strengthen our communities and support young people.
Even as a police officer, Officer Mitchell found time to give back to the community by helping coach first- and second-grade boys' basketball teams.
Officer Mitchell died a hero and will be dearly missed by those who knew and loved him.
He is survived by his partner, mother, stepfather, siblings, and his children.
