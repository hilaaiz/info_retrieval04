Ms. FOXX.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge members of the Association of Equipment Distributors from all over the country who are in D.C. this week for their annual fly-in.
In fact, some of them are joining us in the gallery tonight.
These great men and women are entrepreneurs who provide millions of pieces of equipment to all kinds economy.
They deserve our admiration and thanks.
They certainly have mine.
