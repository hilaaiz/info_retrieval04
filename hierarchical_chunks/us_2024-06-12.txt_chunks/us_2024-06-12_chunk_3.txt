Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career.
Robert Simari, executive vice chancellor for the University of Kansas Medical Center, who will be retiring from the University of Kansas on June 30, 2024.
Dr. Simari's career has been marked by a distinguished commitment to uplifting the medical community and paving the way for critical medical research and advancements.
The staff and students at KU are fortunate to have had Dr. Simari as a part of their community throughout his career.
Dr. Simari graduated from the KU School of Medicine in 1986 before going on to serve as vice chairman of the Mayo Clinic's Division.
He then returned to KU as executive dean of the School of Medicine from 2014 to 2019.
Dr. Simari then began serving in his most recent position as executive vice chancellor of the KU Medical Center, where he has been credited with leading the Center during a particularly transformational period.
He took part in hiring the deans of the schools of Medicine and Nursing, helped the KU Cancer Center earn comprehensive designation from the National Cancer Institute, led a commitment to building a valued and respected workforce, and helped grow KU's research infrastructure in such a way as to enhance KU's status of one of the Nation's top research institutions.
As KU continues to produce excellent medical professionals, cuttingedge researchers, and lifesaving health discoveries, we will have Dr. Simari's legacy to thank.
His service to the Kansas City community and the medical community at large will be forever cemented by these contributions, and I'm incredibly grateful for his lifelong dedication to the health and well-being of our region.
