Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Borba Dairy Family as they are awarded the title of 2024 Dairy Family of the Year.
Frank G. Borba.
Sr. immigrated from the Azores Islands of Portugal to the United States in 1914 at the age of 18.
He worked various jobs until he had the opportunity to start his own dairy in 1924.
In 1920, Frank married Esperanza (Belmeira) Berberia and they welcomed their son Frank Jr. in 1928.
In 1939, the dairy moved to its current location in Porterville, California.
Frank Jr. worked on his father's dairy and took over operations in 1951.
In 1953, he married Nadine Bettencourt.
Together they had 5 children--Susanna, Frank, Chris, Eric, and Mary-- who were raised on the family dairy.
In 2000, a partnership was formed that established Borba Dairy.
Today, the family operates three dairies and takes great pride in their family-owned business.
This June, the Tulare Chamber of Commerce, Tulare County Dairy Women, and California Milk Advisory Board are hosting the Annual Salute to Dairy and Dairy Princess Coronation in celebration.
Each year, Salute to Dairy recognizes a local dairy family for their dedication to the dairy industry and engagement with the community.
The Borba Dairy Family is being recognized due to their longstanding commitment to producing quality dairy products and continuing their family legacy.
