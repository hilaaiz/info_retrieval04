Lieutenant Colonel Burgos has led with tenacity as the Garrison Commander of Picatinny Arsenal since June 2022.
The installation employs more than 6,000 employees, all of whom he cares for as his own family.
His leadership has prioritized the quality of life of the soldiers, civilians, and families.
Lieutenant Colonel Burgos has shaped Picatinny Arsenal into a world class workplace, home, and mainstay of the New Jersey economy.
During his time at Picatinny, Lieutenant Colonel Burgos has also been a valued partner to me and to my team.
His expertise, openness, and willingness to think outside the box have strengthened my work in Congress and made me a better, more effective advocate for our service members and their families.
I also especially appreciate his service on my Academy Nomination Board to help recognize our next generation of military leaders as they look to attend the military service academies.
I extend my most heartfelt thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Burgos, and his family, for their 19 years of service and sacrifice.
I congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Burgos on his next assignment at the Army War College and look forward to his continued success.
