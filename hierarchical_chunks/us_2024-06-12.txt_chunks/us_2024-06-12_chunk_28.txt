Mrs. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor David Casey and his 29 years of public service and dedication to the City of Pomona with the Operative Plasterers' and Cement Masons' International Association, Plasterers' Local 200.
David joined the union in 1995 and became a business agent for the union in 2012.
In 2022, he was appointed as a business manager for the Plasterers' Local 200.
Throughout his time with the union, he also served on the Apprenticeship Committee mentoring the next generation of plasterers entering the field.
In 2001, David was instrumental in leading a ``Labor to Neighbor'' program in the City.
This program was designed to help seniors improve their homes while beautifying the neighborhood.
Through the Plasterers' Union Apprenticeship Program, led by David, local apprentices would work to re-plaster homes of pre-approved low-income seniors.
David officially retired on March 24, 2024.
I hope that he gets to rest and enjoy time with his wife, Cyndee, and children, Jason, Kerry, and Stewart.
We are grateful for his service to our community.
For his outstanding accomplishments, it is my honor to recognize union leader David Casey.
His years of civic service are worthy of commendation.
