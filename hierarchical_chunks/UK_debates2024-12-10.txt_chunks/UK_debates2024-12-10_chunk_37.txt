I thank the Minister for the statement, and express my sympathies for those affected and my thanks to emergency and utility workers for all their efforts over the weekend.
The storm was of great significance in constituencies such as mine.
I appreciate what the Minister has said on the efforts and conversations between the UK Government and the Welsh Government.
Can she say any more on that, and assure us that the lessons to be learned from this storm—on resilience and dealing with any future storms—will be shared with all of us in this House, as well as our colleagues in Wales?
