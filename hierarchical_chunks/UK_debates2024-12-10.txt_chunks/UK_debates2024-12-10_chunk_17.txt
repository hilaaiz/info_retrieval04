I thank the Secretary of State for that answer—I hope to have the chance to meet her to discuss it in more detail.
The Liberal Democrats are deeply concerned about survivors who have been told that, as it stands, their abuser is set to be released early.
One such survivor is Elizabeth Hudson, who I met on the set of “Good Morning Britain” today when launching this campaign.
She has written to Ministers about her concerns, but says that she has not received a response.
Will the Secretary of State meet Elizabeth and me to discuss her case and how survivors can be respected and protected?
