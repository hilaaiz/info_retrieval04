There are no specific domestic abuse offences in law, so abusers hiding behind convictions such as actual bodily harm are being let out early under the SDS40 early release scheme.
That is not right, so I have introduced the Domestic Abuse (Aggravated Offences) Bill to create a specific set of domestic abuse aggravated offences—a bit like racially aggravated offences—that could be excluded from early release schemes.
Women’s Aid is backing my Bill; will the Secretary of State back it, too?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to note that, under current legislation, it is possible to exclude only offences, rather than classes of offender.
I am sure that his Bill will gain some interest across the House.
If any such changes were to be made, they would be for the future, as they do not help us with the current crisis.
I will ensure to discuss the details of his Bill with the Home Secretary.
