I believe that all who have written have received a response from the Ministry, but I will chase down that specific case.
The way we implemented the policy meant that we were able to give the Probation Service time to prepare which was not available to it under the previous Tory Government’s end of custody supervised licence scheme.
That means that all victims who were supposed to be notified under the victim contact scheme have been notified.
What discussions she has had with the chief coroner on reporting sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
I recently met the chief coroner.
We did not discuss the specifics of this issue, but coroners have a statutory duty to investigate deaths that are not reported to them if they suspect that the cause is unknown, violent or unnatural, or that the death occurred in custody or other state detention.
The charity SUDEP Action, which is based in my Oxfordshire constituency of Didcot and Wantage, provides specialist support for bereaved families.
Improvements to the coroner service would help to reduce trauma, improve understanding of the causes of death, and enable more research to aid prevention of future deaths.
Will the Minister press for more investment in, and support for, the coroner service?
The Government recognise the impact of delays and the other issues facing coroners at the moment, and the impact that that is having on bereaved families and the wider systems.
We welcome the recent Justice Committee report on the coroner service, and I look forward to working closely with the chief coroner, local authorities and key partners to devise and deliver a wider strategy for those services.
What assessment she has made of the potential merits of insourcing all prison maintenance.
My hon.
Friend is right to ask this question.
Under the previous Government, a process was already under way to put in place new contracts for prison maintenance.
We need to make sure that those contracts deliver good value for the public purse.
