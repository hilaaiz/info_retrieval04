I welcome that response from the Minister.
Gambling addiction destroys lives.
In fact, on average, 496 gambling-related suicides occur every year.
It is not just the lives of the gamblers that get destroyed; there is an invisible group of victims—the families who have to pick up the pieces.
A local charity in my constituency—Spinney Hill drugs, alcohol and addiction support—told me of a talented young man from a deprived socioeconomic background whose family saved every single penny to send him to university.
He spent that and more on gambling because of his addiction.
The family are now in spiralling debt, and the whole family unit has been destroyed.
Does the Minister agree that gambling companies should pay a levy to help compensate families, especially when children are becoming addicted?
