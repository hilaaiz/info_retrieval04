I thank the Minister for coming to the House to explain what has been going on in relation to Storm Darragh.
Like everyone I thank the emergency services, and I also thank Monmouthshire county council for all the work it did this weekend.
Over 2 million households lost power this weekend, including a group of constituents in Llangybi, one of whom was extremely vulnerable.
Will the Minister share with us how many households have been reconnected?
