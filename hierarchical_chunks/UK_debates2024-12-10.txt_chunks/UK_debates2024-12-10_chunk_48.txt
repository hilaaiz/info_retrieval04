I thank the hon.
Member for her question, and express sympathy with what her constituents are going through.
I am disappointed to hear that constituents face difficulty in connecting to networks.
We are trying our best to work with networks on the wider lessons for the future.
If she writes to me directly about these matters, we can certainly explore the issue further.
