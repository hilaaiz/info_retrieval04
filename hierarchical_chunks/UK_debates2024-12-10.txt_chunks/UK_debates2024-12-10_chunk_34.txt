The UK Government have been working closely with our counterparts in the Welsh Government—the hon.
Member raised concerns about that.
My right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster spoke to the First Minister on Friday, and we are continuing to work closely together.
I hope that reassures the hon.
Member on that aspect.
In my response I set out how work is under way to resolve the situation of properties without power and affected by flooding, which the hon.
Gentleman rightly pointed out.
More broadly, we are continuing to work with partners to ensure that the disruption is addressed as soon as possible, and that support is provided to those affected.
I hope that the hon.
Gentleman feels reassured that we are constantly monitoring the work that we have done to see how to improve for future floods and storms.
The Government are taking this seriously, and I hope the whole House supports these efforts.
I echo the sentiments of my hon.
Friend and  the hon.
Member for Ceredigion Preseli (Ben Lake)  about the people who lost their lives and all those who have been affected by flooding.
Those of us in communities that have been flooded know how desperate the impact is, not just in the immediate aftermath but for months afterwards.
Flood victims often say that they have received false warnings on so many occasions that when the warnings come, they often do not have faith in them.
What are the Government doing to improve the reliability of those warnings, so that we are better informed?
What  are they doing to ensure that the public are better educated about the limitations of the warnings that we get from the Environment Agency?
