The Minister referred to court chaos.
A tribunal judge and a court worker from my Taunton and Wellington constituency wrote to me.
The tribunal judge said: “tribunals are being cancelled every day as they say there are not enough judges to cover the cases.
This is absolutely not the case,” and “People are waiting months for their benefit appeals in appalling poverty and again we cannot deal with the cases because of this limit” on sitting days.
What will the Minister do to increase sitting days in Taunton and Somerset courts?
We are investing in increased court capacity and in the recruitment of 1,000 judges and tribunal members.
As the Lord Chancellor said, we have increased the number of Crown court sitting days by 500, but it is not simply enough to increase court sitting days.
We have to look at fundamental reform to address the serious backlogs we have inherited from the Conservative Government.
What steps her Department is taking through the criminal justice system to help support victims of gambling-related crimes.
The Government are determined to provide support for all victims of crime.
That includes publicly consulting on a new revised victims code in the new year.
I remind the hon.
Member that the Minister for Gambling in the other place recently announced a legally mandated levy on gambling companies to address gambling harm and to introduce NHS-led treatment and support.
