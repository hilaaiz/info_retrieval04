I thank my hon.
Friend.
Tagging technology can monitor offenders effectively in the community.
We have tags that monitor curfews and exclusion zones, tags to impose home detention—in effect, the equivalent of house arrest—and sobriety tags with a 97% compliance rate.
We are currently looking at expanding the use of technology to improve productivity in the Probation Service.
We will also fund an additional 5,000 new tags to expand the use of tech outside prison.
