As my hon.
Friend mentions, up to 2.3 million customers lost power during the storm.
As of this morning, as I mentioned, just under 24,000 customers are without power.
The Government have been reassured that the operators are due to reconnect them all by tomorrow.
I join the House in paying tribute to the emergency services, including Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service and Dyfed-Powys police, as well as Powys county council in my constituency, which have been working tirelessly to keep people safe over the past few days.
Communities across Wales, including in my constituency, have been battered by this storm only a few weeks after already taking significant damage from Storm Bert.
Many of my constituents in the Swansea valley were left without power for over 48 hours and some may not have power restored until Thursday.
Likewise, many water supplies have been disrupted and towns such as Builth Wells have experienced significant flooding.
What support are the UK Government providing to Wales to ensure that power is restored as soon as possible to those households?
I send my sympathy to the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents who are still directly affected.
Our priority is to ensure that everyone without power is reconnected as quickly as possible.
Our colleagues in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero have been receiving regular updates from the Energy Networks Association on electricity outages.
Work is being done swiftly to ensure that those who are directly affected get their power back as soon as possible.
