We are currently reviewing the flooding formula, which will address some of the issues that my hon.
Friend has raised.
We work very closely with the devolved Administrations, local resilience authorities and emergency responders regularly on how we can address this issue.
The UK Resilience Academy will be launched in April next year, and it will be a great way for us to look at the lessons learned and at how we can strengthen our responses to such issues.
As I mentioned, we have set up a flood resilience taskforce, which looks at constituencies such as the hon.
Member’s to make sure that they are not affected.
The Government will invest £22.4 billion until March 2026 in improving flood resilience and better protecting communities across the country.
DSIT is also looking at UK power networks to see what role they could play.
On the emergency alerts that were issued on Friday, we are looking at the lessons learned to see how they could be used effectively if we roll them out in the future.
Like my hon.
Friend, I recognise the impact the storm has had on individuals.
We have been working closely with the Welsh Government on the civil contingencies response structures in response to Storm Darragh, and have convened an all-Wales civil contingencies committee.
Officials in the UK Government regularly engage with the Welsh Government on this matter, and ensure that local responders are working effectively.
We will be looking to see what else we can learn from this situation.
