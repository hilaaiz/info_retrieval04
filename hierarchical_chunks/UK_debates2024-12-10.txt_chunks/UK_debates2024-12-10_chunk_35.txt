I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point and talking about the impact on his constituents and those across the country.
The Met Office warnings are based on judgments made by highly trained staff who have carefully collaborated to provide instructive advice to people, businesses, transport operators and emergency responders on a storm’s impact on customer disruption.
In this particular situation, the emergency alert was sent to approximately 3 million people across Wales and the south-west on  Friday 6 December .
It reached the people who needed to be reached really effectively.
