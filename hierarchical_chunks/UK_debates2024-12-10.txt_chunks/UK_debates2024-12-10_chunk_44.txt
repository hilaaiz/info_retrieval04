I thank my neighbour  the hon.
Member for Ceredigion Preseli (Ben Lake)  for asking the urgent question.
Let me add my voice to the chorus of voices thanking the emergency services, and also pay tribute to communities and local businesses such as the Hand in Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, in my constituency.
The storm brought out the best in society, which is what the worst weather sometimes does.
Will my hon.
Friend join me in paying tribute to local businesses and civic society for all their work in helping those most affected by the storm?
