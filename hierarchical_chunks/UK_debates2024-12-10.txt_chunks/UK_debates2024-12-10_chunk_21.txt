I thank the Minister very much for that response.
One story that has been quite prevalent in the press over the past two months has been the amount of mould growth in prisons, which will obviously lead to health issues.
Will the new prison maintenance service that the Minister has referred to be able to deal with that specific issue?
If it is not dealt with, it will lead to ill health among those who are in prison.
