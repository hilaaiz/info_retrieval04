Local businesses, local resilience forums and emergency services have played a powerful role, and it has been great to see communities and businesses come together to address these problems, so I echo my hon.
Friend’s thanks.
These storms are becoming more frequent, and we in Scotland probably have more experience of them than most, but there is a prevailing sense that we are lurching from one storm to the next.
In the case of Storm Bert, for example, it was felt that the Met Office did not issue enough warnings early enough.
To what extent is the Minister bringing the four nations together to share what they have learned from the various storms so that we can respond to them better?
The Government have been working closely with devolved Administrations, and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster organised a call on Friday to see what work could be done with them collaboratively.
A meeting was held to establish which areas were directly affected and where there were threats to life, and an alert was issued as quickly as possible to those areas in particular.
However, we recognise that there was some delay in the conveying of information, so we are working with operators to see how they can get the message out as speedily as possible in the event of another storm of this kind.
Will the Minister please give us an update om the extent of the floods that resulted from the storm?
Rural constituencies such as mine experienced a double whammy: we were battered by the storm, and then we were deluged once again by flooding.
That double problem is also much more sustained.
A lot of work has been done in this regard, but if my hon.
Friend writes to me I shall be able to respond to her directly and adequately.
