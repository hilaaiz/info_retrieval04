I thank  the hon.
Member for Ceredigion Preseli (Ben Lake) , who asked an excellent question and raised this important issue today.
My thoughts also are with those who tragically lost their lives this weekend and with their families, and with all the communities who have been so terribly affected by the storm.
I have immense gratitude, as I am sure we all do, for our emergency services, utility companies staff and local communities, who have responded with such effectiveness and compassion.
