Like my hon.
Friend, I recognise the impact the storm has had on individuals.
We have been working closely with the Welsh Government on the civil contingencies response structures in response to Storm Darragh, and have convened an all-Wales civil contingencies committee.[Official Report,  6 January 2025 ; Vol. 759, c. 3WC.]
(Correction) Officials in the UK Government regularly engage with the Welsh Government on this matter, and ensure that local responders are working effectively.
We will be looking to see what else we can learn from this situation.
