I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question and for his efforts over the weekend to provide advice and support to constituents.
As he mentioned, many households across north and mid-Wales have been particularly affected by the damage and disruption caused by Storm Darragh.
Again, I extend my sympathy to all those who have been affected by power cuts, flooding and other disruptions, which I know will have been distressing.
Again, I pay tribute to the emergency services and utility workers in north and mid Wales who are continuing to work hard to support the households affected.
