Ms. GRANGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman, a true american hero, and a beloved member of the Montrose, Colorado, community--Betty Jeanne Hayes.
Today, Betty celebrates her 100th birthday, and I can think of no better way to mark this occasion than by recognizing her lifelong dedication to service, during World War II and throughout her years in our community.
Betty Hayes embodies the courage and resilience of the `Greatest Generation.'
In the early 1940s, when our country faced one of its darkest hours, Betty answered the call as a `Rosie the Riveter.'
At North American Aviation in Kansas City, she worked to build B-25 bombers, aircraft that played a crucial role in the war effort.
Betty and women like her stepped into roles that were then unconventional, taking on tasks vital to our Nation's success.
For nearly two years, she worked diligently, earning 95 cents an hour and, more importantly, earning the gratitude of a Nation.
Her contributions enabled our servicemen, including her own husband, Rudy Neill, to serve on the front lines.
When Rudy returned, deeply affected by the war, Betty stood by him, raising their three children with love and determination.
After the war, Betty continued her commitment to service.
She worked at TWA in the accounting department, applying the same care she brought to her wartime work.
Even after retiring over 30 years ago, she found new ways to serve.
Since moving to Montrose, Betty has become a pillar of the community, volunteering with organizations like Christ's Kitchen, Shepherd's Hand, and Region 10.
At 100, she still gives her time to the Warrior Resource Center every Monday.
Her warmth, kindness, and dedication to veterans have made her invaluable to the Center.
As Amy Eifling, the volunteer coordinator, put it: `She is sweet, has kind words, and is uplifting.
She makes all of us better.'
Betty's service hasn't gone unnoticed.
This year, she was named Woman of the Year at the Women of Distinction event, reflecting the deep respect she commands.
Her daughter, Sherry Neill, calls her a role model and pioneer--one of those women who stepped up during a time of need and never stopped serving.
