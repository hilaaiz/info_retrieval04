Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the successes of Chieftain Elementary School in Logan, Ohio, as they were recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School for 2024.
I have had the privilege of visiting the Logan-Hocking school district and the compassion and care the teachers, staff, and administrators, have for their students always stands out.
They are committed not just to the academic success of their students, but also to caring deeply about the well-being of each and every one of their students.
They are invested in the success of their students because they know it will result in the success of their community.
A happy and healthy student is a student who is ready to succeed.
I want to thank the talented teachers and staff for their dedication to Ohio's youth
and I commend Chieftain Elementary on this incredible recognition.
