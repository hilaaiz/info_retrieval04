Mr. SUOZZI.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the 80th Anniversary of the Polish American Congress, which was established by over 2,600 individuals and representatives of Polish organizations in Buffalo on May 28, 1944, just days before the Normandy Invasion.
The purpose of the Polish American Congress was to fight for a free and sovereign Poland which had been attacked in 1939 by Nazi Germany, the Slovak Army, and by the Soviet Union.
As a result of the Second World War, Poland lost between five and 11 million people due to the genocide committed by the occupying forces and border changes.
After the Yalta Conference of 1945, Poland fell under communist rule and lost 20 percent of its territory.
It was then that the Polish American Congress was founded and committed itself to helping the Polish nation.
The achievements of the Polish American Congress include: 1948: advocacy for legislation that allowed 140,000 Polish displaced persons and veterans of the Polish armed forces, who fought against Nazi Germany, to settle permanently in the U.S. 1950: supporting the creation of Radio Free Europe as a voice of truth for the people.
1952:
pressuring the House of Representatives to investigate the Katyn Forest Massacre.
The investigation found that the Soviet Union was responsible for the mass execution of Polish military officers in World War II. 1980s: support for Solidarity, a movement that eventually contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the fall of communism in Poland in 1989.
1999: support for Poland's admission into NATO, signed and supported by President Bill Clinton.
2019:
successful conclusion of the multi-year lobbying effort to include Poles in the Visa Waiver Program.
2022:
raising thousands of dollars for the Polish Red Cross and Ukrainian Relief efforts to welcome over one million Ukrainian refugees into Poland in response to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine.
