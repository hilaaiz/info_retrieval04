Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New Hampshire's 2025 Teacher of the Year, Candice DeAngelis.
For 18 years, Candice has dedicated her life to being an educator and creating a real impact on the lives of students who come through her classroom.
She represents all of what it means to be an amazing teacher: compassionate, friendly, and a lifelong learner.
From the beginning of Candice's career teaching Spanish in Londonderry and Kingston to now at Bedford High School, she has always cared deeply about her students.
Her students are always excited to go to her class because she makes learning a new language fun and exciting.
She always has a smile on her face and is not only ready to teach her students but is also ready to learn from them.
The care and dedication that Candice has for her students comes down to an individual level.
She always makes an effort to get to know them beyond just learning their name.
Understanding how each of her students learn is an important step in getting them to understand a new language.
Candice also works to create lasting memories with her students that will stick with them long after they leave her class.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I congratulate Candice for being named New Hampshire's 2025 Teacher of the Year.
I wish Candice, her family, and her students all the best in the years to come as she continues dedicating her life to education.
