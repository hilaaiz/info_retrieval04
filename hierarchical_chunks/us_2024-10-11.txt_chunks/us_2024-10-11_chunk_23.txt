Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the indomitable spirit and extraordinary life of Wes Selvidge; a true icon whose legacy transcends the ordinary.
Born on August 8, 1942, Wes was not just a man; he was a force of nature, embodying the essence of California's oldest ranching traditions.
Raised amidst the vast expanse of the Tracy Ranch in Buttonwillow, Wes lived and breathed the farming life, etching his name alongside pioneers.
In 1971, he co-founded the Buttonwillow Land and Cattle Company, a testament to his enduring commitment to the land that shaped him.
Wes's agricultural prowess, keen intellect, and unyielding desire to learn elevated him to the ranks of respected growers, contributing significantly to the diverse crops he cultivated.
Wes's influence extended far beyond the fields.
Engaging in a rich tapestry of activities, he raced motorcycles and cars, soared the skies on hang gliders, worked cattle with ranching comrades, and piloted planes and helicopters with a natural finesse.
A licensed pilot since his teenage years, Wes not only competed nationally in aerobatic competitions but also treated countless individuals to their maiden flights.
His love for speed wasn't confined to the air; it translated to the ground with a passion for cars.
From a Model A hot rod built at age 14 to a collection of meticulously restored vehicles, Wes's mechanical acumen was impressive.
Beyond these adventures, Wes was a craftsman and a restorer.
His dedication to restoring sunken boats from the depths of Lake Tahoe showcased not just his skills but his determination to turn forgotten treasures into award-winning beauties.
Wes faced over 18 years of health challenges with a resilience that mirrored his zest for life.
Throughout this journey, his steadfast partner of 59 years, Janet, stood by his side, a testament to a love that weathered the storms.
In Wes's passing, we celebrate a life that embraced adventure, challenged norms, and left an indelible mark on all who were fortunate enough to know him.
His legacy lives on in his family: his wife Janet, daughter Andrea, son Jason, and, undoubtedly his proudest achievement, his four grandsons--John, Clay, Owen, and Zachary.
May we draw inspiration from Wes Selvidge's enduring spirit and the richness of a life well-lived.
I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who mourn the loss of this remarkable Californian.
