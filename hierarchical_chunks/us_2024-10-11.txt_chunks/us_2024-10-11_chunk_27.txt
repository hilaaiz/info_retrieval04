Mr. Sorensen was born on June 30, 1925, in Fresno, CA.
He grew up in Mendota, CA before moving to Fresno where he graduated from Fresno High School in 1944.
After graduating, he served our country and joined the U.S. Navy during World War II.
When he came back home, he worked at his family's machine works business in Mendota until he moved back to Fresno and started WECO, a welding supply business.
Art was not 
Mr. Sorensen's initial career.
Prior to his legacy as an artist, he had been a draftsman, inventor, a partner in farm equipment and manufacturing, and a welder.
His interest and career in art started because of his son, John, who took an art class at McLane High School and asked him for help with welding.
After that, 
Mr. Sorensen took art classes as well--kickstarting his legendary career as one of Fresno's most revered artists.
Sorensen's impact extended beyond his beautiful sculptures when he began the Chris Sorensen Studio in the early 1990s.
This studio brought artists in Fresno together to work on their art, providing the original home for Fresno's ArtHop.
Now, ArtHop is spread out through multiple locations in the city and is held on the first and third Thursday of every month, providing a space for the community to come together to appreciate and enjoy the work of our local artists.
Sorensen's gallery and art studio has been proclaimed the ``The Heart of Art in Fresno,'' bringing together artists for more than 30 years.
His specialty in welding landed him the nickname of ``Man of Steel,'' as he became known for his large metal sculptures.
His impressive sculptures and artistic prowess can be witnessed throughout the Valley, including a massive heart at St. Agnes Hospital, a metal tree on Friant Road, a life size mammoth in Madera, and a bulldog at his welding company, WECO.
