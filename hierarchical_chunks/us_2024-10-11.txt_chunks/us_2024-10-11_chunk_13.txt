Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the immense debt our Nation owes to the surviving family of servicemembers killed defending US interests and the cause of Liberty abroad.
Today, I am joined in bipartisan fashion by Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska in introducing a bill that recognizes their sacrifice by expanding healthcare benefits for Gold Star spouses.
Currently, surviving spouses retain healthcare coverage through TRICARE in the ``active-duty family member'' category for just three years after their servicemember passes away.
After three years, they automatically shift to ``retired family member'' status, which forces them to pay higher fees and out-of-pocket costs.
The debt our Nation owes to the brave men and women who make the ultimate sacrifice while serving overseas is not a debt that can be repaid within three years.
It is our sacred responsibility to honor their sacrifice by caring for their surviving spouses.
It is in this spirit that 
Representative Bacon and I are proud to introduce the bipartisan Gold Star Spouses Healthcare Enhancement Act.
This Act effectively removes the three-year limitation for spouses who meet criteria for the Gold Star lapel button.
It enables them to remain in ``active-duty family member'' status, reducing the costs and burden on those who have already sacrificed so much for our country.
Military service requires our young men and women to risk their lives fighting and defeating America's enemies.
They selflessly accept this risk to secure Liberty across the globe.
I encourage each of my colleagues to support the Gold Star Spouses Healthcare Enhancement Act as one small way to honor the debt we as a Nation owe those who answered the call to service and perished in defense of our Nation.
