The bond between the United States and Poland dates back to the Revolutionary War.
Casimir Pulaski, known as the `Father of the American Cavalry', was a leading commander in the South and died in the 1799 Battle.
Andrew Kosciusko was a colonel in the Continental Army, a military architect credited with the construction of fortifications at West Point in New York, and a close friend of Thomas Jefferson who dedicated his U.S. assets to the education and freedom of American slaves.
Millions of Poles have since emigrated to the United States.
During the Industrial Revolution, Polish immigrants contributed enormously to the economic flourishing of this country.
Polish values and culture, like the love of freedom, hard work, hospitality, and pride in family and community, are woven throughout the fabric.
Throughout its 80 year history, the Polish American Congress has remained committed to its mission: A free and sovereign Poland.
I congratulate this organization, which advocates for the nearly ten million Americans of Polish descent.
The Polish American Congress will meet this weekend in Chicago to celebrate its history of accomplishments, and I wish it many more decades of success as it plans for the future.
