Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and join the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation in celebrating the unveiling of the BIG hope sculpture by Chicago artist Matthew Hoffman.
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer present in women in the United States.
Over the course of 2024, it is expected that about 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women, and about 42,250 women will die from breast cancer.
These numbers are far too high.
Since 1985, the Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation has led the fight against breast cancer, raising funds for breast cancer research and doctors in the Chicagoland area.
This organization is named for Lynn Sage who died at only 39 years old as a result of her breast cancer.
The Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Foundation provides funding for research grants and fellowships.
The organization also holds the annual Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Symposium which assembles breast cancer research leaders from across the world.
The BIG hope sculpture is yet another example of their dedication to raising awareness of the fight against breast cancer.
This sculpture serves as a symbol of hope for those impacted by the disease, and it will raise funds which will support the Chicago Breast Cancer Research Consortium.
