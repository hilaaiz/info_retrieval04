Jorge's leadership was further highlighted in 2018 when the Grapevine-Colleyville ISD Board was awarded the Texas School Board of the Year, an honor that speaks to his forward-thinking approach and commitment to education.
His contributions have left an indelible mark on the district, shaping its future and enhancing the educational experience for countless students.
In addition to his work on the school board, Jorge founded the Exito Hispano program in 2011, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at empowering Hispanic parents through educational workshops.
These workshops provide essential information about public school programs, scholarships, universities, and academic opportunities, helping to bridge gaps and ensure that all Hispanic students in Grapevine-Colleyville ISD have the tools to graduate and pursue higher education.
Jorge Rodriguez's efforts to expand educational opportunities, empower Latino families, and promote youth development have made him a true champion for progress, inclusion, and a brighter future for all in Grapevine and the Hispanic community.
It is my pleasure to recognize Jorge Rodriguez for his exemplary contributions and unwavering dedication to North Texas, as well as congratulate him on receiving the 2024 Latino Service Award.
