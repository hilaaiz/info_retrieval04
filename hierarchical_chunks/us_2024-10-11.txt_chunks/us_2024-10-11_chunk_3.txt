Mr. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to celebrate a Northeast Bronx staple, Butler Memorial United Methodist Church, a place that has continued to be a center of community and worship for more than 100 years.
The Butler congregation initially met at the Williamsbridge Colored Men's Association in 1912.
The service was led by Reverend Gilbert Wilson.
After years of community service, the Church's membership increased, the church school had outgrown the available space, and expansion was urgently needed to the needs of the community.
In 1961 the Church broke ground on their current location, and in 1962 the congregation marched to the new Church.
In November of that year, the congregation held the cornerstone laying service in their new house of worship.
As the congregation continued to grow, so too did the services provided by Butler.
In 1981, the Church established a scholarship program to assist community youth, later other additional scholarships were offered.
The church began offering Thanksgiving services, and 8 a.m. services to accommodate increased parishioners.
Butler added more programming for community members including a weekly newsletter, bible study classes, an additional choir, and a Nurses' unit.
In 1995, Butler began its expansion program to provide services to individuals across the Borough.
After years of careful planning and hard work, Butler broke ground on their new educational facility in 2012.
The groundbreaking was followed by a 12 years of dedication and hard work to provide this service to the community.
Under the leadership.
Allen Pickney, Butler's 10th pastor, Butler completed the final phase of their expansion project, their Butler Memorial United Methodist Church Educational Wing.
I want to say thank you to the entire Butler community for providing spiritual, physical, and educational support to families around the Bronx.
I look forward to hearing about the Church's future successes.
