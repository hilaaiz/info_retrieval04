Mr. Speaker, Betty Hayes is more than a volunteer, more than a `Rosie the Riveter,' and more than a centenarian.
She is a shining example of the best.
Her story is one of selflessness, resilience, and unending generosity.
On behalf of this Congress, I wish Betty a very happy 100th birthday.
We honor her for her lifetime of service and thank her for reminding us all what it means to serve with humility, strength, and grace.
