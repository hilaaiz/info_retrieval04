I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
The Chancellor is sat near me, and I know that, through our discussions, we wanted to ensure that social care was protected.
That is why we confirmed £600 million of new grant funding for social care next year, an uplift to local government spending and an £86 million increase to the disabled facilities grant.
Our Employment Rights Bill will help deliver the first ever fair pay agreement for the social care sector as well, and we will also ensure that the NHS is funded to help with the social care situation.
