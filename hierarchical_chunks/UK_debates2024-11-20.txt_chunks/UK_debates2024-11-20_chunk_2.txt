The Secretary of State was asked— Whether he is taking steps to accelerate the roll-out of the shared rural network.
The Government and industry are working together to accelerate the shared rural network and deliver substantial improvements to outdoor 4G mobile coverage across the UK.
In the past few months, the Government have activated 13 publicly funded masts across the UK, and there are now 27 Government-funded extended area service mast upgrades delivering 4G. In my constituency, only 40, 50 and 60 miles away from this House, villages such as Cuddington are still complete mobile notspots.
Will the Minister explain how quickly the Government intend to move on activating the shared rural network, to ensure no rural community is left without a reliable mobile signal?
I know about Cuddington, because the hon.
Gentleman told me about it yesterday.
Cuddington is such a typical English village that it has featured in “Midsomer Murders”, which is fictional—a bit like the previous Government’s financial affairs.
I know we have said that the desire to please is not part of what Ministers are meant to do, but I do have a desire to please him and his constituents.
The Government will work as fast as we can with industry to try to develop 4G in his constituency.
I am happy to arrange for a meeting between him and my officials to ensure he has street-by-street analysis of how we can do that.
