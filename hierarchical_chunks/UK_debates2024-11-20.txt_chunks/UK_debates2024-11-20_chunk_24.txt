I thank my hon.
Friend for his expertise and his work before he came to this place.
Tory austerity has decimated neighbourhood policing.
We will put thousands more neighbourhood police and police community support officers back on our streets, to ensure that every community has a named local officer.
We will tackle illegal drugs, halve knife crime, crack down on antisocial behaviour and go after the gangs who lure young people into violence.
