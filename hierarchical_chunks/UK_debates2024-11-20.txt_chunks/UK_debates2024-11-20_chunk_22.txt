I thank my hon.
Friend for being such a champion for Plymouth.
As he knows, we are providing £25 billion extra over the next two years for the Department of Health and Social Care, including the largest real-terms capital budget since 2010.
We will ensure that every corner of the UK will see the generosity, and that services will improve for them.
I will make sure that he gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss in detail how Plymouth can capitalise on that.
