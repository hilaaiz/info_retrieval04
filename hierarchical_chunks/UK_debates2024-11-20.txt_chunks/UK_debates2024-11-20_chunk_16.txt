I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that sensitive issue.
It is absolutely horrifying to hear her account of it, and I agree that it is abhorrent.
Although the Human Tissue Authority strictly regulates the public display of human remains, with fines or imprisonment for breaches, it does not cover sales or purchases.
However, I will ensure that a meeting is arranged with the appropriate Minister to discuss the troubling cases that my hon.
Friend raises.
