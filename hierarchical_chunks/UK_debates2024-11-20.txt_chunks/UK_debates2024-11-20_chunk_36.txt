I welcome the Government’s announcements on neighbourhood policing.
We have already seen a real move in this direction in Staffordshire, under the leadership of the police, fire and crime commissioner, Ben Adams, and our chief constable Chris Noble, so I very much welcome what the Minister has said.
She will know, however, that the National Audit Office has raised concerns about the experience of officers when it comes to neighbourhood policing.
What work will she do to ensure that officers have the right degree of experience, so that their effectiveness at neighbourhood policing is maximised?
