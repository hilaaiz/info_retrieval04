I thank my hon.
Friend for his work in this important area.
This Government are committed to dealing with shop thefts and attacks on retail workers, and we will bring forward legislation in due course.
Our safer streets mission focuses on high streets, town centres and communities, so that people feel safe, there is a police presence and antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
