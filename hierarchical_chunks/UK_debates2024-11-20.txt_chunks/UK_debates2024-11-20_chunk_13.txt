I thank the Secretary of State for his kind words, but he has punished labour: figures from his own Department show that workers will be losing out by nearly £800 each per year as a result of Labour’s Budget.
Will he stand up to the Chancellor and oppose any further tax rises on Britain’s hard-working tech sector?
