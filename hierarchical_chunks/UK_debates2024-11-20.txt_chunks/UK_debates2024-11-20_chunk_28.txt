Today is Red Wednesday, when we remember all those worldwide who are persecuted for their belief.
A recent report by Aid to the Church in Need shows that in the countries surveyed the persecution of minorities increased by 60%.
In the light of that, will the Government commit to reappointing the Prime Minister’s special envoy for freedom of religion and belief, a post that has remained vacant since July, as soon as possible and hopefully by Christmas, so that we in the United Kingdom can play our part in defending religious and belief minorities worldwide?
