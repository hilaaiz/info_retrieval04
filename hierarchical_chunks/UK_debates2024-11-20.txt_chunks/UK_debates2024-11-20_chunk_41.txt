I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his service.
We will all benefit from having him in the House, sharing his experience and knowledge.
The police reform agenda, as set out in the Home Secretary’s speech and the written ministerial statement yesterday, is about resetting that relationship with the police.
We want to work with the police.
This is not about doing things to the police, but about working collectively to get the very best police service for this country, for today, tomorrow and the years ahead.
