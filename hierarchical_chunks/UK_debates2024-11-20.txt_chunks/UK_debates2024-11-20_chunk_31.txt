I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this case.
My thoughts are with Harshita’s family in this horrifying set of circumstances, where Harshita should have been protected and felt protected.
The Government are committed to halving violence against women and girls.
We continue to do our work, hopefully across the House, to make sure that we can end the circumstances Harshita faced and we can stop this kind of barbaric action.
