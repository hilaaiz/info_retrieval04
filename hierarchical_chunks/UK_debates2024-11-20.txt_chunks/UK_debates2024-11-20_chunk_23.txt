The town of Cheshunt in my constituency has no banks or building societies, and we have been told that we are not eligible for a banking hub.
Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that every town that wants a banking hub should be eligible for one, so that my residents have access to their hard-earned cash?
We have committed to 350 banking hubs through this Parliament.
I am sure that the Minister will be happy to meet the hon.
Member on that point.
I hope he will thankful for the levelling-up fund round 2 money that we secured, with £14.3 million going to Waltham Cross renaissance project, to regenerate the town centre for his constituents.
I know better than most that, under the last Tory Government, neighbourhood policing was stripped away, leaving the police invisible in towns such as those I represent.
As a former police inspector, I am delighted that the new Labour Government have committed to rebuild neighbourhood policing.
Will the Deputy Prime Minister assure my constituents that Labour’s neighbourhood policing guarantee will soon ensure that every town has a dedicated neighbourhood team?
