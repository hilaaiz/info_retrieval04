I thank the hon.
Lady for her comments, and I agree with her instinctive reaction to what Sir Brian said about the duty of candour.
It will be for the Government more widely to determine how we respond to that in a formal and coherent way.
When my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor was in a previous role, he moved quite a lot of things forward in the Department of Health, as the hon.
Lady knows.
When someone spends that amount of time, with that depth of evaluation, and gives a number of insights and recommendations, it is important that the Government look at them very carefully.
Sir Brian makes wise observations about how we do government in this country, which we must listen to, heed and apply.
