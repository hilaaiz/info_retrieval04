I thank the right hon.
Lady for her observations and for her ongoing engagement since my appointment.
I take seriously her point about having no decisions without full engagement.
I made a decision, in order to get to this point where we would, in principle, accept the recommendations of Sir Brian Langstaff and move forward with the independent expert panel.
As I have said to her previously, I was always prepared to reveal the names of those individuals, but I did not want them to be distracted while they did urgent work to make progress quickly.
Their names will be available shortly—today.
