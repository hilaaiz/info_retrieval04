I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question and for the opportunity to provide clarity.
The forced installation of prepayment meters is clearly unacceptable, and the Government have done everything we can to counteract it.
However, I reiterate that 150,000 investigations were carried out, in 2,500 of those cases compensation is due and, instead of 1%, the actual figure on compensation is 60%.
