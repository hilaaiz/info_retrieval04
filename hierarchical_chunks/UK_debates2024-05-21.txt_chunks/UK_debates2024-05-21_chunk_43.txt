I also welcome payments being made under the five heads of loss to the infected and the affected.
Will the Minister confirm that estimates of the total cost have now been made, and that there will be no undue delay in those final payments reaching victims?
Time is of the essence: one victim dies every four days.
Will the Minister set out more detail about how the personal representatives of estates will be handled as part of the scheme?
Will he also confirm that plans are in place to trace additional people who might be eligible for compensation?
Will he say a little more about when we can expect a progress report on Sir Brian Langstaff’s other 11 recommendations, beyond the establishment of the compensation body?
I add my support, and that of all Labour Members, to the consideration of appropriate and fitting memorials  across the different parts of the UK and, as Sir Brian Langstaff recommends, for victims who were treated at Treloar’s.
On potential criminal charges, will the Minister ensure that all relevant evidence is made available for consideration by the prosecuting authorities and any other necessary support provided?
Sir Brian Langstaff’s findings on institutional defensiveness, and on putting the reputation of people and protecting institutions above public service, follow on from other scandals such as Hillsborough and Horizon.
That is why we must deliver a duty of candour and the political leadership that we need to replace that culture of defensiveness with openness and transparency.
Sir Brian Langstaff’s report challenges us all to make progress on his recommendations.
That is what we must now come together to do.
The victims deserve nothing less.
