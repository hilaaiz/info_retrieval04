I thank the Minister for what he said and how he said it.
I know that he, the Prime Minister and, in particular, the Chancellor, who is sitting next to him, will make this right.
Clearly, the majority of Sir Brian’s recommendations are for the health and social care sector, and the Health and Social Care Committee, which I chair, will play its part, working with the Health Secretary—I see her in her place—and NHS England to ensure that all the recommendations are implemented, unlike with some previous accepted patient safety recommendations.
May I ask the Minister about the five loss categories?
They make every sense, and I note his two small refinements, but will the financial loss award reflect the reality that many infected blood victims, to give just one example, cannot access life insurance?
