We have heard descriptions of institutional defensiveness today, but we should be clear about what we are talking about: this was a grubby secret kept by the Department of Health.
The people who suffered as a consequence were treated as an inconvenience to be managed.
It flies in the face of what we are required to do in this House: hold Ministers accountable for what happens in their Departments.
We need to learn from this, to improve how we behave and to hold the Executive to account in future.
If we do not, this incident will shame us all—not  just those directly responsible.
We need to properly establish a duty of candour for civil servants in the advice they give to Ministers, and a requirement that Ministers must satisfy themselves that they are giving appropriate challenge and consideration to the advice they receive, so that everyone involved in delivering services in future can be held directly responsible, and this place does not continue to be a charade.
