I thank my hon.
Friend for that rather surprising question on hydrogen.
The Government recognise the value of hydrogen in supporting a decarbonised and secure power system.
We intend to publish soon our response to the December 2023 hydrogen-to-power market intervention consultation, and we will soon legislate for decarbonisation readiness requirements, so that new-build or substantially refurbished combustion power plants are built net zero ready.
