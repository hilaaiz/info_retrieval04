I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his collegiate tone and for the constructive approach he has taken throughout our conversations and in his response this afternoon.
I totally embrace the need to continue the dialogue with victims.
That is why I was pleased that Sir Robert Francis agreed to take on that role, having done the study into compensation.
We have obviously met a number of times, and I have explained to him what Jonathan Montgomery and the experts panel did.
I am pleased that he has got to a point where he is sufficiently satisfied to move forward in this way.
