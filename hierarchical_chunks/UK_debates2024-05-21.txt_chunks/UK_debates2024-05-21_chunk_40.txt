Yesterday, the Prime Minister spoke about the anguish that the infected blood scandal brought to those impacted by it.
I want to reiterate his words and apologise again today.
I am sorry.
The Prime Minister also spoke, on behalf of the whole House, of our gratitude to Sir Brian Langstaff and his team for completing his comprehensive report—seven volumes and 2,500 pages—and of our appreciation of all those who came forward as part of the inquiry.
It was the greatest privilege of my ministerial career to meet over 40 representatives of the infected blood community, in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Birmingham and Leeds, as we finalised our response to compensation for this appalling tragedy.
The whole community’s bravery through immense suffering is what has enabled justice today.
I know that many of them will be watching from the Public Gallery.
I want to honour their fortitude through their unimaginable pain, as I lay out a more detailed response to Sir Brian’s second interim report on compensation.
We will provide the House with a further opportunity to debate the inquiry’s full report after the Whitsun recess.
The Government will also respond to each recommendation in full, as quickly as possible, within our comprehensive response to the report.
