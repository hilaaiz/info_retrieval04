The Minister will know that I am concerned about the level of standing charges in my constituency, as I have discussed this issue with her before.
One of the problems is that people with pre-payment meters often find that, when they go to add the payment, the standing charges wipe everything out.
Can the Government and Ofgem find a way to provide more support for those on pre-payment meters to avoid that problem?
The hon.
Lady and I have had many conversations about this issue.
One of the things that we have done is make sure that people who are on pre-payment meters are not unfairly penalised.
