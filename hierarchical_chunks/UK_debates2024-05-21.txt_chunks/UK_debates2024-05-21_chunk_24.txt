The UK Government work closely and collaboratively with the Scottish Government on a whole host of areas, especially energy security and net  zero.
However, this is a live planning issue, and whether it is in the jurisdiction of Westminster or Holyrood, we do not comment on live planning cases given their quasi-judicial status.
What steps she is taking to increase nuclear energy capacity.
The civil nuclear road map reconfirmed the Government’s ambition to deploy up to 24 GW of nuclear power by 2050.
The road map sets out plans to make investment decisions concerning 3 GW to 7 GW every five years between 2030 and 2044.
Clearly it is important to have a mixed economy in terms of energy production, and nuclear has to play its part.
What action is my hon.
Friend taking to ensure that the development of small modular nuclear reactors is enhanced and brought forward, because that is the fastest way to get nuclear energy into our network?
I completely agree with my hon.
Friend.
The small modular reactor technology selection process—the fastest of its kind in the world, I might add—continues to progress quickly and is currently in the tender phase, allowing vendors to bid for potentially multibillion-pound technology development contracts.
Companies will have until June to submit their tender responses, at which point Great British Energy will evaluate bids and negotiate final contracts.
The aim is to announce successful bids later this year.
