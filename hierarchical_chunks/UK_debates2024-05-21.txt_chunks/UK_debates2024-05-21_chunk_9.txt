When it comes to who controls and benefits from our energy system, why does the Government refuse to put the British people first?
As we have heard, foreign-owned firms, whether France’s EDF or Denmark’s Ørsted, reap the rewards of energy produced in Britain.
As they benefit  British people pay the price, exposed to sky-high energy bills and beholden to volatile international prices.
Why is the Minister so opposed to putting power back into the hands of the British people?
There is not a single country around the world that thinks Governments alone can deliver increased energy security.
By working with businesses, we can unlock the private investment to do it.
And talk about irrational: imagine a career politician, the shadow Secretary of State, running UK energy.
Consumer bills would rocket.
