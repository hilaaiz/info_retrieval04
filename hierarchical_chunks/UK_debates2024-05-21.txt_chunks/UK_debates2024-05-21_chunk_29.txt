I welcome Ofgem’s ongoing review of standing charges in electricity bills.
In the North Wales and Merseyside region, the standing charge is 67.04p per day, compared to an average of 60.10p across the UK.
Will the Minister commit to coming back to the House to provide further comment on this geographical variation once Ofgem has published the findings of its review?
