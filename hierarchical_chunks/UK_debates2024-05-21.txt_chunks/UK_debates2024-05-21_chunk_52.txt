I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his endorsement of the appointment of Sir Robert Francis, which seemed to be welcomed in the Gallery.
I recognise that what is absolutely critical for the scheme to be successful is full engagement with the communities and that the explanation of how the scheme has been constructed and any concerns about the wider support that is needed are interrogated fully before the regulations come back to the House.
Throughout, the scheme has been about reconciling speed and efficiency with consultation, which is why it has been done in such a way over the past few months.
The hon.
Gentleman made a point about hepatitis B and access to schemes.
I will be happy to correspond with him separately on that—obviously, there are lots of technical issues.
He asked about the £210,000, which he can see is an irregular amount.
That is because I was trying to get the maximum amount that could be universally paid, as quickly as I could, to those who are infected  and alive without any risk of paying the wrong amount, and that is the amount that I was advised.
What is really important is that we get to the examination of entitlements and what that balancing payment is, and get that payment out as quickly as possible.
This is not a stalling tactic; it is about trying to reconcile the competing priorities of responsible stewardship of taxpayers’ money and getting payments made as quickly as possible for the most vulnerable in our community.
With regard to memorialisation, on these matters there will need to be wide engagement
and I do not want to make binding commitments today.
I have said what I have said, and I or another Minister will return to that in due course.
