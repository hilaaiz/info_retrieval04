In the last 12 months, one in five households, or one in four young households, in energy debt have turned to illegal money lenders to help pay for bills and everyday essentials.
The End Fuel Poverty Coalition has stated that the crisis could mean that young households spend years at the mercy of these loan sharks.
What assessment has the Minister made of the merits of working with Ofgem and energy suppliers in order to introduce support to alleviate this record-high energy debt?
The hon.
Member makes an incredibly important point, and I have had many conversations with her on this matter.
I can reassure her that I meet Ofgem regularly to discuss this, as the issue is very close to my heart—hence the call for input.
To give her further reassurance, I can tell her that earlier this week, I met energy suppliers, and I also have ongoing meetings with Citizens Advice and other stakeholders.
Like others, I welcome what the Government have already done to extend the permitted development rights for rooftop solar and car park canopies, but may I encourage my hon.
Friend to tell others in Government who have  responsibility for planning that there are considerable benefits to car park canopies, particularly in hotter summers?
