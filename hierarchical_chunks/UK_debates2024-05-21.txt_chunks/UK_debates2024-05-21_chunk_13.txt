I thank the Minister for her answer, but I want her to understand that for constituents such as mine in Romford energy prices are becoming completely unaffordable, and the Government need to do more.
My constituents are also very concerned about the cost of net zero, and we need to know what that will cost them in years to come.
Surely the Government need to take the British people with them on these policies, but at present there is a great deal of scepticism.
