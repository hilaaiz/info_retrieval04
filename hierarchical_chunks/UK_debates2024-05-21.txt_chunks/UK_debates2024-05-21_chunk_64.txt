I, too, welcome today’s statement, which has been a long time coming.
This is a poignant day for many of my constituents, their families and friends.
Reassurance has been called for by organisations such as Haemophilia Scotland that the recommendations will be adhered to, as perhaps they have not been in the past.
Does the Minister agree that having the involvement of various groups of infected and affected people will help ensure that happens?
I agree.
When I went to Edinburgh I was keen to meet a representative group of Scottish infected blood campaign organisations.
I had a very candid conversation with them, in which I set out where we were as a Government and what we were planning to do on this day at a high level.
Those conversations need to continue.
As I said, the immediate priority is under Sir Robert Francis’s guidance.
That engagement will continue throughout June, so that the regulations are informed by the wisdom, experience and views of those we are seeking to support.
Let me start by commending my constituency neighbour,  the right hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson) , for her courage, determination and persistence in relentlessly pursuing this matter over the years.
I wholeheartedly support her call for the rapid payment of compensation before any more sufferers die, and I know the Minister has that in mind.
