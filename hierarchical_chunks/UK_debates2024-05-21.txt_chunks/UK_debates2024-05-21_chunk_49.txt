My hon.
Friend mentioned my immediate predecessor, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Horsham (Sir Jeremy Quin) , but I am aware that a large number of Paymasters General—including my right hon.
Friend the Leader of the House, who is sitting alongside me today—have done an enormous amount of work to get us to this point, along with many officials, including James Quinault, who has led the work latterly.
I want to acknowledge their contribution; this is not about me.
More broadly, my hon.
Friend made some wise observations about the need to ensure that, for the communities who will be given significant sums of money—rightly so, and in line with what they would be entitled to if they went through a legal process—the appropriate framework of support is in place to assist them to receive that money in a way that is not destructive to their lives.
