I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I am confident that the scheme will work, and that it will work as quickly as it possibly can.
I mentioned today the interim payments of £210,000 to the infected who are alive.
The speed with which we process the applications of those affected and infected is very much on my mind as we set up the shadow arm’s length body.
I will continue to work with my officials to do everything we can to move the timeline from the right to the left, conscious of how long people have waited.
