I welcome the Minister’s statement today.
Reflecting on the fact that he has talked about those infected and affected being fully engaged, I gently remind him of the maxim “No decision about us without us”, and of the lack of transparency so far in the expert panel.
It is only today that we will learn the names of the people who have been advising the Government.
