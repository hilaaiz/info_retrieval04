My hon.
Friend makes an important point and is right to pick up on this matter.
I reassure him that I have encouraged and pushed Ofgem to do more on this issue.
Electricity standing charges include network costs, which reflect the cost of maintaining and upgrading the transmission and distribution networks across the country.
I am of course happy to meet him to discuss this subject further.
