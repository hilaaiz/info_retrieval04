I thank my hon.
Friend for his comments, and I pay tribute to him for the work that he has done and for his constructive engagement with me over the past six months, and over many previous years.
He made the point about his friend and the stigma that some of the victims have had to endure, which is why injury and social impact are reflected in the heads of loss under the scheme.
He also made some observations about how better awareness of some conditions can be taken forward.
I will discuss that with ministerial colleagues—several from the Department of Health and Social Care are in their places today.
