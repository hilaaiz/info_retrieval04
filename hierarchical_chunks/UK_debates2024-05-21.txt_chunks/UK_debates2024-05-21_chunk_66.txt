The Minister talks about stigma.
When I met some of the affected community in Peterborough, I heard about the discrimination they faced and about their lack of trust in public institutions.
This all leaves a very long legacy.
With that in mind, how confident is he that, despite that long legacy, the scheme will capture and benefit everyone affected or infected?
How confident is he that everyone who should be compensated will come forward?
