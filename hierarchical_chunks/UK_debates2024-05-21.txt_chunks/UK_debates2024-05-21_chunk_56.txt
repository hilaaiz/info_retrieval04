With respect to the five loss categories, my hon.
Friend makes a legitimate point about a specific additional burden that is a consequence of these conditions.
That matter will no doubt be raised by some in the communities.
The structure of the scheme is based around: injuries, social impact, autonomy, care and financial loss.
Clearly, social impact and autonomy capture a range of unspecific things—a basket of goods, if you like—that people will not have been able to procure at the same cost.
I cannot give him a specific answer on that, but Jonathan Montgomery and his team of experts have done everything they can to look at the law, consider what the entitlement would be in different circumstances and give their best assessment, and those sorts of conversations will happen with the communities in the coming weeks.
