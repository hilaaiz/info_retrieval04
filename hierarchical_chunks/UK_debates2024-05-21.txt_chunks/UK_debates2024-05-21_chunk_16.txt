The Minister and her colleagues have repeatedly said today that they care about cutting bills for families, but a recent report by the Resolution Foundation found that the onshore wind ban has hit the poorest households’ income six times harder than that of the richest.
Such households have been forced to pay additional electricity bills as a result of the total failure to build onshore wind in England.
How on earth can Ministers continue to sit there and claim that they stand up for working families when they continue to block the cheapest form of clean energy there is, which could cut bills for families who desperately need help?
Before she leaves office, will the Secretary of State pledge to put this right
so that onshore wind can be built again and customers can save money on their future bills?
That is absolutely not the case.
We stand here incredibly proudly as Ministers in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and we have made a commitment.
We are doing more than has ever been done on renewables and offshore wind, and we have done more to help people with the affordability of their bills.
What steps she is taking to help improve energy efficiency in social housing.
The social housing decarbonisation fund is upgrading to EPC C a significant amount of the social housing stock that is currently below that standard.
We have already committed over £1 billion of Government funding, with a further £1.25 billion already committed for 2025 to 2028.
By how much has the Minister increased the level of insulation, and what significance does she attach to it?
