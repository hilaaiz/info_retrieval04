Mr. KELLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and legacy of Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty'' Harris, a true American hero.
Colonel Harris, a retired United States Air Force officer, was 36 years old when his aircraft was shot down over North Vietnam on April 4, 1965.
He became the sixth American taken as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
Colonel Harris served this Nation with unwavering courage and strength.
Following his capture, he endured more than eight years of brutal conditions, including torture and starvation.
Yet, he never yielded to his captors.
Instead, he put his military training into action, using the Tap Code to communicate with fellow prisoners and maintain unity, morale, and resistance.
After returning home, Colonel Harris continued his service, leading and mentoring fellow airmen until his retirement from the Air Force in 1979.
His devotion to our Nation didn't end with his military career-- he remained deeply involved in his community, lending his time and voice to numerous charitable and veteran-focused causes.
In recognition of his service, I was honored to introduce H.R. 208, legislation that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in 2021, designating the United States Post Office in Tupelo, Mississippi, as the ``Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty'' Harris Post Office.''
That designation serves as a permanent tribute to a man who embodied the best of America.
Colonel Harris passed away in hospice care on July 6, 2025, at the age of 96.
Today, we remember his extraordinary service, enduring sacrifice, and lifelong commitment to his country and community.
He is survived by his wife, Louise; their three children; grandchildren; and great-grandchildren.
May his legacy of honor, resilience, and patriotism continue to inspire generations.
