Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary bravery and service demonstrated in response to the devastating flooding across Central Texas.
Over the past several days, catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe and Colorado Rivers has shaken communities across the Texas Hill Country.
Lives have been lost, others are still missing, and boots remain on the ground--searching, rescuing, and doing everything possible to bring families back together.
On July 4, 2025, as the floodwaters surged near Hunt, Texas, the United States Coast Guard launched a rescue crew out of Air Station Corpus Christi at 5:30 a.m. Despite severe weather and three aborted attempts, the crew aboard an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter pushed through.
That crew--Aircraft Commander Lieutenant Ian Hopper, Co-Pilot Lieutenant Blair Ogujiofor, Flight Mechanic Petty Officer Seth Reeves, and Rescue Swimmer Petty Officer Scott Ruskan--is a team of American heroes who carried out one of the most consequential rescue operations this country has ever seen.
Petty Officer Ruskan was lowered into the flood zone and coordinated rescues for more than three hours, working with state, local, and military partners across three landing zones.
In his first rescue mission, he helped save 165 lives--15 of whom were airlifted directly by the Coast Guard crew.
This mission was one part of a larger operation, powered by 54 Coast Guard personnel rotating day and night to keep rescue efforts moving across the region.
Every hour, lives are being saved by men and women who step into harm's way so others can make it home.
In the face of tragedy, we're reminded of what makes this country strong: selflessness, courage, and Americans willing to step into danger to protect others.
Texans are known for their resilience, but no one overcomes disaster alone.
I thank every Coast Guardsman, first responder, and local official who acted swiftly and selflessly to help their neighbors.
May God strengthen those still searching, comfort those who mourn, and bless the brave men and women who ran toward the rising waters.
God bless Texas, and God bless the United States.
