Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable career of Craig Dellimore and to congratulate him on his upcoming retirement from WBBM Radio in Chicago.
Craig has been a pillar of Chicago journalism for more than four decades.
After studying journalism at Columbia University, he began his career covering Washington politics for the Associated Press before joining WBBM Radio in 1983.
For 40 years, Craig has exemplified the highest standards of fairness and professionalism in political reporting.
As the host of the weekly ``At Issue'' radio show and Political Editor of WBBM News radio, Craig has covered every aspect of Chicago and national politics.
Whether interviewing elected officials or unpacking complex topics like homelessness, mental health, and gun violence, Craig brings compassion, clarity and an unwavering commitment to the truth.
His dedication to integrity earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lisagor Awards, recognition from the Illinois Associated Press, and widespread respect across the state.
Beyond the newsroom, Craig served his colleagues through leadership in the Chicago chapter of SAG-AFTRA, as both President and Vice President.
From the halls of Congress to Chicago's City Hall, Craig has been a trusted voice guiding listeners through a turbulent political landscape with clarity and insight.
