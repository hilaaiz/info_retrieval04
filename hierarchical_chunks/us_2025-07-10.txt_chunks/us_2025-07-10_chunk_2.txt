Mr. ADERHOLT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a special event that is occurring to celebrate and honor an extraordinary American and a dear personal friend:
Mr. Roy Drinkard of Cullman, Alabama.
This event is scheduled to occur on Friday, July 11, 2025.
This will be an event to celebrate 
Mr. Drinkard's 105th birthday as he personally plans to welcome family, friends, and acquaintances to his home in Cullman, Alabama.
Born July 12, 1920, Mr, Drinkard is the oldest living United States Marine in the Nation, a proud veteran of World War II who served his country with courage and who continues to inspire all who know him.
My wife, Caroline, and I plan to attend this momentous occasion and celebrate with Roy and all those in attendance.
