Mr. STAUBER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Seaman Second Class Robert L. ``Bob'' Hanley, the last living survivor of the USS Houston, a member of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet sunk by the Imperial Japanese Navy in March 1942.
Seaman Hanley showcased American grit, tenacity, and commitment in the fight against tyranny.
As one of only 368 crewmen out of 1,060 to survive the sinking of the USS Houston, Bob Hanley faced unimaginable hardships as a prisoner of war four years.
He endured the brutal Bataan Death March, where 64 men from Company D of the 194th Tank Regiment came from my district.
Only 34 survived.
He was transported on ``hell ships'' to Singapore and Burma, and he labored on the infamous Thai-Burma Death Railway under conditions of starvation, torture, and beatings, without access to medicines or supplies.
Battling dysentery, malaria, and pellagra, Bob's resilience never wavered.
At liberation in August 1945, he was among just 291 remaining survivors from the USS Houston.
Bob's service did not end with his Navy enlistment, which ended in 1947 after six years.
He continued serving his country by enlisting in the U.S. Army for 15 years.
After his military career, he worked in security at 3M for another 15 years, retiring in 1978 due to medical reasons.
Throughout his life, Bob's deep faith as a devout member of the Catholic Church of Saint Peter in Forest Lake, Minnesota, guided him through the darkest times and brightest moments, serving as a cornerstone of his strength.
On September 12, 2024, Seaman Second Class Robert L. Hanley passed away at 102 years old.
May he rest in peace.
