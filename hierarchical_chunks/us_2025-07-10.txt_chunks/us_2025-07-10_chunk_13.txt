Mr. BURLISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Rose, news anchor at Springfield, Missouri's KY3 television station, who is retiring after 42 years of broadcast excellence.
KY3 covers 32 counties in southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas.
Lisa's fascination with the news began as a 3rd grader who was devouring the daily newspaper and increased even more when she was 10 years old and witnessed televised reports about the Vietnam War.
According to her, by the time she was in high school, she was truly addicted to learning as much as she could about what was going on in the world around her.
So, it was no great surprise when she graduated from Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, with a Bachelors degree in TV News.
Shortly after graduation, Lisa started her career as a general assignment news reporter at KODE-TV in Joplin, Missouri.
She spent four years at KODE and then moved to KY3 in 1984 as the evening news anchor.
During her time at KY3, she saw TV news reporting change as advanced technology allowed for live field reporting for the first time.
Portable backpacks and satellite trucks became the norm as KY3 stayed ahead of the curve in broadcast news.
Now a single individual can do what used to take a satellite truck, an engineer, a photographer, and a reporter to deliver a live report.
From technology to techniques in news gathering, the station has been a leader in television news and Lisa has been there every step of the way.
Lisa and her husband, Randy, have three children and three grandchildren.
For more than four decades, she has been a trusted and familiar voice in our community where she's brought professionalism, warmth, and a little humor into homes all across the Ozarks.
I'd like to congratulate Lisa on her retirement, and thank her for her service to the community.
She will be missed.
