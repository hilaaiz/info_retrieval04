Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fox Metro Water Reclamation District as they celebrate their 100th anniversary, marking a century of wastewater management and environmental stewardship.
Founded in 1925 in Aurora, Illinois as the Aurora Sanitary District, this institution was established to protect public health and preserve the natural beauty of the Fox River from disease and pollution.
By 1929, this vision became a reality with the construction of a wastewater treatment plant and supporting infrastructure.
Over the past century, Fox Metro WRD has been a model of sustainability, fiscal responsibility, and environmental stewardship.
The Fox Metro WRD has continually invested in innovation from solar power and nutrient reduction to recycling biosolids, restoring native landscapes, reusing treated effluent, and recovering methane gas for campus and public use.
Fox Metro WRD now serves over 304,000 people across 90 square miles, operating twelve pump stations and more than 100 miles of intersecting sanitary sewers, They manage an 150-acre treatment facility where an average of 36 million gallons of wastewater is treated daily, ensuring the health and environmental protection of the Fox Valley region.
For 100 years, the dedicated public servants of Fox Metro WRD have safeguarded public health, supported local economies, and helped eradicate deadly diseases.
