Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Lakes Region Community Services, a non-profit centered around meeting critical needs in New Hampshire.
For more than 50 years, Lakes Region Community Services (LRCS) has been a pillar for providing crucial services in New Hampshire.
Through a number of initiatives, LRCS has acted as a lifeline for so many people throughout New Hampshire.
Whether through its Family Resource Center, Sober Parenting Journey, or Home Assist programs, thousands of Granite Staters are helped each year through this essential work.
These programs assist people with developmental disabilities, acquired brain disorders, chronic illnesses, families with children, and our aging population.
Community service organizations like LRCS play a vital role in creating a positive environment where people can grow and thrive in any stage of life.
Covering 24 towns, LRCS has been a support system where people from across our communities can come and get the resources they need.
I commend LRCS and its more than 300 employees for the important work they do every day to positively impact people's lives.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to say thank you and congratulate LRCS on 50 years of dedicated service to our state.
We are grateful for your commitment to our community, and I look forward to continuing to support this lifechanging work.
