I thank my hon.
Friend for his point, which brings me to something I really want to address.
As I said in my opening remarks, these are imperfect amendments.
I will get into some of the conversations that I have had with a number of people about this.
I am one person; I have not been able to consult the BMA, as a Government or a sponsor could, for example, but I am aware of its concerns.
However, we are talking here about very definite and irreversible decisions on life and death.
I know that many doctors have had conversations about that, but not to the level required to legislate for it.
This is a different set of circumstances, but I very much appreciate his point.
