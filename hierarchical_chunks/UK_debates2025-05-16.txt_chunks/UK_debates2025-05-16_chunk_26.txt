As a doctor, I am very aware of the trust that the public place in doctors and the seriousness with which they take what we say.
If a doctor gives somebody information about assisted dying, it is quite reasonable for that person to think that the doctor is suggesting that they should take part in that process, or is hinting that their death will be dreadful and trying to be kind.
If doctors are allowed to say, “This is a good process,” more people will take it up than would otherwise have wanted to.
