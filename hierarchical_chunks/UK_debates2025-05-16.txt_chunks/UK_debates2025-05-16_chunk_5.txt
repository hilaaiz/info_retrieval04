Perhaps most importantly, Mr Speaker, I have spoken to terminally ill people themselves over recent months.
It is impossible to know what it must feel like to receive a terminal diagnosis and I have nothing but admiration for people who have bravely spoken about their personal situations, some publicly—including, of course, Dame Esther Rantzen—and others who have done so privately, many by emailing their MP.
I know mine is not the only inbox full of such emails.
Will my hon.
Friend distance herself from the correspondence from Dame Esther Rantzen, who accused those of us who have concerns about the Bill of having undeclared religious beliefs?
Many colleagues found that distasteful and disrespectful.
