That would not be an issue, because copies of the report would be given to the patent, the co-ordinating doctor if they are not in the patient’s   GP’s practice, and the commissioner, so that information would be recorded, and it is very important that it is.
The report must set out the reasons— Will the hon.
Lady give way?
I will make some progress, if I may.
I am trying to be very open to interventions, but I do need to crack on.
The report must set out why the co-ordinating doctor is not satisfied and must contain an explanation of why the patient cannot proceed with the assisted dying process.
The co-ordinating doctor must give a copy of the report to the person, to the person’s GP practice if they are not a practitioner within that practice, and to the voluntary assisted dying commissioner.
That reflects the thorough and robust reporting and monitoring mechanisms throughout the Bill.
I turn to the other amendments in my name.
I will try to keep my comments succinct, as many colleagues wish to speak.
Amendment 56 ensures that the co-ordinating doctor gives the commissioner a copy of the patient’s first declaration.
That enables the commissioner to carry out their monitoring responsibilities under clause 45.
Amendments 57 and 61— Will the hon.
Lady give way?
I will.
Persistence pays off.
When considering the Bill, I had presumed that the doctor concerned would be a senior clinician—a senior doctor—but page 63 of the impact assessment refers to pre-registration doctors, who have just completed medical school and are on a provisional registration.
Will the hon.
Lady confirm that it is her intention that the provisions in the Bill may be carried out by the most junior doctors, as well as by more senior consultants and general practitioners?
