I thank my hon.
Friend for these amendments, because a number of people have written to me concerned about the very issue that she is raising.
Does she agree that many people will just be opposed to assisted dying in all its forms, and I entirely respect that, but if that is really their objection, they should be honest about that and not pretend that it is only particular amendments they need?
They should make the argument that they actually want to make.
