On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
I thought this was a debate to discuss amendments, not a general debate.
It is, but I think this is the opening lead-in to the amendments.
I will make that judgment call.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
If I may just finish that point— rose— Order.
May I just say to people that if we are going to have continuous interventions, and  if they continue to make the same intervention, they should not be shocked if they end up at the bottom of the list?
I want to help people, because all this does is soak up time.
Jim Shannon will be a good example.
Mr Speaker, I will always be at the end of the list, so it is important for me to make an intervention.
The hon.
Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  set the scene very well on Second Reading, but since then things have changed.
For instance, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has voiced strong concerns in opposition to the Bill about judicial oversight, robust protections against coercion and so on, as well as the effect it will have on vulnerable groups such as those with dementia, Down syndrome or mental illnesses.
Does the hon.
Lady not respect the viewpoints of my constituents who   tell me that they are opposed to the Bill in principle  and all the things that are coming forward?
The new clause does not address the issues that the hon.
Lady is referring to.
