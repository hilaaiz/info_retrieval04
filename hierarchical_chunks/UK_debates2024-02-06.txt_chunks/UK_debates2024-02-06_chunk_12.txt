I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and I will take the two parts of it in turn.
The Government continue to support businesses with the higher costs through a generous package of support.
At the autumn statement, we showed our commitment to supporting small businesses by extending the 75% retail, hospitality and leisure relief, and by freezing the small business multiplier, which will protect more than 1 million properties from the multiplier increase.
Yesterday, we announced a wide-ranging package of support worth £600 million for local councils, including £500 million of new funding for social care.
