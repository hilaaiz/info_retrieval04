I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Indeed, the Chancellor announced at the autumn statement last year that, over the next 12 months, the Government will consider selling shares in NatWest.
That is all subject to value-for-money concerns and other matters, as he will appreciate, and it is market sensitive.
Of course value for money will be at the heart of any consideration of the sale of shares, and the House will be kept fully informed over the coming weeks and months.
