I thank the Minister for his answer, but since his party’s disastrous mini-Budget fiasco under the previous Prime Minister, food prices have soared, extreme damage has been done to the economy and mortgages have skyrocketed.
Every month 200,000 people are having to remortgage, the average monthly rate has risen by £240, and 1.6 million people will have to remortgage this year.
Overall, after 14 years of a Conservative Government, people are more than £10,000 less well off than they were on pre-2010 trends.
Is it not time that the Chancellor and his ministerial team looked again at the possibility of additional support for those who are facing mortgage and other financial distress?
The Chancellor is frowning, but it is time that he took further action to support people in distress.
