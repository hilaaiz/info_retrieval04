The Minister talks about tax cuts, but in April most households in this country will receive a 5% increase in their council tax.
That is not because local councils have mismanaged their finances, but because after 13 years of austerity, the local government finance system is essentially broken and relies on a regressive and unfair council tax.
Why in the autumn statement did the Chancellor freeze the budgets of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities for the whole of the next Parliament, leading the Office for Budget Responsibility to forecast a further £13 billion rise in council tax?
Does that not show that the Chancellor has no regard at all for councils and the services they provide, or is he simply deferring a problem that his Government has created for the next Government to sort out?
I am afraid that is a ridiculous characterisation.
We on this side of the House care, including about our vibrant, important local councils.
That is precisely why they just received an additional £600 million, and future spending will be a matter for future fiscal events.
I am a strong believer in fairness in taxation.
Would my hon.
Friend care to advise the House about who would bear the heaviest burden of taxation, should His Majesty’s Government choose to adopt the £28 billion spending commitment that the Labour party announced on the radio this morning?
My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
Of course, we never know from day to day exactly what Labour’s policy is, and I understand there are even differences among its Front Benchers at the moment, but we heard a firm commitment, without any promises at all about where the money would come from.
We therefore know where it would come from: it would come out of taxpayers’ pockets or further borrowing, which is deferred taxation.
Everybody will pay for it.
