The Minister talks of fairness, but the fact is that during the cost of living crisis nearly a million more struggling pensioners will start paying income tax, because of the freeze in personal allowance rates, while the Government protect some of the richest members of society through non-domicile status.
Scrapping that status could bring the Treasury an extra £3 billion a year.
Why do the Government not do the right thing and bring in that extra money to protect pensioners and the lowest paid?
Non-doms contributed about £8.5 billion in taxes in 2022, and have contributed to investment to the tune of £7 billion since 2012.
The hon.
Gentleman will be well aware that scrapping their status would not be risk-free in a world in which people can be quite mobile, and could damage the UK’s competitiveness.
As for the need for other support, that is exactly why we have been reducing national insurance rates, for example.
What recent assessment he has made of the potential impact of changes in mortgage interest rates during this Parliament on household disposable income.
Mortgage interest rates have fallen by more than 100 basis points from their peak in the summer.
None the less, the Government have prioritised support for households that are vulnerable to cost of living pressures.
We have introduced one of Europe’s largest support packages, and it is partly thanks to those measures that real incomes have proved more resilient than was anticipated.
In the third quarter of 2023, real household disposable income per person was just 0.5% lower than in Q4 2019, versus the Office for Budget Responsibility’s autumn statement 2023 forecast that it would be almost 3% lower.
