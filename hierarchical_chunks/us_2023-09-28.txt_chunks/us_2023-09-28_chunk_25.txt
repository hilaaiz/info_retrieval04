Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing the life and legacy of 
Representative David Mack III.
The entire Charleston community and the state of South Carolina is grateful for his lifetime of public service.
He leaves a rich legacy that will continue to touch generations of South Carolinians for years to come.
