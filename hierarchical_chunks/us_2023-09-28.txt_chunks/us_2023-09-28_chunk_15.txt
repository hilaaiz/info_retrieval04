Ms. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, l rise today to honor the 44\1/2\ years of service and dedication of Houston's own Judge Richard C. Vara, a trailblazer who was the youngest person to be elected Justice of the Peace at that time.
Judge Vara grew up in the historic east end of Houston, graduating from Austin High School.
the University. and South Texas College.
The Judge got his first encounter with politics by going to LULAC meetings with his parents.
This sense of service to the Latino community remained with him throughout his career.
Both in the courtroom and in the community, Judge Vara has exemplified public service and commitment to bettering his community.
He has created and volunteered for countless organizations in Houston, all aimed at improving the lives of those around him.
Please join me in congratulating Judge Richard Vara for his many years of service.
Felicidades.
