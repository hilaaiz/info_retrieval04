Mr. MRVAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to honor 
Ms. Beth Wrobel and wish her well upon her retirement as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HealthLinc.
For her lifelong commitment to providing quality health care to communities throughout the region, she is to be commended.
In 2002, 
Ms. Wrobel became CEO of HealthLinc.
At the time, HealthLinc was a single, free medical clinic serving the local community.
Under her direction, HealthLinc expanded its medical services to include pediatrics, women's health, and prenatal care, while also adding service lines including dental, optometry, behavioral health, substance abuse, podiatry, chiropractic, clinical pharmacy, health insurance enrollment, medical legal partnership, and more.
The organization continues to grow and is comprised of twelve clinics across Northern Indiana, as well as two school-based telehealth clinics, one mobile medical and dental clinic, and a team of more than 490 employees.
As CEO, 
Ms. Wrobel has worked tirelessly to ensure the accessibility of affordable, quality care to countless individuals and families who are underinsured, uninsured, or unable to pay.
For her outstanding dedication to the people of Northern Indiana, especially those most in need, 
Ms. Wrobel is worthy of the highest praise.
In addition to her noteworthy career, 
Ms. Wrobel has offered her time and support to numerous foundations and organizations throughout the years.
