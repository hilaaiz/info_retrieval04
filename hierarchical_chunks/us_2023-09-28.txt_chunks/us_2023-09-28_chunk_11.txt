Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, America is grateful for the leadership of Chairman Mike Rogers of Alabama for his vision and persistence to support the creation of U.S. Space Command along with President Donald Trump.
This recognizes the threats of dictators, war criminal Putin and the CCP who have developed capabilities in space to threaten American families--we can achieve peace through strength.
It is sad when political interference controls basing, not first the priority of national security.
In South Carolina, we experienced this as the Charleston Naval Base was re-located to New Hampshire.
The obvious advantages of Charleston with a temperate climate of unlimited operations was ignored as the then Senate Majority Leader was from Maine with his constituents commuting to New Hampshire.
Congressman Austin Scott is correct.
Now Politics determines where the missions go.
This is a dangerous game, with national security to suffer.
