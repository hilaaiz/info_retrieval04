Mrs. Dutton embodies Texas' highest values.
She is a former school board member with Van ISD where she fought for parents and students.
When a tornado struck her town, she worked to rebuild the schools and develop a new Career & Technology Center that now prepares students for careers after graduation.
She has dedicated herself to serving the people of Van Zandt County and I look forward to what she will accomplish for the people.
I am proud to represent Van Zandt County and am confident that she will diligently serve them in the Texas Legislature.
I wish her and her family the very best as she begins her term.
