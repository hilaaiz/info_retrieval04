Mr. GOODEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the swearing-in of Jill Dutton as State 
Representative for Texas' 2nd House District.
Mrs. Dutton is a strong conservative, entrepreneur, and devoted to the people.
I am confident she will be a determined and effective representative for her constituents.
