Mr. COMER.
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure today to rise and recognize the Boyle County Rebels, a football powerhouse, in the 1st Congressional District of Kentucky upon their recent winning of the state championship.
I am honored to recognize the Boyle County Rebels on their fourth consecutive state championship.
The hours of hard work that this team puts in both on and off the field does not go unnoticed as they ended their undefeated season as champions.
I want to congratulate all the players, staff, faculty, and the entire community of Boyle County on this great achievement.
This football program has had historic success, and I have no doubt they will continue their winning traditions in the future.
I join with the community of Boyle County in celebrating the Rebels football team in their fourth consecutive 4A state championship.
