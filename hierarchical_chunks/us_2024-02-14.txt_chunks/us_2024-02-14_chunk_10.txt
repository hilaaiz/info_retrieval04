Mr. CAREY.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor a bright young man from Ohio's 15th Congressional District.
Nathaniel Palaia, who attends South-Western Career Academy, was recently named a 2024 nominee for the U.S. Department of Education Presidential Scholars Program.
This is one of the highest honors in the nation for a high school student.
Nathaniel is a dedicated student in the Career Technical Education field and serves as a member of Ohio State University's EcoCar Electric Vehicle Challenge Team.
He also serves as student council president, president of the Engineering and Robotics Program, team captain of the Autonomous Vehicle Challenge, and has founded a peer mentoring program.
Nathaniel is also a member of the National Technical Honor Society and has played varsity football for Grove City High School.
He spends his summers volunteering with children with special needs.
He manages to excel at all of these things while earning above a 4.0 GPA and challenging himself in new ways academically.
Nathaniel represents the true Buckeye spirit.
Among his many accomplishments, it has been made clear that he is also a caring, compassionate, and intelligent individual.
He works hard for what he wants, and I have no doubt this will carry him far in his future career and in life.
I am proud to represent a congressional district where students like Nathaniel give their time and abilities to make it a better place for everyone.
It is with great pride that I honor Nathaniel in this great recognition.
