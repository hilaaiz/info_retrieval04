Mr. Derby would eventually end up in Merced in 1961 after landing a reporting job at the Sun-Star.
Over the course of six decades, he started multiple newspapers across the Central Valley.
Mr. Derby once wrote, ``Life without being a newspaper man is about the most boring thing in the world.
The ink really is in my blood...
I am here to stay and do what I have loved to do all my life--and that is to cover the lives of people in our community in a positive way.''
Last Christmas, he wrote a deeply personal message to some of his top staffers: ``You are full grown, and capable newspaper people.
You have learned all the lessons it took me 60 years to learn and more.
Now it is your duty to teach others the art of good honest journalism...
May your ship of life sail true.
May the ocean be wide and the currents be strong.
May the winds blow hard.
May you sail on, through the fury of those winds, and come out whole.''
Throughout his six-decade career in journalism, John Morrow Derby exemplified ``The Power of Positive Press'' with his devotion to his community and his steadfast dedication to fairness, decency, and truth.
It was an honor to have known him, and upon his passing, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to his family and express my deepest sympathies to his beloved Mid-Valley Publications team.
