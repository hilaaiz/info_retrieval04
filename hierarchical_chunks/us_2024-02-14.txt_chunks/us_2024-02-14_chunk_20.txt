Mr. GREEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to make clear why I voted in opposition to H.R. 3202--The Assad Regime Anti-Normalization Act of 2023.
By way of background, I have in my district the family of journalist Austin Tice, a former Marine Corps Captain who was captured in Syria in 2012.
Since that time this family has been working with me, other members of Congress, multiple presidential administrations, and the Assad regime to secure the release of their son from captivity.
Mr. Tice was abducted in Syria by an unknown group while reporting on the conflict as a freelance journalist.
While the Assad regime has not claimed responsibility, the State Department has indicated that they believe Tice is being held by the regime or its allies.
My opposition to this legislation stems from the appeal of Austin's family.
It is their understanding that saving the life of their son requires engagement with the Assad regime, exactly the kind of engagement that this legislation would prohibit.
Let me be absolutely clear, Bashar al-Assad is an illegitimate war criminal who has brutalized the citizens of Syria and caused immeasurable harm.
I believe our Nation should take all reasonable steps to stymie the goals of this regime, saving steps that will harm captives like Marine Corps Captain Austin Tice and other U.S. nationals held in Syria.
