Mr. Derby was known for coining the local slogan and business mantra, ``The Power.''
He was an avid sailor, a member of the Lake Yosemite Sailing Association, and a longtime member of the Merced Sunrise Rotary Club.
John Derby first came to the Central Valley in the 1950s, studying at Fresno State and serving in the military toward the end of the Korean conflict.
In Korea, he picked up the journalism bug when he pursued an assignment to write about the operations of nine battalions from Seoul to Panmunjom where the peace talks were held.
