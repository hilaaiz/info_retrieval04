Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate outgoing Minnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA) President Bob Worth.
Bob has served more than two decades with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association in various roles: beginning as a volunteer, treasurer, secretary and lastly as president.
MSGA is our nation's longest-running state soybean association, and Bob is the only Minnesota farmer to have served multiple, two-year terms as president.
Bob also has worked on his father's corn and soybean farm in southwest Minnesota for more than 50 years with his wife Gail, their son Jon and Jon's family.
I'm thankful for our strong working relationship during his time with MSGA.
During his tenure, Bob has become a national spokesperson for rural mental health awareness; in this role, he's bravely shared his story and encouraged his fellow rural residents to rally around each other.
Bob is also a strong advocate and leader in expanding and protecting renewable biofuels.
Thanks to the hard work from leaders like Bob, Minnesota became the first state to require biodiesel in our diesel fuel blends when Bob first served as MSGA president.
In Congress, I am proud to be a co-chair of the bipartisan House Biofuels Caucus and a strong advocate for renewable biofuels.
In particular, I have urged the FDA to consider how biofuels can address climate change and improve emissions factors.
Homegrown biofuels are tools we have at our fingertips right now to help address climate change, thanks to leaders like Bob.
I'm grateful for our partnership, and I wish Bob and his family the best in his next chapter.
