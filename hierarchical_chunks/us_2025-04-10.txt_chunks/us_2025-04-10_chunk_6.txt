Mr. Finke received a battlefield promotion for his contributions to the war effort against terrorist forces in this operation and also earned his Air Assault Badge, German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge in Gold, and Norwegian Ruck March Badge.
Moreover, 
Mr. Finke won first place in the 13th Expeditionary Sustainment Command NCO of the Year Best Warrior Competition, out of a cadre of 6,000 soldiers.
Outside of his Army duties, 
Mr. Finke was a devoted husband to his wife, Chelsey, and a father to three beautiful daughters.
He was an uplifting leader who enjoyed playing football with kids in his neighborhood and his Army buddies.
You could always count on 
Mr. Finke to be there and push you to be better than you were yesterday, both physically and mentally.
His legacy of compassion, integrity, and friendship will always be remembered.
I have requested the United States flag be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize 
Mr. Finke's incredible life and service to our Nation.
He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew him.
