Mr. Brown began his ``Children's Book Party'' in his backyard, aiming for every child to form a collection of books.
The books covered a variety of subjects including math, science, short stories, and novels.
His continued dedication expanded the program to the Education Cultural Complex and then the Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park.
His book parties have come to fruition through the nonprofit he founded 35 years ago, ``Reading Literacy Learning, Inc.''
