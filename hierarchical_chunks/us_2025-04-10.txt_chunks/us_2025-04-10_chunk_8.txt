Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Graphics Universal of Greencastle, Pennsylvania, for 60 years of success as a leading provider of diversified design and commercial printing services.
A family-owned business, Graphics Universal has distinguished itself with an inspiring corporate philosophy that was established by Gary and Nancy Gembe when they purchased the company in 1970.
That philosophy is based on treating clients as long-term partners, fostering a rewarding work experience for staff, adhering to the highest standards of integrity and maintaining respect for the environment.
Gary and Nancy's son Garon Gembe proudly expands upon their legacy of achievement as Company President.
Effectively employing a relationship-centered approach with all stakeholders, the team at Graphics Universal prides itself on a commitment to collaboration, open communication and trusted service.
On behalf of everyone in the 13th Congressional District, I congratulate the entire Gembe family on their company's milestone and offer best wishes for continued success.
