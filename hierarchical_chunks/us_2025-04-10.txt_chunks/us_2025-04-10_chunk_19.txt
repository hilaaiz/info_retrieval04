Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of 
Mr. Lue N. Yang, an extraordinary advocate, organizer, teacher, and public figure.
Born on April 10, 1955, in Xieng Khouang, Laos, 
Mr. Yang has been a pillar for the Hmong community.
At the age of 14, he served with the Hmong Special Guerrilla Unit (SGU) during Vietnam.
After serving with the SGU, 
Mr. Yang moved to Vientiane to continue his education.
Upon graduating, he became a Peace Officer for the US Embassy from 1972 to 1975.
Shortly after, 
Mr. Yang fled to Thailand as many Hmong refugees did at the end of the Vietnam War.
A year later in Hawaii, he began to work with the non-profit: Vietnamese Indochinese Volunteer Agency (VIVA) and the Department of Labor as an agent.
A few years later, 
Mr. Yang moved to Des Moines, Iowa and worked for Volunteer Enrichment Services.
In 1991, he moved to Fresno and worked briefly with the Lao Family Community.
In 1992, 
Mr. Yang began his work at the Fresno Center for New Americans, a local non-profit that serves the Southeast Asian Community.
Later that year he served as the Executive Director for FCNA from 1992 to 2017.
Under 
Mr. Yang's leadership, FCNA managed to grow fourteen programs with an annual budget of $6.8 million and a team of 38.
As an Executive Director, he was seen as a role model and mentor by many young Hmong professionals at FCNA, who continued to push for progress for the Hmong community.
Furthermore, during 
Mr. Yang's tenure at FCNA he was able to establish several key sustainable programs.
The Living Well was the first Hmong mental health program in the state that provided culturally competent mental health services.
Mr. Yang also drafted an Adult Day Health Care program that provided essential support for senior community members.
These two programs are still in operation today and are seen as the pillars of FCNA's work.
