I would like to put on record my respect for the Secretary of State and her excellent stewardship of her portfolio.
I would like us to join Horizon Europe, but is it not right that we should get the right deal for our UK scientists, our UK businesses and our UK taxpayers, and that any commentary before a deal is done will only undermine our science industry and not be helpful in the slightest?
That is exactly right, and it is right for two reasons.
The first is that billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money are at stake and we need to be responsible stewards of that money.
That is why we are focused on getting the right deal.
The second point is that my Department exists to forward and further the frontier of science in this country and to make sure that we stay a science and technology superpower.

Order.
We are in the middle of answers to a question.
I call Vicky Ford.
Teledyne e2v is the world leader in space imaging.
It provides the eyes to NASA, the European space programme and Copernicus.
Can my great and right hon.
Friend make sure that our conversations about Horizon also include Copernicus?
Otherwise, the EU is going to be building Earth observation satellites that cannot see the Earth.
