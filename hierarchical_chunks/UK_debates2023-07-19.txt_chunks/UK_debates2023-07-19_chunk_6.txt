My right hon.
Friend the Chair of the Select Committee is correct that we set out that plan in our White Paper.

He will also know that I cannot commit to the contents of the King’s Speech, but what I have already said this morning is that the Government will be returning to the House with a full update on the conclusion of the consultation on the White Paper.

My right hon.
Friend is correct.
That is what we have laid out in our approach so far.
As the Prime Minister said, we intend to lead overseas and domestically, lead the charge of that opportunity in our public services and ensure that our pro-innovation approach enables the benefits of this technology to be captured sooner across the economy.

We are drawing on the benefit of a range of experts in our work.
In particular, I thank Ian Hogarth and those who have stepped up to form our Foundation Models Taskforce, which is helping us by looking extremely closely at the safety requirements for those models at the very frontier.
There will be more updates on that work as time goes on.
