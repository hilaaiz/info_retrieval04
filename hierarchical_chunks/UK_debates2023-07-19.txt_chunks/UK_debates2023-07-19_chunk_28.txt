Conversion therapy is quackery packaged up by bigots seeking to promote their hate and to profit from it.
On  19 January , a Minister promised at the Dispatch Box to bring forward a ban against conversion therapy and ensure that pre-legislative scrutiny was completed before the end of this parliamentary term.
How does my right hon.
Friend plan to continue that?
May I also welcome his statement today and thank those LGBT veterans who are with us?
We are so grateful for their service and we seek this ban also in their name.
