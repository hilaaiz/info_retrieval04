I made some reference to the specific nature of the threat posed by Northern Ireland-related terrorism.
It is clear that it is primarily concentrated and directed against targets in Northern Ireland.
I regularly discuss with UK Government colleagues how we can ensure robust defences across the whole piece, but I am happy to see what more can be done through a conversation.
The rapid proliferation of end-to-end encryption and anonymous messaging services allows terrorist groups  to communicate freely without the risk of detection or identification.
Of course, personal privacy must be upheld for ordinary citizens, so how are the Government looking to work with tech experts to find alternative ways of accessing the communications of members of such groups?
This is something that really does concern me.
The proposed roll-out of end-to-end encryption without enabling lawful access or without safeguards will pose a danger not just to national security, but to children and to all our people.
It is vital that the technology companies work with us to roll out the available technology—I am confident that it exists—to enable and protect privacy rights, but at the same time to enable law enforcement access and interventions to take place so that we can safeguard children online, prevent radicalisation online and prevent criminality online.
