With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like expand on the apology delivered by the Prime Minister this afternoon for the unacceptable hurt caused to LGBT members of our nation’s armed forces by the 1967 to 2000 ban on homosexuality.
It was not acceptable and it was not what the brave men and women it affected deserved.
For that, on behalf of the Government and the armed forces, I am deeply sorry.
