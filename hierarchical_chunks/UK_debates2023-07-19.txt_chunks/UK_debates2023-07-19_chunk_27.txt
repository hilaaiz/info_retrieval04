I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I will leave him and the Labour party to debate the finer points of policy between them.
On the substance, because it is important, the track record demonstrates that we are making a difference and reducing child poverty.
There are now 400,000 fewer children in poverty than there were in 2010, as a result of the  actions of this Government—notably, by moving their parents into work, because that has the single best benefit for those children.
That is the right policy and it is one that we will continue to deliver.
