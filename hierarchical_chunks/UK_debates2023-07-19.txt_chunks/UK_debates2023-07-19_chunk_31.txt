I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that issue.
I cannot imagine how difficult it is for families whose children are being treated for cancer, with everything that comes along with that.
I will happily look into  the specific issue that she has mentioned and get back to her in all haste.
She should know that she has my  total support for helping and supporting families  who are going through what will be an unbelievably difficult time.
