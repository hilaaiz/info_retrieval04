I welcome my right hon.
Friend’s interest in this area, and she is absolutely right to say that we have enormous opportunity in our space sector, across a range of aspects.
I know that the Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman) , would like to discuss her constituency interest further with her.
I can also assure the House that there will be further updates coming soon on the UK Government’s space strategy.
