I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his observations.
He talked about support and compensation for victims of terrorism.
More can and must be done, which is why the Government are reviewing the support available to better address victims’ needs.
We are absolutely committed to ensuring that victims of terrorism get the full compensation to which they are entitled, in line with schemes administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority.
Those schemes deliver for victims of terrorism.
The truth is that no amount of compensation can ever make up for the ordeal suffered by victims of terror.
That is why it is right that survivors get all the support they need, in whatever form it may be required, through the publicly funded CICA, which paid out more than £158 million to victims of violent crime last year alone.
