The Prime Minister mentioned our armed forces.
May I mention them again?
We lost 457 personnel killed in Afghanistan, and several thousand suffered life-changing injuries.
So I and some of my colleagues on the Defence Committee were absolutely stunned to see a video posted by our own Chairman lauding the Taliban’s governance of Afghanistan but not mentioning that they are still trying to identify and kill Afghan civilians who sided with NATO forces, nor the fact that they do not like girls to go to school.
Can I make it plain that that was not in our name, and can I have the Prime Minister’s assurance that that silly and naive act was not in his name either?
I join my right hon.
Friend in paying tribute to our brave serving personnel and veterans, and I thank them for their service, as we touched on earlier.
We have repeatedly called out, and will continue to repeatedly call out, the human rights abuses that we see around the world.
He mentions rightly the prohibition on women being educated in Afghanistan, which is something that we have spoken about in the past.
We will also continue to have dialogue with regimes.
That does not mean that we consider those regimes to be legitimate or that we approve of their actions, but that is all part, as he will understand, of establishing normal diplomatic presence in countries where the situation allows.
I will very happily look into the specific case that he raises.
It is not just the adoption of the disgusting two-child benefit cap; it is the endorsement of a hard Brexit, the tuition fees, the immigration.
Does the Prime Minister not agree that there is now no real difference between the two main UK parties?
Is it not time that we perhaps rearranged the furniture in this House, had them all on one big Bench and re-titled them the “This is what you get from the UK party”?
