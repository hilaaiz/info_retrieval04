I should draw the House’s attention to the fact I am a leaseholder subject to service charges, as are hundreds of my constituents.
There is very often a real lack of transparency and accountability from service providers.
Bills are not very clear, and it takes quite a lot of effort to understand them.
The Government could regulate, but will the Minister use his convening powers to encourage service providers to do better, prior to discussing legislation that could take a very long time?
