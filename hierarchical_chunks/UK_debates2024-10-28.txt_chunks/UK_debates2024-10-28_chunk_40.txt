I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that point, though it is not about leasehold but about the private rental sector.
Our Renters’ Rights Bill, which is currently in Committee, poses no threat to good landlords.
Indeed, it will improve the situation for good landlords by driving out unscrupulous and rogue landlords from the system.
As part of that Bill, landlords have robust grounds to take back possession of their properties when it is appropriate to do so.
What they cannot do is  arbitrarily evict tenants through section 21.
We will finally abolish section 21 no-fault evictions where the previous Government failed to do so.
