Rough sleeping is the most visible end of the homelessness crisis, but it is also brutal—the average age of death for rough sleepers in London is just 44.
The rough sleeping initiative is literally saving lives—in Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, 102 people are kept alive every year through that programme—but it is due to end in March 2025.
Removing it has been described by local teams as nothing short of catastrophic, so what assessment has taken place of the impact of that initiative, and what assurance can the Secretary of State give local authorities about the maintenance of the scheme so that they can plan for the long term?
Again, I ask hon.
Members to wait for the spending review on Wednesday, and for the provisional settlement in December.
We are under no illusion about the pressures faced by councils on homelessness.
In the end, we need to repair the system, which is about providing safe, secure and affordable housing for people to live in.
We will do that, but we also recognise that there is a problem today.
Further detail on that will follow.
What plans her Department has to develop Stretton Hall through the new homes accelerator programme.
Stretton Hall is one of seven sites that the Government have identified to date that we believe would benefit from support through the new homes accelerator, which is a joint programme between the Department and Homes England aiming to speed  up the delivery of large-scale housing developments  across England.
Documents from Harborough district council reveal that there are sites with a capacity of up to 16,000 homes around Stretton Hall.
The Government’s press release in August said that there would be around 4,000 homes on the site that they are involved in.
Will the Minister confirm which Minister visited the site before the announcement?
Will he agree to publish the methodology that led to our community being selected, and the list of sites that were considered but not selected?
