I thank the right hon.
Gentleman again for his interest in my travels, but I have to correct him on a few points.
I did, of course, raise Xinjiang in the context of human rights.
I absolutely raised, as I  assured you, Mr Speaker, that I would, the position of parliamentarians—of course I did—not just with the Foreign Minister but with the foreign affairs spokesperson for the Chinese Communist party.
I raised that as a matter of huge concern.
I also raised the threats and aggression that we are now seeing in the South China sea.
Jimmy Lai, I raised; Members of this House, I raised; Xinjiang, I raised; Hong Kong, I raised.
It would be totally unacceptable for any UK Foreign Minister to go to China and not raise those issues of tremendous concern.
