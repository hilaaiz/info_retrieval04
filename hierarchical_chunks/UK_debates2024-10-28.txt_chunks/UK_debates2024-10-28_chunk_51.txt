I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
On China, this Government are clear that the UK’s national interests will always come first.
Pragmatic engagement matters, not only to co-operate on shared challenges but to make progress in areas where we disagree.
On my visit I made it clear that Chinese companies must stop supplying equipment to Russia that is being used in Ukraine.
I also highlighted North Korean recklessness in stepping up its support for Putin—a threat to European security and stability in the Korean peninsula.
I was robust on human rights, including in Xinjiang.
I raised our serious concerns—which the right hon.
Gentleman has also raised on many occasions—about the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong and called for the immediate release of British national Jimmy Lai.
I called on Beijing to lift its unwarranted sanctions against parliamentarians, including the right hon.
Gentleman.
This was a matter that I raised with you, Mr Speaker, before attending.
I raised Taiwan, and warned that cyber-activity or interference in our democracy is unacceptable and will always be met by a strong response.
