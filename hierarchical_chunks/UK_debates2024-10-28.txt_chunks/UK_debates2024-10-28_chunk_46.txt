I thank the Secretary of State for everything that she is doing to tackle Islamo-phobia.
This anti-Muslim discourse is a scourge on our communities in Burnley, Padiham and Brierfield.
Will she join me in celebrating the work of local volunteers, churches, mosques, Lancashire police and others who organised Burnley’s “Diversity Picnic—Bubbles in the Park”, and who worked so successfully in averting potential disturbances over the summer?
