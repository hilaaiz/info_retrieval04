I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I cannot wait to join him at Bubbles in the Park on a future date, as Burnley is not that far away from my constituency.
He is absolutely right to celebrate the work of volunteers in communities and public servants, who give their time and energy to strengthen our local areas and bring people together.
