As I said in my original response, we recently consulted on how the planning system could do more to support the creation of healthy places.
I will continue to work closely with colleagues in the Department of Health and Social Care when considering next steps, as well as engaging with local authorities.
As I said in answer to a previous question, my Department is analysing responses to the NPPF consultation with a view to issuing a Government response before the end of the year.
I always try to be helpful to the Minister, and I thank him for his answer.
In Northern Ireland, the steps we have taken on fast food outlets include close liaison with school principals to ensure that pupils do not access carry-out food, and addressing the issue of litter, which is the responsibility of fast food outlets.
Perhaps the Minister might want to contact the relevant Northern Ireland Department to gauge what has worked for us.
