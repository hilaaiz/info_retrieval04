I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I assure him and the House that the Government are committed to securing better environmental outcomes alongside facilitating the development that our country so desperately needs.
In our consultation on proposed reforms to the NPPF, we made it clear that land safeguarded by existing environmental designations will maintain its current protections.
We are exploring how we might streamline house building and infrastructure delivery by using development to fund nature recovery where both are currently stalled.
However, we have made it clear that we will act with legislation only when we have confirmed to Parliament that the steps we are taking will deliver positive environmental outcomes.
