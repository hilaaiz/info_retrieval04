I thank the Minister for his reply.
My constituent Paul faces inflation-busting maintenance cost rises and unexpected in-year fees.
His attempts to scrutinise FirstPort’s work and his willingness to fight back have resulted in an exchange of letters with solicitors.
When my hard-working office team asked FirstPort for an explanation of what is going on, the company took more than six weeks to reply with inadequate answers, and it did so only when I took the step of contacting it personally to say that I was raising its name in the House today.
While long-awaited changes are being considered, what would the Minister advise my constituent and others like him to do in the meantime?
