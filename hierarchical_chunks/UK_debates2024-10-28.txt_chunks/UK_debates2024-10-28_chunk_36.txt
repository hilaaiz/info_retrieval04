I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and recognise his constituent’s experience.
As outlined in the King’s Speech, the Government are committed to bringing the injustice of “fleecehold” private estates and unfair costs to an end.
We will consult in due course on the best way to achieve that.
In the interim, as I said, we need to implement the new protections for homeowners on private estates in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024.
That will create a new regulatory framework to make estate management companies more accountable to homeowners for how their money is spent.
