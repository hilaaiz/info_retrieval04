I welcome my hon.
Friend to his place, and he is absolutely right: it is a source of national shame that just over 1.3 million households are on social housing waiting lists.
Nearly 14,000 of them are in Northumberland alone.
This Government do not accept that it has to be this way; we will deliver a fairer, more sustainable right-to-buy scheme where existing social housing stock is protected to meet housing need.
I recognise the particular housing challenges faced by rural communities, and that is why the Government announced that the 2021 to 2026 affordable homes programme will be targeted, so that 5% to 10% of delivery outside London will be homes in rural areas.
