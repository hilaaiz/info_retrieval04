Ministers dropped the last Government’s plan for the development of Cambridge and connections to nearby towns including Haverhill in my constituency.
When will the Government come forward with an integrated plan to develop Cambridge and improve road and rail links to towns like Haverhill?
I wrote to local leaders in the greater Cambridge area a few weeks ago to make it clear that the Government believe the area is a site where we should take forward nationally significant housing growth.
We will set out further details in due course, but the hon.
Gentleman will be aware that the Cambridge growth company is taking plans and pulling together an evidence base to set out precisely what the scale of development should be and how it should take place in that area.
What steps she is taking to protect the green belt in Farnham and Bordon constituency.
The Government attach great importance to the green belt, including the more than 20,000 hectares in the borough of Waverley in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency.
In planning terms, the green belt serves a number of specific purposes, but the fundamental aim of green belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open.
The Government do not intend to change the general purposes of the green belt or its general extent, but we are committed to taking a more strategic approach to green-belt land designation and release so that we can build more homes in the right places.
