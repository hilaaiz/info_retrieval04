I thank the Secretary of State for her answer.
Conservative-run Northumberland county council’s own figures show that over 6,000 people in Northumberland are not adequately housed.
Despite that, since the Conservatives have led the council, its own housing stock has decreased in number.
Does the Secretary of State agree that we need more social homes in the right places to support the thousands of people in North Northumberland in need of a safe and secure place to live?
