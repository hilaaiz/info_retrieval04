My right hon.
Friend has rightly outlined the complex nature of our relationship with China.
May I add to the long list the tension in the strait of Taiwan and the effect that that is likely to have on international trade if it goes wrong?
The fact that the relationship is complicated, however, does not mean that we should  not get clarity.
That is important not just for Members of the House but for others, whether they are promoting British exports overseas or are human rights campaigners such as Sebastien Lai, whom I met last week, or are British representatives in Mongolia.
We need clarity in our approach to China, so we urgently need to know when the China audit will be completed.
Will my right hon.
Friend tell us when that is likely to happen, and will he also commit to appearing before my Committee to answer questions about it?
Yes, of course, I will appear before my right hon.
Friend’s Committee, whenever she commands, to answer questions.
She is absolutely right—the issues in the Taiwan strait are very serious.
I raised those issues in China, and also in Indonesia and in Korea.
We need a consistent approach to China, which is why  we are doing the audit.
It is my hope that it will be complete early next year.
