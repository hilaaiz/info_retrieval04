I thank the hon.
Member for meeting me at one of our regular drop-in sessions.
His concern is reflected across the country.
Local communities recognise that their council is being forced to choose vital neighbourhood services against targets for adult social care, children’s services and homelessness services.
In the end, we need to rebuild the foundation from scratch, and that is exactly what we are committed to doing.
