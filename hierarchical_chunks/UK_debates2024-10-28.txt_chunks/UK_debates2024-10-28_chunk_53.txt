I thank you for granting this urgent question, Mr Speaker.
China is even now carrying out military exercises threatening Taiwan and threatening to blockade it, which would damage all our economies, yet I see in the Foreign Office’s readout after the visit to China that there was absolutely no discussion of that  issue.
Why not?
On human rights in Xinjiang, the House of Commons, including the Labour party in opposition, voted that genocide was taking place in Xinjiang, yet the Foreign Office readout simply said: “Human rights were discussed”.
This is a genocide taking place, with slave labour.
Why is there not more robust condemnation from the Government to China?
