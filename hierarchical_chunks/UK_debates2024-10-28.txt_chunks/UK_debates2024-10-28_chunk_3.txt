Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak in this debate on remembrance and veterans.
I congratulate my hon.
Friends the Members for Nuneaton (Jodie Gosling) and for Chipping Barnet (Dan Tomlinson), and  the hon.
Member for Reigate (Rebecca Paul) , on their excellent contributions.
It was an honour to attend the festival of remembrance organised just over a week ago by the Leicester and Leicestershire British Legion at De Montfort hall.
That festival was an outstanding tribute to those who have served in the military and those who are currently serving.
It paid thanks to our armed forces with some outstanding performances from local musicians and contemporary dancers.
However, it is the harrowing accounts of those who experienced the D-day landings that will stay with me.
It will be a privilege to be involved in the many remembrance events across the constituency.
It is the honour of my life to have been elected to serve as the MP for North West Leicestershire.
In that role, I am following Andrew Bridgen, who served the community proudly for 14 years.
While we do not share much in terms of our politics, I know that he worked hard for his constituents.
While I am referencing former MPs, I have to go back further to our former Labour MP, the late David Taylor, who sadly died in office in 2009.
It will be no surprise to those who knew David that he is fondly remembered today in the constituency.
North West Leicestershire is in the heart of the national forest.
It is a fast-growing area, with the highest housing growth in Leicestershire and an equally impressive growth in employment opportunities.
None of this is surprising, considering our transport links: we have an international airport, East Midlands airport, which includes one of the largest freight operations in the country.
However, like so many other areas that have seen massive growth, we have been lagging behind in terms of infrastructure.
Local people need to see delivery of our commitment to expand public services, rather than the scaling-back we saw for the past 14 years under the Conservatives.
I am proud to be the first female MP in the history of North West Leicestershire.
Recently, I had the pleasure of attending the unveiling of the newly refurbished mother and child statue in Coalville.
Stuart Warburton, a local historian, has kindly checked for me, and we think that it is the first statue of a lone woman to be installed in the whole of Leicestershire.
That award-winning statue, first installed in 1963, depicts a woman proudly striding forward with her son while holding a shopping bag containing many items linked to the constituency, including a lump of coal, an oil tanker, a yarn bobbin  and a dolly.
It occurred to me that there is no better way of showcasing our constituency than by considering some of the items in her bag.
North West Leicestershire has a rich mining heritage.
The coalmining industry has been so important to the development of North West Leicestershire that it is literally gives its name to the main urban centre, Coalville.
The coalfields powered Britain, and Kegworth—also in my constituency—is just a stone’s throw away from the last coal-fired power station in the UK, which closed just a few weeks ago.
As is customary in a maiden speech, I will briefly adopt the role of travel agent: I highly recommend that everyone does a tour arranged by the Snibston Heritage Trust in Coalville.
Snibston has one of the last remaining examples of above-ground working of the coalmines.
We also have many pit wheels dotted across the constituency, reminding us of what previously lay beneath our feet.
While in Coalville, visitors can pop into the Belvoir centre to sample the famous Birds Bakery jam tarts.
My constituency is home to another character who enjoys sweet things: just a few miles up the road, in the wonderful town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, we recently had installed a Paddington Bear on a bench.
For the thrill seekers, we have Donington Park, home to MotoGP and motorbike racing, and for the heavy metal fans among us, it is also home to Download festival every June.
I turn to the oil tanker in the bag.
As with our coal heritage, North West Leicestershire’s fingerprints are all over the rail industry.
The oil tanker represents William Stableford’s wagon works, which delivered a large contract for English and foreign railways.
It is perhaps ironic that my constituency has no passenger rail service at all, even though the manufacturer Siemens completed the signalling work for the Elizabeth line from its base in the constituency.
One of my major goals in this House is to get the Ivanhoe line back running for passengers.
This trainline was originally created in the 1830s by the great industrialist and father of the railways, George Stephenson.
Reopening it has the potential to create a beautiful trainline travelling through the greenery of the national forest.
The national forest line—now that sounds nice!
North West Leicestershire had other industries, too.
It is no secret that Leicestershire has a long history with the British textile industry, hence the yarn bobbin in the bag.
H Seal Elastics has been knitting in the constituency since 1898 and currently provides textiles for use in military personal protective equipment—key equipment for our service personnel today.
North West Leicestershire was also the home of Palitoy, which produced the dolly in the bag and the action man figurine—a character that seized the day and got stuff done.
The contents of a North West Leicestershire shopping bag today would be similar to the contents of everyone’s shopping bags at home, as the constituency is now home to a selection of food and drink manufacturers.
In that shopping bag, there would be a selection of key produce from local farmers, KP Nuts, McVitie’s biscuits, a Mars bar, Jacob’s cream crackers, Quality Street, and some of the Mr Freeze ice pops that I enjoyed with the Secretary of State for Business and Trade a few months ago after a tour of the Refresco beverages factory.
During my time in this House, I hope to be an action woman—someone who adds to our North West Leicestershire bag with cleaner waterways, better public services for all and, most importantly, an anytime day return ticket on the Ivanhoe line.
As the Member of Parliament for the home of the British Army, it is my honour to speak in this debate on remembrance and veterans.
I will use my time to share a story from a veteran of the Royal Marines, who celebrates their birthday today.
My constituent has given me permission to share his story in the debate, although I have changed his name to protect his privacy.
John served our country with honour.
He was discharged from the Royal Marines after three years of service, but life outside the military was hard.
His mental health spiralled.
He ended up homeless, sleeping rough on the streets, so he went to the local authority for help.
This is the part of his story that shocked me, because John was  told that before the local authority could help him, it had first to confirm that he really was homeless.
Rather than taking John at his word, he was told that he would have to continue to sleep rough in a named location for two weeks and wait for an outreach worker to visit him to verify that he was homeless.
John did as he was ordered, following what he had been taught by his service, but he found staying in the same place meant he was targeted with verbal and physical abuse, so he moved and kept moving—the cycle went on for years.
Eventually, he was diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder and referred to Op Courage.
Even then, it took several more years in temporary accommodation and him witnessing a violent incident, before Op Courage and Help for Heroes were able to get John the specialist accommodation in my constituency that has allowed him to start to move forward with his life.
I know just how great a step it was for John to share his story with me.
I take three things from John’s story.
The first is that we owe our veterans much more than our silence and respect on Armistice Day; it is our duty to speak up whenever the systems that come from this place fall short.
Secondly, safe and accessible housing is vital.
That is why I was so proud to hear just a few weeks  ago the Prime Minister announce the Government’s commitment to house all veterans.
Thirdly, John’s experience tells me that our commitment to respecting every veteran must reach through every Government Department and every level of staff if we are to succeed—from the Secretary of State down to every member of frontline staff.
That is the culture change needed to deliver for people such as John who have served our country.
The spirit of remembrance is defined by what we do for one another, and the contribution that every one of us can make.
With shared effort, we can build a greater legacy for those who served us—now and in the future.
My constituent and resident of Burgess Hill, able seaman George Chandler, was due to lead the blind veterans at the remembrance parade on Remembrance Sunday the weekend after next.
Sadly, George died earlier this month.
He was 99 years old.
I never had the privilege of meeting George, but I have been able to speak to his son Paul, who gave me a wonderful insight into his father.
He was full of character and, in Paul’s words, an old rogue.
George was born to a working-class family off the Old Kent Road.
When war was declared, aged 14 George stayed in London—he was not evacuated—and experienced the Blitz in all its horror.
His father, Will, had been a soldier at the Somme, and George was determined that he would not be what he called one of the “poor bloody infantry”.
He was not going to go into the Army.
When he was still 17, he pestered and pestered the recruiters at the naval office to sign him up.
Eventually, they took him on, even though he had not yet reached his 18th birthday.
George saw active service in the channel as a gunner on a boat, with close combat with the Germans occurring very frequently.
On D-day, he provided cover for American troops landing on Omaha beach, watching the slaughter before his eyes.
He returned from the D-day landings to Newhaven in East Sussex, and saw rows and rows of empty coffins waiting for the dead.
This year, George was one of a handful of  remaining veterans who took part in the 80th anniversary commemorations.
He went to No. 10 Downing Street, HMS Belfast and the trooping of the colour.
This caused George’s family a certain amount of consternation, for George was not a Conservative.
His family were terribly worried about what George might say when he met Government Ministers.
They had a plan that if George let rip, they would whisk him away in his wheelchair before any embarrassment could be caused.
I am pleased to say to Conservative Members that he met Gillian Keegan, Grant Shapps and the former Prime Minister’s wife, and no event occurred.
I asked Paul what George’s messages to the House would be, and the answer—what Paul thought his dad would have said—was characteristically robust.
He was passionate about remembering his shipmates, those who gave their tomorrow for our today.
He stayed in contact throughout his life with the daughter— Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak in this debate on remembrance and veterans.

With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement to the House about the action the Chancellor will take this week to fix the foundations and rebuild Britain.
Economic growth and modern public services can only be built on strong foundations.
That is why this Government have brought political and economic stability back to Britain.
After years of chaos from the Conservative party—chaos that cost families, businesses and public services dear—the British people are now rightly looking to this new Labour Government to clear up the mess from the last Government, fix the foundations and rebuild Britain.
That is the change that my party promised the country, and it is the change that we will deliver.
To deliver that change, the fiscal rules that the Chancellor will set out this week will establish the basis for stable fiscal policy, meaning careful management of day-to-day spending and responsible long-term plans to invest and grow the economy.
As we committed to in our manifesto, the Government will have two robust fiscal rules that will guide the decisions we take.
The first is our stability rule: we will pay for all day-to-day spending on public services from receipts.
The budget was last in surplus under the last Labour Government, and this Labour Government will return the public finances to that position.
The second is our investment rule, which will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy.
It will ensure that we can secure the investment that our economy needs to grow, and to generate jobs and opportunities for people across the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, while maintaining a strong fiscal anchor and ensuring that our debt burden falls over time.
The plans that we inherited from the last Government would have seen public sector investment decline to the lowest level in more than 10 years.
The path of declining investment is the path of a declining nation, and we refuse to follow it.
Instead, we will seize the huge opportunities of the future to support the enterprise and talent that this country creates.
The Government recognise that sustained public investment is a crucial driver of long-term economic growth, giving the private sector the confidence to invest too, but our ambitions for public sector investment must be balanced against the need to maintain debt on a sustainable trajectory and ensure that we invest every pound of taxpayers’ money responsibly.
That is why I will deliver a 10-year national infrastructure strategy next spring, working with colleagues across Government, the nations and regions, and with our mayors and the private sector, to set out a robust long-term strategy for sound investment.
That is also why our new approach to overlapping multi-year spending reviews will improve the way that we allocate and spend capital, and why the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and I will lead the new national infrastructure and service transformation authority, which will drive better delivery of major projects and infrastructure across the country.
In addition, there will be the work of the new office for value for money and the National Audit Office.
Those robust guardrails will ensure that our capital spending is value for money, and that our financial investments deliver a positive return for the Exchequer.
Finally, the Chancellor has been listening to the views of institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, and to expert economists.
As she has set out, that is why the Treasury has been reviewing the right measure of debt to target in the fiscal rules ahead of the upcoming Budget.
The details of that policy will be announced to the House in the Chancellor’s statement on Wednesday, alongside an economic and fiscal forecast produced by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility.
In the usual way, the fiscal rules will be published in a draft charter for budget responsibility, on which Members will vote in due course.
I commend this statement to the House.
