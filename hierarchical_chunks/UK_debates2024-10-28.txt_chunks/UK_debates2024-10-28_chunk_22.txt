I thank the Minister for his update.
My constituents in Halesowen recognise that homes have been unaffordable to first-time buyers and welcome these planning changes, but they are frustrated by some of the scaremongering from the Opposition.
Can the Minister reassure my constituents that protecting the environment will be central to our planning changes as we roll out lots of additional new houses?
