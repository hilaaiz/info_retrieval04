In 2022, Lubov Chernukhin opened an amusement centre in Hastings town centre known as Owens.
The project received more than £400,000 of taxpayer money as part of the Conservatives’ levelling up towns fund plans.
Ms Chernukhin has also donated more than £200,000 to the Conservative party.
Shortly after opening, Owens closed, and earlier this month it was covered in boarding, which now dominates Hastings town centre.
