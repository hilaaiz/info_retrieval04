I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I have not had the opportunity to visit the site, but I intend to do so in the future, along with the other new homes accelerator sites.
On the point of principle, to meet housing demand and housing need in England, every area of the country must play its part.
The site in question is currently being promoted in both the Harborough local plan and the Oadby and Wigston local plan, as it crosses the boundary of both local authorities.
Although I appreciate that it does face a number of planning and enabling challenges, the Government believe that it nevertheless has the potential to make a significant contribution to housing supply in Leicestershire.
