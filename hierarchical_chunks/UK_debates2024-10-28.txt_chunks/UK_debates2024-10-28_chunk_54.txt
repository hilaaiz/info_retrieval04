In Jimmy Lai’s case, he is a British citizen and a prisoner in Hong Kong for committing no crime whatever.
Did the Foreign Secretary not only call for his release, as he just said, but demand full consular rights of access?
On sanctions on British parliamentarians, the week before last, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister whether the Foreign Secretary would tell the Chinese Government to lift the sanctions on parliamentarians.
The Prime Minister said that he would.
However, I see from the Foreign Office read-out that the Foreign Secretary did not even raise that, let alone call on the Chinese Government to lift those sanctions.
Given your brave support, Mr Speaker, for those of us who are sanctioned, I simply ask why the Government cannot follow suit and demand that from the Chinese?
I have just heard—this is my final point—that there is a move in the Foreign Office to lift British sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the brutal genocide in Xinjiang as a deal to lift the sanctions on parliamentarians here.
I must tell the Foreign Secretary that I, for one, would never accept such a shameful deal at any price, and I hope that he will stamp on that straightaway.
Will he make it clear what our real position is on what is becoming a clear and massive threat to our freedoms?
