I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that point.
He is absolutely right that the previous Government significantly expanded permitted development rights after 2013.
We acknowledge the criticism of those expanded rights, particularly because of the low-quality development that they have brought forward.
He raises a specific issue for leaseholders, but the problem goes wider than that.
I am more than happy to give consideration to the point he raises.
