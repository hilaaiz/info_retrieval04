We remain deeply concerned by Beijing’s abuse of human rights and disregard for international law.
Too often, the previous Government pursued trade links instead of acting on these concerns.
Will this Government now do the right thing and recognise that the crimes perpetrated against the Uyghurs amount to the crime of genocide?
China is not listening to the UK on Hong Kong, Jimmy Lai remains in prison, and the police have offered bounties in relation to pro-democracy activists.
Will the Foreign Secretary now put actions on the table, including reviewing our position on Hong Kong’s autonomy and whether it should continue to receive preferential customs status?
Can he assure the House that Hongkongers  who have sought refuge in the UK are receiving proper protection?
Finally, given that Taiwan is a democratic ally, can the Foreign Secretary assure the House that his Department played no part in preventing Parliament from hosting former President Tsai?
I do not recognise what was suggested in relation to Taiwan.
I assure the hon.
Gentleman that Jimmy Lai’s case is a priority for the Government and will remain so.
We continue to press for consular access to Jimmy Lai and for his release.
Diplomats from our consulate general in Hong Kong attended his court proceedings on a regular basis, to keep abreast of what is taking place.
