At the last oral questions, the Secretary of State assured me that she had no plans to increase council tax for anyone.
However, when pressed by my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) , she would not give the same guarantee that the single occupant discount would be retained.
Will Ministers take the opportunity to do so now?
I can see the shadow Secretary of State making that point repeatedly, because at this stage we are all waiting for the statement and the Budget that will contain that information, but I can say that the right decisions will be made in the interests of working people.
We recognise the cost of living crisis that is  being faced across the country.
I am sure that she, like all Members of the House, is waiting with interest for Wednesday.
Local authorities employ 2 million people and commission services such as adult social care.
The impact assessment for the Secretary of State’s Employment Rights Bill says that the Bill will increase costs.
Those costs are likely to be passed on to councils, so has the Secretary of State assessed the impact of the Employment Rights Bill and an increase in employers’ national insurance specifically on local authorities?
If costs do increase, will local councils be compensated?
Any decisions related to the Budget will be taken at the appropriate time, as will any decisions on the local government finance settlement.
What I can say, though, is that this is a new partnership from this Government: we are not locking local government out, but standing shoulder to shoulder with it.
Only last week at the Local Government Association conference in Harrogate, the Secretary of State launched the leaders’ council, a forum where central and local government will reset that relationship.
