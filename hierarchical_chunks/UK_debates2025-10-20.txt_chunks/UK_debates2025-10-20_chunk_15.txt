I recently saw some brilliant specialist provision in a neighbouring Liverpool constituency, but I know that, for too many children in Liverpool and across the country, waiting lists are too long for them to get the support they need.
That is why we have already started investing in early intervention.
Where there are concerns about a local authority’s capacity to make improvements, we will help them to identify barriers and put in place an effective recovery plan.
This year’s high needs funding increase will help mainstream and special schools with the cost of supporting pupils.
I have spoken to many anxious parents whose children have not been in receipt of an EHCP or local authority funding but would historically have benefited from independent education provision because of their SEND needs.
One of their concerns is that such provision can no longer be afforded because of the imposition of 20% VAT on those schools.
On behalf of those parents, I implore the Government to look at that again and do a U-turn.
Would the Conservatives support cutting breakfast clubs?
Would they support reducing the expansion of free school meals?
Would they sack teachers?
Those are some of the things being invested in because we made that decision.
We are determined to provide support for children with special educational needs wherever they need it.
We want children to be able to go to their local schools, but we will support them with their needs.
