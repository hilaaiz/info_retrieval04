I thank my hon.
Friend for her advocacy for her constituents.
This year, per-student funding is rising to £5,105—up from £4,843 last year.
These decisions made across the further education system and for sixth-form colleges mean that institutions can make the best choices for their students, including, where appropriate, backing students to study the international baccalaureate.
