I welcome the Minister to his new role.
I have been listening to him closely, but I have to say that the rhetoric does not match the actions.
In fact, the headteacher of Ashcroft academy wrote to the Secretary of State saying exactly that the IB cannot be delivered because the additional funding has been cut.
The international baccalaureate is recognised globally and allows British students to compete internationally.
Cutting funding will mean that those who can afford it will have access to it, but those who cannot—namely in our state sector—will not.
Why is the Minister scrapping funding for the IB and undermining standards in our state schools?
