I thank the Minister very much for his answers, and I thank  the hon.
Member for Hartlepool (Mr Brash)  for setting the scene so very well.
We in Northern Ireland are very keen to learn from the education system here.
I believe that the Education Minister from the Northern Ireland Assembly—he is a colleague in my party, by the way, so I understand his interests in these matters—will be keen to listen to and hear the suggestion put forward by the Minister.
Will the Minister share his ideas for Hartlepool with us in Northern Ireland to ensure that we can all benefit in this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?
