Can I say to those on the Front Bench that when I start coughing and shaking my head, I am trying to move you along, not indicating that you should carry on?
I think I am getting my signals wrong.
I recently met dedicated parents from my constituency who choose to home-educate their children.
They raised questions about duties on parents and providers to report details of their children’s education and recreational activities included in the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill.
Could the Minister reaffirm his support for home-education families and meet me, so that we can provide clarity for these parents?
England is an international outlier by not requiring the registration of electively home-educated children, and we are remedying that with the Bill’s measures.
Information on non-educational activities will not be required for inclusion in the registers.
I will happily meet my hon.
Friend to discuss this further.
Time and again in my constituency surgeries, I hear stories of children’s needs going unrecognised and unsupported for years.
Given the aim of increasing mainstream inclusion, what are the Government doing to ensure that all teachers receive comprehensive SEND training?
Teacher training is an incredibly important part of mainstream inclusion and, from this September, we have changed the core teacher training to ensure that it includes SEND content.
We are also supporting early years provision to have specialist SEND support, alongside the wider work to support mainstream inclusion.
Sacriston academy, a primary school in my constituency, has ceilings held up by scaffolding joists.
The classrooms, built in 1910, are unusable due to water penetration through the ceilings and walls.
Can the Minister say when the funding might be available to repair the school, after 14 years of Tory neglect?
