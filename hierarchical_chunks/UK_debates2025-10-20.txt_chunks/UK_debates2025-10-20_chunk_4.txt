I know that my hon.
Friend is a champion for Ashcroft academy and has visited it many times.
I can confirm that the changes that the Government are making will mean that the international baccalaureate can still be studied.
We are providing funding for 16-to-19 provision so that sixth-form colleges can make those decisions.
This week I have been inundated by families who send their children to Europa school just outside my constituency; they are so concerned by these changes.
I taught the IB for 11 years, and I know full well the difference that its incredible curriculum can make to children’s lives.
Does this policy direction not send a negative signal from the Government?
I remind the Minister that it was a Labour Government who introduced the funding in the first place.
Surely this is the wrong direction.
The decision is essentially about where in the system resources go.
Over 75% of students in receipt of extra support from the large programme uplift are studying A-levels, and we want to prioritise support for the vast majority of students who are studying A-levels and taking extra A-levels, including further maths.
That is right for our economy, and it is also right for the vast majority of students.
We still recognise the international baccalaureate as an important course and we want to support it.
I, too, have a school in my constituency that offers the international baccalaureate.
Dane Court school in Broadstairs has an extremely successful programme in breaking down barriers to opportunity for a large number of pupils in an area of significant deprivation.
Only 10% of the children in East Thanet succeed in passing the Kent test; we need to be able to ensure that those children and others get the maximum opportunities available.
Will the Minister reassure me, the senior leadership team, and parents and children at Dane Court that the international baccalaureate will still be possible for those children and for future generations?
