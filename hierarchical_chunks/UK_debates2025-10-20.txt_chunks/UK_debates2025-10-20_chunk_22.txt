One year ago, the Education Secretary paused plans to open 44 approved free schools.
In January, she said that she was “working rapidly” to make a decision.
That was nine months ago—enough time to make a baby, but not enough time for her to make up her mind.
When will our Ministers tell those free school founders—among whom are some of the best education leaders in the country—if they can open great new schools?
There is a choice here.
We are debating how the Government, within only a few months of being elected, are making big progress across the education system.
That includes big decisions made at fiscal events to invest capital into programmes such as this one, which at every opportunity the Conservatives have failed to support.
We are able to make these decisions to improve our school estate only because of the decisions made at fiscal events.
When the British Sign Language GCSE will be available in schools.
This is a really important qualification that is a step forward in opening up British Sign Language.
However, the GCSE is a new qualification, and a lot of work is going into ensuring that the new assessment works for a wide range of students.
Ofqual has consulted on its proposed assessment arrangements and expects to publish its final qualification rules this autumn.

Beyond qualifications, what work is being done to ensure that deaf children and their whole families can access BSL teaching without cost, especially in the early years, when their deaf babies’ brains are developing language skills?
