I thank the Secretary of State for her response.
In Knowsley, while we are making progress with work from the council and organisations such as the Brilliant Club, we still fall below average for young people going into higher learning.
Barriers remain to continuing education, and to developing skills for good jobs and good lives.
Will she meet me to discuss how we can improve that?
