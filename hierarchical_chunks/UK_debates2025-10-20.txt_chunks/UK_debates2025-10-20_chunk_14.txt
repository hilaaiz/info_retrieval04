I welcome the Minister’s response and the £740 million investment into the sector.
However, although Liverpool has improved waiting times for EHCPs, there remains a shortage of specialist school places and necessary support.
Some 8,000 children in Liverpool now require an EHCP—that figure has doubled over the past three years—but almost half of them are educated in mainstream schools that do not meet their needs.
More children with SEND are excluded from school and sent into inadequate pupil referral units and alternative provision.
What steps will the Government take to ensure that SEND reforms deliver real improvements for families in Liverpool Riverside, and that no child is excluded from education because of a lack of services?
