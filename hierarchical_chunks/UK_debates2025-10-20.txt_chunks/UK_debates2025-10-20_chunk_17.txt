My Committee’s recent inquiry on SEND found that, although support from health services is critical in enabling many children with special educational needs and disabilities to access education, health is often not represented at the table and there are no effective mechanisms to hold health services to account for the vital role that they play.
What engagement does my hon.
Friend the Minister have with her Department for Health and Social Care counterparts to ensure that health services play their full part in supporting and enabling children’s education?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her leadership of the incredibly detailed Education Committee report, which I read with interest.
I know how much expertise went into that, and how many conversations there were with parents; there is so much rich information in it.
I agree that the partnership with health is essential, and that is something I am focused on.
To give children and young people the best opportunities, we must work across Government to support young people with special educational needs.
What steps her Department is taking to ensure that it meets its target of two thirds of young people participating in higher-level learning.

Later today I will make a statement on our post-16 education and skills White Paper, which sets out measures  to support this learning ambition.
For too long, skills have not been taken seriously, and that stops with Labour.
Our long-term plan for national renewal will unlock opportunity for our young people, and drive growth for our country with clearer pathways, stronger alignment, and a renewed partnership between Government and business.
