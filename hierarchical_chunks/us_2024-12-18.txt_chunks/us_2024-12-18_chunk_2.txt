Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of more than two decades of extraordinary public service by Catherine (Katie) Rice to the County of Marin Board of Supervisors, as an aide, supervisor, and president.
Supervisor Rice has deep roots in Marin County.
Raised in Mill Valley, she graduated from Tamalpais High School and received degrees in both Liberal Studies and English from Sonoma State University.
After college, she worked as a journalist for several North Bay publications and developed professional skills researching complex community issues.
She settled in San Anselmo where she raised her three children and became an active community leader.
An effective advocate for high-quality education, land preservation, and environmental stewardship, Supervisor Rice co-founded the Ross Valley Schools Foundation, served on the Sleepy Hollow Homeowners Association Board, and assisted in the creation of a master plan for San Domenico School.
In 2003, Supervisor Rice expanded her public service work as an aide to former Marin County Supervisor Hal Brown.
Her connections throughout the greater Ross Valley community made her an important asset to Supervisor Brown.
After helping him win reelection, he chose Supervisor Rice to lead his office as Chief Aide, a role she held for eight years.
When Supervisor Brown was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2011, she was appointed to his seat by Governor Jerry Brown.
She was then officially selected by voters in 2012, 2016, and 2020.
