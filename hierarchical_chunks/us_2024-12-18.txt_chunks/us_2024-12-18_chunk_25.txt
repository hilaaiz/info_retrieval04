Mr. CALVERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Bill Zimmerman, who is completing his term as mayor of the city of Menifee, California.
Bill has been a true leader in Riverside County for decades and served as an effective advocate whose many tireless efforts to better our region will be missed.
Bill attended Vanguard University in Costa Mesa, California from 1981 to 1984.
In 1989, along with his wife Julie, Bill purchased a new home in the community.
After the town incorporated in 2008, Bill was appointed to serve on its first Planning Commission.
He also served on the City's Parks, Recreation & Trails Commission.
Bill was first elected to serve on the Menifee City Council in 2012 to represent District 3.
In 2020, Bill was elected to serve as Menifee's directly elected mayor.
As mayor, Bill has worked tirelessly to support the infrastructure and recreational opportunities required from a growing residential community.
My office and I have been proud to work hand-inhand with Bill and city staff to support these efforts with federal resources.
In addition to his role at city hall, Bill serves on the Board for Boys & Girls Club, Menifee Valley Historical Association, and is President of the Antelope-Menifee Rural Center Board.
Bill clearly possesses a passionate belief in public service and a dedication to the community he has served so faithfully.
I know I speak on behalf of all residents in expressing my heartfelt thanks and praise for Bill's significant contributions to Menifee.
I wish Bill and his family the very best in the years to come.
