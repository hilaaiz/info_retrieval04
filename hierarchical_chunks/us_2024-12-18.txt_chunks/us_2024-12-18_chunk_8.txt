Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the loss of retired Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Peterson--a champion for southern Nevada's veteran community.
Chief Peterson was a highly decorated Army Veteran and unrelenting advocate for those around him.
After flying helicopters in the Army for more than 20 years, he came home to serve as Commander of the Henderson Chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, be a member of the Henderson Vietnam Veterans of America, and attend as many Unaccompanied Veterans Burial Ceremonies as he could find.
He also attended every Veterans Treatment Court graduation and never hesitated to offer his support to fellow veterans in need.
To be clear: it is impossible to sum up Chief Peterson's decades of service in just one speech on the House floor.
That's part of the reason why I had the privilege of working with the Library of Congress for his story to be part of the Veterans History Project.
But while he has too many medals to name here, I can say this: Chief Peterson, you were a mentor, leader, a friend, a protector, and a servant to both southern Nevada and our entire country.
We all owe him a debt of gratitude, and we will all miss him.
