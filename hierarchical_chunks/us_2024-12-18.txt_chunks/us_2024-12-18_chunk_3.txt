Supervisor Rice is known for her critical thinking skills and professional style, always applying informed decision making and attention to the concerns of her constituents.
She doesn't shy away from complicated issues.
She has taken lead roles in a multitude of initiatives, including flooding in Ross Valley and developed a keen understanding of how to work with agency partners such as the United States Army Corp.
Always steadfast in her values to protect our vulnerable communities, she was largely responsible for the completion of major projects including Project Homekey, permanent supportive housing in Larkspur, and the establishment of the Marin Wildfire Protection Authority, which organizes countywide wildfire prevention and preparedness efforts.
It was my privilege and honor to work with Supervisor Rice.
She is not afraid to rise to the occasion and embrace complex challenges from mitigating sea-level rise and greenhouse gas admissions to improving community health and reducing homelessness.
I appreciate her collaborative leadership style, strong work ethic, and wit.
