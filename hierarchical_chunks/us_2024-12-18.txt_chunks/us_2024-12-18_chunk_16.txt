Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize David Winnacker as he retires from his role as Chief of the Moraga-Orinda Fire District.
David has worked tirelessly to promote public safety and improve quality of life for residents of the East Bay.
David served with the Fresno Fire Department and Alameda Fire District before joining the Moraga-Orinda Fire District (MOFD) in 2017.
David also served in the Marine Corps and remains in the Marine Corps Reserves.
He has earned the rank of Colonel, serving as the Commanding Officer for the Fourth Reconnaissance Company and as the Deputy Commander of the Twenty-Third Marine Regiment.
During his time with MOFD, David has shown his dedication to mitigating wildfire risk and making our community safer.
Under his leadership, MOFD developed a strategic plan to implement early warning systems and provide real-time fire spread modeling.
He has worked to expand MOFD's outreach to the community, providing critical education and resources to property owners to implement fuels mitigation techniques at their homes.
Further, he was worked collaboratively with local elected officials, insurance industry representatives, and other key stakeholders to improve emergency preparedness throughout the fire district.
David's efforts have been critical in reducing wildfire risk and keeping residents safe.
Please join me in congratulating Chief Winnacker on his well-deserved retirement after years of outstanding service.
