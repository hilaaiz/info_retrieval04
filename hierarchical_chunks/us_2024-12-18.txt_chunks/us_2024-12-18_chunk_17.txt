Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with Representative John Garamendi to recognize Mark Ross as he retires from his role with the Martinez City Council.
Throughout his life, Mark has been a strong advocate for the City of Martinez in California and has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of Contra Costa residents.
Mark grew up in Martinez, attending Alhambra High School, and earned his degree in English Literature from UC Berkeley.
He went on to start Ross Company Realtors where he has helped guide clients through Contra Costa's real estate market for the last 30 years.
Mark has been a devoted public servant and has continually shown his commitment to Martinez residents.
He has served on the Martinez City Council since 1996 where he has been critical in fostering a strong sense of community throughout the City.
During his time on Council, he has worked to improve public safety, bolster Martinez's historic downtown, and protect Martinez's open spaces and environment.
Further, Mark has spent much of his time focusing on California's environment.
He played a critical role in the Alhambra Creek Restoration Project, which has helped to protect the watershed and native plant life.
Additionally, Mark has served as a Director on the Bay Area Air Quality Management District's (BAAQMD) board since 2001, where he has worked on reducing emissions, supporting the health and safety of Bay Area residents, and leading regional efforts to address the challenges associated with climate change.
Please join me and 
Representative Garamendi in thanking Mark Ross for his many contributions to our region and in congratulating him on his well-deserved retirement.
