Mr. Speaker, Alfred Williams' legacy transcends the sport of bass fishing.
He is a testament to the power of resilience, skill, and quiet confidence in overcoming barriers and achieving excellence.
On behalf of the people of Mississippi's 2nd Congressional District and the entire Nation, I am honored to recognize and celebrate his contributions to our society.
