Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and legacy of 
Mr. Alfred Williams, a pioneer in the world of professional bass fishing and an inspirational figure in the ongoing struggle for racial equality in America.
Although federal laws and court rulings of the 1950's and 1960's mandated racial desegregation, the reality on the ground in many parts of the South, particularly in Jackson, Mississippi, remained starkly different.
Persistent and often insurmountable barriers continued to divide communities.
It was within this challenging environment that Mr. Alfred Williams grew up, demonstrating resilience, quiet determination, and extraordinary skill that would ultimately break barriers and inspire generations.
After bravely serving our country in the Vietnam War, 
Mr. Williams returned home and turned his attention to bass fishing.
Entering a predominately white arena, he became a trailblazer, competing in bass tournaments where he was often the only Black angler in the field.
Despite the obstacles he faced, he consistently demonstrated his talent and tenacity, earning victories and accolades that spoke louder than any words.
In 1983, 
Mr. Williams made history as the first Blank angler to qualify for the Bassmaster Classic, the pinnacle of professional bass fishing.
Competing against 42 of the world's best anglers on the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he finished in an impressive 10th place, surpassing legendary names like Hank Parker, Rick Clunn, Denny Brauer, and Roland Martin.
This groundbreaking achievement opened doors for future Black anglers, paving the way for figures such as Ish Monroe, Mark Daniels Jr., and others to follow.
