Mrs. NAPOLITANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the patriotism of Jordan Ramirez.
Jordan Ramirez resides in La Puente with his parents and older sister.
He and his family started participating in 5K races when Jordan was 4.
Their first race was at Disneyland, where Jordan dressed up as Captain America because he loved superheroes and would often talk about showing support for firefighters, police and military members.
Jordan broke a world record by doing seven marathons in seven continents by the age of 10.
As he's gotten older, Jordan's mindset about showing his support to military and first responders has remained the same.
When races were canceled due to the pandemic, Jordan found the walks to be another way to express that support.
When Jordan first began his appreciation walks in September 2020, his father, Dimas Ramirez, created an Instagram account to document the journey, called ``thankyouforyourservicewalk.''
The account has connected Jordan with many of the departments they have honored, and continues to be a means for other first responder departments' requests to build morale.
Jordan's purpose behind the walks is two-fold: to thank first responders for their service, and to show appreciation and respect for what they do.
The walks are different from the marathons he's run because with those, he would ``usually just run for the fun of it, but the walks...
it's doing something else for our military and first responders.''
Most of these walks are in southern California, but the walks have also taken him to San Francisco, New York City, and Washington, D.C.
Jordan is currently a high school sophomore and working on his next goals: earning a nomination to the Naval Academy to become an officer in the Marine Corps and then to become a firefighter.
