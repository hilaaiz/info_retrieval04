I thank the hon.
Member for making that point.
It looks like I will not get to make a speech, but I want to put on the record that the Ulster Unionist party actually campaigned to remain in the European Union.
We thought it best at that point, because we foresaw exactly what is happening now.
We respect the referendum of this United Kingdom, but we are now seeing the enabling of what we were concerned about because of the lack of interest in this House with regard to some of the regulations that are coming through and how they are applied to Northern Ireland.
The hon.
Member mentioned medicines.
Yes, we have supply issues, which are global issues, but we also have additional supply issues because of regulation from the European Union.
