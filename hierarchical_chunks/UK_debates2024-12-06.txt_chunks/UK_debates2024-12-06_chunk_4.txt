I thank the hon.
and learned Member for introducing the Bill.
At Prime Minister’s questions, I asked the Prime Minister about the general product safety regulation that will come into effect next Friday, which will force suppliers in constituencies across England, Scotland and Wales to increase bureaucracy and costs if they still want to supply Northern Ireland consumers and producers.
Does he agree that it is absurd that we are putting additional costs on our internal UK market to facilitate the requirements of the European Union?
