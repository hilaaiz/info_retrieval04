I thank the hon.
Member for his contribution.
I want to give the point of view of my constituent, who runs a business.
She says, “I currently supply materials to a lady in Devon, who then produces goods for sale within the United Kingdom, only I’m at a complete loss as to what to do regarding the GPSR rules coming in.
The United Kingdom voted to leave the EU.
Successive Parliaments have done what they can to make this nation as dysfunctional as possible and  return us to EU subjugation.”
What would the hon.
Member tell my constituent’s business, which must close as part of the price to pay to further the aim of having an all-Ireland Irish Republic?
That is what my constituent says, and it is very much contrary to what the hon.
Gentleman said.
