I thank the hon.
and learned Gentleman for giving way.
I hope he will recognise that it is not laughter on the Government Benches, but bemusement at the inconsistency.
He opines about his anger that a third party can make law in Northern Ireland.
Many of us tried to untangle the inconsistencies in the Rwanda legislation.
The right hon.
Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)  and I tried in vain to raise it with the previous Government.
The critical issue was the right to remedy and the rights it gave people in Northern Ireland to petition a third party if they thought their Government was overbearing on their own basic rights.
The hon.
and learned Gentleman has himself used those rights: he has chosen to go to the Supreme Court and that is why we are here today.
He has not chosen to go to the Court in Strasbourg—that would be his right
and I would support him in doing so—but why would he deny the right to remedy to the rest of his fellow residents of Northern Ireland, as the Bill would, when he says he thinks it was wrong for that right to be protected by the European Court of Human Rights in the first place?
