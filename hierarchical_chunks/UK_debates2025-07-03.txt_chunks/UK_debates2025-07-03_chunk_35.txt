The Christian town of Taybeh is the same town as Ephraim in John’s gospel where Jesus went before his passion.
This town is entering a new passion: there was a violent attack by extremist Israeli settlers on the town on  26 June .
There is a continuing pattern of crops being destroyed and outposts being set up, and it is happening all over the west bank.
This is outrageous racial cleansing, deliberately designed to prevent a two-state solution and to drive out the people who have tended their crops there for 2,000 years.
Will the Church of England call out this outrage every day of the week in an attempt to put some sort of pressure on the Israeli Government?
