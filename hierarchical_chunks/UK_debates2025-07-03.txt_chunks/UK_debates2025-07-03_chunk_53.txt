The city of Perth is still recovering from a devastating fire, which unfortunately resulted in loss of life.
Residents were evacuated, and people were unable to access their properties.
Last week, together with local MSP John Swinney, I hosted a meeting with affected residents and businesses, and we found that support from insurance companies is nothing other than a lottery.
Can we have a debate about what people can rightly expect from insurance companies in such emergencies, and can we look at insurance companies being obliged to offer support to all customers who are unable to access their properties?
I am really sorry to hear of the incident in the hon.
Member’s constituency, and I am sure his constituents are very grateful for the leadership he has shown in tackling the after-effects of it.
He is right to raise the challenge of insurance companies.
We need to make sure that there are rights of recourse for customers and consumers, and that insurance companies are offering the service we need them to offer, because it is vital that people can rely on insurance.
