I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.
I have to say that I am as disappointed as she is that the BBC has not been able to come back with even basic facts.
There were hundreds of BBC staff there, and it is not acceptable that it is unable to identify who ultimately had the final decision on whether to broadcast.
The chairman needs to inform her, as a matter of urgency, who that was and what action they are going to take.
While I absolutely understand the independence of the BBC, just as artists cannot hide behind artistic expression for vile commentary, the BBC cannot hide behind independence from accountability.
I hope the Secretary of State knows that she has the full support of the Opposition as she pushes it for greater clarity.
