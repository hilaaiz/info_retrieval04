Several of my Chelmsford constituents have contacted me about the lack of local NHS dentistry services.
One constituent told me an all too familiar story: waiting list for NHS patients are either too long or closed, so he has had to rely on private dentistry for routine check-ups.
Now, he cannot afford crucial dental care because it would cost hundreds of pounds that he does not have.
That is a concern not only for patients but for dentists.
One Chelmsford dentist recently wrote to me detailing the need for the Government to urgently fix the failed contract that he works under, to ensure that providers are funded to carry out NHS services and take on more patients.
As with all healthcare, we know that the longer it takes to treat a problem, the more serious and expensive it can become.
