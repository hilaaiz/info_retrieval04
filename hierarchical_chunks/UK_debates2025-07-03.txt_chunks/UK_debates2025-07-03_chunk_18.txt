May I associate my party with the words said about Diogo Jota?
It is a tragic loss to the world of football.
A few weeks ago, we stood in this place and talked about the UK-EU reset deal.
My party welcomed the moderate progress, but we think the Government should go further, particularly on touring artists.
The Minister asked us to talk about this with our European liberal colleagues.
We have started those discussions.
Can he update us on his discussions and reassure us that this is on the agenda for the next review?
If he does not give us any good news soon on Europe, will he admit that we are close to the final countdown?
I had a horrible fear how that question was going to end.
It is really important that we win this battle.
This has to be a campaign that we wage across all of Europe—we need to get every single capital city in Europe on our side to make sure that, by the time we get to the next EU-UK summit, we can get this over the line.
British acts are desperately wanted, apart from anything else, in lots of different venues and arts festivals across the whole of Europe.
I have spoken to the commissioner who is in charge of this.
I have also spoken to four of my European counterparts.
My intention is to get round every single one of them so that we can get this over the line.
What steps her Department is taking to support the financial viability of women’s football.
I established the women’s football taskforce in 2024 in response to the Karen Carney review of women’s football.
The taskforce aims to achieve a financially sustainable women’s football pyramid, raising minimum standards for players, fans and everyone involved in the game.
As the Euros begin, I know the whole House will join me in wishing the Lionesses, and of course Wales, the very best of luck.
