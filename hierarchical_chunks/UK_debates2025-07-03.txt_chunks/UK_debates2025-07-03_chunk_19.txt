I thank the Minister for her response; I know she is aware of some of the financial challenges that my local club in Lewes faces.
With England about to start the defence of their European title in Switzerland against France on Saturday, does she share my concern that, despite the phenomenal rise in popularity of the women’s game, domestic prize money for the women’s FA cup still falls woefully short of that for the men’s?
It is frankly embarrassing that in 2025 we still tolerate that glaring inequality.
Will she support my call for the Football Association and the Premier League to equalise the women’s FA cup prize fund, so that women footballers are rewarded equally for the same achievement as their male counterparts?
