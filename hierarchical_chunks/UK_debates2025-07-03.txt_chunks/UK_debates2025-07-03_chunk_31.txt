I thank my hon.
Friend for the work she is doing representing the Church Commissioners.
The community of Hyndburn is vibrant and rich in its diversity, and I was proud to see how we responded to the awful riots last summer.
What conversations has she  had with the Church Commissioners on how the Church can continue to strengthen its work on integration and work with the Government as they develop a community cohesion strategy following the immigration White Paper?
