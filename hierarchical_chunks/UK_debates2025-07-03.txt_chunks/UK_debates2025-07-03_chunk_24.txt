I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that matter, and I agree with him.
The answer is that I am not satisfied with the response I have had.
I can update the House, as I promised to do on Monday, that I have received a reply to the very many questions raised by colleagues from all parts of the House, and I am not satisfied with it.
I have gone back to the BBC leadership to ask for further information, in particular—as the right hon.
Gentleman mentioned—about the failure to pull the live feed, the due diligence that was done prior to deciding to screen that act and the level of senior oversight that took place in the BBC during the Glastonbury weekend.
I think that the BBC leadership has heard and will hear the strength of feeling in this House on this issue, and I expect further answers to be forthcoming imminently.
