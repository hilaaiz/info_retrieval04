I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question, because I know this has caused considerable concern to many people in this House and the other place.
We are absolutely committed to bringing forward legislative change that provides certainty and clarity both for AI and tech companies and for the creative industries, and to ensuring that transparency and remuneration are at the heart of that legislation.

The Government recognise that as well.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Business and Trade and I will bring forward the roundtables and working groups before the summer recess.
