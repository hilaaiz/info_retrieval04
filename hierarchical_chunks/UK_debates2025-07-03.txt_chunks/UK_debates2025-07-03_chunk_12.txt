The Secretary of State will know that Royal Ascot last week attracted a viewing population of tens of millions, and “Glorious Goodwood” is about to do the same.
Horseracing supports about 85,000 jobs across the UK and generates about £4 billion a year for the UK economy, but the Secretary of State will know that it faces a looming and imminent crisis.
When will the Government really start to back British horseracing?
Let me reassure the hon.
Member on this point: we understand not just the joy that horseracing brings to millions of people in the UK and across the world but the huge economic benefits that it produces.
We are absolutely determined to back British horseracing to the hilt.
The Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Barnsley South (Stephanie Peacock) , has had several meetings and discussions with industry, and we will continue to ensure we are present, walking alongside them in order to support them.
