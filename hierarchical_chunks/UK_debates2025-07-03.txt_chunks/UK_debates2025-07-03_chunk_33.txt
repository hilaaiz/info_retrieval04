I thank my hon.
Friend for his important question.
There is no safe space for children in Gaza, where we know that over 56,000 people have lost their lives, including more than 17,000 children.
The Church has rightly condemned the attacks on hospitals and civilians, but we can certainly do more and the Church must do more.
The Church must continue to be a voice for the voiceless, and Gazan children are  the voiceless.
I encourage the Government to enable medical evacuations, heed calls for the creation of a Gaza family visa scheme and take concrete steps to ensure Israel allows vital medical aid into Gaza.
