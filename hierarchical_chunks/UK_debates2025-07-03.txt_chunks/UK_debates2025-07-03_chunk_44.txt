I thank the hon.
Member for raising that important matter.
I am sure that as constituency MPs we all know how important it is for people to have access to NHS dental care and dental appointments.
She is right to highlight how many dental deserts there still are; that is the legacy that we have inherited.
We are committed to providing more NHS dentist appointments.
That is a key part of our NHS 10-year plan, which the Secretary of State will soon be setting out.
That does mean looking at issues relating to the contract and how that care is provided.
I will ensure that in addition to the statement being given today, the House is kept fully updated on these matters.
