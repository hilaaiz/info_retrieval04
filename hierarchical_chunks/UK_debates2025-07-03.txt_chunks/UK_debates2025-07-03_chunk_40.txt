I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important matter.
I am really sorry to hear that banners relating to the Congleton Pride have been vandalised in such a way; that is completely unacceptable.
I am sure that on  19 July  the whole community will want to come out and support the LGBT community in Congleton, because that is exactly what they should be doing.
As she knows, the Government are committed to supporting the community and to taking steps to tackle homophobic hate crime.
