I thank the right hon.
Member for raising this important issue.
As he says, the situation in Gaza—the suffering, the killing, the lack of aid and support—is totally intolerable and unacceptable, and needs to be brought to an end.
That is what this Government have focused on doing in all their efforts in the middle east.
We once again hold some hope of that ceasefire happening.
He raises an important point about children who need hospital care and treatment.
I will gladly arrange for a Minister to meet him and a delegation of others to talk about how the UK Government can play our part.
