I welcome anything the Government bring forward to support our new bands and musicians across the country, but the big thing that so many musicians are asking for is that we get touring rights sorted out with our European counterparts.
Could the Minister update the House on what progress there has been, if any, and how we can go further to get our bands out there and their bands over here?
