The Secretary of State is getting a liking for visiting Northern Ireland.

Friend the Minister for Creative Industries, Arts and Tourism has had discussions directly with our counterparts.
It is a devolved matter, but it is the clear view of this Government that arts and culture belong to everybody.
We are working closely with all nations and regions across the UK to make sure that wherever people grow up and whatever their background, there is no barrier to them being able to access the arts, which are an essential part of a richer, larger life.
