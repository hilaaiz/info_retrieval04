I thank my hon.
Friend for her work championing such an amazing local club, and we are pleased to support her in that endeavour.
I encourage her to explore the support available via the premier league stadium fund delivered by the Football Foundation.
The Government are pleased to be supporting grassroots clubs with £98 million of funding for the multi-sport grassroots facilities programme through the next financial year, which will build new facilities and upgrade facilities.
If she wants to get in touch with me directly, we will work together to ensure that that benefits Scarborough, like every other part of the country.
