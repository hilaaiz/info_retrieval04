Last week at a council meeting, when medical dispensation was being sought for Labour councillor Carol Hyatt in the Merry Hill ward of my constituency so that she could undergo cancer treatment, a Reform UK councillor said that was not fair on taxpayers.
Will the Leader of the House first please join me in wishing Councillor Hyatt, who is an excellent councillor for her ward, a speedy recovery?
Secondly, considering that one in two of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in our lives, will she please reassure the House that the Government will always support cancer sufferers at work?
I am really sorry to hear of that; that is totally unacceptable.
I join my hon.
Friend completely in wishing Carol Hyatt a speedy recovery.
I hope that she gets all the support she needs.
It is vital that we support people who have got cancer with all their work and care needs, and that is what the Government are all about.
