I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue, which many of my constituents raise with me as well.
I recently did an unannounced visit to one of my sorting offices to meet staff there, and I saw at first hand that staff morale is low, and people feel unable to provide the service that they are there to deliver.
I encourage him to continue to raise that issue directly with Royal Mail.
He has other opportunities to raise it in the House, perhaps with the Select Committee and its Chair, and I am sure it would make a very popular topic for debate.
