I thank the Father of the House for his question.
He is absolutely right: the attacks that took place in Taybeh last week were outrageous and should not have been allowed to happen.
If we are all going to be the hands and feet of Jesus, we have to speak out when we see such atrocities happen.
We must be a voice for the voiceless.
I hear him when he says that the Church must speak out every day against what is happening in Gaza, and indeed across the whole occupied territories.
