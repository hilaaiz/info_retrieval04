the city of Hayward by reducing graffiti vandalism.
When graffiti taggers were caught, Chuck offered to mentor and help them change course to prevent property vandalism.
Chuck also founded HayWallKru in 2010, empowering graffiti taggers to become artists through abatement, education, and additional development opportunities.
Chuck served in the community through his various roles in other community service organizations, such as director of the Hayward Coalition for Healthy Youth, the Ashland Cherryland Health Community Coalition, the Hayward Rotary Club, the Salvation Army Meal Project Coordinator, Vice President of the Hayward Education Foundation, and an Ambassador for the Hayward Chamber.
Chuck has been a beloved member of the Hayward community for over 30 years, and known as the big guy with a booming voice, and a personality to match.
Chuck has battled prostate cancer for ten years while remaining involved in various outreach roles and has recently started hospice care.
I join the Hayward community in recognizing the contributions of Pastor Chuck and send my sincerest well wishes to Linda, his wife of over 50 years, and their two children, Christal and Aaron.
