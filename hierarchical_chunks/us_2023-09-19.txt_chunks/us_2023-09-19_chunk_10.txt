Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival in Leominster, Massachusetts on Saturday, September 23, 2023.
While many have heard the tales of Johnny Appleseed--the American folk hero who wandered our early Nation planting apple seeds--not many know the man behind the story.
John Chapman was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1774.
From a young age, his father taught him to cultivate trees.
That's where his story starts.
Back then, frontier law allowed anyone to earn a claim to the land by developing a permanent homestead on it.
Chapman established his homesteads by planting apple orchards, just like his father.
He ventured more than 100,000 square miles from Massachusetts to Illinois, all the while planting apple seeds in his wake.
At the time of his death in 1845, John Chapman owned over 1,200 acres of land, leaving behind hundreds of apple trees.
Every year since 1993, thousands of people have gathered in Leominster to celebrate the life and work.
Through live music and apple crisp, the festival aims to honor Chapman's legacy of abundance, bravery, and cultivation.
