Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Electrician's Mate 3rd Class Richard Alan Danculovich of Jefferson City for his valiant military service during the Vietnam War.
Following in his WWII veteran father's footsteps, EM3 Danculovich's dedicated service in the United States Navy began on November 29, 1965, at the RTC Great Lakes for Bootcamp and later EM-A School for electrician training.
Upon completion of his naval training, EM3 Danculovich served aboard the U.S.S. Piedmont (AD-17), ported out of San Diego, where he was assigned to the Electrical Repair Division.
The U.S.S. Piedmont (AD-17) was a Dixie-class destroyer tender that served and maintained all ships engaged in combat operations during naval battles.
While aboard the U.S.S. Piedmont, EM3 Danculovich conducted electrical repairs on ships in the Western Pacific region, including Pearl Harbor, the Subic Bay in the Philippines and Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and many of these ships previously spent months in service off the coast.
After 3 years of distinguished military service, he was discharged from Active Duty in November of 1968.
He is proud to share that his grandson continues the family tradition of military service in support Please join me in celebrating Electrician's Mate 3rd Class Alan Danculovich for his distinguished military service to the United States
