Mr. Speaker, this year is special.
Under the dedication and expertise of Festival Coordinator Rick Marchand, the event has blossomed year after year.
This year, the festival will provide 1,000 complimentary meals to children and their families, accommodate 230 local vendors, and welcome several dozens of organizations and artists to interface with their community.
The Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival is a chance to celebrate our rich land across generations.
