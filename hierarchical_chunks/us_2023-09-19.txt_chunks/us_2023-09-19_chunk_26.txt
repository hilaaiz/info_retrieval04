Mr. GALLEGO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and mourn the loss of Frank Barrios, a third generation Arizonan and proud Mexican American who dedicated over 50 years of service to the people service to the 3rd Congressional District, to our community, and to all Frank spent his career in hydrology, utilizing his engineering degree to ensure the sustainability of Arizona's water supply.
Without these efforts, Arizona's growth and success over the past decades would not have been possible.
He began his career with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
From there, he transitioned to the Arizona Water Commission, later called the Arizona Department of Water Resources, serving as a director for both the Pinal and Phoenix Active Management Areas.
After retiring from Colorado River Planning in 1998, Frank was appointed to the Central Arizona Water Conservation District Board of Directors, where he served for 3 years.
But Frank's impact and his legacy go far beyond his career.
Frank served as President of 7 boards, won numerous awards and accolades, and published several books.
He was passionate about preserving the history of Mexican Americans in the Valley, fighting to restore a historically Latino burial ground in downtown Phoenix and archiving photographs and stories.
Thanks to his work, the contributions of Latinos to Arizona history will not be erased.
My thoughts are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Although he will be greatly missed, his legacy will be carried on through the countless lives he touched in his decades of service to the people.
