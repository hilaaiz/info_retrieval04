Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor and congratulate Gary Kroeschen on his retirement as Marshall County Board Chairman.
Gary has dedicated much of his career to serving the people of Marshall County.
Throughout his incredible career.
Gary served on the Marshall County Board, Bennington Township Board, and Toluca Park District Board.
Serving on the Bennington Township Board and the Toluca Park District Board for nearly 20 years, Gary also served on the Marshall County Board for 16 years and 11 of those as Chairman.
He retired from this role on September 14, 2023, marking the end of his exceptional tenure serving the Marshall County area.
Like his work serving the people.
Gary was a small business owner of Kroeschen Plumbing and Heating Inc in Toluca, Illinois.
Gary exemplifies the values of public service and hard work.
I want to express the utmost gratitude to Gary.
I am certain that my fellow Illinoisans feel the same pride and respect towards him that I do.
He has undoubtedly improved the lives of Marshall County residents and Central Illinoisans more broadly.
Most importantly, Gary accomplished all this while being a loving husband, father, and family man.
I congratulate Gary, and wish him happiness and relaxation in retirement.
