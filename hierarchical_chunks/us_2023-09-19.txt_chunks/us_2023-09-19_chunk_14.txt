Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Operations Specialist 5th Class Donald Wolf of Morristown for his courageous military service in the United States Army.
Specialist Wolf joined the Army in 1968, and trained for the Quartermaster Corps after attending basic training at Ft. Campbell in Kentucky.
In 1969, SPC Wolf deployed to Vietnam, where he served as a clerk in Headquarters Company 266 Supply and Service Battalion.
During his tour of duty, he earned the Bronze Star for Meritorious Service in a Combat Zone.
Ultimately, he was honorably discharged from the Army following 2 valiant years of service.
Please join me in thanking Operations Specialist 5th Class Donald Wolf for his bravery and heroic military service to our great Nation.
