Mr. Speaker, Johnny Appleseed is a treasured National figure that we in Central Massachusetts are proud to share.
I commend the Johnny Appleseed Festival on its 30th anniversary and am proud of the staff, volunteers, and community members that work to make this such a beloved annual event.
We look forward to welcoming tens of thousands of neighbors to this beloved festival.
