Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize a stalwart figure in the Buffalo community, Carl Thomas.
After roughly 4 decades of leading by example at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Kevin's Guest House, it is only proper to acknowledge and give gratitude for a lifelong dedication to those in need of help.
A graduate of Lafayette High School, he has always put the needs of his hometown neighbors ahead of his own.
At the very beginning of his professional career, Carl recognized an unfortunate and common challenge for so many cancer patients--having a stable place to stay during treatment.
As a volunteer at Kevin's Guest House, a local hospitality guest house, he undoubtedly recognized that a community effort can make the bleak reality of cancer a little easier on a patient and their loved ones.
Of course, Carl was familiar with cancer treatment and hospital care due to his father's employment at Roswell.

Carl devoted his time and energy toward the needs and safety of the entire Roswell campus.
