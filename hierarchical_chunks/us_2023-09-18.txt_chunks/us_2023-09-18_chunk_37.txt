Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the memory of my good friend, former Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist, who also served alongside us, in this House chamber for 12 years, as the U.S. 
Representative for the 7th District.
He was a trusted leader and treasured friend who will be deeply missed.
He accomplished a rare feat that every elected leader aspires to, winning every election in his path of public service, including 6 terms in Congress and 2 terms as the 47th Governor.
Don was an original ``Reaganaut,'' first elected to Congress in 1982 during President Ronald Reagan's Administration.
As a successful business owner and entrepreneur, his expertise and personal insight were invaluable in his leadership on the Ways and Means Committee, where he stood firm on conservative American values.
His love and compassion for the people of Tennessee led him from Capitol Hill to the Governor's Mansion in 1994.
Unwavering in his convictions, Gov. Sundquist took on monumental issues, including welfare reform that lifted 40,000 families out of poverty, a comprehensive crime bill focused on victim's rights, expanding broadband to every public school and library in Tennessee, and earning National accolades for the state's economic success on his watch.
