Mr. Zelenko is a beloved husband, father and grandfather.
He married Barbara (Saltz) Zelenko in 1961.
In 1964, the Zelenkos moved to Maryland's beautiful Eighth District where they raised their 3 children, Brian, Laura and Carin.
Ben and Barbara Zelenko still live in the same house they first occupied.
This year, 
Mr. Zelenko celebrated his 90th birthday surrounded by his loving children and 6 grandchildren, Leslie, Jennifer, Sasha, Katya, Lia and Kayla.
Mr. Zelenko is known by his family for being a gracious and captivating host, performing magic shows at all 6 of his grandchildren's birthday parties and seizing any opportunity to tell a great story.
I am proud to salute 
Mr. Zelenko for his lifetime of service and extraordinary character.
