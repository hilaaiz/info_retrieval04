saw these 2 institutions, Kevin's Guest House and Roswell Park, as inherently intertwined and was one of the earliest to recognize Roswell Park's leading role in the fight against cancer.
Carl's passion for Roswell's success earned him the position as Chief Organizational and Community Liaison.
In essence, he has worked as an ambassador for Roswell with community organizations, government officials, churches, and block clubs in Western New York.
As an African American executive, Carl Thomas has often cited his responsibility to lead a new generation of achievers.
Those who know Carl understand retirement will not result in the end of his mentorship; as a resident of the University District, he has already expressed an interest in maintaining his position as a role model within the community.
Nonetheless, retirement will allow Carl some much-deserved time with his wife of over 4 decades.
Betty, along with their children, Mario, Samantha, and Phylicia.
Buffalonians and Roswell Park patients, alike, owe Carl an incredible debt of gratitude, and it is my pleasure to recognize his career as a capable worker and generous man.
