Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Little Union Baptist Church in Dumfries, Virginia on their 120th anniversary.
For 120 years, Little Union Baptist Church has served as a space for the community to gather, connect, and worship.
Little Union Baptist Church has deep roots in Dumfries, Virginia that can be traced back to Mary Bates--fondly referred to by many as ``Granny Mary.''
Mary was born into slavery, but she had the determination to learn to read and write.
After the Emancipation Proclamation, Mary settled in the area with her husband where she proved to be a pillar in the community.
She served as a midwife, wrote letters on behalf of those who could not, and helped administer medications.
In 1901, Mary convinced her husband John to donate land to build a local church, so people would not have to travel to neighboring communities to attend services.
The church built on that land flourished and eventually came to be known to the community as Little Union Baptist Church.
Today, Pastor Michael L. Sessoms continues Little Union Baptist Church's longstanding tradition of building community.
Under his guidance, the church continues to grow and provides families in the Dumfries area with a space to gather and celebrate.
