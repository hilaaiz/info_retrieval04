In addition to his courageous public service, he was also a proud veteran of the United States Navy.
Of all the honorable titles that have been etched into history beside his name, Don's most cherished were husband, father, grandfather and friend.
Thanks to our longtime friendship in the U.S. House, Don later introduced me to my beautiful Tennessee bride, Cynthia.
He and his First Lady Martha graciously hosted our wedding at the Governor's mansion in 1999, remaining constant friends all the while.
It is for his dedicated friendship and partnership in public service that I shall be eternally grateful.
My wife Cynthia and I offer our heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the entire Sundquist family and the people.
