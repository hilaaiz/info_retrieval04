Will the Minister give an assurance that the proposed changes to the application of inheritance tax to certain armed forces death-in-service payments are compatible with the commitment in the armed forces covenant to ensuring that our brave and loyal armed forces personnel “face no disadvantage compared to other citizens in the provision of public and commercial services”— yes or no?
The covenant will come into law in the next two years or so, on the back of the armed forces Bill.
That will result in a great expansion, with all Government Departments falling in line with the covenant, so that no individual who has served is disadvantaged because of that service.
