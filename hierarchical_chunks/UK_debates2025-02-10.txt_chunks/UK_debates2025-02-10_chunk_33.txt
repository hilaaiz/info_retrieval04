We just talked about resilience and defence in depth.
The cadets provide an example of where we can bring society and defence together to help people understand the benefits of defence.
It gives them some great examples, from courage to commitment, dedication, drive and, indeed, becoming a net contributor to society.
I fully support it.
Are the Government doing any forward thinking—[Laughter.]
No, I am being serious—about what will happen when the shooting stops with a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine?
Wherever the border between free and occupied Ukraine finally forms will become the new frontline for Europe, so what provision are we making, even now, to be able to secure the future shape and safety of Europe?
Despite the titters on his own side, the right hon.
Gentleman makes a really important point.
At the point at which Ukraine decides to talk instead of, or as well as, fight, security guarantees will need to be in place to ensure that Russia does not resume its aggression.
In Washington last year, the NATO allies made a commitment that Ukraine is on an irreversible path to NATO membership, but there will be a period when during the talks, just as in the fight, they will require our support.
We are giving that detailed discussion now.
On Thursday, my hon.
and gallant Friend the Minister for Veterans and People came to my constituency  for an important discussion on veterans’ mental health.
May I ask him for his reflections on that discussion and on what actions he will be taking moving forward?
First of all, I thank my hon.
Friend for hosting a fantastic get-together with veterans, bereaved families and the charitable sector.
I learned a huge amount from the visit.
I looked again at how councils are delivering support to veterans, which I can contrast and compare with other visits, and will come out with a plan in due course.
