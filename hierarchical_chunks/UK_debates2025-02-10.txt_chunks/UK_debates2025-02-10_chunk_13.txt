I thank the right hon.
and gallant Member for his response.
We need to take a holistic view of this.
I remind him that we have missed every recruitment and retention target for the past 14 years.
We are working really hard to get after that now: we have just put in place wraparound welfare, we have done the Annington Homes deal, we have put additional resources into veterans’ homes for after service, and we have given the biggest pay rise in 20 years.
We are working really hard on that, in discussions with our Treasury counterparts, and we will move it forward.
