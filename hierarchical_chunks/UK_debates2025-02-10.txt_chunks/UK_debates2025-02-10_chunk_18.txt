I welcome the fact that the right hon.
Gentleman went to Ukraine.
He was there with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Macclesfield (Tim Roca) , and I look forward to meeting them both later this month to discuss the detail of what they saw.
From my second day in this job, when I was in Odessa with President Zelensky, I made the commitment that the UK would step up and speed up support for Ukraine, which is exactly what we have done.
That will be part of the discussions we will have with other nations at the meeting I will chair on Wednesday, and I am sure it will also be part of our discussions at NATO on Thursday.
