I thank  the right hon.
Member for Tonbridge (Tom Tugendhat)  for his important question.
He has my absolute assurance that if anyone dies in service, from training all the way through to combat and operations, they will absolutely be exempt from inheritance tax provisions.
I will continue to discuss that issue, as well as many others to do with armed forces pay, with my opposite number in the Treasury.
This Government are deeply proud of the armed forces, and I am deeply proud of them.
They will have my full backing as we move forward.
