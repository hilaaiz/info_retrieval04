I can indeed.
Everyone in NATO, including every one of the European allies within NATO, is ready and is stepping up on Euro-Atlantic security.
This Wednesday I will have the privilege of chairing the Ukraine defence contact group, a 50 nation-strong group in which we co-ordinate the support that Ukraine needs, because we must stay with Ukraine for as long as it takes.
What his planned timetable is for the annual provision of £3 billion of military support to Ukraine.
The Government have committed to maintain £3 billion in military aid to Ukraine this year, next year, and each year for as long as it takes.
I came back from Ukraine a week and a half ago.
I was very close to the front and talked to many of the military commanders there, and they made it very clear to me that they were desperately short of artillery pieces, 155 mm, and, most importantly, munitions—they could hardly respond to the Russians.
As I understand it, they are also short of C-RAM—counter-rocket, artillery and mortar—defence missiles, which are desperately needed to protect Ukraine’s energy sites and its civilians’ flats and houses.
That hardware has been promised by many European nations, and of course by the USA—and I must say that when you are that close to the front, Mr Speaker, you realise how desperate it is there.
In the light of this delay, will the Government commit the UK to at least provide the sort of weaponry that it can provide to alleviate that problem as far as humanly possible, but mostly to push our allies to do what they promised to do?
From what I heard, without that hardware, Ukraine runs the risk of losing this war.
