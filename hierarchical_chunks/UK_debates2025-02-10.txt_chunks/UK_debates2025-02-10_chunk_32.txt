I thank the Government for improving the pay and housing conditions of our armed forces.
Bishop Auckland has turned out some excellent young men and women into the armed forces, many of whom first went through our brilliant volunteer-led cadet forces.
Without wishing to pre-empt the strategic defence review, will the Government commit to ensuring strong funding for our local cadets?
