I thank the hon.
Member for his useful comments.
We have launched our Raising our Standards programme, which will take standards from where they were and raise them.
We will make Defence the most inclusive career and, indeed, the most rewarding for any part of society to join.
The Defence Committee will hold us to account on some of that.
When the covenant comes into place, that will also cover certain elements of standards, too.
