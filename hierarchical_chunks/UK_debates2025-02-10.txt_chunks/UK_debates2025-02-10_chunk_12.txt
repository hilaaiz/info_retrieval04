First of all, I place on record my full congratulations to the hon.
and gallant Member for his recent award in the new year’s honours.
That is a fantastic achievement for somebody for whom I have the greatest admiration, and with whom I have served in numerous fields.
May I raise the problem with his answer, however?
Retention in the armed forces is already suffering; numbers are already coming down and people are struggling to make the maths add up between serving today and having a future tomorrow.
The problem with  these arguments and the lack of clarity from the Government is that too many people are making decisions on which we all need them to think again.
We need people to serve and stay, and it is his responsibility to keep them there.
