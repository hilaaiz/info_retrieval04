I thank and pay tribute to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham Erdington (Paulette Hamilton) , who brought the debate to the House this evening.
All hon.
Members will agree that her passion and commitment to her constituency and this subject shine through.
I can only say what an absolute honour it was to visit her constituency to discuss the work of the north Birmingham economic recovery board.
I will come shortly to the situation in Birmingham and the approach that my hon.
Friend recommends that the Government take.
I hope that her remarks at the end of her speech on the purpose of politics and the role we all must play in giving everybody a chance and an opportunity in our society would be supported across the House, but she makes the case well for that approach.
