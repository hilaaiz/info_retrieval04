I thank the Veterans Minister for recently visiting Redditch for a roundtable, where he heard from veterans about the excellent work by the Redditch armed forces and veterans breakfast club in bringing together the community and signposting critical support.
Does he agree it is vital that the Government continue to work with such organisations to ensure that no veteran misses out on the support they deserve?
