The Secretary of State agrees that the threat to critical undersea infrastructure is serious, so will he prioritise development of underwater capabilities, such as uncrewed systems, including under pillar 2 of AUKUS, and will he increase research and development investment into systems that could protect that critical undersea infrastructure?
I am grateful for the hon.
Member’s question—it is a good one.
We are seeing more risks posed to our critical underwater infrastructure by players who wish harm to our national security.
We already have brilliant capability in RFA Proteus, which is able to support our infrastructure and that of our allies.
When the strategic defence review is published in the spring, I am sure that there will be more developments in that direction.
