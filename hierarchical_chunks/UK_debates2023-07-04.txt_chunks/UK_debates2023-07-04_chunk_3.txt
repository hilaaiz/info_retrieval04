I thank the Secretary of State for that response, particularly in relation to CfDs.
Will he commit today to a clear pathway for the true commercial-scale development of tidal stream energy?
A ringfence in the CfD auction is welcome, but it is only scratching the surface of what the industry can deliver.

Let us unlock this predictable, renewable power and create an industry and sector that we can be proud of and that can be made on these islands.
We need a commitment today that the ringfenced budget will increase, to allow costs to fall and true-scale projects to be delivered.
If we want energy security, here is the pathway.
