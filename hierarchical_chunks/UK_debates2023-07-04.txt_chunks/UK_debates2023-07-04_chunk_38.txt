I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her salient and wise comments, as always.
May I reiterate that on Friday the Foreign Secretary made a joint statement with the Canadians and Australians to set out very clearly our opposition to Israel’s announcement of the expansion of settlements across the west bank?
We are asking Israel to halt and reverse that policy of settlement expansion with immediate effect.
