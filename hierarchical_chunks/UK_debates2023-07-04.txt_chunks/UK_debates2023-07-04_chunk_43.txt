I thank the Minister of State for her measured and careful answers to the urgent question.
It is important that her interest in this matter is put on the record.
Will she outline what discussions have taken place with our Israeli allies to renew peace talks, to allow both states to co-exist beside each other without the tit-for-tat action that has become normalised and yet is truly horrific and heartbreaking for all those who are losing loved ones in this conflict?
