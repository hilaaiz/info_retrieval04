Will this Government stop chuntering on about batteries and battery storage all the time?
Will they get down to JCB and see its innovative new hydrogen fuel car and  heavy goods vehicle?
Is it not about time that we realised that hydrogen is the future and that this Government should be building a pipeline of hydrogen throughout the country?
I will not be drawn on chuntering on by the hon.
Gentleman, but let me just say that it was this Government who allowed JCB to proceed with that technology and to develop it at commercial scale.
I am pleased to tell him that the Secretary of State will be visiting imminently.
What steps he is taking to help increase the potential benefits of floating offshore wind for the supply chain.
The Government are committed to placing the UK at the forefront of the floating wind sector.
I am delighted to announce that the Crown estate will be providing an update to industry this morning on a 4 GW leasing round in the Celtic sea and has already commissioned the survey work required to support it.
The development of floating offshore wind in the Celtic sea is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for my Aberavon constituency, for Wales and for the entire United Kingdom.
Last week, the Climate Change Committee rightly blasted the Government for failing to deliver on their net zero commitment.
I am profoundly concerned that floating offshore wind will be squandered due to the lack of grip and direction that the committee described.
When will the Minister be bringing forward an industrial strategy for floating offshore wind, which will ensure that Welsh manufacturing and Welsh jobs are placed at the heart of turbine and substructure fabrication, starting with the vital seabed licensing process.
