He is right that, when this violence occurs, the great tragedy is that civilians are caught up in it, especially where the Israeli Defence Forces are legitimately trying to defend themselves and, indeed, Palestinians from the terrorist threat.
The Foreign Secretary continues to have a strong focus on this and we are working with leaders and our allies around the world to try to find a solution.
