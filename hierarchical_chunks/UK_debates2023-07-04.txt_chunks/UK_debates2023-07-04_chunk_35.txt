I thank the hon.
Lady for bringing the urgent question to the House.
This is a matter of deep concern to us all.
We will continue to urge the Israel Defence Forces to demonstrate restraint in this operation so that all parties can try to avoid further escalation in the west bank and Gaza.
As I have said, while the UK will always support Israel’s right to self-defence, the protection of civilians, particularly children, must always be prioritised, and we expect the armed forces’ conduct always to be in line with international humanitarian law.
We therefore call on Israel to adhere to those principles of necessity and proportionality while defending its legitimate security interest.
