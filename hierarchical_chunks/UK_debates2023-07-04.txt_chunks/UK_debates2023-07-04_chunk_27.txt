What assessment has the Minister made of the role of a tariff support mechanism to encourage short-term private sector investment in deep geothermal to support levelling up?
There is no greater champion than—or anyone in this House with half the knowledge of this, as far as I can tell—my hon.
Friend in supporting the potential of deep geothermal.
When the Prime Minister responded to his report, I know he thanked my hon.
Friend for all the work that went into it.
I can confirm that geothermal technologies that generate electricity are eligible for the contracts for difference scheme.
We are also supporting and encouraging the development of geothermal heating projects through the green heat network fund, which supports the development of low-carbon heat networks.
Under the leadership of my hon.
Friend, I am confident that geothermal has a positive future.
Private sector businesses in the Humber are ready and willing to invest £15 billion in carbon capture, storage and decarbonisation projects.
However, this is being put at risk because, of the eight track 1 carbon capture and storage projects selected, not a single project was approved for the Humber, despite the Humber being the largest carbon emitter in the country and the fact that 80% of the UK’s licensed CO2 storage capacity is accessible from the Humber.
When will these businesses get the clarity they need?
When the track 1 expansion process is launched, will both Humber pipelines be approved?
