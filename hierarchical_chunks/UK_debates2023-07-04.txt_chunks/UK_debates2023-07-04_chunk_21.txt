Last week I attended the opening of the first phase of a new solar farm at Newcastle airport.
It was 50% funded by the regional development fund, which post Brexit we no longer have access to.
The further three phases are vital to ensure that the airport meets its net zero target and the Government meet their solar target, so what are the Government doing to ensure that those further three phases will be supported in some way by the Government?
