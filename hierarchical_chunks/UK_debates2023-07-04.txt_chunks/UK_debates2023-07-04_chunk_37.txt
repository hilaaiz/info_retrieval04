We need a return to the diplomatic table.
Jordan and Egypt  have been trying to facilitate that and stand ready to continue to do so, but they must see meaningful efforts to stand up for the agreements reached at previous meetings, such as the one in Aqaba.

We must see Hamas end its terror attacks on Israel.
They are wrong—they are terror attacks—and although we have no influence over Hamas, we must use our voice to make it clear that it must immediately stop.
As the UK, can we urge our Israeli friends to show restraint?
Can we appoint a middle east peace process envoy who can be tasked with spending their entire time working with our allies around the region to de-escalate the situation?
Our voice is unique and will be heard, and we have a role to play in the peace process.
Finally, will we use our UN Security Council presidency?
Through that role, we can shed light on what is taking place.
