The Minister is sort of right that there have been some onshore wind turbines built just recently—two since February 2022, so there is not much chance of community engagement there, to be honest.
In December, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities promised that the onshore wind ban would be completely lifted by the end of April this year.
Why have the Government broken that promise?
I will take no lectures from the Labour party on developing renewable electricity.
When Labour left office in 2010—[Interruption.]
They do not like to hear this, but when Labour left office in 2010, less than 7% of the grid was accounted for by renewables.

It is now generally understood that the Government consultation is likely to lead to only minimal relaxation of planning rules and that onshore wind will effectively remain banned.
Tory peer Lord Deben, chairman of the Climate Change Committee, said of the consultation on Saturday that it is simply unacceptable that the Government are still discussing whether they are in favour of onshore wind or not when it is widely recognised as one of the cheapest forms of energy generation.
He is right, is he not?
I really wish the Labour party would stop talking down what we are doing on renewable electricity.
I remind the House that the consultation on onshore wind finishes on  7 July .
