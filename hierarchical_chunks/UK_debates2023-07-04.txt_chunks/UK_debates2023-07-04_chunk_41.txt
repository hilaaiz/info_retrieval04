I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cynon Valley (Beth Winter)  for securing this urgent question.
It has been reported that medical teams have been prevented from entering Jenin.
Will the Minister condemn that now from the Dispatch Box?
Will she express to her counterpart that Palestinians must have medical aid, and can she then return to the House to update MPs on the medical situation?
