Mr. Lancaster has also been requested to announce at other big events at Springstead, such as senior nights, their annual cheer competition and during the final matches of the historic Corey Hill Memorial Wrestling Tournament.
As an Athletic Director, Coach Kupcik shares that having a consistent announcer locked in is always a plus.
It's one less thing to worry about.
But having a consistent, amazing, professionallevel announcer that transforms a relatively meaningless Tuesday night baseball or basketball game into a must-go-to, college like event for fans and players alike is truly a blessing.
Mr. Lancaster is one of a kind, and is now a true part of what Springstead Athletics is, and forever an Eagle.
It is clear Dean Lancaster has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
