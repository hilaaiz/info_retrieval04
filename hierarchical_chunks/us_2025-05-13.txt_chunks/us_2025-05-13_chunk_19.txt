Volunteering has become a Godding/Brooks ``family affair''!
Kimberly is truly an example of an outstanding volunteer and a Hero in our Community.
It is clear that Kimberly Godding Brooks has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
