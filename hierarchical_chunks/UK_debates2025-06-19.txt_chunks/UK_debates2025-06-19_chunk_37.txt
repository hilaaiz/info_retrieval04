I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that with me.
He will know that GCSE subject decisions are taken by the independent exam boards, but he may be interested to know that the Education Secretary has recently written to the exam boards asking them to consider introducing a GCSE in Ukrainian.
I hope my hon.
Friend will continue that campaign, and I am sure that it will get wide support from across the House.
