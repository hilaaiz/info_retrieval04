Many Welsh farmers in mid-Wales depend on being able to move their livestock back and forth over the border with England.
Indeed, 550 farms straddle the border.
The imposition of a veterinary hard border between England and Wales will be damaging for the farming community in my constituency and the local economy that they support.
Farmers simply cannot afford to pay £70 a beast for testing, and apparently there is not even enough testing capacity for all the livestock that cross the border anyway.
What steps is the Minister taking to address the situation, and to prevent Welsh farmers from losing out?
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to ask that question.
As I just referenced, the bluetongue issue has been serious and difficult.
We have made a sensible decision for England, and the approach we have taken has managed to control the spread.
The decision in Wales is obviously a matter for the Welsh Government, and I am sure that he would understand that I respect that decision.
We are talking about how we can resolve the difficult issues that he has raised.
I am deeply distressed that the Government are planning to extend the badger cull, because the evidence shows that with good testing and biosecurity, we can bring down rates of tuberculosis.
I heard what the representative from Gatcombe farm said when they visited Parliament just a couple of weeks ago.
Will the Minister look at the evidence?
Before moving forward with a badger cull, will he look at biosecurity measures that could ensure that we really get on top of bovine TB?
I can assure my hon.
Friend that we are not extending the badger cull.
We have a clear commitment to ending the badger cull in this Parliament, and I will visit Gatcombe with others in the weeks ahead.
We are taking an evidence-based approach.
We also have to make sure that we help farmers tackle a distressing and difficult disease.
