I thank the Minister for her very strong answer.
Recently, I have been made aware of a recurring incident of fly-tipping in Bedwell, in the heart of my constituency.
The council is working very hard to clear up the mess and find those responsible, but the situation is being made worse by people picking up that rubbish and taking it to the nearby woods.
Will the Minister offer extra support to councils like mine, so that together we can clean up our communities and crack down on criminals who think that they can dump their waste with impunity, wrecking the lives of constituent like mine, and making their lives a living hell?
