The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to help prevent animal disease outbreaks.
Good morning.
Can I start by acknowledging the expertise that the hon.
Gentleman brings to the House?
We are investing in the Animal and Plant Health Agency, and have committed more than £200 million to the next stage of rebuilding our biosecurity facilities at Weybridge to enhance our ability to understand, detect, prevent, respond to and recover from outbreaks.
That is in addition to supporting farmers through the animal health and welfare pathway, which includes veterinary visits to improve livestock health, welfare, biosecurity and productivity.
