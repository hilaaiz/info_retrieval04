I thank the Minister for acknowledging the power of the outdoors.
I should say that I have failed to climb many more mountains than I ever actually got up.
Many of the lessons I learned in the mountains are the reason why I am here today.
The power of the outdoors in building confidence and resilience among young people is enormous.
I am so pleased that 244 young people in Rossendale and Darwen are, right now, taking part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s award scheme; that is fantastic.
For many, discovering the power of nature can be life-changing.
Nationally, the evidence of the benefits of outdoor recreation is extensive and unarguable, yet for too many, access to the outdoors remains limited, and 20 million people do not live within 15 minutes of green and blue space.
Do the Secretary of State and the Minister agree that a key ambition of access legislation must be access for all?
