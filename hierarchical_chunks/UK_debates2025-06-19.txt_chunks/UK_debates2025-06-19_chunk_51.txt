I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this issue.
I know that those who suffer with ME and their families feel incredibly strongly that not enough has been done over many years, and the Government will shortly be bringing forward our 10-year NHS plan.
I will ensure that she and others get an update on that, which will contain information about ME care.
