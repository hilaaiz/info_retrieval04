The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right.
We take this matter extremely seriously.
Sadly, it is not a new problem.
We have had similar reports in the past, and I can assure him that we are giving careful consideration to this report.
We will develop a plan to address it.
He will be aware that there are a range of threats, and it is important that we balance our work.
We have taken strong measures to restrict personal imports, given the threats on the continent.
As the House will know, sadly the epicentre of the UK bluetongue outbreak was in my South Norfolk constituency, so biosecurity is a huge issue for my farmers.
Will we look to lower our biosecurity risks by returning to checking products at the Bastion Point inland border security centre at the White Cliffs business park, which is closer to the border point, instead of products having to travel nearly 17 miles before they are checked?
