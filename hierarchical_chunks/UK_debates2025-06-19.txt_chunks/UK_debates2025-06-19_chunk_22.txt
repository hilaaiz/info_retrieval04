I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
The Government are, of course, strongly committed to ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment.
I am aware that the Environment Agency is investigating this matter, so I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss it in detail.
