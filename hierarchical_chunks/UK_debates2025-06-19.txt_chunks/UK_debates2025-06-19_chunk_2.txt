I thank the Minister for his comments.
The recent National Audit Office report was hugely concerning, and it was clear that the UK is at high risk of, and unprepared for, a major animal disease outbreak.
Post-Brexit checks mean that only 5% of animals are physically checked as they come into the UK.
We know that a lot of illegal meat is coming in through the ports, and our farm animal veterinary workforce is overstretched.
Also, climate change and antimicrobial resistance are putting us at a higher risk of disease outbreaks.
If a disease such as foot and mouth hits again, it will devastate British agriculture and rural communities, and have an impact on our food security.
Can the Minister assure us that the Government are treating the issues that the report raises as a strategic national threat, and that its warnings will not be ignored until it is too late?
