The outbreak of bluetongue and the subsequent announcement by the Welsh Government imposing a hard border for livestock between England and Wales leaves the livelihoods of many border farmers at risk.
Their land often straddles the border, and farmers rely on moving livestock daily between both countries.
According to the Farmers Union  of Wales, by introducing mandatory checks the Welsh Government are creating a “wholly impractical” policy.
I am reliably informed by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Brecon, Radnor and Cwm Tawe (David Chadwick)  that a large majority of ewes are on one side of the border, while the tups are on the other, which will make breeding rather tricky.
Will the Leader of the House ask Ministers to bring forward a statement about any work they are doing to create a more joined-up approach between England and Wales to protect farmers in these border counties?
While she is doing so, can we have a statement on whether the Government will create a funded vaccination programme to protect livestock and livelihoods in the whole of the UK?
