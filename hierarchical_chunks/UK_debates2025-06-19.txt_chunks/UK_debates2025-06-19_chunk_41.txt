The UN ocean conference in Leeds last week marked a turning point, with countries coming together to accelerate action to protect and restore our seas, including the UK’s welcome commitment to end destructive bottom trawling in some of our most biodiverse waters.
Will my right hon.
Friend join me in celebrating that progress and support those international efforts by providing parliamentary time to ratify the high seas treaty?
May I take this opportunity to thank my hon.
Friend for all her leadership on this issue, and for bringing representatives of both Houses together last week to watch the very moving documentary with David Attenborough?
That has had a profound impact on many Members across this House.
She is absolutely right that we have to take action to ratify the treaty, and we are committed to bringing forward legislation before the end of the year—I hope it will be sooner.
I am really pleased that the British Government have taken steps to ban bottom trawling in our protected marine waters.
