The National Audit Office report says that the Government really need to step up their border checks.
As the Government have admitted in answers to me, 72,872 kg of illegal  meat imports were seized between January and April this year, close to the 92,000 kg seized in the whole of 2024.
With foot and mouth disease and African swine fever on our doorstep in Europe, I shudder to think how much potentially infected meat is slipping in undetected.
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen.
Will the Government act urgently to strengthen our biosecurity and our border checks before it is too late?
The hon.
Gentleman will know that we have acted with speed and haste to make sure that we are protected.
We have banned personal imports, and we are absolutely committed to giving the Weybridge facility the support that it requires—we have given it what it asked for.
The question is why we were in that position in the first place when we came into Government.
What were his Government doing for all those years?
These are not new problems.
United Auctions in my constituency has recently become the UK’s first employee-owned livestock auctioneer.
Will the Secretary of State commit to doing more to encourage employee ownership models as a great option for rural businesses that want to thrive, attract new talent and remain rooted in the communities that they serve?
Will he also congratulate the new owners?
I am delighted to hear that news.
I assure my hon.
Friend that we are looking very closely at how we can use the co-operative model to boost the rural economy, particularly in respect of farming profitability, as we know that access to new private market opportunities is not always straightforward.
