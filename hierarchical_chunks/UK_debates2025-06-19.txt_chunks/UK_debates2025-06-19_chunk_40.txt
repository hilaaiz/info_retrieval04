I thank the hon.
Lady for raising the serious issue of cross-border breeding and the difficulties that she outlines.
I know this is a very worrying time for farmers.
I am sure she will be aware that disease control is a devolved matter, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is working very closely with the devolved Governments on this particular matter.
She is right to say that the restricted zone has been put in place, which is causing challenges for breeding, as she outlines.
I understand that Ministers are in constant contact with their counterparts on this issue, and it was raised yesterday in Prime Minister’s questions.
I know it is an issue of importance to the House, and I will ensure that the House is constantly updated.
