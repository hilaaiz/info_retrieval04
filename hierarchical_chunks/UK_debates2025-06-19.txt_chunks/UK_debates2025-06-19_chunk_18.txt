Many GB-based horticultural companies, as well as other companies, want to supply British produce into Northern Ireland, but have difficulty with the bureaucracy and paperwork required by the procedures implemented some years ago.
Will the Minister operate in concert with his colleagues in Cabinet and Government to eliminate the bureaucratic problems that are preventing those companies from supplying UK citizens in Northern Ireland?
The hon.
Gentleman makes an important point.
It is exactly why we wanted to improve our relationship with the European Union.
We have negotiated and are undertaking further negotiations to improve those systems to very much help people to achieve that.
We genuinely believe there are real opportunities here if we can eliminate some of the unnecessary bureaucracy.
What steps he is taking to tackle river pollution.
My hon.
Friend will be aware that we inherited record levels of sewage pollution in our waterways from the previous Government.
Since the election, we have launched the biggest crackdown on water pollution in history: unfair bonuses have been banned for water company executives, and water bosses who cover up pollution crimes now face up to two years in prison.
We will also invest a record £104 billion of private funding to upgrade crumbling sewage pipes and reduce discharges by nearly 50% within five years.
I remain extremely grateful for the £100 million of support the Government have given to the River Wye action plan—a pioneering joint effort between the UK and Welsh Governments—but we must do more, including using sustainable farming initiatives to support farmers to look at their stocking rates.
I am concerned by reports of Thames Water seeking regulatory easements.
Can the Secretary of State assure me that this Government will continue to crack down on water pollution from all sources, in the Wye, the Thames and all across the UK?
