I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue again.
He does it week in, week out, and it is obviously an important issue for his constituency.
The Government are looking at how we can strengthen community right to buy in these circumstances, because we want to make sure that town centres and villages, such as those in his constituency, can flourish into the future.
