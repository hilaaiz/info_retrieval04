I thank the Minister for her answer on the water restoration fund, but it would be good to know when it will come back into action.
A Liberal Democrat freedom of information request found that Ofwat has failed to force water companies to pay any fines for sewage discharge cases since 2021, despite sewage being pumped into waterways for over 3.6 million hours last year alone.
Meanwhile, water company bosses earned a collective total of £20 million in the 2023-24 financial year.
The water restoration fund provided valuable funds to local communities to improve water quality and river health.
When will the Government stand up to the water companies, make them pay for the damage they are inflicting on our environment, and ringfence this money for communities, so that they can protect and improve their waterways?
