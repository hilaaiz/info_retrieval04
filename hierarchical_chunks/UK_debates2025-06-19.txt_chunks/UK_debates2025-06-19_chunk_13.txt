I have the greatest sympathy for my hon.
Friend’s constituents.
I encourage Stevenage borough council to work with our National Fly-tipping Prevention Group, which shares best practice on tackling fly-tipping.
We are also taking direct action on some of the littered items, because once there is litter, people think that they can fly-tip, and then they think that they can dump.
That is why we have banned the sale of single-use vapes from  1 June , and I stand ready to work with his council.
When it comes to cracking down on litter and fly-tipping, I would welcome anything the Government do.
However, during proceedings on the Crime and Policing Bill, which passed through this place this week, Government Members had ample opportunity to accept various new clauses and amendments that would ensure stricter tackling of littering and fly-tipping, but failed to do so.
What message does that send to those who go around tossing litter and fly-tipping, and, importantly, to the many volunteers in constituencies like mine who work day in, day out, to clear up that litter?
We have said that we will use existing powers to create clean-up squads, which will force the waste criminals to clear up their mess.
It is a little rich of the Conservative party, after 14 years of failure, to attack us after just 10 months in government.
We have said that we are changing the carriers, brokers and dealers regime to tighten up arrangements relating to who can carry and transport waste, because the Conservatives left us a paper-based system that is open to fraud.
