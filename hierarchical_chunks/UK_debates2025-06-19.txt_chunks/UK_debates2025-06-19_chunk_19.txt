I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and I understand her concerns.
I reassure her that the Government will always act in the national interest on  these issues.
Thames Water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligations to its customers and to the environment—it is only right that the company is subject to the same consequences as any other water company.
The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, as I have said before, including a special administration regime, if that were to become necessary.
