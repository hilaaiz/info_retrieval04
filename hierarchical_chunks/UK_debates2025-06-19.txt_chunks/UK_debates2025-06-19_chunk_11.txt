The interim Cunliffe report on the water sector has highlighted weak, disjointed and reactive regulation by various regulators.
If the commission’s final findings confirm the assessment of the regulators, can the Minister confirm that she will act swiftly and decisively to reform regulation of our water companies?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight the important work that the commission has been doing.
I do not want to get ahead of any announcements the commission may make—it is not long to wait now, Mr Speaker; it is only a few weeks—but clearly regulation has not been working, so action is needed.
What steps he is taking to tackle fly-tipping.
Fly-tipping sky-rocketed under the Conservative Government.
This Labour Government will crack down on the waste cowboys in order to clean up Britain’s streets.
We will support councils in seizing and crush their vehicles.
We will use drones and CCTV to hunt down the fly-tippers, forcing them to clean up their mess, and we will bring in new prison sentences for those transporting waste illegally.
I am delighted to tell the House that we are beginning the clean-up of the disgraceful fly-tipping in Hoads Wood site of special scientific interest, which happened under the previous Government.
That work is ongoing.
