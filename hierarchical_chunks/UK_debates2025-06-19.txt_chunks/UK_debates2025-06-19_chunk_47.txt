I thank my hon.
Friend for her campaigning on this issue.
When she takes up campaigns, she normally gets results.
I am sure that she will get results on this issue, too, because we need to regulate these practices.
We need to make sure that people are properly trained and accountable and that people can hold them to account when things go wrong.
We are responding shortly to the consultation, and I will ensure the House is updated.
