Mr. BOWMAN.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to remember the beautiful life age of 25 from complications due to pulmonary hypertension, a condition she was diagnosed with at birth.
Our community in Mamaroneck and across New York's 16th district is devastated by Rachel's passing.
I want to send love and strength to Rachel's parents, Deborah and Stephen, her siblings, Leah and Joshua, and her fiance, Dylan.
I know that they are proud of Rachel's incredible life and all that she was able to accomplish.
After graduating from Mamaroneck High School, Rachel attended American University and was in the process of getting her masters degree from George Washington University.
She was also working at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society as a Government Relations Manager, pursuing her goal of changing healthcare in the United States.
Before her time at HIMSS, she worked for the National Council for Mental Wellbeing and ADvancing States and interned here in Congress.
We are all grateful for the contributions Rachel made to improving our healthcare across the country, work informed by her own experiences with the healthcare system throughout her life.
Her commitment to public service and advocating for others is clear and we are all better for it.
My thoughts are with her family, friends, and loved ones in this difficult time.
Rachel was a beautiful soul and an incredible part of our Mamaroneck community.
It has been an honor to represent her and her family.
