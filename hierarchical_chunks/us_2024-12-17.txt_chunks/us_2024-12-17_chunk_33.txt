son-in-law, a stepson, two stepdaughters and sons-in-law, ten grandchildren, and twenty-five great-grandchildren.
He is a loving role model to his family and is a living history of someone who served our country so valiantly.
Our Nation owes Guido a debt that can never be repaid.
We wish Guido countless blessings, and I remain deeply appreciative to Guido DiFrancesco for his life of service and sacrifice for our community, district, and country.
His commitment to his fellow neighbors, veterans, and service members alike is a testament to his character and spirit.
I am more than honored to recognize him today and wish him nothing but the best for his 100th birthday and the future beyond.
