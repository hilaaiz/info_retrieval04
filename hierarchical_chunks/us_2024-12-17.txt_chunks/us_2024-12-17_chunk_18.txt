Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Tony Fletcher, a dedicated advocate in our Napa community.
For thirtyfive years, 
Mr. Fletcher has demonstrated unwavering commitment to enriching the lives of the blind and visually impaired (BVI) through his work with the Enchanted Hills Camp for the Blind.
Born and raised in Napa, 
Mr. Fletcher dedicated his career to serving our community and ensuring that visually impaired individuals have access to resources.
Mr. Fletcher's journey with Enchanted Hills Camp began in 1989, marking the start of a lifelong career with LightHouse for the Blind.
Later, in 1995 he earned a Master of Arts in Special Education with an emphasis on Orientation and Mobility from San Francisco State University.
Mr. Fletcher is retiring after thirty-five years of serving Lighthouse for the Blind which oversees Enchanted Hills Camp concluding his career as the Senior Director.
Under 
Mr. Fletcher's leadership, Enchanted Hills Camp has flourished as a safe, nurturing, and empowering environment where blind campers of all ages could explore, learn, and experience the joys of a traditional summer camp.
Mr. Fletcher's vision and determination extended beyond the campgrounds, as he built partnerships with the County.
In 2017, when devastating wildfires destroyed much of Enchanted Hills Camp, 
Mr. Fletcher in partnership with County Supervisor Ryan Gregory and the LightHouse organization, helped rebuild the camp.
Today, Enchanted Hills Camp continues to be a fully accessible and inclusive retreat where blind, deafblind, and low-vision campers continue to thrive.
