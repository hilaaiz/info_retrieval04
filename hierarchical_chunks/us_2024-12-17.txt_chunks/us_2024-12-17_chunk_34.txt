Mr. POSEY.
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. House of Representatives unexpectedly lost a true public servant this week.
My Chief of Staff, George Cecala, served with me from the day I was sworn into office on January 3, 2009, until his life was cut short earlier this week, suffering from a heart attack at the young age of 49.
George was a loving husband and father and leaves behind his wife Jennifer, whom he cherished and their daughter Genny who was the joy of his life.
He also leaves a record of remarkable and sacrificial service to this institution and to the people of Florida's Space and Treasure Coasts.
Whether it is Kennedy Space Center, Patrick Space Force Base, Port Canaveral or our beautiful beaches, citrus groves or improvements to our highways or airports, George had a hand in it.
I saw both gentle care and dogged tenacity as George worked tirelessly against what seemed insurmountable odds to secure the safe return of abducted children from a war-torn region of the world to their grieving mothers.
To those who worked with George he was always encouraging.
When someone was troubled or struggling, George was always there to offer a word of encouragement.
George was always attentive to the needs of those around him--the colleague sitting beside him, the visitor who just walked in the office door, the intern looking for that first job on the Hill, or the constituent on the other end of the line, calling the office to tell George how to fix Washington.
George always went out of his way to serve others--the hallmark of a public servant.
He loved his Lord and Savior.
He loved his church.
He filled our office with stories of delight over Genny's latest achievements and her excitement over life's joys.
And, he loved his community, even running for a seat in the Maryland House.
The House of Representatives is a better place because of George Cecala.
George will be deeply missed.
