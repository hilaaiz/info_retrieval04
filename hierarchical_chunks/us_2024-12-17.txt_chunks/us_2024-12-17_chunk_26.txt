Mr. Gable's wife Emily passed way in 2017.
He is survived by his three children James, Elizabeth, and John and his two grandchildren.
Bob Gable was a great patriot, one of my most valued political mentors, and a true Kentucky gentleman.
I am most grateful for his loyal and genuine friendship, his sound advice, never-fail positive attitude, and kind, dignified manner.
It is my honor to lift up his life before the House.
