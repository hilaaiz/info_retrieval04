House, Dr. Burgess has been an important voice on every important healthcare debate during his two decades of service in the House.
I've had the pleasure of working closely with Dr. Burgess on the Energy and Commerce Committee for a long time, and whenever a bill related to healthcare was being debated or discussed, I knew I could count on Dr. Burgess to provide clarity and insight from an experienced physician's perspective.
Dr. Burgess and I share a passion for our military servicemembers and for many Congresses have introduced the MISSION Zero initiative together to improve trauma care between the military and civilians.
Seeing this bill signed into law was a major achievement together
and I intend to ensure this program continues in his legacy.
He has accomplished some truly amazing things during his time here including lowering drug costs, reigning in government waste, cutting taxes, and expanding healthcare options for folks around the country.
Since being nominated as Chairman of the Rules Committee, Dr. Burgess has worked tirelessly to ensure good legislation makes it to the floor and has been instrumental in our accomplishments in the 118th Congress.
I would like to thank Dr. Burgess for his unwavering commitment to conservative principles and his sound leadership.
On a personal note, I appreciate his friendship and counsel over the years.
While his colleagues and the people in his district are sure to miss Dr. Burgess in Congress, I know he is looking forward to spending more time with his family back home in his beloved Texas.
