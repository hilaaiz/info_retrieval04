Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Board Director Dee Rosario as he prepares for retirement after an extraordinary 37 years of dedicated service to the East Bay Regional Park District.
A proud native of the East Bay, Dee's journey began at Mt. Eden High School in Hayward, followed by an associate's degree from Chabot Community College and further studies at California State University, East Bay.
His deep roots in this community have shaped both his personal and professional life, driving a career that has had a profound and lasting impact on our region.
Dee's career with the Park District began in 1975, where he took on a series of vital roles, including park ranger, firefighter, fire lieutenant, and ultimately, park supervisor of Reinhardt Redwood Regional Park.
His unwavering commitment to preserving our natural resources and serving the public has left an indelible mark on the East Bay community.
During the 1991 Oakland Firestorm, his bravery and leadership were instrumental in mitigating the devastation.
His steadfast dedication to both protecting lives and safeguarding our natural landscapes proved invaluable during that critical time, demonstrating his remarkable courage and deep sense of responsibility.
In November 2016, Dee transitioned to a new chapter as a Board Director, where his visionary leadership has shaped the direction of the Park District.
Notably, he co-chaired Measure FF, a successful initiative that secured crucial funding for park improvements, wildfire prevention, and public safety--investments that will benefit generations to come.
Dee's exceptional contributions to the Park District were recently recognized with the 2024 California Special Districts Association Board Member of the Year award, a fitting honor for his tireless work and dedication.
One of Dee's most lasting legacies is his role in renaming Redwood Regional Park in honor of Aurelia Reinhardt, a pioneering figure in the Park District's history.
This thoughtful and meaningful tribute not only celebrated Reinhardt's contributions but also underscored Dee's commitment to preserving the rich heritage of our community and our parks.
Throughout his career, Dee has exemplified what it means to be a true leader.
He has consistently sought to cultivate growth, creativity, and compassion in others, mentoring the next generation of public servants to continue his legacy of excellence and service.
His belief that leadership is about empowering others will continue to resonate long after his retirement.
On behalf of the entire community, I extend our deepest gratitude to Board Director Dee Rosario for his outstanding service, leadership, and unwavering commitment to enhancing our natural and recreational resources.
His legacy will continue to inspire us all.
