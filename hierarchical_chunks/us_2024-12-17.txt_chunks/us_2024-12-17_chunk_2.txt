Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a piece of property in South Central Alaska known as the Bering River Coal Field located in the magnificent Copper River Delta.
This issue goes back to the days of Theodore Roosevelt as a conservation effort.
The United States government has the opportunity to purchase the mineral rights to this field.
This Congress provided the U.S. Forest Service $8 million to buy the Bering River Coal Field through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but the appraisal came in at $6 million.
The Korean Alaska Development Company that owns it will sell for $8 million, and I want to thank a gentleman, Joe Shinn, and the KADCO board of directors for staying at the table.
We have an opportunity, and I believe the members on both sides of the aisle would agree if you could by acclamation to give the Forest Service the ability to purchase this remarkable property for conservation.
But the United States government cannot pay more than appraised value unless we in Congress authorize them to do that.
The difference is between $6 million and $8 million dollars, and I ask my colleagues, if not now then, in the future, to help the United States of America to set aside the Bering River Coal Field in perpetuity for all future generations to enjoy.
