I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his commitment to and intimate knowledge of Georgia.
I underline the importance of his points on the freedom of the press—we need to know what is happening—and the freedom to protest.
Emotions were running high following the election campaign, but police brutality is never acceptable.
It is so important that people who wish to are able to express their views safely.
I thank him for putting that on the record.
