Many of the Ukrainian refugees living in my constituency have expressed relief and gratitude that there has been continuity of policy in still supporting Ukraine with the change of Government.
But at a time when Russia is finding that its economy is affected by the war and is having to rely on Iran, China and Korea to continue the war, does the Minister think it unwise to start talking of negotiations about land and so on, which will only encourage Putin and his regime?
Should we not be talking about increasing the resolve of our partners, giving military support and seizing Russian assets to let Ukraine use them?
There is no change in the UK position; we have always said that we will support Ukraine to achieve a just peace on its own terms.
The Prime Minister has been clear, including in his speech last night, that we must continue to back Ukraine and do what it takes to support its self-defence for as long as it takes.
The Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee made a strong case about the financial pressure that Russia finds itself in.
What additional pressure can we place on Russia?
Are there any plans to introduce a sanctions Bill?
