I thank my hon.
Friend, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax, for his pointed question and his support for freedom of the press.
We know that journalists must be free to report the facts.
Although he tempts me to speculate, he knows that I will not go there on any future sanctions arrangements; we always keep those quiet until we make the announcement, for obvious reasons.
He commented on the backsliding on freedom of the press and on the links between Georgia and the UK, which we will certainly investigate.
If he has specific questions or concerns in relation to those matters, could he write to us so that we can investigate?
