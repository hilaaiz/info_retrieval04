On the discussions the Minister for Europe, North America and the Overseas Territories has had, the hon.
Gentleman underlined the importance of UK support for the democratic process and spoke about the irregularities during the election campaign, which worried us, as partners during the election proceedings.
As he will be aware, we have called for an investigation into those irregularities so we can be clear that the results were correct.
We have taken the decision to pause our discussions at a political level until there is more stability; in that time, we will see how things develop with the forming of the new Government, and so on.
The hon.
Gentleman is right to lay out his concerns.
We will relay them not just from ourselves as a Government, but from this Parliament.
