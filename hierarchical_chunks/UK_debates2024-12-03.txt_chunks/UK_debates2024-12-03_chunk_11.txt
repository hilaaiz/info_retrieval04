I welcome the work that my hon.
Friend does on the all-party parliamentary group for Yorkshire and Northern Lincolnshire.
As I announced in October, the UK Infrastructure Bank has now become the national wealth fund and it will expand its team and be headquartered in the brilliant city of Leeds, to realise our ambition on the national wealth fund.
The national wealth fund will also have a strong regional focus, working with the mayors, including Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire, so that we can realise the potential of all our regions, including Yorkshire.
Further details on the national infrastructure and service transformation authority’s governance and location will be confirmed in due course.
