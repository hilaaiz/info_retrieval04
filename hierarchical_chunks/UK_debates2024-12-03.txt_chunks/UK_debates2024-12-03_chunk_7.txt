I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
As she said, the Scottish Government’s spending review settlement for 2025-26 is the largest, in real terms, of any settlement since devolution began.
The Scottish Government are receiving at least 20% more per person than equivalent UK Government spending in the rest of the United Kingdom.
That translates to over £8.5 billion more in 2025-26 alone.
This Labour Government are delivering for the people of Scotland by giving the Scottish Government the power and money to get on with the job, and it is for the SNP to be accountable for what it delivers for the Scottish people.
