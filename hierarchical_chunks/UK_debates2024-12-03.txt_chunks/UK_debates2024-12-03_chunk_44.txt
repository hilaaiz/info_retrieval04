I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her intimate knowledge of the elections in Georgia.
Our current position is to monitor the situation.
We are looking carefully at what our European partners say, but we are also encouraging the Georgian authorities to determine any complaints, as there have been a number of complaints about irregularities.
We are clear that all irregularities should be thoroughly investigated.
In addition, we are calling for demonstrations to be peaceful, an end to any police brutality, the exercise of restraint, and respect for the process of the formation of a new Government.
While we are not calling for a rerun of the election, we want to know the outcome of the investigation into those irregularities.
