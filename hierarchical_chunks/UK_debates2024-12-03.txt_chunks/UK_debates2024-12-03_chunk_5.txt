I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
She will know that this Government, like every Labour Government, are committed to improving living standards right across the country.
From  1 April 2025 , the national living wage will increase by 6.7% to £12.21 per hour for eligible workers aged 21 and over.
That represents an increase of £1,400 to the gross annual earnings of a full-time worker on the national living wage, and is expected to benefit around 3 million low-paid workers.
My hon.
Friend knows that the Government have set up a ministerial taskforce on child poverty, which will report in 2025.
