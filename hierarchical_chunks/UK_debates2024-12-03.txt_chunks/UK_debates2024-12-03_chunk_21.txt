While Europeans spend barely the cost of two cups of coffee a week on support for the war in Ukraine, 41% of Russia’s total expenditure is spent on the war.
They have had to cut social security and raise taxes to pay for the war effort.
While speculation about the future of the war is understandable in the current circumstances, it is really important that we remain firm.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that we must remain steadfast in our support for Ukraine?
We stand with Ukraine.
The Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and its members, heard from the Foreign Secretary last week about the UK’s steadfast support for Ukraine and our strong friendship.
I am sure my right hon.
Friend the Select Committee Chair is aware of that given all the Ukrainians who are based in homes in her constituency, and I reassure her that we will be steadfast and keep the support going for as long as it takes.
