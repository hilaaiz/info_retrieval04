Later today, the House will vote on the Government’s £25 billion national insurance tax hike.
To avoid any uncertainty when we vote, will the Minister confirm exactly which public sector organisations will be compensated?
If the shadow Minister would like to know which public sector organisations will be compensated, he could look at what his Government did with the health and social care levy, because the definition of public sector organisations—it is a regularly cited definition—is set out through the Office for National Statistics.
We will reimburse Departments and other public sector organisations.
There was so little information in that response—the civil service will be very proud of the Minister.
He will not say who will be spared by the Chancellor’s tax raid, but we know that working people will be made to pay—the Office for Budget Responsibility has said so; the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said so; even the Resolution Foundation has said so; and working people know so.
Why is it that Labour always leaves office with unemployment higher than when it entered office?
I do not think the shadow Minister listened to my response to the previous question, in which I set out very clearly the definition of the public sector for the purposes of national insurance contributions.
Look at what the OBR has said: yes, it recognises that we are asking businesses to contribute more and that this will have an impact, but it also says that the employment level will rise from 33.1 million to 34.3 million by 2029, meaning an increase in the employment level over this Parliament.
