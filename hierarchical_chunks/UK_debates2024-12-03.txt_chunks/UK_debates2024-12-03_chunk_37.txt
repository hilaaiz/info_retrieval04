I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Following the elections in Georgia on  26 October , the Minister for Europe, North America and the Overseas Territories, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty) , made clear our support for the findings of the OSCE office for democratic institutions and human rights’ election monitoring mission preliminary report on the election.
That report highlighted a range of concerns, including frequent breaches of voter secrecy, procedural inconsistencies and reports of intimidation and pressure on voters, which had a negative impact on public trust in the process.
This has seriously damaged Georgia’s international reputation.
I hereby reiterate our call on the Government of Georgia to implement the recommendations issued by the OSCE monitoring mission after the publication of its final report.
