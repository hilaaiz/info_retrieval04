I thank the hon.
Lady for her detailed knowledge and her question.
We know that the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific work closely together on all these Navy questions.
I would not want to give anything specific away at the Dispatch Box that might help President Putin, but it is good to see that she is monitoring that.
It is so important that we continue to work together, whether that is through the training of forces on the ground, air defence or Navy assets.
