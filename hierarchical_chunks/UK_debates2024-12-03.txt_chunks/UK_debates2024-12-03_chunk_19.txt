The Minister will herself have seen President Zelensky’s latest remarks about NATO membership.
It is important for NATO to speak with one voice on these matters, and this unity is absolutely crucial, so can the Minister update the House on the Government’s current position on Ukraine acceding to NATO?
We all continue to see more appalling brutality from Putin, with his pummelling of civilians and Ukraine’s energy systems constantly as winter kicks in, which is starting to hurt the people of Ukraine.
The misery that that could inflict is the most atrocious form of psychological and physical warfare.
The UK has led so much on Ukraine, so can the Minister confirm whether the Government are looking at what more can be done to protect Ukraine’s energy infrastructure?
Can she reassure the House that we will keep on doing everything we can do to support the defence of freedom in Ukraine?
I reassure the right hon.
Lady that there is no change in the UK position.
We have always said that we will support Ukraine to achieve a just peace on its own terms.
The PM has been clear, including in his speech last night, that “we must continue to back Ukraine and do what it takes to support…self-defence for as long as it takes”, because it is for Ukraine to determine its position in any future discussions.
Putin cannot be trusted—Russia has violated multiple previous agreements—and the clearest path to peace is for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine tomorrow and respect Ukrainian borders.
On the NATO membership question that the right hon.
Lady poses, Ukraine’s place is in NATO.
The allies agreed in Washington on  10 July  that Ukraine is on an “irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership”, and the UK fully supports that goal.
