One aspect of support that the UK could offer Ukraine is expired medical equipment and dressings.
A charity based in Axminster in my constituency, called Medics4Ukraine, has just got back from Odesa.
It has been training municipal workers, and it says that it needs dressings, haemostatic dressings and gauzes.
Will she speak to her counterparts in the Department of Health and Social Care to see whether some of the expired items could be released for that purpose?
I refer the hon.
and gallant Gentleman to the discussion in the Adjournment debate last night on medical assistance in conflict.
The UK has an enormous amount of resource in that area.
I will certainly look into what is possible and write to him with what we are already doing in relation to Ukraine.
I very much welcome the statement, the ongoing commitment we have seen from this Government and the co-operation with the previous Government on Ukraine, because it is not just about security in Europe, as these things are in our self-interest.
May I impress on the Minister that if Ukraine is allowed to fall, it will not just be a European problem?
So much grain that is grown in Ukraine finds its way to Africa.
If Ukraine falls, people in Africa will starve, too.
