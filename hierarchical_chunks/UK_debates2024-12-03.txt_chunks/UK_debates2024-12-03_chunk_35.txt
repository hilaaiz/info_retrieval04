I thank the Minister for her answers.
President Zelensky has been clear that NATO membership must mean article 5 including the entirety of Ukraine territories.
What discussion has the FCDO, and perhaps the Minister, had with our NATO allies to ensure that that is the case?
Will she commit in particular to discussing the issue with the current and incoming US Secretaries of State to ensure that a co-ordinated approach is taken on behalf of Ukraine?
