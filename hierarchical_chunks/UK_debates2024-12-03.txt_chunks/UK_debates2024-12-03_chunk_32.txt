I thank my hon.
Friend for making an important point.
We all watched two summers ago with bated breath as the Black sea grain negotiations occurred, and the impact of missing out on that important agricultural wealth in Ukraine, and the deleterious effect it had on developing nations, were of concern to all in  this House.
He is right to speak about the knock-on effects of conflict.
We must redouble our efforts to stop that happening.
