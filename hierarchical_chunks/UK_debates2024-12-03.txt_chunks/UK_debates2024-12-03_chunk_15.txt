I welcome the right hon.
Member to his place, and look forward to many exchanges with him across the Dispatch Box.
At the Budget in October, as he knows, we had to fix a £22 billion black hole in the public finances.
Some of that black hole comes from the fact that we are the only G7 economy in which employment is lower than it was before the pandemic, when he was Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, so we had to raise taxes to fund our public services; but never again will we have to repeat a Budget like that one, because we have now wiped the slate clean and drawn a line under the mess created by the previous Government.
