I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for the invitation.
In October, the Government launched the national wealth fund to mobilise billions of pounds of investment into world-leading clean energy and growth industries.
I am pleased that the national wealth fund already announced a £20 million investment in XLCC to support it in moving towards a construction phase.
This will support 900 jobs, as well as making a contribution to the UK being a clean energy superpower by strengthening the home-grown energy suppliers that are fundamental to achieving our energy independence.
