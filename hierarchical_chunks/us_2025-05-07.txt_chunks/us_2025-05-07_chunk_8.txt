Motor Company's Head of State, Local and Stakeholder Government Affairs.
In this vital capacity, he leads a team to navigate the complex systems of state and local governments in order to strengthen the American auto industry.
However, Tony's influence extends well beyond his role with Ford Motor Company.
He serves as Vice Chair of the Ford Civic Action Fund, a member of the Executive Committee of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, and former Chairman of the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association.
These underscore his significant contributions to shaping the automotive landscape and public policy for the industry.
Tony's service extends deep into the community.
He has served in many roles in the Sixth Congressional District of Missouri and the Northland of Kansas City, Missouri, as he has worked to make it a better place to live and work.
He serves on the Board of Directors for both the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce and Liberty Economic Development Corporation.
He is the President of the Northland CAPS Board of Directors.
He is the Chairperson of the Board of Directors for the Kansas City Zoo and sits on the Advisory Council of the North Kansas City Hospital.
He is the Past Chair Advisor for the Clay County Economic Development Council.
His service and commitment to our community is deep and the impact is tremendous.
As a native of Lexington, Missouri, and a proud graduate of Drury University in Springfield, Missouri, Tony's roots are firmly planted in our state, and we are incredibly proud to count him a Missourian.
I am proud to call him a friend.
A strong American auto industry means a strong American economy.
We live and breathe that in Missouri.
Ford's Kansas City Assembly plant makes the best-selling vehicle in America, creating jobs not only at the plant, but at dealerships, suppliers, and other parts of the community.
Tony's work at Ford helps the company invest in local communities and make an impact both in Missouri and across the country.
