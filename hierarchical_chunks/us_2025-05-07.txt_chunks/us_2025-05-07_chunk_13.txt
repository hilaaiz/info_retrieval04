Since 2013, Jerry has also served as the Pasco County Local Coordinator for SHINE Volunteers within the Area Agency on Aging as well as a Florida Statewide SHINE Trainor.
He has traveled around the state for the Florida Department of Elder Affairs educating SHINE Volunteers.
Jerry is a true advocate and can be relied on to accept any challenges that arise.
In addition to Volunteering with the SHINE program he is a Lay Pastor in his church and has spent time assisting with Metropolitan Ministries, the Shepard Center in Tarpon Springs, Cares Senior Center, and other non-profit organizations.
He also volunteers with the Supervisor of Elections and as an election worker during the voting season.
In addition to his volunteer work, his wife Phyllis, who is his high school sweetheart of 50+ years, and his children and grandchildren keep him busy.
It is clear Jerry Phillips has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
