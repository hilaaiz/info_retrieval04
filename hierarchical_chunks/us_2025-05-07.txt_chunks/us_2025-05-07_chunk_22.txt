Mr. Hudson's time in the Navy has shown his bravery, dedication, and deep love for his country.
Throughout 
Mr. Hudson's military service, he has had the honor of receiving the Asiatic-Pacific Ribbon, a Commendation by Captain Strauss of the U.S. Navy, an American Campaign Ribbon, and a Victory Medal.
I would like to wish 
Mr. Milton Hudson a Happy 98th Birthday and thank him for his great service to our country.
