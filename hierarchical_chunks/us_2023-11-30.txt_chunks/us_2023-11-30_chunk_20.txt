Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad on its 75th anniversary.
The all-volunteer agency continues to provide exemplary service to residents and its work is truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Incorporated in 1948, Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad is a 501c4 that does not bill for its services.
Though the squad is responsible for financing most of its operations, including its medical supplies, equipment, and vehicles, it receives a small stipend through the city and is also supported by the community through donations and fundraisers.
Responding to over 600 calls a year, Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad serves the residents of the Elberon section of Long Branch, but also provides backup for the entire city of Long Branch, West Long Branch, Deal, Allenhurst, Eatontown, Oceanport, Monmouth Beach, and Sea Bright.
In addition to providing on-site support for local community events, including the large-scale NJ Marathon, Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad is on a Monmouth County EMS Strike Team and stands ready to assist in mass casualty incidents.
First Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians play a vital role in our communities, providing quality care in a timely manner.
The members of Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad volunteer their time and undergo rigorous training to support its neighbors.
They are welltrained, efficient, and compassionate, and they demonstrate true community service.
