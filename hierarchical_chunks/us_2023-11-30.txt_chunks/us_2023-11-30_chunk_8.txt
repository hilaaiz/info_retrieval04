Mr. NEWHOUSE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the commitment of a devoted Central Washington public servant, Kevin Fuhr.
Formerly the Chief of Police for Moses Lake, Chief Fuhr has concluded an illustrious 32-year career in law enforcement and is now ready to move on to the next chapter of his life.
While other regions of Washington State had trouble hiring new police officers, Chief Fuhr's leadership drew people to Moses Lake Police Department in the pursuit of working underneath him.
Chief Fuhr's force also spearheaded an exceptional outreach program, and his leadership on my Central Washington Fentanyl Taskforce has fostered a remarkable level of trust within our communities.
When most folks retire, they look forward to all the spare time they will have.
However, the call to public service continues to ring for Chief Fuhr, as he has recently been hired as the city manager of Moses Lake, underscoring his unwavering dedication to Central Washington.
I have known Kevin for a long time, and I am proud to call him a dear friend, His leadership, integrity, and commitment to the prosperity of our region has resulted in a wonderful career with more than enough to show for it.
It has been a pleasure working with him, and I am looking forward to continuing our collaboration in his new role.
