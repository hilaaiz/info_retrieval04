Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate my friend David Whisenant on his retirement from WBTV after 32 years of service.
David Whisenant started his news career at Salisbury-based radio station WSTP while in high school in 1976.
He went on to attend Appalachian State University, earning degrees in both Political Science and English.
Throughout his four years, he worked at a radio station in Boone, North Carolina.
After graduation, David returned to Salisbury and started a full-time job at WSTP.
When WBTV first created their bureau in Salisbury, David sent a handwritten letter to the news director expressing his interest in working for the station.
David started at WBTV as a stringer and within a year was promoted to General Assignment Reporter.
David would go on to provide coverage for Charlotte as well as Salisbury, Concord, and Kannapolis.
In his words, he would go ``wherever they send me.''
Some of David's biggest stories include the Pillowtex/NC Research Campus developments, the tragic fire at Salisbury Millworks, the funeral of President Ronald Reagan, NASCAR-related stories, and coverage and updates.
I think I speak for the whole of our community here in North Carolina in wishing David all the best as he begins this next chapter of life.
