Mr. GALLEGO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate over 70 years of the Azteca Wedding Plaza as the Torrez family heads into retirement.
Founded in 1950 by Adolfo and Kay Torrez, their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren have kept the family business thriving over the decades.
Family has been at the center of everything at Azteca.
For generations, the Torrezes have proudly served Phoenix families through quinceaneras, weddings.
and many other special moments.
To be part of memorable occasions and serve their community has been their motivation and constant goal throughout the years.
Prolific entrepreneurs, Adolfo and Kay's first business was Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix.
From there, they opened a bar, flower shop.
furniture store, and eventually grew into Azteca Wedding Plaza-- an entire city block dedicated to the bridal industry.
Azteca has been a mainstay in Phoenix's Latino community, providing a welcoming environment for generations of brides and grooms.
Now, as a family, they have determined it is time to retire Azteca.
Reaching this conclusion has not been easy, but their decision was fueled by one factor--family.
Now, their plan is to spend more time with friends and family and to watch their community grow and prosper.
I would like to congratulate the Torrez family on over 70 years of business and wish them all the best in their future endeavors.
