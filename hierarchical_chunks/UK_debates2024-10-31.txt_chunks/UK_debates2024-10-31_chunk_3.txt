I thank my hon.
Friend for his previous answers.
We are blessed with some fantastic high streets in Hendon, such as Mill Hill Broadway, Station Road and the High Street in Edgware, Watling Avenue in Burnt Oak, Brent Street in Hendon and Vivian Avenue in West Hendon.
However, when I talk to business owners, they all too often tell me that they are struggling to find and retain the staff they need to grow successfully.
What steps is the Department taking to make sure small businesses can get the skilled staff they need not just to survive, but to thrive?
