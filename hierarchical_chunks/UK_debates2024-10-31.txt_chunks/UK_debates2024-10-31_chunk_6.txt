I welcome some things that the Minister has referred to regarding high street businesses, and I thank him for that, but there are many other matters.
For example, in Newtownards family businesses make up a great many of the attractive high street businesses, such as Wardens, Knotts Bakery and the family butcher, and they are important, as they are in Ballynahinch.
Has the Minister had the opportunity to talk to the chamber of trade in Newtownards, which is working well?
Other chambers of trade in my constituency can also contribute, so has there been an opportunity to speak to them to get their ideas about the way forward?
