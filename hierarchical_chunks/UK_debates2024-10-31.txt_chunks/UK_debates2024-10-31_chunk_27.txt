I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for the work that he is doing to represent his community.
We are working extensively with all parties to find an outcome for Harland & Wolff that delivers shipbuilding and manufacturing in Belfast, Scotland and Appledore in Devon.
I cannot comment further, as he says, due to commercial sensitivities, but we are working extensively with everyone to get the right deal.
