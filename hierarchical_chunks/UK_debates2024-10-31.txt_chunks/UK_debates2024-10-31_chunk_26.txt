We should all welcome the work of both Governments that resulted in the announcement of £63 billion of inward investment into the UK.
However, since then, as a number of Members have pointed out, we have had significant new regulation in the labour market and massive new taxes on businesses.
If any of those investors now change their minds, will the Secretary of State come to the House and inform us, please?
We will of course keep the House updated on the results of the investment summit, but the £63 billion, as I said earlier, was a massive show of confidence in this new Government.
I am grateful to the Minister and the Secretary of State for the work that they have put in to secure a future for the Harland & Wolff yard at Arnish in my constituency, and indeed at Methil, Appledore and Belfast.
I understand that talks are commercially sensitive, but, as workers are anxious about their future, can the Minister update us on how the talks are going?
