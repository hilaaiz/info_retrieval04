I thank the Minister for his answer.
In my constituency of Watford, many people are employed in the hospitality, retail and construction sectors and, with a big hospital, in the health and social sector.
Will the Minister confirm that the Government’s Make Work Pay plan will bring long-lasting benefits to them and to other workers?
