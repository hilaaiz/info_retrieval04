I welcome the decision by my right hon.
Friend’s Select Committee to take a further look at the issue.
It is a priority for the Department to speed up the compensation process.
Victims are still coming forward, and we are actively looking at whether all those who come forward are covered by the compensation schemes.
We have asked the Post Office to write to all those sub-postmasters who have not yet come forward to see if they are eligible for compensation.
