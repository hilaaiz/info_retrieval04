I thank my hon.
Friend for that incredibly important question.
Community energy has so many benefits in our energy mix, including giving communities a stake in our energy future.
We also know that there are many social and economic benefits that come from that.
We are committed to our local power plan, which will deliver investment in community-owned projects.
Great British Energy will have a key role to play in supporting communities, capacity building and in that initial funding to help them deliver these projects.
