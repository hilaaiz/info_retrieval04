Last week was the historic week when 142 years of coal-fired electricity generation came to an end, and this week we have announced the new era of carbon capture and storage.
We will work in a different way from the last Government, adopting a proactive approach to ensure that the transition works for people and that we create new jobs as well.
At Grangemouth we provided a package of support for workers, and at Port Talbot we managed to negotiate a better deal than the last Government.
We will use all the levers that we have—Great British Energy, the national wealth fund, the British jobs bonus and the office of green energy jobs that we have set up—to ensure that we get the transition right.
