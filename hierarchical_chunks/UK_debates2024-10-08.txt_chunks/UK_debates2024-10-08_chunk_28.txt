I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
She is absolutely right to say that, in order  for us to meet our 2030 ambitions, we will need a whole range of different options.
Community energy is a critical part of that, helping to deliver energy security and lower bills.
Crucially, it also gives communities a stake in the energy future.
That is why one of Great British Energy’s five objectives is to support the delivery of a local power plan, which puts local communities, combined authorities, local authorities and others in the driving seat in restructuring our energy economy.
I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend and others to discuss this issue further.
