I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.
Cantonian high school in my constituency of Cardiff West will be the first Cardiff school to be  operationally net zero in line with Welsh Government standards, while the building work itself will feature a significant reduction in embodied carbon.
Fairwater community campus will be a collection of highly energy-efficient buildings that are powered from renewable energy sources, helping Cardiff to deliver on its One Planet strategy, which outlines the city’s ambition to mitigate climate change.
Will the Secretary of State join me in celebrating the development, and agree with me that this sort of collaborative vision is required to deliver on our net zero commitments both here and in Wales?
