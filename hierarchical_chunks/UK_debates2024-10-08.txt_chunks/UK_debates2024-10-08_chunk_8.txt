Thank you Mr Speaker—I’ve done the training.
I welcome the Secretary of State’s warm words about our leadership on international climate issues, which is in stark contrast to the previous Government’s failings.
I also publicly welcome his recent visit to Harlow college—less said about the racing game, which he won, the better.
Does he agree that it is only thanks to the commitment shown by the new Government to drastically deliver on climate change issues that we can lead on a world stage?
Neatly done, although it was a little long.
Come on Secretary of State.
My hon.
Friend did very well, and I agree with him.
Part of the problem with the last Government—I do not doubt that there were people making good endeavours—is that when we do something different at home to what we preach internationally, such as say we are going to power past coal by opening a new coalmine, people say, “Well, you are saying one thing and doing another.”
Consistency is the absolute foundation for global leadership.
