The Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State,  the hon.
Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks) , have spoken passionately about the need to upgrade the national grid, but do they recognise the concerns of people across the east of England, including in the Witham constituency, about what that means for their local communities?
The Under-Secretary has said that he will meet Members of Parliament, but I ask him very politely whether he and representatives and Ministers from the Department will also meet members of the communities that are affected by this matter.
I know from the questions that I have received from the Opposition that the right hon.
Lady has been a tireless advocate on these issues.
I do understand the concerns of local communities about clean energy infrastructure, which is why I am so keen on the idea of community benefit.
It is important that communities receive benefit for hosting that infrastructure.
We must have a discussion about this matter in the House and across the country.
If we are to end our exposure to international fossil fuels and the kind of the cost of living crisis that we have seen over the past few years, which has devastated communities across Britain, this infrastructure does need to be built.
Last week’s announcement on carbon capture and hydrogen in my constituency demonstrates that we now have a Government of substance, not of hollow slogans.
What discussions have the Secretary of State and Ministers had with the trade unions to ensure that we build those facilities with unionised labour?
