Could I invite the Minister to meet a cross-party group of MPs from the east of England to discuss how the review conducted by the electricity system operator can contribute to energy security and in particular to look at how undergrounding high voltage direct current cables could be cheaper in the long term than pylons and more efficient for achieving net zero?
Will he agree at least to have a meeting with us on that basis?
I am always happy to have meetings with any right hon.
and hon.
Members across the House on a range of issues, so I will take that away.
The evidence suggests that undergrounding is five to 10 times more expensive and that actually it can have more of a damaging impact on nature and natural habitats than pylons.
The important thing with all of this is that this is nationally important structure, which is necessary for us to get to the targets that we want to get to.
I know that the hon.
Gentleman takes that seriously, and I will meet him and others, but we have been clear as a Government that we will build this infrastructure if it is necessary.
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of Great British Energy on job creation in industrial communities.

The Government have two key missions: to become an energy superpower, and to grow the economy.
Great British Energy will help us deliver on both those missions.
The Under-Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks) , will be taking the Great British Energy Bill through Committee today, and I am excited for the job creation potential in our industrial communities.
From engineers to welders, and from electricians to project managers, Great British Energy will be powered by people across all the nations and regions of this great country.
