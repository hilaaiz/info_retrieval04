I thank the Secretary of State for his really rapid action to reach our 100% sustainable goals by 2030.
It has developed a real excitement in this country, and the people I speak to are genuinely behind this action.
In Stroud, we are developing a community energy programme of putting solar panels on every school and public building that agrees to it.
What steps is he taking to support solar on schools and public buildings, and can he ensure there are no barriers to progress?
