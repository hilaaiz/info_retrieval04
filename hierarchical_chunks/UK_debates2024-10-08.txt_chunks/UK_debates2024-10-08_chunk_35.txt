I welcome the Government’s commitment to increasing renewable energy generation.
An important component of that is the development of associated infrastructure, including battery storage facilities such as those proposed in Cullingworth in my constituency.
How do the Government plan to ensure that the safety of residents is not put at risk by such developments, and that there is clear community benefit from any renewable energy plans and the associated infrastructure?
