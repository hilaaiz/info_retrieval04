I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
A similar point has been raised by many hon.
Members across the House.
This issue affects areas right across the country.
We are doing what we can at the moment to prioritise the connections queue, so that the most important projects, or those most able to be delivered, can move forward.
There is much more that we can do on that, but, fundamentally, we need to build much more network infrastructure in the first place so that we can speed up and reduce the cost of these connections for schemes such as the one he mentions.
