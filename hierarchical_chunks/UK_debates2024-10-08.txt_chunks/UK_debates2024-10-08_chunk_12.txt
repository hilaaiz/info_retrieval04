The Secretary of State will be aware that 25% of the UK is situated on top of coalmines, which can provide geothermal energy to heat houses and businesses in places like Ashfield.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can make that work in coalfield communities?
I very much welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s question—which I must say is somewhat of a surprise.
I will absolutely meet him to discuss that.
We have been clear that any technologies can be part of the solution and, if that can be part of the picture, I will meet him to discuss the options and the technology more generally.
One of the ways in which we can increase energy security is through community-owned and co-operative energy schemes.
They give greater control to local people, who get a say in where profits go, and crucially they build resilience from international energy markets.
Will the Minister say a bit more about where community-owned energy will fit into the energy security plan?
