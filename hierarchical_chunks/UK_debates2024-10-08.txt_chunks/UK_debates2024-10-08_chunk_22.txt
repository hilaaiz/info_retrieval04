Keeping vulnerable people warm and lowering their energy bills is, I am sure, something we can all agree on across the House.
Insulating homes is a key part of that puzzle.
We welcome the news that we will see the warm homes plan in spring.

Does she have any idea of the amount and allocation of funding in this Parliament that there will be for insulating homes?
We are really clear that as we develop our plans we absolutely need to get on with the job of upgrading homes.
We have announced our warm homes local grant and our warm homes social housing fund, which are targeted at low-income families, because we know there is a job of work to do.
We are committed to an additional £6.6 billion to invest in our warm homes plan over the course of this Parliament.

We will work with them and other industrial regions to develop a plan, ensuring those workers are the people who decarbonise our country.
