The Institution of Civil Engineers has called for a spatial energy plan to utilise new and emerging technologies to facilitate future net zero infrastructure planning.
Will the Government look to bring forward a spatial energy plan and meet me to discuss that?
Yes, we will be bringing forward a spatial energy plan.
That is one of the responsibilities of the National Energy System Operator.
The hon.
Gentleman makes an important point: we need a plan for the system.
We can have a plan for the 2030 system done by the NESO and, indeed, a wider strategic spatial energy plan, which will be crucial for the country.
The warm homes plan is excellent and much needed in towns such as mine, but on warm homes grants for insulation, during recess I met a large number of constituents who had been victims of failed insulation and cowboy workmanship under such Government schemes.
Some are living in horrific conditions with useless warranties.
Is the Minister   aware of their plight?
Will she ensure that regulation is strong enough, and will she meet me and victims to make sure that this never happens again?
