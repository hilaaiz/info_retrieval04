What recent progress he has made on meeting his target to have a zero carbon electricity system by 2030.
In 12 weeks, this Government have hit the ground running for our 2030 target by ending the onshore wind ban in place for nine years under the Conservative party, consenting to more nationally significant solar projects than in 14 years of the last Government, and overseeing the most successful renewables auction in history compared with the Conservatives’ disastrous auction round that crashed offshore wind.
This is a Government in a hurry to meet our mandate from the British people, and we are just getting started.
