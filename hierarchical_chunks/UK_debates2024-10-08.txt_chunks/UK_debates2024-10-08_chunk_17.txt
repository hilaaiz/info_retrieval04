I thank the Minister for her work.
Warm home prescriptions can target that support towards elderly people and those with underlying health conditions, saving our NHS as well as keeping people warm over the winter.
The pilot has shown real benefit.
Will she meet me to discuss that and other options to keep old people warm this winter?
