I thank the Minister for her answer and for her commitment to the warm homes plan.
I congratulate her on the announcement over the conference recess to end the scandal of cold, draughty homes in the rental sector, which particularly affects people in my constituency in towns such as Haltwhistle, Throckley, Newburn, Hexham and elsewhere.
Does she agree that often the   very poorest in our communities are forced to live in those cold and draughty properties, and it is important that we cut bills and give those families energy security?
