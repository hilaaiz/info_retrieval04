Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the NASWA Resort's anniversary and in memory of their dedicated owner, Hope Markis.
The NASWA Resort is one of the Lakes Region's most iconic establishments, founded by Greek immigrants and its legacy carried on by their daughter, Hope Markis, and her family.
Starting as just a few cabins, the Markis family has transformed the NASWA Resort into the hospitable and beautiful place it is today.
Over the years, they have grown their business from an inn to the resort we know, expanding to include more options for entertainment, food, and adventure.
Hope Markis was truly a leader, through both her work in pioneering the resort and her active involvement in her community.
Her legacy truly lives in her hospitality and generosity, whether that was in the way she welcomed guests to the resort or in her support of veterans and first responders.
The way that she cared for her community will not be forgotten, and that care lives on in her children and grandchildren, who continue to run the NASWA Resort.
Certainly, what she has built as a businesswoman and as a matriarch will be felt by all of those who come to the resort and experience her hard work and dedication.
The NASWA Resort is not just an important piece of New Hampshire's tourist economy, but a multigenerational family business that is a vital part of the Lakes Region.
New Hampshire owes Hope and her family a debt of gratitude for all that they have brought to the region and the work they have done to better the community around them.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I share my condolences with the Markis family, including her children and her grandchildren.
I would once again like to extend my condolences to her family and wish them all the very best in this time
