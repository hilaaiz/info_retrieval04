Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Ms. Betty Doster, for her dedicated service to The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, my alma mater, as Special Assistant to the Chancellor for External Relations and Partnerships.
After nearly fifteen years in this important position, Betty announced her retirement, with her last day being Monday, June 30, 2025.
Throughout her many years of service, Betty played an immeasurable role in the growth of UNC Charlotte into an R1 research institution.
Even though she is a proud UNC Chapel Hill alum, Betty's passion for UNC Charlotte was enormous.
Her efforts significantly contributed to the growing influence of our universjty across the state of North Carolina, around the country and around the world.
It was a pleasure to work with Betty on many of these initiatives over the years.
As Special Assistant to the Chancellor for External Relations and Partnerships, Betty worked closely with federal, state, and local officials, as well as economic development partners to secure important public investments for the University.
Betty's efforts helped acquire major student-focused initiatives, including authorization for the University Recreation Center, expansion of the Collegiate Recovery Program, and support for UNC Charlotte's esports initiative.
It is my honor to take this opportunity to recognize 
Ms. Betty Doster for her incredible service to UNC Charlotte, and her significant impact on the University.
While I'll miss working with Betty and discussing the 49ers, I wish her all the best in her next adventure and hope she will be able to enjoy more time with friends and family.
