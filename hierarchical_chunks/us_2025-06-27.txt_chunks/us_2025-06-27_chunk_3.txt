Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly special milestone for my district: 100 years since the incorporation of Deerfield Beach, Florida.
What started in June 1925 as a town of just 500 people has boomed into a vibrant city and one of the best places to live in South Florida.
Deerfield Beach is special not just because of its natural beauty, but also because of the people who have built this city up for the past century and make it what it is today.
I'm proud to represent parts of Deerfield Beach, and I'm fortunate to work with Mayor Todd Drosky and its local commissioners to deliver the federal resources this city needs to support its infrastructure, boost its economic development, and keep families here safe.
It is truly an incredible place to call home.
