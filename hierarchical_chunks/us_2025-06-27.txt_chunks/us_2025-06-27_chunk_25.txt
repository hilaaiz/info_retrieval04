Senator Jordan once said, ``I didn't stop there.
I just kept on pushing.''
That simple sentence says everything about him.
He kept pushing--for himself, for his community, and for justice.
He is the kind of public servant we should all strive to be.
His memoir, From the Mississippi Cotton Fields to the State Senate, tells the full story of his journey.
It's a powerful reminder of what is possible when courage and commitment meet opportunity.
