Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barbara Collura, a long-time advocate for family-building equality, who is stepping down after more than 20 years of leadership with RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association.
During her tenure, Barbara's leadership was key to furthering RESOLVE's missions: lifting up the voices of millions of Americans struggling with infertility and fighting to ensure that everyone, regardless of background, income, or geography, can access the care they need to build their families.
Her work included testifying before Congress, meeting with lawmakers and federal agencies, organizing advocates, and working toward a world where infertility is recognized as a disease that deserves attention, compassion, and coverage.
Her tenure has been marked by meaningful policy progress, including expanded insurance coverage for fertility care at the state level, and increased protections for IVF.
As someone who relied on access to IVF to have my twins, I know personally how important it is to raise more awareness about infertility and expand access to fertility treatments.
I have been proud to work with RESOLVE under Barbara's leadership to push for common sense legislation that would offer hope to millions of families struggling with infertility.
At a time when reproductive freedom is under attack, Barbara has stood firm in defense of all paths to parenthood--because infertility is not only part of the reproductive health conversation, but central to it.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Barbara Collura for her extraordinary contributions to the infertility community.
Her legacy is one of hope, progress, and an unwavering commitment to the idea that everyone deserves the chance to build a family.
