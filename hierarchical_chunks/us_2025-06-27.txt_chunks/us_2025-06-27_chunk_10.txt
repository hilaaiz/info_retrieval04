Mrs. KIGGANS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate Shirley Smith Southerland's 90th Birthday on July 26, 2025.
Shirley Smith Southerland was born in Wallace, North Carolina in 1935, and is a mother of 4 children, 1 boy and 3 girls.
She was an award-winning hairdresser before working for Princess House Inc., becoming one of its top five independent sales managers in the country.
Known as ``Yaya'' by her 21 grandchildren and great grandchildren, she is a devoted and loving grandmother.
We celebrate her this month as a shining example of a civic-minded American--through her service dedication, hard work, respect for others, and active participation in democracy.
She shows us what it means to be a model citizen.
