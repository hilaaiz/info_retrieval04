Ms. Rodriguez, posthumously and deservingly promoted to Lieutenant on June 23, 2025, served as a Metro Transit police officer for more than eight years.
Lieutenant Rodriguez was a compassionate leader who served as head of the Homeless Action Team (HAT), building real relationships with those experiencing homelessness and personally guiding hundreds toward housing stability and hope.
In addition to her police duties, Lieutenant Rodriguez served as Northern Vice President of the National Latino Peace Officers Association, where she was described as ``a compassionate advocate, a trusted mentor, and a tireless servant.''
I extend my deepest condolences to Lieutenant Rodriguez's family, friends, and colleagues.
Her heroic works will never be forgotten.
