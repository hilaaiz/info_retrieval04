Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated public safety professional who was taken from us much too soon.
Metro Transit Police Lieutenant Beverly Rodriguez was just 40 years old when she died on Sunday, June 22, 2025, in a tragic accident.
Her death is a deep and profound loss for her family, especially her two sons Macallen and Macody, the Metro Transit Police Department, and our entire east metro community.
