Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Merced County Community Action Agency (MCCAA) in celebrating sixty years of service.
MCCAA began serving Dos Palos in 1964 and opened its first Head Start center in 1965.
MCCAA is part of a nationwide movement that began with the signing of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
MCCAA's mission is to serve, advocate, and collaborate for those in need by developing innovative strategies for self-empowerment.
MCCAA gainfully employs nearly 200 people and serves over 17,000 unduplicated customers every month with a total of sixteen federal and state programs.
The work MCCAA provides for the community would be impossible without our local community, who last year volunteered over 14,000 hours.
Last year, MCCAA housed over 112 formerly unhoused community members with safe, affordable homes.
Over 400 children utilize their free preschool programs for early learning and education.
MCCAA provides 1,500 families with utility assistance, keeping families safe during scorching Valley summers.
The MCCAA maintains over sixteen other locations in Merced County, and partners with over 200 local service providers, government agencies, and families to help with outreach, referrals and access to needed services.
The D Street Navigation Center is open year-round, twenty-four hours per day to meet the needs of Merced County's most vulnerable living on the streets.
Last year, over 514 unhoused individuals stayed at this Center.
MCAA continues to expand.
MCAA recently added a diaper bank, a summer food program, and expanded support for at risk pregnant and new mothers.
Therefore 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the MCCAA for 60 years of service to our Valley.
