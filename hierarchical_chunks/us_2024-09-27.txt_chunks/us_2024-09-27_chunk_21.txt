Ms. DelBENE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank 
Ms. Lois Langer Thompson for nearly 40 years of invaluable service to our public library systems.
Since 2018 Lois has passionately led Sno-Isle Libraries as Executive Director, which provides service to over 800,000 residents across Snohomish and Island counties.
Prior to moving to Washington, she served the Hennepin County Library.
I first met Lois in 2019 at the former Lake Stevens Historical Society and Museum, when she told me about her plans to expand SnoIsle's library system in Lake Stevens with a new, larger library for the community.
Since then, I have had the pleasure of working with her and watching her cultivate a thriving library community in Washington's First Congressional District and beyond.
Under Lois' leadership, Sno-Isle Libraries has embedded equity across the organization, built a capital strategy to connect everyone to their local library, completed three library construction projects in Darrington, Edmonds, and Mill Creek, invested in digital equity, launched a commitment to sustainability, expanded the Foundation Board of Directors, strengthened community collaboration, and supported the formation of the first collective bargaining unit for employees.
Lois also guided the organization through a pandemic, while adopting new services to allow Sno-Isle to continue providing essential resources to our communities.
