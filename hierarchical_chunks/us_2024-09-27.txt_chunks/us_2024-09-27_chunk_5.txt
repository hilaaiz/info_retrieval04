Mr. BOYLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Robert Sunshine on his retirement after 48 years of stellar service to the Congressional Budget Office, the Congress, and the country.
I'd like to take a few minutes to honor this truly exceptional public servant.
Bob's tenure at CBO has been extraordinary, not just for its longevity, but for the outstanding work he has produced and the people he has so deeply affected.
Throughout his distinguished career, he has served as a mentor to countless members of the CBO staff (and to CBO's directors) who have valued his wisdom, work ethic, and experienced perspective.
Bob truly exemplifies the values of dedication and leadership--of upholding CBO's mandate to be objective, impartial, and nonpartisan.
Before coming to CBO, Bob was a senior associate at a transportation consulting firm.
He joined CBO in 1976 when the agency was in its infancy.
His first job was as principal analyst, covering transportation issues in what is now the Natural and Physical Resources Cost Estimates Unit of CBO's Budget Analysis Division.
