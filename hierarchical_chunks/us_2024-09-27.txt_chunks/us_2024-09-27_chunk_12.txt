Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hooksett Lions Club Citizen of the Year Richard ``Turk'' Bairam.
For over 25 years, Turk has been dedicated to supporting Hooksett in any way he can.
He continues to volunteer in his community to make Hooksett an amazing place to live and raise a family.
A lifelong resident of Hooksett, Turk owned and operated his own auto repair shop for 36 years before retiring in 2006.
A former member of the Hooksett Police Commission, Turk currently serves as Sewer Commissioner, Chair of the Central Hooksett Water Precinct, as a member of the Town Recycling and Transfer Committee, and on the Zoning Board In addition to his volunteer work, he has also dedicated his life to his family.
Turk and his wife of 62 years, Mary, have raised their children, grandchildren, and now great grandchildren in Hooksett.
It is because of the hard work and dedication of community leaders like Turk that the Town of Hooksett continues to thrive.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I congratulate Turk for being named the Hooksett Lions Club 2024 Citizen of the Year.
I wish Turk and his family all the best in the years to come as they continue to work to make Hooksett a better place.
