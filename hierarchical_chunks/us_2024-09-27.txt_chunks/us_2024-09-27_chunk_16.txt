Mr. LARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an op-ed by Lisa Rimland for recognizing Tim Colburn's career of courage, compassion, and care for those who are most in need and often forgotten.
I have known Tim Colburn all my life.
We grew up together in a federal housing project called Mayberry Village, named after the legendary Dr. Franklin Mayberry.
We jokingly referred to it as the `Cardboard City.'
Tim was then always caring, compassionate, and competitive--excelling at everything he did.
In sports, he was probably the best all-around athlete in the Village and in the town we grew up in; he especially excelled at track and field, which require individual athleticism.
His love of people, with special attention to the underserved and the underdogs, is legendary.
It was an honor for me to know and count Tim as a true friend.
I stand in awe of his selfless leadership and accomplishments.
He was never concerned about taking credit and always did the right thing because that is how he was raised and what he valued.
Lisa Rimland's op-ed in the Hartford Courant confirms what the world should know about Tim.
They attest to Tim Coburn's contributions to his family, his friends, his community and associations, and the state and Nation he loved.
