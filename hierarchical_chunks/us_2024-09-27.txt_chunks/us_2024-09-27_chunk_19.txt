Mr. Coburn's last one ran through the pandemic and is approaching four under another receiver.
Miraculously, he remained healthy through most of the pandemic.
Few of us can imagine what he and all those responsible for running the homes went through during the pandemic.
But if you visit the homes now, and even more so if you live in the homes, you can see and feel the pandemic's mark, almost as if you were visiting a country where a terrible war was fought: the bodies'of the casualties are gone, but you can feel their presence everywhere.
It is quiet and peaceful, yet with echoes of an unspeakable past, and the words ``God willing'' are appended to every plan.
This is the world that 
Mr. Coburn left, having served the frailest citizens of our state during both peace and metaphoric wartime.
It was in these homes that the most helpless of the pandemic's victims died, and that many of the most courageous of the healthcare workers fought to save as many as they could, and to save themselves.
Many people shun the world of these homes even if they have family members living in them.
This is a tragedy in many ways, because there are lessons to be learned in the homes that cannot be learned from books, lessons for the heart as well as the mind, lessons in compassion and even keys to the mysteries of war and peace.
Eventually, most of us will occupy a bed in one of these homes.
Why wait until then to visit?
If more people embraced the homes with the love, compassion and enthusiasm of 
Mr. Coburn, it would be a better world for all of us, both inside and outside the homes.
If there is one sure lesson that can be learned from the pandemic and the homes, this is it.
