Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize Mushroom House Automotive, a veteran and family-owned business out of Colora, Cecil County, Maryland, as it approaches its 30th anniversary on October 1, 2024.
Originally a mushroom farm operated by the Webb family for over 40 years, the business transitioned into an automotive repair and sales center after being pushed out of the industry.
In 2006, Mushroom House survived a devastating fire that destroyed the shop and several classic cars.
It was rebuilt and reopened only with the support and dedication Today, Mushroom House Automotive continues to serve Cecil County and provide top-notch, honest automotive services under the leadership of Victor ``Butch'' Webb Sr., his son Steven Webb and with the expertise of Archie Singleton II.
Together, they have raised over $300,000 through their vehicle donation program for various non-profit organizations and consistently support the community, including participating in Career Day at Rising Sun Middle School and the CCPS Summer Work Program, where they pair students with local businesses.
Mushroom House Automotive also partners with the Cecil County School of Technology's Automotive program to teach and support the next generation of mechanics and car enthusiasts.
In the last three years, Mushroom House Automotive has placed in the top three of Cecil Whig's Community Choice in Automotive Salesperson-- Used Cars, Auto Repair, Oil Change, Pre-Owned Vehicle Sales and Tires.
In addition, Steven Webb and Archie Singleton II were honored as business leaders and inducted into the National Technical Honor Society, a recognition spearheaded by Scott Coutu, the Automotive Technology instructor at the Cecil County School.
I am proud and grateful to Mushroom House Automotive for its continued service of over 30 years to the community.
Small, familyowned businesses like these constitute the backbone of American economy and provide essential services to local communities.
