Mr. Johnson, the former Chief of Police in Edwards, Mississippi for 39 years, parlayed his love of sports into coaching youth baseball and softball.
He was able to coach while also giving the children in his community a positive role model to follow.
When the number of kids playing baseball started to dwindle, 
Mr. Johnson started coaching basketball, and, at one point he was coaching 6 different teams at the same time.
He has been a great asset to his community, and his work never goes unnoticed.
The Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame will honor Louis Johnson for his lifetime commitment to his community with this award during its annual Hall of Fame Induction Banquet, set for Saturday, July 29, at the Jackson Convention Complex.
