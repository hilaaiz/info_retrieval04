Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the 112th National Day of the Republic of China (Taiwan).
I join all those celebrating this Day, memorializing the beginning of the Wuchang Uprising on October 10, 1911 that led to the collapse of the long-reigning imperial Qing Dynasty and foundation of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912.
Chinese Americans are a vital, valued, and vibrant community not only in my legislative district, but throughout our United States.
I wish them and all observing this occasion, Godspeed, and a safe, happy, and momentous celebration.
