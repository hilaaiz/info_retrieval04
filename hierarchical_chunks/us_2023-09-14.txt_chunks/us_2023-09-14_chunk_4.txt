David was born in the Bronx to a family of strong Polish roots.
Both parents were proud union members and like many Jews of the era, were supporters of progressive politics.
David and his wife, Alice AudieFigueroa, who is also a well-known activist, are longtime members of Shir Tikvah in Troy.
Aimed with a Masters degree from the University of Massachusetts and a PhD from University of Wisconsin, David began his work in labor when he joined Local 3220 in 1977, the union of graduate assistants at University.
After being elected president, David decided that building the labor movement would be his life's work.
Subsequent experience with the Allied Industrial Workers, Michigan State AFL-CIO, and the Metro Detroit AFL-CIO led to David taking a position at AFT Michigan, where he was eventually elected president in 2001.
Since 2004, he has also been the Vice President of the National AFT.
David spent his time as President of AFT Michigan aggressively promoting the ideal that ``K-12 public education is the foundation of our democracy''.
During his tenure, AFT Michigan organized many new locals representing thousands of new members and built deep partnerships with community allies.
Notably, David was one of the cochairs of the Coalition for the Future.
This Coalition's report and legislative work resulted in legislation that saved the future of the Detroit Public Schools.
David is also a cochair of the Metropolitan Affairs Coalition, a group of leaders brought together from business, labor, and the government to the same table to respond to our region's challenges and opportunities.
No matter where he is, David is always working to bring people of all perspectives together to reach common goals that improve our region for all who live here.
