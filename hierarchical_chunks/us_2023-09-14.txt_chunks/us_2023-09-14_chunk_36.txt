Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Consulate of Mexico in Fresno on the 213th Anniversary of the Independence of Mexico and thank them for their significant contributions to the Central Valley.
The Consulate of Mexico in Fresno opened in 1931 to support the needs mission of the consulate is to help Mexican citizens assimilate into the community and advance their rights while residing in California.
For nearly a century, those working in the consulate have been dedicated to that mission, providing invaluable assistance to local immigrants including identification services, health guidance, and educational opportunities.
The consulate connects local immigrants with the services they need to thrive.
Through their Mobile Consulate, which travels to different cities across the Central Valley throughout the year, Mexican immigrants have greater access to the over 30 services the consulate provides.
The consulate is also focused on the educational outcomes of Mexican students.
Last year alone, the consulate, in partnership with other local organizations, granted more than $45,000 in scholarships to 30 college students pursuing careers in public health.
On this day, as we celebrate the independence of the Mexican people, I want to recognize the incredible contributions Mexican immigrants have made to our communities in the Central Valley and across the nation.
As the son of immigrants, I understand first-hand the perseverance, determination, and sacrifice of immigrants who come to the United States in search of greater opportunities.
