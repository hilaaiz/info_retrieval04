Ms. CASTOR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the ten inventors who have been selected as the 2023 Inductees to the Florida Inventors Hall.
To be named as an Inductee, these inventors were nominated by their peers nationwide and have undergone a thorough review by the Florida Inventors Hall.
As a result, their innovations have been identified as significantly impacting the quality of life, economic development, and welfare of their communities, the residents of Florida, and the United States.
The Florida Inventors Hall of Fame was founded in 2013 at the University.
It was recognized by the Florida Senate with Senate Resolution 1756, adopted on April 30, 2014.
Its mission is to encourage individuals of all backgrounds to strive toward the betterment of Florida and society through continuous, groundbreaking innovation by celebrating the incredible scientific work that has been, or is being, accomplished in Florida and by its citizens.
Nomination to the Florida Inventors Hall of Fame is open to all Florida inventors (living or deceased) who are or have been residents the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
The impact of the inventor and his or her invention should be significant to society, and the invention should have been commercialized, utilized, or led to important innovations.
