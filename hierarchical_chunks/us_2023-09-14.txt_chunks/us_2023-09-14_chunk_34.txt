Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the achievements of the Conference of Western Wayne over the last 45 years.
With the support of the CWW, the residents of Western Wayne County have had better response times to emergencies and have had access to a plethora of programs to enhance their daily life.
We thank the CWW for all the support they provide to our Western Wayne communities and hope to see another 45 years of tremendous service to those in need.
