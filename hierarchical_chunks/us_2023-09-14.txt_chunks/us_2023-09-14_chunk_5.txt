Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the lifetime of work David Hecker has contributed to the cause of public education.
Within our state and around the country, children in our public schools have quality educators and better access to resources due in no small part to his tireless efforts.
We are saddened to see him leave, but we know his activism will not stop in ``retirement''.
I thank David for his significant contributions.
