Mr. Speaker, wildlife conservationists put the world first, wildlife first, the future first.
They don't seek a hero's reward, a medal, or a prize.
But they surely deserve it.
Mr. Speaker, I ask today that we recognize the impact Theo Pagel has had on saving species, honor his work and acknowledge American Humane's Kiessling Prize as a way to shine a light on the important work of saving species for future generations to love.
