Mrs. STEEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the passage of the MAHSA Act, which is an important step in holding the Iranian regime accountable for its continued oppression of its own people.
However, we cannot ignore the Biden Administration's latest misstep in handing over $6 billion to Iran.
Longstanding U.S. policy dictates that we do not negotiate with terrorists.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what President Biden did with this payoff, enabling Iran to continue threatening the security of the free world.
I've introduced the bipartisan, bicameral Solidifying Iran Sanctions Act with Foreign Affairs Chairman McCaul.
Our legislation will hold Iran accountable and prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Iran poses a serious threat to global stability and peace.
We need strength--not payoffs and appeasement--to deter future hostility from this rogue regime.
