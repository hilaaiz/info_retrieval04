I thank my hon.
Friend for his excellent work as co-chair of the Labour Growth Group.
I know that he is passionate about how we can use data to boost productivity and improve public services, and he  is working with Wigan council and his local NHS trust to build data-driven tools to better deliver preventive healthcare.
