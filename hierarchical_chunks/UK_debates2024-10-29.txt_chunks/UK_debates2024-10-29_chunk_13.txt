I welcome my hon.
Friend to his place, and he is doing a great job for the people of Lichfield.
This Government are committed to delivering a decade of national renewal and ensuring that growth and prosperity are felt everywhere in our country.
We will work in partnership with businesses and local communities to rejuvenate our high streets, which are the lifeblood of our local communities, including those in Lichfield and Burntwood.
As part of this, we plan to introduce new powers to help fill vacant properties through high street rental auctions.
We know that this is such an important issue for so many of our constituencies.
