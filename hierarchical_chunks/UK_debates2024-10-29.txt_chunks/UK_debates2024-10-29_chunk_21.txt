I thank the Minister for that response.
A key part of the northern powerhouse agenda was investment in our rail infrastructure, and residents in my constituency were excited that Cheadle train station finally got planning approval recently.
However, recent talk of cuts to infrastructure investment has caused concern.
Can the Minister assure us that Cheadle train station is safe and will go ahead?
