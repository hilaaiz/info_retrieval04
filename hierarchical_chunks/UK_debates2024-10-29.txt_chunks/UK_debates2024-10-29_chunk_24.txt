Under the last Government, the Chancellor said that interest rates and gilt yields were driven by Government policy.
Will the Chancellor guarantee that neither will rise higher than they did under the Conservatives?
The last Government crashed the economy with a mini-Budget and sent interest rates and mortgage rates soaring, putting huge pressure on the costs borne by families and businesses.
We will set out our Budget tomorrow, including robust fiscal rules on paying for day-to-day spending through tax receipts and borrowing only to invest, whereas the previous Government borrowed for day-to-day spending, which is why we are in the mess we are in today.
