I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and congratulate her on her great work on the Co-op’s food justice policy.
As she knows, we are right behind her in our commitment to raise living standards across the country.
We made a manifesto commitment to update the remit of the Low Pay Commission so that, for the first time ever, it will take into account the cost of living when making recommendations about the minimum wage.
