I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I note the number of Labour MPs we now have in Somerset and across the south-west of England.
We will set out more detail in the Budget tomorrow, but our commitment to investing in home-grown energy will boost our energy security, create good jobs here in Britain and begin to reduce people’s bills, as will our programme to better insulate homes, which the previous Government failed to do.
