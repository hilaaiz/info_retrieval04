Friend for that question.
I absolutely recognise the important role of the NHS and the health of our nation in getting people back to work and in boosting the economy.
That is why in tomorrow’s Budget we will set out further detail of how we will increase the number of elective appointments per week, delivering one of the Government’s first steps in office to reduce waiting times in the NHS.
