I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
Since taking office, this Government have been working to reset our relationship with our European friends and neighbours.
The Prime Minister recently met the President of the European Commission and agreed to strengthen the UK-EU relationship to address global challenges such as the economic headwinds, geopolitical competition, irregular migration, climate change and energy prices.
Improving our relationships will be good for business and good for consumers.
