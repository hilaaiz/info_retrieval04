We on the Conservative Benches are deeply concerned about all those who will lose their winter fuel payments under Labour.
Some pensioners will keep the winter fuel payment if they claim pension credit, but we know that some will not apply or will have difficulty applying.
Can the Minister confirm how many people the Treasury assumes are eligible for pension credit but will not claim it, therefore losing their winter fuel payment, and what is the Treasury doing to close that gap?
As the hon.
Gentleman will understand, the estimates of how many people might be eligible for pension credit are an imperfect science—they are based on a survey.
Means-testing what is a very complex benefit, as all means-tested benefits are, requires an assessment of not only people’s income but their savings; it is about pensioner household units, too, so it is a complex set of procedures.
All I can say is that I am glad we are targeting support at those most in need, something that was outlined in the 2017 Conservative party manifesto, which stated: “we will means-test Winter Fuel Payments, focusing assistance on the least well-off pensioners, who are most at risk of fuel poverty.”
