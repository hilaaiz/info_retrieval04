During the election campaign, I held a press conference at which I outlined the glaring funding gaps in Labour’s plans and the taxes they might raise to pay for them.
One of those taxes was employer national insurance contributions.
The right  hon.
Member for Bristol North West (Darren Jones) —now Chief Secretary to the Treasury—responded at the time by arguing that this was a list of things that “Labour isn’t doing.”
Is it correct that raising employer national insurance contributions is something Labour isn’t doing?
The right hon.
Member will have to wait for the Budget tomorrow.
She was a Minister not that long ago, so she might still remember that the Budget is the time when such announcements are made.
Let me restate our commitment, so it is crystal clear, that we will protect working people by not increasing national insurance, income tax or VAT.
Might I add, very briefly, that I note the Conservatives suddenly have a new-found interest in the livelihoods of working people?
It is a shame, frankly, that they never prioritised that during their 14 years in office, during which, time and again, they made working people pay for their mistakes.
What steps she is taking to help ensure value for money in public spending.
The Government have launched a multi-year spending review to set out our long-term plans for public spending and to ensure that every pound of taxpayers’ money is spent effectively.
The first phase of the spending review is due to report this week, alongside the Budget, and phase 2 will begin shortly after the Budget.
