I thank my right hon.
Friend for his response.
Recent National Audit Office reports have revealed the extent of the Tories’ economic mismanagement over the past 14 years.
That has put capital projects such as Bingley pool in my constituency at risk.
As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I will ensure that taxpayers’ money delivers value.
Will the Minister assure me and my constituents that tomorrow’s Budget will be based on an honest assessment of the public finances, so that this Government can deliver on their promises?
