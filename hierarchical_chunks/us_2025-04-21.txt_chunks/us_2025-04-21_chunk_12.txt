Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating Destini Houston--not only as Miss Western New York's Teen or the Kindest Kid in America but as a role model, a community leader, and a beacon of hope for the future.
Her impact reaches far beyond titles and trophies.
Miss Houston reminds us all that even the smallest acts of kindness can lead to something truly extraordinary.
Destini's leadership has left an indelible mark on our city, and we are all the better for it.
