Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an extraordinary young leader from Western New York--Miss Destini Houston.
At just 16 years old, Miss Houston is showing us all that leadership, kindness, and advocacy can go hand in hand.
Miss Houston was recently crowned Miss Western New York's Teen, a title she has embraced not for the spotlight but to shine a light on causes close to her heart.
She is now receiving national recognition for her inspiring efforts, and she will be honored as New York's recipient of the Kindest Kid in America award.
To celebrate her achievement, the award organization has created a children's book inspired by Miss Houston's journey.
She will read it to students throughout Western New York in hopes of inspiring a new generation to lead with compassion and purpose.
Miss Houston has said, ``Being kind isn't just about being nice to people--it's about taking action to help others.''
She lives by those words.
From volunteering and mentoring to working with the Buffalo Urban League to organize an informational event for prospective foster and adoptive families, she is a true changemaker in her community.
In addition to her advocacy, Miss Houston is also a competitive dancer training in multiple styles and performing at high-level competitions.
Her dedication to dance has helped build the discipline and confidence that now serve her well as she prepares to compete in the Miss New York pageant.
