Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleague Congressman Ro Khanna to recognize Fremont Firefighter Anthony Ganzler, on the occasion of his passing on March 17, 2025, at the age of 42.
Anthony joined the Fremont Fire Department in 2019, serving on the Department's Special Operations Task Force.
Prior to joining the Fremont Fire Department, Anthony worked at the El Dorado County Fire Protection District as a Firefighter/Emergency Medical Technician from 2015 to 2019.
Predating his time as a firefighter, Anthony served in the United States Army's 173rd Airborne Division for more than eight years.
Throughout his service he was stationed in Hawaii, Alaska, and a number Anthony was one of many firefighters in the department who raised awareness about men's health issues during the month of November each year.
His enthusiastic support for the campaign titled ``Movember'' is apparent in his most recent fire department photo, which now memorializes his notorious sense of humor.
Anthony was known as a lion of a man with a big heart and warm personality.
He will always be remembered as a kind and selfless individual who dedicated his life to serving others.
Our communities will miss his presence deeply.
He had a deep devotion to public service and his passing is an immeasurable loss for everyone around him, including his colleagues at the Fremont Fire Department.
We send our deepest condolences to Anthony's wife, Erin, and his two daughters, Savannah and Abigail, as well as his other surviving family, friends, and fellow firefighters who were lucky to have Anthony in their lives.
