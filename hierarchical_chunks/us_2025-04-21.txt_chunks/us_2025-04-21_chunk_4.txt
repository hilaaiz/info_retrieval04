Mr. Speaker, as we acknowledge this milestone, let us recognize the essential role that Asia Food Market plays--not just as a business, but as a beacon of cultural exchange, economic growth, and community spirit.
Please join me in applauding the achievements and continued success of both Asia Food Market and the Asia Center Mall, as they remain an enduring source of pride and connection for generations to come.
