Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Danielle Roberts, a cause-driven leader whose unwavering passion and commitment to community have made a profound impact throughout Western New York.
In her role as Vice President of Community Impact, 
Ms. Roberts oversees YMCA Buffalo Niagara's association-wide fundraising and outreach initiatives and leads major community programs, including the iconic YMCA Turkey Trot--the oldest consecutively run footrace in the world.
She also played a key leadership role in the YMCA's Capital Campaign to construct a new 65,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility that will expand access to health and wellness resources for everyone in Western New York to enjoy.
A staunch advocate for equity, 
Ms. Roberts has worked to close racial disparities in swim instruction and water safety, particularly among African-American teens, who face significantly higher risks of drowning due to a lack of access.
Under her guidance, the William-Emslie YMCA and its partners are building pathways for competitive swimming and promoting safety education in historically underserved communities.
Beyond her YMCA work, 
Ms. Roberts serves as a national trainer for YUSA, specializing in diversity and cultural lens training.
Her extensive background includes experience in banking, treasury management, education, public speaking, grant writing, and the performing arts.
She is also the Executive Director of Entertaining Angels Productions, a faith-based arts organization, and a classically trained dancer.
Earlier in her career, she proudly performed as a professional NFL cheerleader with the Buffalo Bills as a Buffalo Jill.
