Mr. Speaker, Dr. Candace Johnson's recognition as the Boy Scouts of America's Distinguished Citizen is a well-deserved tribute to her outstanding contributions to both the Western New York community and the world.
Her leadership continues to inspire us all to live by the values of citizenship, community service, and integrity, and to make a meaningful impact wherever we can.
Her example serves as a beacon of what it means to be a distinguished citizen and a leader who embodies the very best of what we can achieve for the greater good and we are all the better for it.
