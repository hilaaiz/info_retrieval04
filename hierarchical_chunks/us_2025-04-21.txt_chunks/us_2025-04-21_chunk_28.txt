not an exaggeration to say that our democracy depends on people like Mike Cole--working behind the scenes to get the story right, to ask hard questions, and to speak truth to power.
So, on behalf of the people of the Second Congressional District of Massachusetts and the United States Congress--I thank Mike for his dedication, his professionalism, his integrity, and his decades of service to the people.
We're all better off because of his work to shine the light of truth on the stories that matter--and to hold accountable those we entrust to lead our communities, our commonwealth, and our country.
