Mr. Speaker, Danielle Robert's extraordinary service and leadership to the people of Western New York continues to inspire us all to live by the values of citizenship, community service, and integrity, and to make a meaningful impact wherever we can.
Her example serves as a beacon of what it means to be a good neighbor in the ``City of Good Neighbors'' and a leader who embodies the very best of what we can achieve for the greater good, and we are all the better for it.
