Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a foundational institution in Western New York's spiritual and civil life, the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church of Buffalo, NY and its dedicated pastor, Reverend Paul J. Thomas.
Founded in 1831, Bethel AME Church stands as the oldest AfricanAmerican congregation in Western New York.
For nearly two centuries, Bethel has been a cornerstone of strength, faith, and leadership in Buffalo, nurturing generations, advancing social justice, and offering an unwavering commitment to the community it serves.
It is a place where history and hope walk hand in hand, where the spirit of unity and progress has never wavered.
Under the leadership of Reverend Paul J, Thomas, Bethel AME continues to thrive.
Reverend Thomas brings a wealth of knowledge, compassion, and a vision to his ministry.
A graduate of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania and Turner Theological Seminary, he combines his training with a heart for education and outreach, holding a master's degree in Special Education as well.
His leadership has deepened the church's mission, strengthened its outreach, and reaffirmed its role as a spiritual and cultural anchor in Buffalo.
As we welcome visitors from across New York State and the greater First Episcopal District, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, New England, and Bermuda, to the 29th Session of the Western New York Conference, hosted by Bethel AME, we are reminded of the power of faith to bring people together and to move communities forward.
Reverend Thomas and the entire Bethel AME family represent the very best of the City.
Their work uplifts lives, unites neighborhoods, and strengthens the bonds that hold our community together.
