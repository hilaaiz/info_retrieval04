Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor someone who's spent his life making sure the rest of us stay informed--not by standing in front of a camera, but by quietly, tirelessly, and professionally working behind it for over four decades.
Even though you don't see his face on TV, Mike Cole is a cornerstone He got his start at WHDH before moving to FOX 25--eventually landing at WCVB in 2003.
But the values he's carried from newsroom to newsroom haven't changed: Fairness, transparency, accountability, and truth.
For the past 28 years, Mike has been a force of nature at WCVB, producing NewsCenter 5 and the Sunday morning political program On the Record.
It's the most-watched political talk show in New England--and for good reason.
It's thoughtful, fair, and tough.
And Mike is one of the main reasons why: Chasing down stories, booking guests, doublechecking facts, and putting together a show that keeps viewers informed and engaged.
He has an uncanny ability to know which questions will break news and get people talking.
I've had the privilege of going On the Record many times over the years, and I can tell you that Mike is the real deal.
He cares deeply about getting clear, concise, accurate information on the air.
And that kind of public service is beyond invaluable.
