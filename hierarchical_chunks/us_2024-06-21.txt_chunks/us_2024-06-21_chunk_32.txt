Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the late Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson, a World War II Tuskegee Airman and one of Michigan's most decorated pilots as we prepare to dedicate a community gathering space in his honor.
Born in Detroit, he was the descendant of formerly enslaved people and would go on to become a Black trailblazer.
One of the original Tuskegee Airmen, the U.S. Army's first Black Air Corps, Jefferson served as a P-51 fighter pilot with the Red Tail, 332nd Fighter Group 301st Fighter Squadron in Ramitelli, Italy.
His unit bravely escorted bombers into action, providing critical protection from enemy aircraft and without losing a single plane.
Jefferson was captured as a prisoner of war on August 12, 1944, three days before the invasion of Southern France, after he was shot down while firing at German radar stations on the coast.
Presumed dead, he was held for more than nine months.
He was liberated by U.S. Forces on April 29, 1945.
Following the war, Jefferson dedicated himself to education as an instrument instructor in advanced flight training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in Alabama, continuing the storied Air Corps' legacy of excellence in flight.
He was discharged from active duty in 1947 and retired from the reserves in 1969.
In his civilian life, Jefferson worked as an elementary school science teacher in Detroit, where he would retire as an assistant principal in 1979.
He has received numerous awards and accolades for his bravery and his selfless service for our country, including the Purple Heart Award.
He represented the best.
As we celebrate the dedication of the plaza in his honor, we offer our thanks for the service and legacy of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jefferson.
