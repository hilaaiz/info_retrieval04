Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the outstanding accomplishments of Afton Elementary School's Environmental Protection Club, also known as the Green Team, which is a group of teachers and students in the Pennsbury School District whose hard work and dedication has garnered them well-deserved recognition both statewide and nationally.
I am proud to announce the Green Team has secured first place in the state of Pennsylvania for their outstanding contributions to the environmental protection services and has been recognized as a runnerup in the nation.
This remarkable achievement is a testament to the passion, hard work, and commitment of the members and the following Advisors of the Green Team.
