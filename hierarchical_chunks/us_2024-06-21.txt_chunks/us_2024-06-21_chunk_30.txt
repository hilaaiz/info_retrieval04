Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent of my district, Middletown Township Police Officer Nelson Webb, who is retiring on June 28, 2024, after 36 years Pennsylvania.
Nelson began his career in policing on June 24, 1990, as a Penndel Borough Police Officer.
After six years with the Penndel Borough Police Department, he joined the Middletown Township Police Department on June 24, 1996.
During his distinguished career, he has received several department commendations for outstanding work.
In addition, Nelson has served as a field training officer, a motorcycle patrol officer, and served for 20 years on the Bucks County South Central Special Emergency Response (SWAT) team.
Beyond his accomplishments, Officer Webb embodies the essence of a devoted public servant.
Modest and humble, he avoids the spotlight, preferring to lead through actions and example rather than words.
His exemplary conduct serves as an inspiration to his colleagues, earning him respect as a true leader and mentor among his peers.
In every sense, Officer Nelson Webb epitomizes the true law enforcement professional--a person of integrity, dedication, and great work ethic.
I wish to congratulate Nelson Webb on his 36 years of service to the citizens of Bucks County and on his well-deserved retirement from the Middletown Township Police Department.
