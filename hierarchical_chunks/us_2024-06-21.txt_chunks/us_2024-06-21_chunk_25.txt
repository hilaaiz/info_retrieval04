Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a profound sense of admiration and gratitude to recognize an exceptional constituent from my district, Detective Martin McDonough of the Bucks County Police Department who is retiring after over three decades of unwavering dedication to the wellbeing of citizens in the community.
Martin is a native of Holland, Pennsylvania.
In addition to his studies at Spring Garden College and Temple University, his commitment to professional growth led him to achieve a remarkable milestone in 2015 when he graduated from the prestigious FBI National Academy.
This achievement not only showcased his relentless pursuit of excellence but also underscored his resolve for helping others.
Detective McDonough eventually settled in Jamison, where he and his wife of nearly forty years, Joanne, still live today.
