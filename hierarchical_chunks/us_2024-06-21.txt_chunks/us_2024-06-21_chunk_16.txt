Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Veterans Legal Support Act of 2024, which would allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide support to law school clinical programs that provide pro bono legal and support services to veterans, including assistance with disability claims and foreclosures.
There are at least 22 law schools that have clinics devoted to veterans' legal needs, including the William & Mary Law School Veterans Benefits Clinic, which was the first recipient of a ``best practice'' certification from the VA.
There are many other law schools, such as the University of the District of Columbia's David A. Clarke School of Law, that are interested in starting their own VA-certified clinics.
More needs to be done to sustain and increase the number of these programs.
I was a tenured professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and continued to teach a seminar there after being elected to Congress.
I saw the expert assistance that clinical programs provide their clients.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill, a concrete measure that would assist our veterans, who put their lives on the line for this country.
