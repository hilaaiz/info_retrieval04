Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Willow Street Fire Company in Willow Street, Pennsylvania on 100 years of service to the community.
The Willow Street Fire Company was founded in June 1924 by volunteers that recognized the need to provide fire and emergency services to their community.
Today, the company's 40-person membership remains 100 percent volunteer-based, a reflection of their dedication to the wellbeing of the community.
You never know when you might need emergency services, but you are always thankful they are there when you need them.
These heroes risk their lives in dangerous situations for people they likely do not know.
This kind of selflessness is beyond admirable.
Willow Street Fire Company responds to almost 500 calls every year and services West Lampeter Township and Providence Township.
They also provide mutual aid to surrounding townships.
For 100 years, Willow Street Fire Company emergency and rescue service volunteers have demonstrated what it means to be a good neighbor.
I thank them for the heroism and bravery they demonstrate daily.
Congratulations to Willow Street Fire Company.
I wish them a happy 100th anniversary.
