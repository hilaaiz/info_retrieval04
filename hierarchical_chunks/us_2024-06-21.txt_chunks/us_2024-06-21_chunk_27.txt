Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Fire Captain Jon Drennon for his twenty-five years of service with the Dearborn Fire Department in Michigan's 12th District Strong.
Fire Captain Drennon got his start in public service in 1999 as a Firefighter.
After only one year of service, he received the first of many Meritorious Company Commendations.
In addition, he has been recognized numerous times for valor and lifesaving.
Over the course of his public service career, Fire Captain Drennon has committed himself to continuous professional development, completing numerous certification and educational programs in various rescue operations techniques and other technical programming.
Fire Captain Drennon has been an outstanding public servant to the communities served by the Dearborn Fire Department.
Please join me in recognizing his twenty-five years of commitment to protecting our families' safety across Michigan's 12th District Strong as we wish him well in his retirement.
