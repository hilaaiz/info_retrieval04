Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Bryson DeChambeau on his second career 2024 U.S. Open Golf Championship win.
This achievement not only exemplifies his impressive skill and dedication to the sport, but also reminds us of his journey from the Central Valley of California to the pinnacle of professional golf.
Originally born in Modesto, California, Bryson attended Clovis East High School, where his passion and innate talent for golf quickly became apparent.
His first major golf moment arrived in 2010 when at age sixteen, he secured the California State Junior Championship.
Five years later in 2015 as a Southern Methodist University Mustang, Bryson's hard work led to winning the NCAA Individual Championship, along with the United States Amateur Championship.
These dual wins propelled Bryson forward, becoming one of only five golfers to ever hold both titles in the same year and launching him into the professional ranks in 2016 at the age of twenty two.
Unorthodox but confident in his approach, Bryson has reimagined golf using irons and wedges that are all the same length.
This unique innovation, characteristic of the Central Valley's dynamic style, inspires future athletes to push boundaries as they see the U.S. Open Champion with nine career victories still finding new ways to excel in a game steeped in tradition.
