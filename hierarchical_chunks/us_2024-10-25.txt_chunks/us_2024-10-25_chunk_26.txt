Mr. CASTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Metra Commuter Railroad on its 40th anniversary of providing reliable, affordable, and safe transportation services throughout the state and for residents of Illinois' 6th Congressional District.
In the last forty years, Metra has made significant progress revitalizing and rebuilding stations, tracks, and signals, purchasing new locomotives and railcars, and modernizing and stabilizing and expanding services across the region.
Metra also provided a crucial lifeline during the global pandemic.
I commend Metra on these advancements and was proud to lead the Illinois Delegation's support efforts for its recent Federal Transit Administration's Rail Vehicle Replacement Program grant application.
Metra was selected as one of only three recipients nationwide to receive a grant.
This $100 million federal investment will support the procurement of new, multi-level railcars to replace those from the 1970s and improve the safety, comfort, and accessibility to all passengers boarding Metra trains.
