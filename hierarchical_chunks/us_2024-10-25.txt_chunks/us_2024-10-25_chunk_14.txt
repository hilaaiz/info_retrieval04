Mr. Speaker, as we honor David Jakubaszek today, let us remember him not only for his outstanding service, but also for the values he instilled in each of us--values of compassion, dedication, and the importance of lifting one another up.
While he may no longer be with us in body, his spirit lives on in the community he cherished so deeply.
