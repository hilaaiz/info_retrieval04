Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, along with the people.
Louis, I rise today to honor and recognize the esteemed Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., particularly the members of the St. Louis Alumnae Chapter and the Saint Louis Metropolitan Alumnae Chapter, on the occasion of Delta Day, celebrated on October 18, 2024, in the City.
Louis.
Founded in 1913 at Howard University by 22 courageous collegiate women, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. has been a beacon of social justice, leadership, and public service.
The Founders' first public act--marching alongside the suffragettes to achieve voting rights for women--set the tone for more than a century of advocacy and action.
Today, the sorority continues to be a transformative force in communities across the globe, guided by the powerful theme:
Forward With Fortitude: Engaging Our Sisterhood, Empowering Our Communities, Elevating Our Impact.
The St. Louis Alumnae Chapter and Saint Louis Metropolitan Alumnae Chapter have proudly embodied the sorority's mission of service and advocacy in our region.
Their dedication to public service has improved countless lives in St. Louis, as they have stood in the vanguard of social, educational, and economic justice.
Whether it is through mentorship programs, voter engagement initiatives, or charitable efforts, Deltas are at the heart of helping to make our communities stronger.
On this Delta Day, we recognize our remarkable Deltas for their tireless efforts and lasting contributions.
As they gather together, we honor their ongoing work to safeguard the legacy of those who came before them and to build a better future for those who will follow.
On behalf of Missouri's First District, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. and in recognition of October 18, 2024, as Delta Day in the City.
Louis.
May we continue to support and uplift each and every member and the communities they so passionately serve.
