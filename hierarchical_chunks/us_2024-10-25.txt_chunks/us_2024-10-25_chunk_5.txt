Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Smith County Medical Society Alliance, an organization that has strengthened, supported, and served medical families in and around Tyler, Texas, since 1934.
Their dedication to nurturing and encouraging a healthy community has not been overlooked.
Over the years, the SCMS Alliance has provided countless educational and supportive opportunities, events, and projects for the citizens of Smith County.
The SCMS Alliance has distributed over $1 million in medical student scholarships to students at Tyler Junior College, the University of Texas at Tyler, and UT Tyler School.
Their Junior Health Ambassadors project focuses on providing physician children with ways they can serve Smith County.
The Youth Leadership Council aims to develop leadership skills among local high school students.
The SCMS Alliance has also collaborated with TMAA to sponsor book vending machines at elementary schools.
Members of the SCMS Alliance are primarily spouses of active and retired physicians, as well as physicians themselves.
Physicians and their spouses make significant sacrifices to serve and care for others, and it is a privilege to honor their selflessness.
These members use their time impactfully to serve Smith County, offering their support to doctors and doctors' families.
And for that, I am once again proud to be an East Texan, where people put others before themselves.
I would like to thank President Renee Wright, the SCMS Alliance Board, and all the members of the Smith County Medical Society Alliance for their outstanding work over the years.
I am delighted to congratulate the Alliance on 90 years of service to Smith County.
