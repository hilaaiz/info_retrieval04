Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding academic accomplishments of a constituent from my district, Hayden Joseph Kang.
Hayden is a Senior at Council Rock High School South who regularly demonstrates a commitment to academic excellence, with this dedication culminating in him achieving a perfect score of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) on November 4, 2023.
Hayden demonstrated a proficiency in reading comprehension, including information and ideas, craft and structure, and expression of ideas, and mathematics, including a remarkable understanding of advanced mathematics, problemsolving and data analysis, algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
Hayden's performance on the SAT should serve as a testament to his intelligence and motivation.
I am encouraged by his motivation to perform incredibly in his academic career, and I am proud to represent such a remarkable student in my district.
It is my hope that, by Hayden's example, students throughout my district and throughout the country are encouraged to challenge themselves academically, and endeavor to strive for excellence in every facet of their lives.
Moreover, the example provided by young people, like Hayden, should serve as an inspiration to challenge ourselves and strive for excellence in every facet of our lives.
I would like to wish Hayden the best in his future endeavors, both academically and professionally, and once again congratulate him on his incredible performance on the SAT.
