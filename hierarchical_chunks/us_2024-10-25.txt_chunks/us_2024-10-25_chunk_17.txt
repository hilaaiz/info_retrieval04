Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent constituents like Mary.
Her friends and family remarked that Mary had an infectious love for life and emulated devotion to her community.
She was a beloved teacher and community leader, and we can take solace in the knowledge that she has left a legacy through each and every one of her students and the countless individuals who knew her.
She is survived by generations of cousins including Mary ``Betsy'' Clarke, Heather Anderson, and Adam Clarke and their respective families.
Mary is also survived by her neighbor, David Bonneville.
I request that my colleagues honor Mary's life of service.
