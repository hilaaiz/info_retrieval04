Moss, they reached inside and pulled out two young children--a 7-yearold and a 9-year-old.
Just moments after they rescued those precious kids, flames erupted from the window.
I thank Officers Michael Stephenson and Ashton Moss, for their bravery, speed, and dedication.
Their actions embody the true spirit of Southeast Texas--courage, selflessness, and a deep commitment to protecting others.
It is an honor to represent them in Congress, and their heroism sets an example for us all.
