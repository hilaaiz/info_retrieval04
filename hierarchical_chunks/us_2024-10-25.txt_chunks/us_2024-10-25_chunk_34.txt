Mr. Speaker, it is through the work of people like Amy that our communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger.
Her efforts remind us of the power in making a positive difference in the lives of children and families in need.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, I extend my deepest gratitude to Amy for her extraordinary service.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose leadership and spirit of service will inspire generations to come.
May her example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to make our communities, country, and world a better place.
