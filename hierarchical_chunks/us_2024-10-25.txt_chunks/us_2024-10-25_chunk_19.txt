Mr. ADERHOLT.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the Republic Day of Kazakhstan, commemorating Kazakhstan's declaration of sovereignty on October 25, 1990.
This pivotal moment paved the way for Kazakhstan's eventual independence from the Soviet Union and symbolizes the nation's enduring commitment to self-determination, prosperity, and peace.
Kazakhstan's early alignment with the West has significantly influenced its development.
Over the past three decades, Kazakhstan has transformed into a thriving nation with a strong economy, a growing international presence, and a robust partnership with the United States.
The relationship between Kazakhstan and the United States is rooted in the shared values of democracy, economic growth, and mutual respect.
As we celebrate Kazakhstan's achievements, we reaffirm our commitment to working together in addressing global challenges and promoting peace, security, and economic development.
Kazakhstan continues to be a pillar of stability in Central Asia, emerging as a global leader in nuclear nonproliferation, peacekeeping, and fostering regional cooperation.
As a net contributor to peace and security not only in the region, but also globally, Kazakhstan is committed to addressing global challenges and promoting international stability.
As a religiously diverse country, it serves as a case study of peaceful coexistence.
Kazakhstan hosts the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, which has become an important venue for fostering dialogue among various faiths and serves as a unique platform for interfaith and intercultural cooperation.
At a tumultuous time in the world, this event serves as an important opportunity for faith leaders to work to promote and protect freedom of religious expression and worship in Kazakhstan and in all nations.
President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's commitment to political and societal reforms is commendable.
Despite external pressures, Kazakhstan has remained a peaceful and stabilizing force in Central Asia, exemplifying its dedication to democracy and Western ideals.
Kazakhstan remains a reliable and trusted partner of the United States, particularly as an active member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
This long-standing partnership highlights the importance of advancing efforts to establish Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR), ensuring that Kazakhstan's economic growth is fully acknowledged and supported within the global marketplace.
As we look to the future, the United States and Kazakhstan are poised to deepen their partnership through continued dialogue, trade, and collaboration on shared goals.
Together, we are committed to fostering peace, security, and prosperity, not only in Central Asia but on the global stage.
