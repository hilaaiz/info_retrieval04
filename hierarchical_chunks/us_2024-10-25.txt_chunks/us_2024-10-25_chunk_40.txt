He was honorably discharged in 1946.
In 1954, Russell married Ginger McDaniel, and together they built a loving family, raising two sons and a daughter, along with a growing number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Russell's professional career spanned over three decades with Montgomery Ward, where he made significant contributions throughout the Midwest.
His commitment to community service was unwavering; he actively participated in local Chambers of Commerce and Merchants Associations.
In Flint, Michigan, where he spent his later career, Russell left an indelible mark on the community.
Notably, he served as Chairman of a committee that collaborated with then-Mayor Jim Rutherford to plan the inaugural Crim Race in Flint.
Additionally, he dedicated six years to the Whaley Board for Children and served on the board of the YMCA.
As a devoted member.
Paul's Episcopal Church in Flint, Russell held the position of Vestry member and worked alongside First Presbyterian Church and Court Street United Methodist Church to establish the Ministry.
This initiative addressed the needs of the local community by providing clothing, food, and referral services.
Throughout his remarkable century-long life, Russell Matar has exemplified the core values of family, community, and service.
His legacy of steadfast support and commitment to those around him truly sets him apart.
