Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary individual from Pennsylvania's First Congressional District--someone who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to both our community and our country.
It is with great respect and admiration that I recognize Valerie Hamilton, one of our district's distinguished Hometown Heroes.
Hometown Heroes are not defined by titles or accolades, but by the quiet power of their actions.
They are distinguished by their unwavering integrity, the strength of their character, and their steadfast commitment to the people and places they serve.
They are the foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others up, inspire hope, and in doing so, call us all to higher standards of service and compassion.
Valerie Hamilton has embodied this spirit in ways that words can scarcely capture.
Since 2012, Valerie--owner, founder, and executive director of Children of God Educational Services--has been a driving force in transforming early education and childcare in Bristol Borough.
With a relentless focus on strengthening family bonds and immersing children in rich, local experiences, Valerie has built more than a childcare service--she has cultivated a foundation for lifelong success.
Every day, Valerie and her devoted team go above and beyond to provide children with the skills, opportunities, and confidence they need to thrive.
Through her carefully crafted Preschool, After School, and Summer Camp programs, she not only enriches young minds but also offers critical support to working parents, empowering families to succeed.
Valerie's mission is rooted in more than education--she shapes character, instilling integrity, compassion, and a deep sense of community in every child she serves.
Her unwavering commitment to highquality care and her ability to inspire and uplift have left a lasting mark on countless children and families.
Her work is not just childcare; it is a beacon of hope, opportunity, and purpose, changing lives and building a stronger future for our community.
It is through the work of people like Valerie Hamilton that our communities thrive and our Nation grows stronger.
Her service, given without expectation of recognition, stands as a testament to the belief that one individual's dedication can ripple through the lives of many, sparking change, fostering resilience, and inspiring hope.
Today, we honor Valerie Hamilton not just for her remarkable deeds but for who she is--a true hero in every sense of the word.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, I extend my deepest gratitude to Valerie Hamilton for her extraordinary service.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose leadership
