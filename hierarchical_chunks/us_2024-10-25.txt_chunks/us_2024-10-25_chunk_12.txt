Mr. Jakubaszek's journey began in the City of North Tonawanda, where he grew up and cultivated a love for his community that would guide him throughout his life.
After pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Pennsylvania, he was commissioned into the U.S. Army--a testament to his commitment to service.
It was during this time that he met the love of his life, Jean, and together they built a family that included their four cherished children:
Jennifer, Michael, Thomas, and Joseph.
