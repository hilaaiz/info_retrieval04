Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary public servant, Chief J. Scott Bendig, on the occasion of his retirement from the Montgomery Township Police Department after 35 years of dedicated service to the Montgomery Township community and the field of law enforcement.
Chief Bendig was born and raised in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

He then pursued higher education, earning a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Temple University followed by his completion of the Pennsylvania State Police Academy.
Chief Bendig's passion for law enforcement was matched by his commitment to continuous learning, as evidenced by his earning a Master's Degree in Criminal Justice from West Chester University and his graduation from the prestigious FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
These experiences further solidified his credentials as a leader in public safety.
Chief Bendig dedicated his entire 35-year career in law enforcement to the residents.
During his tenure, he rose through the ranks, starting as a Recruit Patrol Officer in 1989 before serving as a Canine Officer and Unit Supervisor, Corporal in 2000, Sergeant in 2001, and eventually Deputy Chief in 2010.

These teaching roles highlight his dedication to nurturing the next generation of law enforcement professionals.
Under Chief Bendig's leadership, the Montgomery Township Police Department experienced significant advancements in both its operational capabilities and technology infrastructure.
One of his most impactful initiatives was the implementation of the Body Worn Camera system, a crucial tool for promoting transparency and accountability.
He also led the deployment of Fixed License Plate Readers, which enhanced the department's ability to monitor and respond to criminal activity more effectively.
Chief Bendig's leadership extended far beyond the borders of Montgomery Township.
