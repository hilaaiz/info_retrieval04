I join the Leader of the House in congratulating the Deputy Speakers on their birthdays, and in celebrating our armed forces.
Earlier this year, when the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions announced the welfare reforms, her argument to this House was that they were all about getting people back into work.
That argument was  undermined somewhat by the timing; in the spring statement the following week, we discovered that the £5 billion saving we achieve from the welfare reforms makes up fully half of the fiscal headroom that the Chancellor is relying on.
When we take a closer look at the reforms, we find that most of the savings are generated by changes to the eligibility criteria for the personal independence payment.
Entitlement to PIP is given to those in work, those out of work and those unable to work.
It follows that many of those who stand to lose out as a result of the reforms will not be incentivised into work, because they will already be in work, or will be unable to join the workforce any time soon.
No wonder, then, that when the Bill was published last week, there was condemnation from all sides of the House.
If the books need to be balanced, we need to make sure that they are not balanced on the backs of the disabled.
The Leader of the House will be well aware of all the rumours circulating around this place that the Government are preparing to make concessions on the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill.
What is the procedure for doing that?
We understand that a reasoned amendment, if one is tabled, would kill the Bill off entirely.
What are the options for the Government to make concessions?
Will they have to withdraw the Bill and re-present it, or is there some other mechanism by which they can make compromises with their Back Benchers before next week?
