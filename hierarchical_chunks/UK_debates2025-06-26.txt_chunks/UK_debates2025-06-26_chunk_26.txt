Following the successful seven-year experiment on estimates day debates, the Chairs of the Procedure and Liaison Committees, the hon.
Members for Lancaster and Wyre (Cat Smith) and for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier), met me yesterday, and we agreed that we would bring forward proposals for changes to the Standing Orders, which I am sure the Leader of the House will look favourably on.
In addition to the business that the Leader of the House has announced, there will be a debate on  Thursday 10 July  in the Chamber on the attainment and engagement of boys in education, followed by a debate on children’s health.
In Westminster Hall, there will be a debate on regulatory powers over billing of energy supply to businesses on  Tuesday 1 July , and debates on the future of music education and on safeguarding children with allergies at school on  Thursday 3 July .
There will be a debate on alcohol and cancer on  Tuesday 8 July , and debates on state support for victims of terrorism and on London’s contribution to the national economy on  Thursday 10 July .
Tomorrow, across India, the annual Ratha Yatra festival will take place.
In Ahmedabad, the Rath Yatra festival has been held since 1878, and there is a procession through the streets of the deities that Hindus worship.
In Harrow, we will celebrate on Sunday, when the annual procession will take place.
This year, it will be between Stanmore temple and Kenton temple—a seven-mile route, in 31° heat, taking about four hours to complete.
The good news, of course, is that it is downhill this year, and not the uphill route from Kenton to Stanmore.
Will the Leader of the House join me in wishing all Hindus celebrating this most important festival Jai Swaminarayan, Jai Shri Krishna and, indeed, Jai Jagannath?
