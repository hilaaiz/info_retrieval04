I welcome the extension of the £3 fare cap and the new powers enabling local authorities to deliver bus services that local residents need.
In my constituency of Watford, the recruitment of bus engineers to keep services running remains a major problem.
What are this Labour Government doing to work coherently with the sector to meet that need?
