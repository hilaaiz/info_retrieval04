The Minister may be aware that the outline business case for improvements to the A31 at Hickley’s Corner in Farnham   will come before her in a couple of months’ time.
While I understand that she cannot make any promises now, will she at least agree to look kindly on that application and meet me to discuss it?
I look forward to seeing that business case when it comes forward, and I will of course be happy to discuss it with the hon.
Member at the appropriate time.
