I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important matter during Armed Forces Week.
I am really sorry to hear that there has not been a response forthcoming.
She is absolutely right to raise the issue of the mental health trauma suffered by many of our veterans, and the need to do more to support them in the community.
I will make sure that a response is forthcoming.
