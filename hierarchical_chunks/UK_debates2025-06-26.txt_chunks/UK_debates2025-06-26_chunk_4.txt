The Secretary of State clearly has not listened to Logistics UK—I hope that at least she knows where the lower Thames crossing starts and ends.
Let us turn to another foundational industry to transport and growth: fuel.
Elizabeth de Jong, chief executive of Fuels Industry UK said about this week’s industrial strategy: “we are disappointed not to be named explicitly as a ‘foundational industry’ today, given the vital role of the fuels sector in enabling growth”.
Why has our transport-critical fuels sector also been left behind by the Government?
This Government’s industrial strategy sets out the sectors that have the potential to deliver economic growth and for which are competing internationally for mobile capital investment.
My colleague the Minister for the Future of Roads and I meet repeatedly with the industry, be that to discuss fuels or freight and logistics.
We are determined to get our economy firing on all cylinders, and we know what critical role the sectors he talks about play in that.
