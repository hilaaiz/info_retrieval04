To achieve growth, businesses rely on our world-class logistics and haulage sector.
Given that Logistics UK said that it was “disappointed” that the logistics sector had not been identified as one of the foundational industries in the  industrial strategy this week, what happened?
Did the Department for Transport go into bat for our logistics sector?
Did it lose the row?
Or did it not bother?
What will the Secretary of State be doing to ensure that our logistics sector is seen across Government as foundational to any growth mission?
It is my understanding that the logistics sector was pleased to be recognised as a case study in the industrial strategy.
I know that it welcomed the announcement in the spending review of £590 million to progress the lower Thames crossing, which is a key strategic freight route.
For many years the sector has been talking to us about improving the route from the south-east to the midlands and the north.
Unlike the previous Government, this Government are finally getting on with the job.
We have taken the planning decision to grant consent to the crossing and are making money available through the spending review to improve the country’s critical freight routes.
