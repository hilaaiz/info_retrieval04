Mr. MURPHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to formally commend Dr. Robert Whitmore of New Bern, North Carolina for more than 40 years of service as a physician and his exemplary record of service.
He has attended to our Eastern North Carolina community and our Nation honorably.
His reputation and accolades for patient experience are a testament to the great care and expertise he has consistently provided throughout his career.
As a urologist myself, I understand that providing top quality medical care is more than simply treating a disease but taking the time to listen to patient concerns and answering their questions.
His standing in our community as a caring doctor, who personally follows up with patients, shows his commitment to the profession and his great character.
Furthermore, his CarolinaEast Beacon of Service Award attests to his expertise and ability to touch the lives of so many others.
I would be remiss if I failed to say thank you for Dr. Whitmore's service to our Country as a staff urologist in the U.S. Army.
Military doctors endure so much, and it takes a special person to do the job.
Dr. Whitmore is a true servant-leader with a heart for others and is revered among America's heroes.
