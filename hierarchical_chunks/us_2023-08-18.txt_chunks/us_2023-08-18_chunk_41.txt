Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing the life and legacy of 
Senator John L. Scott, Jr.
Senator Scott embodied the Biblical teaching to ``Be devoted to one another in love.
Honor one another above yourselves,'' and as such devoted his life to improving the welfare of every South Carolinian.
He will be sorely missed and well remembered.
