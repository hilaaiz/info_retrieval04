Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Joan Kaplan Davidson, a philanthropist and champion of conservation in New York State who recently passed away at the age of 96.
Joan spent her life advocating for the restoration and conservation served as the leader of the J.M. Kaplan Fund, as the New York State Commissioner of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, and gave her time to countless non-profit boards and committees.
I had the pleasure of working alongside her to designate the Hudson River as New York's first Heritage River and to work to advance numerous local waterfront development plans and historic preservation projects.
Joan chose to make a profound impact through the power of small, decisive actions, and her work has inspired me and countless others.
