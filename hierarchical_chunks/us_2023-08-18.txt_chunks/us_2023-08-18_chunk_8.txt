I would like to thank Senior Trooper Christopher Carlton for his service.
He serves the State of Alabama with integrity and always answers the call of duty.
I extend my gratitude for his hard work and diligence in public service.
The Second Congressional District of Alabama is blessed to have such an outstanding citizen.
