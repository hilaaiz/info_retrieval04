Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 10th Congressional District, and surrounding communities, I'm honored and humbled to commemorate Greg, Carol, and the entire Kupp Family upon the 90th Anniversary of Kuppy's Diner in Middletown, Pennsylvania.
I wish them continued God's blessings for all they have built, achieved, and contributed, not only to the communities of Central Pennsylvania, but to the United States of America.
