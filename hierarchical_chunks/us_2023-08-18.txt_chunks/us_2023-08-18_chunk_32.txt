Mr. Speaker, Colonel Bob Dill's life was devoted to serving his country and his local community.
Soloman tells us in the book of Proverbs that ``a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches.''
Colonel Bob Dill was a kind man who loved his country, and his memory will live on in the Third District.
