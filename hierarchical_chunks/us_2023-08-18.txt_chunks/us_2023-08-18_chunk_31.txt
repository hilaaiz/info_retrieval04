Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the life and military service of Colonel Bobby Dill, who passed away on August 14, 2023, at the age of 91.
Colonel Dill was a native of Greenville County in South Carolina.
He was a 1955 graduate of Clemson University and earned a master's degree from Oklahoma University.
In the U.S. Army, he served in Korea, Vietnam, Germany and on Army Staff at the Pentagon.
After retiring from military service, he spent several years investing in the next generation by working as a substitute teacher.
Later, he would leave retirement to take on a new career as a newspaperman--working diligently to keep his community informed.
With his wife LaVerle at his side, he wrote articles, attended countless meetings, and remained devoted to printing the truth.
