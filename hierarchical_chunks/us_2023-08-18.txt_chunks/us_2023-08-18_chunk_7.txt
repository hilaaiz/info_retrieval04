Mr. MOORE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the heroic action of Senior Trooper Christopher Carlton with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.
On February 17, 2023, at approximately 4:38 P.M., Senior Trooper Carlton responded to a vehicle crash on Highway 84 in Houston County, Alabama.
Senior Trooper Carlton rescued Jessica Joy Thrasher of Lynn Haven, FL and 4-year-old Simon Thrasher, from the scene.
Upon Trooper Carlton's arrival, a member of Wicksburg Rescue advised Carlton that another ambulance would be required for both patients since they needed immediate medical attention.
Without hesitation, Carlton transported Simon to Flowers Hospital in his patrol vehicle to ensure rapid treatment and care.
Physicians, nurses, and hospital staff were able to stabilize Simon after the incident, and both Jessica and Simon are expected to make a full recovery.
I am confident Trooper Carlton's quick and selfless actions saved the lives of Jessica and Simon.
