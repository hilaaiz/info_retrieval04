Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Kathleen Bailey who passed away surrounded by her loved ones earlier this month.
Born and raised in Northwest Pennsylvania, Kathy was known throughout Oil City for her love and dedication to the region.
She was a true advocate for Oil City, working hand-in-hand with local businesses for the betterment of the community.
Those who knew Kathy could attest that her enthusiasm was infectious.
Aside from her work in the community, Kathy was passionate about the arts.
In her free time, she sang in the Barrow-Civic Theater and the Erie Philharmonic Choir.
She also played the organ for St. Stephen Church and St. Joseph Church.
