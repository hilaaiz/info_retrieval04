Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dale Hamilton on his retirement from the North Conway Fire Department after an impressive 60-year tenure as a firefighter.
His position as the longest-serving member of the department speaks to his tireless dedication to maintaining the safety of the North Conway community, and his love for his work is an inspiration to those he serves with and those he strives to protect.
His distinguished lifetime commitment to public safety is vital to keeping New Hampshire safe, and I commend his years of service to North Conway and the Granite State.
A longtime resident of North Conway, Dale joined the North Conway Fire Department in 1963, and has remained a fixture in the department ever since.
Dale's experience in all positions, including operator of Engine 3, the ladder truck, and dispatcher, has made him an integral member of the North Conway Fire Department.
Through his kind demeanor, dedicated work ethic, and his love of his craft, Dale has become a beloved and renowned member of the North Conway community.
While we can never fully repay our debt of gratitude to Dale, we recognize his decades of service and immeasurable impact.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to congratulate Dale Hamilton on his well-deserved retirement and the work he has done to protect and serve the North Conway community.
He will serve as a shining example for future North Conway firefighters, and I look forward to seeing what his next chapter holds.
I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
