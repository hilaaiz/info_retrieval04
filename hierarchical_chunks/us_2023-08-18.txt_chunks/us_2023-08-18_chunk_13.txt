Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Greg and Carol Kupp upon the auspicious occasion of the 90th Anniversary of ``Kuppy's Diner'' on August 6, 2023.
Kuppy's is located in the heart of Middletown, Pennsylvania, and has remained a beloved landmark since Percy Kupp founded the establishment in 1933, during the Great Depression.
Kuppy's has been owned and operated by Fourth Generation Kupps (Greg and Carol) since 1991, with the Fifth Generation (Rachel) working alongside them daily, and even mentoring the Sixth Generation (Jackson) to take over someday.
The Kupp Family is dedicated to continuing the tradition of their small, hometown, hardworking, friendly, and community-based establishment where all are welcome and treated like family.
Kuppy's Diner has enjoyed and earned extraordinary success, due in no small part to Percy Kuppy's philosophy, ``if you serve good food at reasonable prices, people will be satisfied.''
But perhaps the most significant factor in Kuppy's longevity, popularity, and legacy is the Kupp Family's tireless dedication to and appreciation of their customers and community for nearly a century.
