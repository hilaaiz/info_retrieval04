Mr. Speaker, scripture in Thessalonians 4: 13-18 instructs us with these words: ``Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.''
Kathy lived to bring hope and optimism to so many in her community.
Let us also count our blessings that we were fortunate enough to know Kathy Bailey.
I send my sincere condolences to her husband, Scott, and their family during this difficult time.
