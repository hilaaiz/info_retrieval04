Mr. EMMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aaron Anderson for his efforts to better his community.
In high school, Aaron was a dedicated member of the youth service club at Blaine High School.
As a member of ``Bengals in Action,'' he spent countless hours volunteering at the North Anoka County Emergency food shelf.
While volunteering, he noticed a problem with the procedure for taking orders.
Luckily for Aaron, the solution lay in another area of his interest, technology.
Aaron, with the help of his friend and fellow Eagle Scout, Andrew, created a software application to help track the food shelf's orders.
The application immediately helped reduce confusion when taking orders and increased efficiency in sorting and packaging donations for distribution.
Their application keeps records of past food shelf orders, family members, and dietary restrictions, which customers can reuse each time they come in.
In fact, their program has allowed food and necessities to be delivered to clients in half the time.
In recognition of their efforts, Aaron and Andrew were recently presented with the Congressional Award.
The award represents the highest Congressional honor available for young Americans.
Aaron and Andrew are true inspirations and examples of what it means to be a community servant.
They are bright young men committed to making a difference in the world and I look forward to seeing all they accomplish in the years to come.
