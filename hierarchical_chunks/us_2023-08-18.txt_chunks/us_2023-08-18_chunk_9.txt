Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of service and sacrifice of United States Marine Corps veteran Corporal Donald A. Shields.
Cpl.
Shields was born in the town of Harpersfield, New York in 1932.
After graduating high school, Cpl.
Shields voluntarily enlisted into the United States Marine Corps on September 7, 1951 during the onset of the Korean Conflict.
Cpl.
Shields left his job as a dairy farmer to serve.
After completing basic training, Cpl.
Shields was deployed to Korea where he served selflessly and honorably.
Cpl.
Shields earned two Purple Hearts for his valor and sacrifice, along with the Korean War Service Medal, United Nations Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and, most notably, the South Korean Presidential Unit Citation for his service with the 7th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in Korea.
Following his 3 years of service in the Marines, Cpl.
Shields was honorably discharged from active duty, although he continued to serve in the Marine Corps Reserve until 1959.
Upon his return stateside, he found employment as a truck driver for Mobil Oil Corporation.
Cpl.
Shields moved his family to Castleton, New York and drove for Mobil for 33 years before retiring.
Donald always remained involved in his local community.
He worked for the Town of Schodack as a building inspector and member of the Zoning and Planning Board.
Donald was also a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 7337, a communicant of St Paul's Methodist Church, and a Boy Scouts Troop Leader.
Donald was a proud family man, and enjoyed traveling with his wife, spending time with his grandchildren, and doing handyman work for his friends.
Corporal Donald A. Shields' record of service to his country and Rensselaer County is admirable, and it is my honor on behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District to recognize the commendable life and inspiring legacy.
