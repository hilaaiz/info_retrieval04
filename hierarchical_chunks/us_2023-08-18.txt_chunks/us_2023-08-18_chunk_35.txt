Mr. Speaker, Choir alumni will gather on campus during Ohio Wesleyan's homecoming weekend this October for a reunion concert and celebration.
On behalf of the people of Ohio's Fourth Congressional District, I thank the members of the Gospel Lyres Choir for contributing so richly to the musical landscape of our great state.
I wish them all the best as they mark their golden anniversary.
