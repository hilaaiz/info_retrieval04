Mr. JORDAN.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commend to the House the 50th anniversary of the first concert of Ohio Wesleyan University's Gospel Lyres Choir.
From its founding in October of 1972 by students Cheryl Smith and Marteal Pitts, the Gospel Lyres Choir provided a place for African American students at Ohio Wesleyan to gather in fellowship and friendship and to use their musical gifts to praise God.
At its debut concert on campus on November 4, 1973, the Choir numbered an impressive 22 members.
Through the years, Choir members served as unofficial ambassadors of Ohio Wesleyan, performing at churches not just in the city of Delaware, Ohio, but across our great state and beyond.
Its members formed strong, lifelong bonds as they touched countless lives with the Gospel message they shared through their music.
