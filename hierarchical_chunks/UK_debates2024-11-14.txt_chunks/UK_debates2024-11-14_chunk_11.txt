I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing sympathy with the communities of the Valencia region and across Spain following the dreadful flooding.
This Government’s floods resilience taskforce marks a new approach by national, regional and local government, and by flood risk partners, to better co-ordinate flood preparedness.
It met on  12 September , with 40 attendees from 27 organisations agreeing actions including sharing learning from recent floods.
This Government will invest £2.4 billion over the next two years to improve flood resilience by maintaining, repairing and building flood defences.
Yesterday, at the Association of Drainage Authorities conference, I announced that we will allocate a further £50 million to the internal drainage boards.
I also send my best wishes to the citizens of Valencia and the surrounding region.
As the Secretary of State knows very well, the village of Upper Tean is frequently affected by flooding and sewage discharges.
After visiting the Environment Agency, it was suggested that the parish council should set up a flood action group to help to tackle the causes and prevent further impacts of flooding.
Will the Secretary of State and the Minister responsible for flooding meet me to discuss the support they can offer to the village in setting up a flood action group?
I was delighted to hear that the village is proactively setting up a flood action group.
Of course, I appreciate the wonderful work that my hon.
Friend is doing to support the village.
The Government fully support collaboration between risk management authorities, including local Environment Agency teams and local communities, and we are committed to hearing from people on the ground via the new taskforce.
Of course, I would be happy to meet them.
