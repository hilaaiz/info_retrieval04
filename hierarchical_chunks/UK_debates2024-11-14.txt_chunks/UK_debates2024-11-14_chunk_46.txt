I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for that question.
She is absolutely right; after 14 years of the previous Government’s record in office, local government is on its knees.
We have a system on the verge of collapse.
We had multiple years when in-year spending pressures were ignored.
The headroom that we have provided through the Budget—more than £4 billion in new local government funding, which I referenced earlier—will allow us to start to turn that system around and to get ahead of some of the challenges we are facing, whether the pressures on adult social care, children’s services or homelessness costs as a result of temporary accommodation.
That is why our house  building programme—within my specific remit of responsibility—and, in particular, the increase in social and affordable housing supply that we are committed to, is so important.
