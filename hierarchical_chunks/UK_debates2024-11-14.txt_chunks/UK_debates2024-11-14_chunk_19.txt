I welcome the record allocation for agriculture in the Budget.
However, the simple fact is that that agriculture budget is no good if it stays in the Whitehall coffers.
Last year, there was a £300 million underspend in the agriculture budget, worth more than £1,400 on average for every single farm holding in the country.
What steps is the Secretary of State taking to guarantee that every single penny of that budget gets to communities such as Lichfield, Burntwood and the villages?
