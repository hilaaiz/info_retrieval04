I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that very important point, and for the work she is doing in this area.
For too long, victims of domestic  abuse across the country have been let down, but this week, we have welcomed a new domestic abuse joint justice plan between police and prosecutors.
That plan will see them working more closely together to support victims, in order to deliver swifter investigation and justice for all.
