Food security is national security, and underpinning it are farmers and farmland.
Labour’s ill-judged and heartless family farm tax will put all of that in jeopardy: family farms lost; tenant farmers unable to continue farming; communities hollowed out; rural mental health damaged; and precious food-producing land lost to developers or investors.
No farms, no food.
No farmers, no food.
Will the Government please now admit that they have got  this catastrophically wrong?
Will they do the right thing by reversing this farm tax to protect our country’s food security?
