I thank the hon.
Member for his question, and I am sorry to hear about that specific case.
I am of course happy to make contact directly with any local chief Crown prosecutors to address that case.
More generally, victim transformation work is taking place across both police and CPS, such as investment in victim liaison officers to make sure that there is a single point of contact so that victims are supported right the way through the criminal justice process.
