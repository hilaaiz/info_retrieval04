The Minister has accused the Conservatives of scare- mongering about Labour’s family farm tax.
Is the National Farmers Union of Scotland also scaremongering?
I talk regularly to the National Farmers Union of Scotland.
I respect it fully, but I genuinely say, as I have said on many occasions, that we need to look closely at the figures and look at the detail.
We will find that the vast majority of farmers in this country will be fine.
