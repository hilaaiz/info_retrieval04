I welcome the hon.
Member to his place.
He raises an incredibly important point.
This Government in general are committed to raising standards and rebuilding trust in the justice system.
That means regulators working effectively with investigators in the public interest.
He will know that, in accordance with long-established practice, it would not be proper for me to comment on the specific case that he mentions, but I can assure him that we will be working to ensure that regulators are working effectively with investigators in the public interest.
