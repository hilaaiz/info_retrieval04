I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his kind remarks.
I met his colleague from DAERA at an inter-ministerial group in September.
I am aware of the concerns in rural areas about fly-tipping, which blights swathes of our countryside.
I am working with the National Farmers Union and others through the National Fly-Tipping Prevention Group to promote good practice, including on private land.
We know from the national waste crime survey that 86% of landowners and farmers have been affected by this terrible crime.
