I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, which relates to an earlier one.
I think that, in the urgent question, the Opposition failed to account for the various other sources of support that we are providing for families.
We are continuing the household support fund—that is £1 billion.
There is a £1 billion uplift for special educational needs.
There is UK shared prosperity funding of £900 million—the list goes on, but if the hon.
Gentleman wishes to discuss the specific conditions in Northern Ireland further, I am more than happy to pass on that request to the Local Government Minister.
