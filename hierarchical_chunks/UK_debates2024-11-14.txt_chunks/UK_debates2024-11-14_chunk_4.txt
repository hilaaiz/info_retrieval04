The Minister’s response to my hon.
Friend’s question highlights his arrogance on this issue.
He constantly keeps saying that we need to look at the detail, yet his Department and the Treasury disagree on how many farms will be impacted by as much as 40%.
In fact, as he knows, the figures being repeatedly regurgitated by the Government consider only past claims for agricultural property relief, not those combined with business property relief, which is just as important.
Why?
Because the Treasury does not have the data.
We need comprehensive detail on this policy to properly understand the impacts of his family farm tax.
I ask this for a third time in this House: will he release a full impact assessment—yes or no?
We seem to be discussing this endlessly.
The figures on agricultural property relief are absolutely clear.
I have kept asking people to look at the detail, because what they will find—listen to the tax experts and the people who have actually looked at the policy in detail—is that fewer than 500 farms will be affected.
That is the reassuring message that the Conservatives should be conveying to British farmers.
