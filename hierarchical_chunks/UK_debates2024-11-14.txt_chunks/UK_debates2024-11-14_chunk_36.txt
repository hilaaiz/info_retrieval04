I acknowledge my hon.
Friend’s proud track record in highlighting economic crime and his work in exposing dirty money.
I met the director of the Serious Fraud Office yesterday in this House.
We are working closely together to crack down on corruption, fraud, and bribery, and I assure my hon.
Friend that the SFO is working incredibly hard in that area.
In 2023-24, more than 16,000 crimes involving fraud were committed in Scotland.
Since crime of that kind is often committed online and observes no borders, will the Solicitor General advise the Chamber on whether the UK and Scottish fraud offices are co-operating on that issue?
My hon.
Friend is correct to say that so often these terrible crimes do not respect borders.
Fraud that is specific to Scotland is investigated by Police Scotland and prosecuted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, which works closely with English-based agencies and the SFO where it is appropriate to do so.
This Government are committed to strengthening the Union, and that extends to law enforcement in this area.
I warmly welcome my hon.
Friend the shadow Solicitor General to her post—it is good to see her back—and I thank the Solicitor General for her kind words.
I equally warmly welcome the advent of a “failure to prevent” offence in relation to certain kinds of economic crime.
The Solicitor General will agree that the purpose of that exercise is not to engender further prosecutions but to change behaviour.
Will she therefore reassure the House that she will work with colleagues across Government to ensure that businesses receive all the advice they need about how to put in place the reasonable anti-fraud measures that will give them a defence under that new offence?
