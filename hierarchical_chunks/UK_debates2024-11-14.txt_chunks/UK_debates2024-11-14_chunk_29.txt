Thank you very much indeed, Mr Speaker.
It is an honour to stand at the Dispatch Box again, albeit on the other side of this great Chamber.
I hope to work constructively with the hon.
and learned Lady on this challenging and very intricate part of Government.
Violence against women and children is abhorrent and inexcusable.
It crushes self-confidence and self-esteem in victims, wrecks families and ruins lives.
As someone who was a family lawyer for 23 years before coming to this place, I welcome the Government’s mission to halve violence against women and girls within the next decade.
To achieve that important goal, what action are the Government taking on prevention and early intervention, and when will the specialist rape courts be introduced?
