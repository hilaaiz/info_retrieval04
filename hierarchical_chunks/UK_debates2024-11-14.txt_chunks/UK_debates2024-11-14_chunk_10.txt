I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place.
Let me say once again that it is important to treat this subject carefully.
We must look at the facts and listen to people who know about it.
I was asked earlier by someone else whether this measure was wrong, but we should look at what Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and other tax experts have said.
There are many ways in which this can be managed, and I encourage the hon.
Gentleman to join me in reassuring British farmers about their future.
