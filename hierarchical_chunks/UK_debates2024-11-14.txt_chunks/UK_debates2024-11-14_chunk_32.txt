I thank the Solicitor General for her answer.
The Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023 had support from across the House in the previous Parliament.
The statutory instrument to bring in its measures is with the Home Office but has yet to be brought forward.
Property seized by the Thames Valley police rural crime taskforce across South Oxfordshire and the Vale of White Horse since the start of 2023 is valued at more than £400,000, with an incalculable impact on farmers’ mental health, wellbeing and anxiety.
To improve the rate of prosecutions for rural crime, will the Solicitor General urge her colleagues at the Home Office to bring that statutory instrument before the House?
