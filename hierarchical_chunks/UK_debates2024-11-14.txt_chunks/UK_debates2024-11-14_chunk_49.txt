I thank my hon.
Friend for that point, and I will relay it to the Local Government Minister.
On the general principle, we are determined to rebuild local government from the ground up.
That is why we are providing multi-year funding settlements to councils and removing a number of ringfences, and are committed, as I said, to fair funding.
On his general point about the Opposition, I completely agree.
It reminds me of a phrase my nan used to use: “More front than Harrods,” she used to say.
That is what Opposition Members have.
