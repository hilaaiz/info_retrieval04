I welcome the new shadow Ministers to their place—as well, of course, the returning one.
Under the previous Government, water companies got away with discharging record levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes and seas, leaving them in an appalling  polluted state.
That is why we are taking immediate action to place the water companies under special measures, with legislation going through Parliament right now that will ban the payment of unfair bonuses to water company executives.
We have also launched a commission that will lead a root and branch review of the entire sector, so that we can clean up our waterways for good.
