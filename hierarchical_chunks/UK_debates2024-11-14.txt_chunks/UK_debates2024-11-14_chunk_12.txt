I welcome my hon.
Friend’s answer.
We talk a lot in this House about extreme weather and flooding, but we do not talk enough about the vital role  that our internal drainage boards play in protecting and keeping safe our agricultural land and farming.
I welcome the Government’s inclusion of the internal drainage boards on the taskforce, and I welcome the money that the Minister put into the system yesterday.
That is in stark contrast with the first actions of the 2010 Conservative Government, who cut flood defences by a horrifying 27%.
