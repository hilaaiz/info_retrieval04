I welcome the Solicitor General to her place, and I very much look forward to working with her.
I echo the comments of others welcoming the shadow Minister,  the hon.
Member for Maidstone and Malling (Helen Grant) , to her place.
The Solicitors Regulation Authority recently labelled the Legal Services Board’s damning report into the handling of the Axiom Ince fraud as merely an opinion.
Can the Solicitor General clarify what mechanisms are in place to ensure that the regulator is properly regulated?
What actions are being taken by her Department to prevent similar economic crimes to ensure that all constituents, including mine in North Cornwall—one of whom is in the Gallery today—can have confidence in our legal system?
