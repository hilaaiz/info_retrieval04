Prosecutions and convictions for domestic abuse plummeted over the last eight years under the previous Government.
Additionally, the time taken to charge domestic abuse cases has increased dramatically.
Given the alarming rise in delays, what measures is the Solicitor General implementing to expedite those processes and ensure timely justice for victims?
My hon.
Friend raises a powerful point.
He is right that between 2016-17 and 2023-24 the number of domestic abuse flagged cases received from the police by the CPS dropped by nearly 36%.
We are beginning to see a rebound in those figures, but much more needs to be done.
We need a whole-system approach to fix the system, and our domestic abuse joint justice plan will ensure that the CPS and police work more closely together to address those delays from the very outset of a case.
I have been contacted by a constituent who had concerns about how they were treated in a rape case, and about the communication that came from the police and the CPS.
What steps is the Solicitor General taking to ensure victims are properly informed all the way through?
