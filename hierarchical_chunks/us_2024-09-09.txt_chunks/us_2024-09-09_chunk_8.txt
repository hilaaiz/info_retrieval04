Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the exceptional work demonstrated by American Legion Post No. 682, and to celebrate the unveiling of their Veteran's Memorial Brick Wall.
For years, American Legion Post No. 682 has selflessly served the veterans of our community.
As a combat veteran, I believe taking care of America's heroes when they return home must be a top priority, and American Legion Post No. 682 has courageously stepped up to the task.
One such way they are honoring America's heroes is with the unveiling of their Veteran's Memorial Brick Wall, a memorial constructed to showcase the community's love and recognition of those who have given all for their country.
