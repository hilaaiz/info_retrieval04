Throughout its long history, the 103d Attack Squadron has embodied the core values of the United States Air Force: Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do.
They have safeguarded the nation's skies, provided critical support in times of war, and stood ready to respond when called upon.
Their aircrew and superior operational support personnel have been, and continue to be, some of the most skilled and dedicated Airmen in the world.
As we celebrate this historic milestone, it is my distinct honor to celebrate those who have faithfully served in the 103d Attack Squadron over the past century.
Their sacrifices and those of their families have ensured our freedom and security.
It is with deep gratitude that we acknowledge their service and pay tribute to their bravery.
