Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 103d Attack Squadron and in extending a heartfelt thank you to the men and women who have served, and continue to serve, in this distinguished unit.
May the next 100 years of Airmen serve with the same valor, honor, dignity, and dedication to duty as the exemplary men and women of the 103d Attack Squadron have so expertly demonstrated over the last century of service.
