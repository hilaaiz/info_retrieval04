Mr. KIM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Commissioning of the Naval Vessel, the USS New Jersey on September 14, 2024.
The third naval vessel named after the great State of New Jersey, this Virginia class submarine is a nuclear-powered cruise missile fastattack vessel that will prove invaluable to the efficacy of our great Navy.
After rigorous tests and trials at sea, this ship has proved its capability to perform her designed mission and join America's strong Naval fleet.
Upon being commissioned.
the USS New Jersey will welcome our brave sailors from the Commanding Officer to the crew who are entrusted with maintaining and operating the submarine during peacetime and time of war.
Not just a phrase but a guiding light through high seas and troubled times, the submarine's motto--Firepower for Freedom--inspires all of its crew members to preserve our Nation's values in fighting for valor and freedom across the globe.
With many Americans coming together in Monmouth County to celebrate the commissioning of the USS New Jersey, we also celebrate the long legacy of tenacity and bravery that the Navy has proved time and time again.
The brave sailors on all three USS New Jersey vessels, and vessels across the globe, exemplify the honor, courage, and commitment stated in the Navy's core values.
As the crew begins their service aboard this exceptional naval vessel, I am grateful for the devotion each and every one of them has to serving their country.
I look forward to continuing to support the USS New Jersey and its' servicemembers in achieving their many missions to come.
