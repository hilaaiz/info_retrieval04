Representative Anna Eshoo.
Anna has served the people of San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz counties with great distinction for over three decades.
She's hardworking, meticulous, and demanding of herself.
In sum, Anna Eshoo is the kind of person every Member of Congress should be like.
She has built a legacy of fighting for her constituents, and her leadership in Congress will be greatly missed upon her retirement.
First elected to Congress in 1992--dubbed ``the Year of the Woman''-- Anna was the first Democrat and first woman in the history of the then14th Congressional District to win the Silicon Valley seat.
In Congress, Anna has been a health care pioneer, a champion for innovation, a human rights and consumer advocate, a staunch proponent of clean energy, and a defender of women's reproductive rights.
A prolific legislator, over 60 of Anna's bills have been signed into law by five presidents.
Anna has served on the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee since 1995.
In 2019, she became the first woman to serve as Chair of the Health Subcommittee.
Anna helped draft portions of the groundbreaking Affordable Care Act, oversaw the largest overhaul of Medicare since its inception, and wrote landmark bipartisan legislation to promote the development of new lifesaving cures.
Anna also broke the glass ceiling as the first female Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology, where she has championed a free and open internet, removed barriers to entry in the telecommunications market, and helped deploy broadband to underserved communities.
I know Anna is grateful to her dedicated staff in both California and Washington, D.C. for the countless achievements they have secured for constituents over the years, and for the support of her children and granddaughter.
I thank them for their years of service and sacrifice.
I congratulate my good friend and colleague on a well-deserved retirement and wish her the very best in her next chapter in life.
