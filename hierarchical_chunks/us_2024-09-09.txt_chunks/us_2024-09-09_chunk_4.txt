Mrs. Mathews was born on September 26, 1924, and grew up with her parents and seven siblings in Titus, Alabama.
She moved to Buffalo fifty-four years ago where she has lived since.
After graduating high school, 
Mrs. Mathews's top priority was her family.
Together with the love of her life, Luther, they raised six incredible children, three daughters and three sons.
Mrs. Mathews' family continues to grow, with grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
She is most proud to be a wife, mother, grandmother, and greatgrandmother.
When 
Mrs. Mathews is not with her family, she is with her friends and neighbors.
They know they can always rely on her for a warm smile and a laugh.
Deeply devoted to her faith, 
Mrs. Mathews is an active member of the Greater Refuge Temple of Christ on Jefferson Avenue.
Further, 
Mrs. Mathews deeply values civic engagement, having voted in every presidential election she has been able to.
She was very excited to vote for the first Black President, President Barack Obama, and is looking forward to casting her ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman nominated by a major party for President.
Today, 
Mrs. Thelma Holtzclaw Mathews continues to inspire all who know her, sharing her compassion and dedication to her family, friends, country, and faith.
Please join me in celebrating 
Mrs. Thelma Holtzclaw Mathews on her 100th birthday.
