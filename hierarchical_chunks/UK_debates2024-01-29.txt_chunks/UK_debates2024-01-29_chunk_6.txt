As I said in answer to the earlier question, there is a golden thread of high-quality teacher training reforms.
We will be looking at a revised framework and working with providers so that they can ensure that the contracts deliver the very best support for teachers.
What will be vital, and something that Members will feel, is the additional 7,000 SENCOs that will be trained in the coming years.[Official Report,  29 February 2024 , Vol. 746, c. 2MC.]
(Correction) Worcestershire County Council has some welcome plans to set up a new autism free school in Malvern.
Recently, I visited Our Place—an independent provider—in West Worcestershire, which provides specialist education, mainly for children with autism.
Is it the Secretary of State’s understanding that such independent provision would be affected by taxation should the Opposition bring in a tax on independent schools across this country?
My hon.
Friend makes a very good point: there are 2,408 independent schools across our country, many of which provide special educational needs support and excellent education in particular specialties.
If those schools were subject to increased taxation, that would make provision more difficult.
We will have to assess what that would mean.
A number of colleagues have mentioned initial teacher training.
Perhaps they and the Secretary of State should look no further than tomorrow, when my ten-minute rule Bill comes before Parliament—a Bill that aims to increase and ensure there is autism training for all teachers.
Will the Secretary of State back it?
