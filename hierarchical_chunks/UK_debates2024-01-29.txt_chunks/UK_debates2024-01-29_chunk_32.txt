The shareholder representative on UKGI, as the hon.
Lady was right to say, is not the chair; it was Tom Cooper, but is now Lorna Gratton.
Do I have confidence in her?
Yes, I do.
I meet her regularly and have a high degree of confidence in her.
Compensation is too slow—we accept that.
A number of measures were introduced prior to the TV drama, as the hon.
Lady puts it, including the fixed-sum award of £600,000 for overturned convictions.
We have also introduced a fixed-sum award for the group litigation order to expedite compensation.
That is something on which I am absolutely focused on a daily basis.
I accept what the hon.
Lady says about the remuneration of sub-postmasters around the country.
Part of that, of course, is about consumer habits—where we shop on the high street.
We are keen to identify new sources of revenue, including through the banking framework, which is a potential lucrative opportunity, and parcel hubs.
On the issue of confidence in the individuals, let me say that, having been a board director myself for 30 years, you are only as good as your last game, so it is fair to say that, at this point in time, we did not feel that Henry Staunton was the right person to lead the board.
Given the Government’s role as the sole shareholder in the Post Office, and the associated liabilities and responsibilities that go with  that, when will the Secretary of State for Business and Trade make public all the associated papers related to Horizon and this entire scandal, so that the victims as well as the country can see where the responsibility for all this lies?
By doing so, the Government will be able to take the right kind of action and support the victims as they seek compensation.
