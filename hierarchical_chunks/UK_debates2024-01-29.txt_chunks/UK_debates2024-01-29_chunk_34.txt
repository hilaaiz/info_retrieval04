The Post Office Horizon scandal is one of the most insidious injustices in our country.
It has robbed innocent people of their livelihoods, their liberty and, all too sadly, their lives.
At least 60 postmasters have died without seeing justice or receiving compensation and at least four have taken their lives.
Twenty years on, sub-postmasters and their families are still suffering from the consequences and the trauma of all that they have been put through.
The scale of the scandal is so vast that getting the right leadership in place at the Post Office is of paramount importance.
However, to decide to eject the chair during the weekend with no real opportunity to get the details of the decision on the public record is unusual, to say the least.
People need to know that removing Henry Staunton was a substantive, evidence-based decision if we are to have confidence in that decision.
Can the Minister assure us that this decision was, indeed, substantive and not just the result of a personal falling out between Mr Staunton and the Secretary of State?
