I thank the hon.
Member, and I thank Della Robinson for her work.
She was one of the trailblazers who were so important in getting to where we are today and to our getting compensation to the people affected.
As I said in response to earlier questions, I believe the Post Office brand is not damaged; it is the centre of the Post Office—those who ran it from the centre—that is damaged.
I think we should all get behind our post offices, and of course support them wherever we can.
This is not about the brand itself.
As I say, when I hear about any closures from colleagues or in my constituency, I know that the local populations are opposed to them, which identifies the high esteem in which people regard their post offices.
I am very happy to have a conversation with the hon.
Member, if necessary.
