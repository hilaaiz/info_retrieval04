I thank the Minister for that reply.
Declining school rolls in London is a big issue that I have raised in the House on a number of occasions.
We are seeing families with young children being driven out of London because of the affordability of housing and the cost of living crisis, and a new report out today by London Councils shows that the situation is getting even worse.
In Lambeth we are seeing a 17.5% drop in demand for reception places over the next five years.
Archbishop Tenison’s School, opposite the Oval cricket ground in my constituency, closed last year.
We need urgent action from the Government.
The falling rolls funding is helping, but that is just for the short term.
Will the Minister look at how we can protect our vital education assets?
Will the Government finally address the cost of living crisis?
