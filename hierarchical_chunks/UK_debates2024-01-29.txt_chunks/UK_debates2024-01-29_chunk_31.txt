I thank the hon.
Lady for her work; the all-party parliamentary group on post offices does a tremendous job.
The phrase used in the statement was “mutual consent”, but it is fair to say that the Government exercised their right to remove the chairman; the hon.
Lady can deduce from that what she will.
This is not a case of allocating responsibility for the past problems of the Post Office; we are simply saying that we need new leadership going forward.
There were specific circumstances around the chairman that meant that we felt that he was not the right person to lead the organisation of the board at this time.
