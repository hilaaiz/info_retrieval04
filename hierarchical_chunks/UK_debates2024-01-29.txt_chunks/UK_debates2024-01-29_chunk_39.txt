Leaving the Post Office rudderless now, when people are literally dying before they get redress, is not a situation we can put up with.
The key question for the Minister is this:  where is the Bill to expedite redress for those who were wrongfully convicted?
Will he commit this afternoon finally to making sure that we have pre-legislative scrutiny of that Bill so that it is as strong as it can be, and will he commit to a hard deadline enshrined in law in the Bill to make sure the payments are made as rapidly as possible?
Frankly, Mr Bates and the other sub-postmasters who have been wronged for so long should not be made to wait a moment longer.
