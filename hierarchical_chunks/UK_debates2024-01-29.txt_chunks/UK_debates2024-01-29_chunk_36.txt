I thank my hon.
Friend for his work on the Select Committee.
I was present for his line of questioning during that session.
The chief executive committed to providing responses to the Committee; I am not sure whether they have been provided thus far.
A number of questions needed to be addressed, and it is right that those answers be provided.
As far as the Government are concerned, our primary means of achieving that is through the inquiry, which is hearing important evidence right now, and will conclude its work by the end of the year and report shortly afterwards.
