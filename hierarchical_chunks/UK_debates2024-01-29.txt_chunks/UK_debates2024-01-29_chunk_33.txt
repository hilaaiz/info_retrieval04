I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question and the work that she has done on this.
We set up the inquiry in 2021 to undertake that work.
Those documents are public and subject to public scrutiny.
She may have watched some of the inquiry sessions, which were very revealing about some of the conduct that happened at the Post Office.
That inquiry is due to conclude by the end of this year and then report probably sometime next year.
We will have a much clearer understanding then of who is responsible, and, as is often said at this Dispatch Box, that is the time to hold those individuals to account.
