Back in July, the Minister for Enterprise, Markets and Small Business said in a debate on POL’s management culture: “Through the shareholder’s representative on the board, the Government oversee the Post Office’s corporate governance, strategy, performance and stewardship of its financial and other resources.”—[Official
Report,  13 July 2023 ; Vol. 736, c. 180WH.]
That is not the same as the chairperson.
Are the Government satisfied that the UK Government Investments board representative has adequately fulfilled his oversight role?
Indeed, has Tom Cooper, who stood down in May, been replaced?
That is not clear from Post Office Ltd’s website.
It is clear that the governance model simply has not worked.
The arm’s length approach used by successive Governments has allowed scandal after scandal to fester.
The post office network is in disarray.
Financial redress to postmasters is far too slow and, in some cases, wholly inadequate.
The remuneration package for sub-postmasters means that many are working for below the minimum wage, and services are continuously being stripped away.
Does the Minister have confidence that the removal of Mr Staunton will speed up financial redress for victims and bring about change in the management culture of Post Office Ltd?
Back in July, Mr Staunton appeared in front of the Business and Trade Committee over the bonusgate scandal.
In a debate at the same time, I asked the Minister if he had confidence in the current management of Post Office Ltd. I received no meaningful answer, so has it taken a TV drama for the Government to take action?
How is that acceptable?
