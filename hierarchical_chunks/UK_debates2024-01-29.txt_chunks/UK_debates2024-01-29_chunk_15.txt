The millions of children persistently absent from school is a national scandal, yet last week Government MPs joined together to vote against Labour’s long-term plan to deal with that issue, putting party above country and children.
So far the Government have only announced sticking plaster policies.
Will the Secretary of State come forward with a long-term plan to address that properly, or do schools and families have to wait for a Labour Government to finally give all children the education they deserve?
Certainly not.
Under a Labour Government, school standards would plummet back to where they were the last time Labour had education under their control—27th in the world for maths and 28th for English, if I remember correctly.
Standards fall under Labour, and it has absolutely no plans to get children back into school.
As I said, this Government have uniquely put in place daily data to enable us to get down and implement lots of different plans.
We are also planning to legislate for children who are not in school, which I think was about the only thing Labour actually put in its plan.
We are committed to doing that, and we warmly welcome the private Member’s Bill from my hon.
Friend  the Member for Meon Valley (Mrs Drummond) , the Children Not in School (Registers, Support and Orders) Bill, and look forward to working with her when it progresses to Second Reading on  15 March .
I urge all hon.
Members to support the Bill.
What steps she is taking to support schools with decreasing pupil rolls.
I recognise the challenge from falling rolls when there is demographic change.
That is why we are changing how the growth and falling rolls funding is allocated to local authorities—it is now based on decreases as well as increases in pupil numbers.
We are also giving greater flexibility to allocate funding to meet the revenue costs of reducing surplus places.
