“will never be a science superpower behind a visa paywall”?
I know that the hon.
and learned Lady is a stickler for data.
Our target was for over 600,000 international students every year, and we are well over that target.
As I say, our visa changes strike the right balance, being fair to the taxpayer while ensuring that we have good international students coming to our country.
The minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa is set to increase by 48%, from £26,200 to £38,700, jeopardising the prospects of early-career researchers and academics coming to the UK.
Can the Minister answer the question from my hon.
and learned Friend  the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry)  that he did not answer: how will the UK be a science superpower behind that visa paywall?
I think I have set that out.
We have 36% of university researchers coming from outside the UK, and over 46,000 postgraduate students from overseas—41% of the total.
What I would say to the  hon.
Gentleman is that the real cost of the SNP’s tuition fee policy is that Scottish universities are unable to provide places for local students, who are 13% less likely to take a place at a university in Scotland than English students are to take a place in England.
Will the Minister be investigating the discovery, exposed by The Sunday Times yesterday, of Russell Group universities taking students with much lower academic qualifications for undergraduate degrees, and when he does so, will he check that the same is not happening in the postgraduate field, given the much higher fees that can be charged for overseas students?
