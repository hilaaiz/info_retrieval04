As I said in answer to the earlier question, there is a golden thread of high-quality teacher training reforms.
We will be looking at a revised framework and working with providers so that they can ensure that the contracts deliver the very best support for teachers.
What will be vital, and something that Members will feel, is the additional 7,000 SENCOs that will be trained in the coming years.
Absolutely.
Obviously, one reason for the reduction in some of the SME numbers is the fact that we made improvements to ensure that every single apprenticeship was of high quality.
I want to make sure that all young people who embark on an apprenticeship, as I did, put their trust in the system and get what they deserve.
We have removed the limit on caps on SMEs, and we are working on reducing the number of steps to make it easier for them to access the system.
We are also looking at what more we can do: we are focusing on a number of ways in which to ensure that apprenticeships work well for SMEs, which account for 70% of employment.
