I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
He will know that, while I am a strong supporter of international students, I am absolutely clear that I want a level playing field for all domestic students as well.
I met vice-chancellors only yesterday afternoon, as soon I had seen the report in The Sunday Times, and I have asked the Department for Education to carry out an urgent investigation into bad practice by agents where it occurs, as I was very disturbed by what I saw.
We want absolute fairness of entry for domestic students as much as for international students.
