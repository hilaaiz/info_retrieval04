I thank my right hon.
Friend for all her work in this area.
She is right; the first thing to do is ensure that we understand best practice, and that it is rolled out everywhere.
A lot of work is being done in that area.
I very much appreciate the initiatives that she has introduced, and I urge colleagues across the House to support her endeavours.
