I very much welcome the fact that this Government are doubling investment in early years and childcare.
As the Secretary of State said earlier with regard to special educational needs, early identification of need is absolutely key.
From that perspective, will the Minister meet me to discuss the urgent need for a specialist assessment centre in Worcester, after the loss of the one in Fort Royal?
It has gone out for commissioning, but unfortunately we have not had any bids to host the new one, and we need to get on with delivering one for next September.
I do not know the details of my hon.
Friend’s specific case, but I would be delighted to meet him to discuss it further.
