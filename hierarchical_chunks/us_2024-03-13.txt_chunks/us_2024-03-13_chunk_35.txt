by their mother's commitment to public service.
Prior to her service with Congress, Wendy Motta served the California State Legislature in the 18th Senatorial District office.
Her experience and expertise from the state level were instrumental in navigating the complexities of multi-jurisdictional issues and implementing effective policies for the benefit of our shared constituents on the Central Coast.
As we express our gratitude for Wendy's years of service, we also extend our best wishes for a fulfilling and joyous retirement.
The 24th Congressional District has been fortunate to have such a dedicated advocate, and Wendy's legacy will undoubtedly endure as an inspiration for future generations of public servants.
In closing, I ask you to join me in acknowledging Wendy Motta's selfless contributions to the well-being of our community and express our deepest appreciation for her years of dedicated service.
May her retirement be filled with the same warmth and kindness she has bestowed upon us throughout her illustrious career.
