Mr. KELLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the remarkable life and legacy of 
Mr. William Anthony Anderson, Sr., whose sudden passing on March 9, 2024, has deeply saddened our community.
Mr. Anderson's journey, characterized by dedication, service, and compassion, has left an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Born on July 12, 1962, in Blue Springs, 
Mr. Anderson's commitment to public service was evident from the outset.
He served at the Union County Sheriff's Office for over a decade before assuming the role of chief of police for the city of Verona, where his leadership and dedication earned him the respect of his colleagues and the community.
Anderson was appointed as the assistant police chief at Northeast Mississippi Community College in late 2014.
His commitment to the safety and well-being of the students led to his subsequent appointment as police chief on July 1, 2021, succeeding Chief Randy Baxter.
