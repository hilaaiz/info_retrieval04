Mr. Craighead was very kind in making sure that I was included in activities with his boys.
Following his retirement in 1987, 
Mr. Craighead wrote and published a book titled, ``Jackson's Legacy.''
He was preceded in death by his wife, Janet Terry Akers Craighead, his parents, and his two brothers, William M. Craighead, Jr. and James L. Craighead.
He is survived by his five children and their significant others, Russell Craighead and Cynthia Miller, Anne Craighead, Steve and Beth Craighead, Nancy Craighead and Janet Ardam, Tim and Debra Craighead; adoptive daughter, Amanda Allen; nine grandchildren; and sixteen greatgrandchildren.
I wish them my sincerest condolences during this difficult time.
I want to thank 
Mr. Craighead for his service to our country and note that he was a valued member of the Salem community throughout his life.
