Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill.
Certainly, we can agree that federal agencies, like many large employers, need to reevaluate their office space requirements in response to more hybrid work options post-COVID.
But this is not a new endeavor for the federal government.
This is something the federal government was doing for more than a decade before the pandemic.
