Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Judge Onzlee Ware, who passed away on February 10, 2024, at the age of 70.
He was born in North Carolina on January 4, 1954, to the late Onzlee McCrimmon and Edna Taylor.
While attending North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Onzlee was charged with possession of heroin and marijuana, but later had those charges dropped when he agreed to become a police informant.
A year later, it was revealed in court that he was an informant.
Because of that revelation, he was subsequently shot and critically wounded, eventually losing his left leg.
This harrowing experience would shape the rest of his life and reinforce his belief in second chances.
He would later come to Roanoke to work with Boy Scouts of America, which is where we met.
He eventually became a lawyer, and we became friends.
Our friendship was first cemented while spending hours photocopying form files in my office.
We then served in the Virginia House of Delegates together, where I knew him as someone who would often reach across party lines to get things accomplished for his fellow Virginians.
In 2013, Onzlee helped then-Republican Governor Bob McDonnell pass his transportation plan.
After leaving the House of Delegates, Onzlee was appointed as a judge, serving in juvenile and domestic relations court.
It was there that he used what he learned earlier in life to reach out to juveniles, telling them they could turn their lives around and be successful, just as he had become.
He later rose in the ranks to become a circuit court judge.
Onzlee Ware was a trailblazer.
He served as the first Black legislator from the western part of Virginia and later the first Black judge in Roanoke Circuit Court.
He made an impact on so many throughout his life, his legacy will live on for years to come.
He was my friend.
I will miss him.
