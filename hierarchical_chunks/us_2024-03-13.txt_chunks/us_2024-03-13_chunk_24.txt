Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. Ross for his tremendous accomplishments, his commitment, and tireless community service.
His immense impact will continue through the multitude of lives he has impacted.
On behalf of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I wish 
Mr. Ross great joy and relaxation in retirement as Mayor.
