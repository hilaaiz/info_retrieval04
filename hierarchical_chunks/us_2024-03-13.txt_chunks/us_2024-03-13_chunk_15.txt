Mr. GREEN.
Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.
I rise to honor the memory of a noble public servant Harris County Justice of the Peace Judge Armando V. Rodriguez.
Elected to Harris County's Precinct 6, Place 2 in 1973, Judge Armando V. Rodriguez became the first Hispanic to hold the title of Harris County Justice of the Peace.
He served our county admirably for more than four decades and was known as the longest-tenured judge in Harris County.
The Honorable Judge V. Rodriguez was not just a holder of public trust but a justice seeker, community leader, and coalition builder.
Judge Rodriguez exercised compassion and experience to boldly advocate for and protect his community.
Judge Rodriguez went above and beyond the call of duty when he founded Fiestas Patrias, an organization that celebrates the diversity and cultures of Latin America and culminated into an annual parade that is still being held today.
Judge Rodriguez's efforts also included the creation of the Black and Brown Coalition, which we co-founded together.
