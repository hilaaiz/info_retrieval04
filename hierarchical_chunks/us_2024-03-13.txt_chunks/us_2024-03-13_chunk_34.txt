Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an exemplary public servant, Wendy Motta, who has dedicated her career to serving the constituents of the 24th Congressional District with unwavering commitment and tireless effort.
As we bid farewell to Wendy, we reflect on her distinguished service and the indelible mark she leaves on our community.
Wendy Motta's journey in public service spans decades, including previously serving in the office of my predecessor, Congresswoman Lois Capps.
Throughout her tenure as Senior District Representative, Wendy demonstrated an exceptional ability to address the diverse needs of our constituents, tackling crucial issues ranging from agriculture and veterans' affairs to infrastructure and environmental stewardship.
Her tireless efforts have made a lasting impact on the lives of those she helped.
One of Wendy's most remarkable contributions was her dedicated work in responding to natural disasters and emergencies.
Her leadership during those challenging times provided solace and support to our community, showcasing her resilience and dedication to the well-being in times of crisis set a standard of excellence for public service in our district.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Wendy Motta is the epitome of a devoted family person.
Married to Silvio Motta, she has been a loving partner and a source of strength for her family.
Wendy and Silvio have been blessed with two wonderful children, Caio and Carina, who undoubtedly have been inspired
