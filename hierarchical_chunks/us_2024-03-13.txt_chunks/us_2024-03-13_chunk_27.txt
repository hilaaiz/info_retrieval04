Mr. Speaker, please join me in applauding Vicki Turnbow as a thank you for leading the Raytown Chamber of Commerce as President and charitably serving her community.
Her enthusiasm for improving the lives of others has earned her a joyous retirement.
On behalf of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I want to thank Vicki for her leadership on behalf of the 118th Congress.
