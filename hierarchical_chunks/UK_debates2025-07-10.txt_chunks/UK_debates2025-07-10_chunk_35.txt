The two bedrocks of our national defence are our own sovereign capability and our membership of NATO.
The United Kingdom and France are both members of NATO, but, as the shadow Secretary of State pointed out, the paradox is that we and every other NATO member bar one are members of the NATO nuclear planning group.
Of course, that “bar one” is France.
As part of these  discussions, is France going to join the NATO nuclear planning group?
If not, how on earth will this co-ordination work within that partnership?
I am not here to speak for the French Government.
As far as I am concerned, our nuclear posture has not changed; their nuclear posture is a matter for them.
What this agreement says is that there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations, and although we both independently look after and are responsible for our deterrence, we believe that co-ordinating potential responses in this way provides a greater deterrent for Europe and NATO.
That is the basis of this agreement.
Clearly, our deepest and closest relationship on nuclear deterrence is with the United States of America.
Can the Minister confirm how this agreement will affect that relationship, which is crucial for our security?
The agreement does not change our very close relationship with the Americans.
In line with the NATO strategic concept, the strategic forces of the US, the UK and France all contribute significantly to the overall security of the alliance.
There is no reason why that should not continue to be the case.
