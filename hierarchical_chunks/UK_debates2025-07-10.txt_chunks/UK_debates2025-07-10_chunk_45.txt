I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that important issue, which I know she and many in her party care deeply about, as do most on the Government Benches.
As she says—I think it is widely accepted—we inherited a SEND system in crisis; I think any parent or any constituency MP who has been supporting families through this system knows that it is broken and needs addressing.
I join her in highlighting the LBC investigation, which has really shone a light on some of these issues.
