The Minister for the Cabinet Office was asked— What assessment his Department has made of the effectiveness of the new trading relationship with the EU.
What assessment his Department has made of the effectiveness of the new UK-EU trading relationship.
We have reset our relationships with the European Union, and are now focused on delivering a long-term strategic partnership to improve the lives of working people and make the UK more prosperous.
That is good for bills, good for our borders and good for jobs.
In 1973, the UK joined the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union.
Given this week’s visit by the French President and this Government’s desire for closer co-operation with the EU, will the Minister confirm that no new or existing trade deal will lead to this country rejoining the EU through the back door?
That is absolutely not the case.
What we have with the European Union is a new deal that the supermarkets say has put a downward pressure on prices, and which Octopus Energy says will bring the cost of energy down.
I am surprised to hear that Reform is against that, but since it has welcomed Liz Truss’s party chairman as a new member today, perhaps it is no surprise that Reform takes that view.
Yesterday on “Farming Today” at 5.45 am, it was put to a shellfish farmer that it was going to become much easier for her to export her produce to the European Union.
Her response was, “Yes, but we are told that the changes will be two or perhaps four years away, if they happen at all.”
Given what we have negotiated away, can those changes be expedited?
I am determined to expedite these new arrangements as quickly as possible.
It is fantastic to see the Opposition take that position—I thought the right hon.
Gentleman’s Front Benchers were against them.
