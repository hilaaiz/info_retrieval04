I thank my hon.
Friend for his continued advocacy for greater transparency in procurement, which we know delivers better value for money and better services.
We have set up the central digital platform, which now holds over 4,000 pipeline notices, and we will soon make available a data platform that will facilitate detailed analysis of SME participation.
We expect that to be available to procurement teams soon, and we are scoping how we will make it available to the wider public.
