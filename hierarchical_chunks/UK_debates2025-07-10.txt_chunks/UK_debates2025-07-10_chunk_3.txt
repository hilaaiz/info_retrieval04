As the Minister will be aware, under the existing framework, the UK is entitled to take unilateral measures to protect the internal market where there is a diversion of trade.
The Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland says that a third of businesses that previously traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland have ceased to do so.
We know from his interview yesterday that the Minister does not consider three quarters of deportations being voluntary to represent a majority, but does he consider a third of businesses to be a diversion of trade?
If he does not, what would be a diversion of trade?
On  1 July , we introduced the phase 3 checks under the Windsor framework.
The Windsor framework was negotiated by the previous Government, and we supported it from the Opposition Benches.
I assume that the Conservatives continue to support those arrangements.
Obviously, we monitor the issue of trade diversion very carefully, and we stand ready to help businesses adjust to the new arrangements.
