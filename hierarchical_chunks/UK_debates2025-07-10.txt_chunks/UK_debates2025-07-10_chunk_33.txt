My hon.
Friend is correct.
The strategic defence review and our ongoing commitment to increasing defence spending in this country give opportunity for our industry to benefit, obtain contracts and assist us in ensuring that we can defend our nation and NATO more fully and in a better way going forward.
There will be jobs, skilled opportunities and growth in all parts of the nations and regions of the UK.
The threats and nuclear sabre-rattling that we have heard from President Putin since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is utterly unacceptable, and the response from the British and French Governments has been robust.
For me, defence co-operation between the UK and France is always welcome.
Will our Governments also seek to get a reaffirmation from other P5 countries, including Russia, of the Reagan-Gorbachev formula that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”?
