On Security Action for Europe and access to EU funds, negotiations are ongoing but not complete.
One would hope that progress can be made.
I cannot recall the hon.
Gentleman’s third point— The coalition of the willing.
I have nothing further to say on that today, as the hon.
Gentleman would probably expect in a response to an urgent question on nuclear co-ordination.
Is the Minister as surprised as I was to find that the shadow Secretary of State only half quoted that sentence from the report in Navy Lookout, about making it clearer that “no extreme threat” to European security would go unanswered by both countries, but failed to look at the real purpose here—that it signals a strengthened deterrence posture, as Russia has repeated its threats to use nuclear weapons?
Does my hon.
Friend agree that this shows that the relationship, which was damaged by Brexit, is now being recreated by this Government?
The AUKUS pact and defence co-operation is now a clear priority for this Government, with the European Union, and that is embodied in this new relationship with France.
I suppose I should say that I am surprised that the shadow Secretary of State for Defence only quoted half the sentence—if indeed that is the case—but he is probably not the first Opposition spokesperson to do that in the history of Oppositions in this House.
I agree with my hon.
Friend that what we have here is a strengthening of the deterrent across Europe, which will help to deter potential adversaries from conducting themselves in a way that might threaten the future of our nations.
