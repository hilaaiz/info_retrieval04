I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his support for this extra co-ordination.
The aim of all this is to make sure that NATO and Europe are safe from the threats that may come from Putin and his nuclear sabre-rattling, as the hon.
Gentleman referred to.
We believe that deterring those threats is the best way to ensure that we do not end up having to fight a war that would be catastrophic.
That is where we are at present.
I am not sure that President Putin is in the mood to agree that nuclear wars cannot be won, because he does issue nuclear threats every now and then.
We need to ensure that he is deterred in his approach.
