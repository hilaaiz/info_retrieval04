My hon.
Friend raises some good points.
We do not just want to see buildings with no connection to the local community; it is important that they have that connection.
I also want to ensure good career progression in civil service buildings outside London.
I recently announced a new civil service apprenticeship scheme so that we can recruit people from all backgrounds to the civil service and make sure that they can get promoted and enjoy a good civil service career.
The last Government saw civil servant jobs relocated not just to Wolverhampton, but to Stoke-on-Trent.
It is important that the very top level of the civil service is also located outside of London, so will the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster set out how many permanent secretaries are currently located permanently outside London?
What steps will he take to ensure that more permanent secretaries are located in both Wolverhampton and Stoke-on-Trent?
We do not have a permanent secretary in Wolverhampton, but it is important that there is career progression and that there are senior roles outside London.
That should include permanent secretaries, and that should all come within our target of half of UK-based senior civil servants being located outside London by 2030.
