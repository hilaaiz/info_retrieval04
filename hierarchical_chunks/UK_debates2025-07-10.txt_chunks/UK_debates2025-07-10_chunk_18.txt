I thank the Minister for his answer and for the response to yesterday’s report.
I speak today on behalf of one of my constituents, a core participant in the inquiry, who was recently invited to start their claim.
They have asked specifically when those affected, such as the parents of the infected, will be invited to start their claims, given that they have been waiting for decades for justice and there are concerns that delays may mean that they do not get to see it in their lifetime.
