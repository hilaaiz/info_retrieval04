I welcome the announcement of strengthened collaboration with France, although reading between the lines, it sounds like “co-ordination” is actually submarine patrol deconfliction.
Our aerial participation in the NATO nuclear mission is still a decade away, with the completion of F-35A delivery not scheduled until 2033, according to the Government, but both the French air force and marine nationale are armed with the air-sol moyenne portée amélioré—ASMPA—medium-range supersonic nuclear-tip missile as part of their force de dissuasion.
Is that nuclear strike capability within the scope of this agreement?
If so, how will it be incorporated into our own nuclear doctrine?
Will it be an escalation step prior to the use of Trident?
Does this form an interim solution while we await the capability to fully participate in the NATO nuclear mission?
How will command of it work?
