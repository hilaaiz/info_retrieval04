I thank my right hon.
Friend the Minister for his answer.
Given that he leads on UK-EU relations, will he outline how the Cabinet Office will ensure that the new sanitary and phytosanitary agreement will reduce the level of checks on goods at both the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkstone, in my constituency, and the Port of Dover, and improve the flow of trade?
What steps are being taken to further break down barriers to trade in goods with the EU?
