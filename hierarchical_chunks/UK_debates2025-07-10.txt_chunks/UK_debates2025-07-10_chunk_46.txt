On the process, I reassure the hon.
Lady that we absolutely want to and will build consensus on these issues—we have been very clear about that.
We will be working with parents, teachers, campaigners and professionals right across the system to develop those reforms and to fix the system, which is much needed.
We will continue that engaged dialogue over the summer before publishing a White Paper in the autumn; that White Paper will, of course, be followed by all the processes and discussions that would normally follow.
I will ensure that the House is kept updated throughout.
At a time when just 26% of the UK’s science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce are women, I am incredibly proud that Croydon high school in my constituency is on course to become the first all-girls school in the world to design, build and launch a CubeSat into space, following a successful live flight test this month.
This group of students are testament to what is possible when we encourage our girls to reach for the stars.
Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating the Astrogazers team on their pioneering work, and will she allow time for a debate on how we can open up more opportunities to girls in science, technology and engineering across all our schools?
As a STEM graduate myself, I absolutely endorse what my hon.
Friend says.
Girls are often better at science and maths in many ways, but they just do not pick it.
I strongly congratulate the Astrogazers team and the school in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, and encourage all the girls involved to get into a career in science, engineering and technology.
