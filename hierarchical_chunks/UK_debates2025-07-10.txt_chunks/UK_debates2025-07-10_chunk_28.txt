I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his support for deeper defence co-operation.
On the co-ordination of our nuclear deterrence—there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations, but France and the UK remain two sovereign nuclear weapon states, and their respective nuclear forces and decision-making processes are independent.
There will be increased co-ordination of research and development, and of the co-operation that we have been engaging in since the Chequers announcement of 1995.
That will be deepened, and a co-ordinating committee between the Élysée and the Cabinet Office will be the joint arrangement for deciding precisely how and what extra research or training we might do.
There will be increasing co-ordination of that effort, but I stress that our decision-making arrangements remain completely independent.
Both nations recognise that there is no extreme threat to Europe that would not prompt a response by our two nations—our vital interests are the same in that respect.
