I thank the Minister for all her hard work to bring together procurement information centrally for the first time and to improve the quality of that data.
What progress has been made to push that out to the public in the dashboards and analytics that will help us track and improve the public procurement system and monitor the Government’s strategic goals of backing British small and medium-sized enterprises and supporting key sectors of the economy?
