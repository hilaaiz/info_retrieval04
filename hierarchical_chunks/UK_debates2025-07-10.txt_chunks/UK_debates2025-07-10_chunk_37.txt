I thank the Minister for her answers today.
We very much welcome the news that we are to enhance our nuclear programme—that security can only be good for our whole nation.
However, the estimates I have read still put our nuclear capability well below the threat posed by Russia, so how can we continue to build our nuclear capability, and how can Northern Ireland play a   part in that work?
The Minister is always committed to helping Northern Ireland, so I am very keen to hear how that will work.
