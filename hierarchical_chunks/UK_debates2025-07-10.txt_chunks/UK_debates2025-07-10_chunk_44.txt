Yesterday, LBC published a month-long investigative story on special educational needs and disabilities.
Shockingly, it revealed that families have been sent legal cease and desist letters in attempts by some schools and local authorities to deter parents from seeking education, health and care plans for their children with SEND.
The report uncovered that some parents and the independent SEND advocates assisting them have been threatened with legal action and with being reported to the police simply for daring to ask questions about the SEND provision to which their children are entitled but that is not being delivered.
Let us be very clear: SEND children and their families have a legal right to support, and I am sure that the whole House would agree that attempting to prevent or limit the provision of such assistance, particularly through intimidatory tactics, is completely unacceptable.
We all know that the SEND system is fundamentally broken and that reform is needed.
That is why the Liberal Democrats set out our five principles for SEND reform in England yesterday.
Principle No. 1 is ensuring that children’s and families’ voices are at the heart of the reform process.
Indeed, the Prime Minister said yesterday that he wants “to work with parents and teachers to get this right.”—[Official

Will the Leader of the House ask the Secretary of State for Education to make a statement explaining exactly how their voices are being not just heard, but understood as part of the SEND reform process, and will she join me in condemning the outrageous practice of issuing legal threats to parents who are simply trying to do their best for their children?
