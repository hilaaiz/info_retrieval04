I welcome the UK-EU reset, which will help to bring down energy bills and grocery bills.
I also welcome the Government’s new procurement plans.
Bournemouth East has fantastic talent, particularly among our younger population.
Will the Minister outline how the new procurement plans will both help to give those younger people opportunities and secure clean power in the south-west?
