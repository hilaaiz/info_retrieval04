The Minister referenced the political steering group that will be set up between the two nations.
Are there any concerns—either within Government or within the Ministry of Defence—about sharing intelligence with a separate political steering group that will sit outside of, or adjacent to, NATO?
The steering group is about political policymaking rather than intelligence.
I am sure that appropriate arrangements will be established if there is any such issue, but I do not anticipate that there will be a problem.
On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
A point of order relevant to this debate?
Indeed.
May I seek your guidance on how to set the record straight?
Following the question from  the hon.
Member for Brent West (Barry Gardiner) , the Minister criticised the fact that I only partially referred to a quote from the declaration text.
To be clear, I have not seen the declaration.
It was leaked to the media overnight; that was all I could read from, and I am none the wiser from the answers we have just had.
Order.
Please, we cannot keep the debate going.
You have made the point and it is on the record—let us move on.
