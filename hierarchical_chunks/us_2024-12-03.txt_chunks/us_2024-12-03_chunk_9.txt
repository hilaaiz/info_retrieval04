Mr. FINSTAD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Minnesota House 
Representative John Petersburg.
First elected in 2012 to represent District 24A, 
Representative Petersburg has served the people of Minnesota honorably in the State House for the past twelve years.
John grew up on a farm and has exemplified a profound willingness to serve throughout his career.
Many know him to be a dedicated father and husband, as well as a respected leader in his community.
The priorities of the people of Waseca and Steele counties have always been at the forefront of 
Representative Petersburg's service in the Legislature, particularly through his continued leadership in the many House committees on which he has served throughout the years.
