Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor the 120th anniversary of the founding of the REO Motor Car Company, a pioneer in American automotive history founded by Ransom E. Olds.
Established in 1904 in Lansing, Michigan, REO played a foundational role in shaping both the automotive industry and the city.
Throughout its years in operation, REO Motor Car Company stood as a symbol of innovation, producing vehicles that helped define an era in American transportation.
REO Motor Car Company had a profound effect on Lansing.
By the 1920s, REO employed 10 percent of the city's population, underscoring the company's importance not only as a major employer but as a pillar of the community.
The REO Clubhouse, built in 1917, served as a social center for employees and their families, hosting weddings, patriotic events during World War I and II, and even Lansing's first radio station.
Through its commitment to its workforce and the community, REO helped shape Lansing's identity as a manufacturing hub.
Among REO Motor Car Company's most celebrated vehicles were the REO Speed Wagon, the Flying Cloud, and the Royale.
Introduced in 1915, the REO Speed Wagon set a new standard for trucks with its speed and durability, paving the way for the modern pickup truck.
The Flying Cloud, launched in 1927, was known for its advanced hydraulic brakes, which set a new benchmark in automotive safety.
The 1931 REO Royale featured a streamlined design that made it a true trendsetter in American car design.
Although REO ceased car production in 1936 to focus exclusively on truck manufacturing, the company remained a force in the industry.
During World War II, REO Motor Car Company contributed to the war effort, supplying trucks to U.S. allies in a time of great need.
REO continued to produce trucks until 1975, ending more than 70 years of innovation and service in the automotive industry.
Today, the legacy of REO Motor Car Company is preserved by the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum in Lansing.
The museum stands as a tribute to both the company and its visionary founder, Ransom E. Olds, displaying a collection of rare and historic vehicles that allow visitors to appreciate the craftsmanship and ingenuity that defined REO.
