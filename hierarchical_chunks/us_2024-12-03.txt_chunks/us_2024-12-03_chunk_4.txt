Mr. LOPEZ.
Mr. Speaker, Colorado high school women's volleyball coach Michelle Baker was recently awarded the Horizon Award from the Colorado High School Athletics Association.
This award is presented to Michelle for the significant improvements to Wiggins High School's volleyball program she has brought about over the past few years.
Her dedication to her team and the women's volleyball program at Wiggins High is an inspiration to all.
Every student deserves the opportunity to compete in sports.
Coaches like Michelle make that possible by coaching their players towards success on and off the court, teaching them skills like discipline, teamwork, and work ethic that will benefit them for years to come.
It is my distinct privilege as the United States 
Representative of the 4th District of Colorado, to congratulate Michelle for her hard work in achieving this award, and for improving Wiggins High School's women's volleyball team.
Her dedication to the development of Colorado athletics cannot be understated, and I encourage Michelle to continue cultivating the best women's volleyball program at Wiggins High for the betterment of her players and the school at large.
