Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the investiture.
Harrison Keller, Ph.D., as the 17th president of the University Dr. Keller received his bachelor's degree from the University of Notre Dame and earned a master's degree and Ph.D. in philosophy from Georgetown University.
He began his career as a legislative aide in the Texas House of Representatives and Senate before becoming Director of Research and Senior Education Advisor.
Dr. Keller also taught courses at the University of Texas at Austin, Georgetown, and St. Edward's University.
He later served as the Deputy to the President for Strategy and Policy at UT Austin as well as Vice Provost for Higher Education Policy and Research and Executive Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning.
In this role, Dr. Keller developed several educational initiatives, including OnRamps, to provide high school students with the opportunity to earn college credit to UT Austin at low cost.
Prior to arriving at UNT, Dr. Keller served as Commissioner of Higher Education and chief executive officer of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.
Under his outstanding leadership, the Board advocated for policies and programs to help low-income and firstgeneration college students be successful.
Moreover, Dr. Keller worked with state legislators to improve access to financial aid and workforce education.
His tenure as commissioner allowed Texas to lead nationwide in higher education and university research.
I am pleased to recognize Dr. Keller today for his dedication to student success and commitment to strengthening UNT's status as a Tier One Research University.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of this historic occasion.
Congratulations to Dr. Keller, and I wish him the very best.
