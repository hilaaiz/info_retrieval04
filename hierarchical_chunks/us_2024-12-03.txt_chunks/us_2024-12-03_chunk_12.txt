Mr. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Irving ``Yitz'' Greenberg, a visionary scholar, teacher, author, and lecturer whose career spanning more than 65 years has profoundly influenced Jewish thought and practice while relating deeply to universal human values.
His pioneering work, grounded in the core value of choosing life and improving society through goodness in every action, carries insights that resonate far beyond any single religion or tradition.
Rabbi Greenberg envisions a future shaped by a profound reverence for life in all its forms, inspiring us to build a more unified, compassionate, and humane world.
Central to this vision is the traditional Jewish belief in Tzelem Elokim--the conviction that all humans are created in the image of God, underscoring the inherent dignity and worth of every person.
Rabbi Greenberg's contributions extend far beyond ideas and scholarship to the institutions he has created and shaped, institutions that continue to embody his vision, often challenging traditional norms to inspire growth and progress.
As leader of the Soviet Jewry movement, rabbi of a Modern Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale, and co-founder of SAR academy, a day school in my district of the Bronx, Rabbi Greenberg has served the Jewish community in numerous capacities.
He has been a professor and chair of the Jewish Studies Department at City College of New York, president of CLAL and the Jewish Life Network/Steinhardt Foundation, and executive director of the President's Commission on the Holocaust.
His leadership extended to chairing the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
In fact, Rabbi Greenberg was among the first to teach college-level courses on the Holocaust in the mid-1960s.
As a Modern Orthodox philosopher, Rabbi Greenberg has addressed the profound challenges posed by the Holocaust, framing it as a transformative moment that altered the relationship between man and God, and shattered the Jewish world, one that had to rebuild itself and create a new, life-affirming reality.
