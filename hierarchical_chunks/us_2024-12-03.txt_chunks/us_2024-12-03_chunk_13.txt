world emphasizes resilience, responsibility, and the power of moral action.
He described this period as the ``Third Great Era'' in Jewish history--an era marked by Jewish self-determination.
This era would be defined by Jews taking full responsibility for their own destiny, from the establishment of the State of Israel to the creation of new Diaspora institutions that would celebrate and sustain the full spectrum of Jewish religiuos and ethnic identity.
Now, at 91, Rabbi Greenberg explores this core principle of Tzelem Elokim in ``The Triumph of Life: A Narrative Theology of Judaism'', a profound magnum opus that encapsulates the breadth of his teachings.
Greenberg's vision emphasizes justice, compassion, and dignity, with the sanctity of life and the divine image inherent in every human being at its heart.
Throughout his career, Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his commitment to these values, in partnership with his wife, Blu, a trailblazing writer and founder of the Orthodox feminist movement.
Together, Rabbi Yitz and Blu Greenberg's progressive values have been central to the educational philosophy of SAR Academy, the school they founded in Riverdale, NY.
Inspired by the Open Education movement, they envisioned a school with no walls, one that would foster creativity, independence, and collaboration through open spaces and a studentcentered approach--a vision in this deep belief in the divine potential inherent in every individual.
Today, more than fifty-six years later, SAR continues to embody Rabbi Greenberg's vision, recognizing the divine spark in each and every individual child.
The school challenges students to live Torah values while fostering creativity, empathy, and a commitment to building a better world.
Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his mission to advance Judaism as dynamic, inclusive, and responsive to the challenges of the modern world.
He has consistently advocated for the inclusion of women and LGBTQ individuals in religious life, while also championing interfaith dialogue as essential to fostering compassion and understanding across communities.
In these dark and challenging times, Rabbi Greenberg's message serves as a beacon of hope.
His teachings remind us of the transformative power of goodness and respect for every individual in shaping a brighter future for all.
