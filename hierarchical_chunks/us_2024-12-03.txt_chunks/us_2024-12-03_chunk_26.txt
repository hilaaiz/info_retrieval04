Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the service of Julian A. Purdy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Policy of Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS) in the U.S. Department.
The Deputy Assistant Secretary previously served on our Committee's staff, and has proven his dedication to America's veterans, servicemembers, and their families over his impressive career thus far.
