Mr. LOPEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Cheyenne Wells Football team for winning the A6 State Championship with an undefeated record.
Their overwhelming victory over Stratton, who won the past two A6 state championships, is a testament to the teamwork and determination players for setting an example that will serve as an inspiration for future generations of high school athletes.
They should all be extremely proud of what they have accomplished and know that this is just a precursor for the many great achievements that each of them will have in their lifetimes.
I am honored to celebrate with the team and wish them all the best in their future seasons and beyond.
