Mr. GARBARINO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my sadness at the devastating news that Long Island native Omer Neutra, 21, was among the 47 Americans slaughtered by Hamas during the brutal October 7th massacre.
Growing up on Long Island, Omer was a cherished and active member of his community at the Schechter School of Long Island, Midway Jewish Center, and as a participant in Jewish youth summer programs.
Those who knew Omer will miss his magnetic, fun-loving personality and joyful spirit.
My heart is with Omer's parents, Ronen and Orna, and his brother, Daniel, who have fought tirelessly to bring Omer home.
May Omer's memory be a blessing.
