I thank my hon.
Friend for contributing to these important debates in the House once again.
He brings first-hand experience, as the only postmaster serving in the House.
He is quite right to say that money was taken, and someone must have noticed it.
One would think that the finance departments or auditors would have noticed it, as it would have appeared in some kind of suspense account and was presumably transferred out at some point.
I will endeavour to find out the number, as I do not have it.
We do know that prior to Horizon being installed in the post office network, there were around five prosecutions a year.
That suddenly jumped to about 60 a year.
We know that there were significant numbers of prosecutions, and the fact that there are around 3,500 postmasters in the various compensation schemes illustrates the scale of the problem.
I will endeavour to find out a number for him.
