From there, it should be a simple process: a statement needs to be signed, as the hon.
Gentleman and I both referred to.
We will work with the advisory board to ensure that the statement is appropriate.
Following the signing of that statement, if people choose the detailed assessment route, that will be more complex because it will look at not just financial loss but personal impacts, such as on health or on other livelihoods, and consequential losses.
If people choose the fixed sum award route of £600,000, that process can be very quick, which is one of the reasons why we have managed to complete 30 full and final settlements already, many using the fixed sum route.
The hon.
Gentleman raised the issue of people using the pilot version of Horizon, of which we are cognisant.
Every postmaster around the country has been written to and should be aware that the compensation scheme is available.
We believe that these schemes cover that pilot period for Horizon.
I am very happy to work with him and  the right hon.
Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)  to ensure that the people they have identified have already been contacted.
The good news is that, following the excellent ITV dramatisation, we have seen a good number of new cases come to light.
We are keen for people to come forward, whether they have suffered convictions or financial detriment through shortfalls.
We are keen to ensure that those people get access to compensation as quickly as possible.
