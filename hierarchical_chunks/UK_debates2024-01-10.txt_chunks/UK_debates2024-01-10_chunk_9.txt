The proposed sale of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, a critical piece of national infrastructure, will be hugely damaging to innovation in biomedical science.
I appreciate that the Science Minister will be meeting me later today to discuss the issue, but can the Minister explain how this sale sits with the UK Government’s plan to be a science superpower?
I hope that my colleague the Science Minister will be able to address the hon.
Lady’s concerns at that meeting.
What steps she is taking to increase access to AI skills training.
The Government have funded a broad package of AI skills initiatives through the education pipeline, to address the skills gap and to support citizens and businesses to take advantage of the wealth of opportunities that AI technologies provide.
We have funded a new AI master’s conversion course and published draft guidance to help training providers develop business-relevant AI skills training.
The defence AI strategy acknowledged an AI skills gap across the whole of defence and promised to work with industry to provide expertise in AI and develop a skills framework.
That was two years ago.
Where is it?
The hon.
Member does not quite grasp the magnitude of what we have done on this agenda.
We have invested £290 million in it since 2018.
We also recently published guidance to support businesses to adopt AI.
We will continue to prioritise that area.
