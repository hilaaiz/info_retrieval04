The Minister has announced that approximately one third of the 555 individuals involved in the group litigation will benefit from the up-front payment of £75,000.
What other support will there be for those in that group litigation who suffered losses way in excess of that £75,000?
How will the Government assess not just the financial losses but the reputational damage they suffered, the health impacts and the family breakdowns that many endured?
How will it work in practice?
As the Minister outlined, time is pressing.
This is very difficult and there is no one-size-fits-all answer, but individuals need recompense sooner rather than later and to feel that justice for this institutional state failure will actually act in their favour.
