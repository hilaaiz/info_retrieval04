When my best friend and constituent Dr Laura Williams lost her husband suddenly at 35, she was left alone with three children under the age of five.
Nothing could have prepared her for that grief and loss.
I have witnessed at first hand what a remarkable job she has done to carry  on and stay afloat, but that has been made much harder by the fact that bereavement support payments have been cut to just 18 months—an allowance that is primarily for children who lose a parent.
Will the Prime Minister be kind enough to meet Dr Laura and me to hear at first hand her experience of losing her husband, and to see what can be done for those who, like her, are bereaved with young children to support?
I am very sorry to hear about the hon.
Lady’s constituent and her tragic loss.
I would be very happy to meet her at the earliest opportunity.
