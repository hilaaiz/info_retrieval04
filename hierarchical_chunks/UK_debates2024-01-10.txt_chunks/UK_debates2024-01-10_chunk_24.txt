I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Our focus has always been on delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, who rightly expect and deserve their locally elected decision-makers to address the issues that matter to them.
We have held talks with the DUP and believe that significant progress has been made, and that there is now a very good basis for the Executive to be restored.
I thank him for his comments about the £3 billion financial package.
With that, there is a real chance to restore the Executive, resolve pay for public sector workers rapidly, and get Northern Ireland and its public services moving again.
