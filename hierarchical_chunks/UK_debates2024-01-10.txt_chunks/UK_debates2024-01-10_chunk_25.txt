The Atherleigh Way bypass in Leigh was first proposed over 60 years ago, but to this day remains unfinished.
I recently met representatives of Wigan Council, Warrington Borough Council and St Helens Borough Council, as well as the Mayor of Greater Manchester, and I am pleased to say that an agreement in principle has been reached to bring forward proposals to complete the bypass.
Will the Prime Minister also throw his support behind this vital project for my constituents in Leigh?
I commend my hon.
Friend for all his work bringing local authorities and the mayor together to drive this important project forward.
I know that the Rail Minister is meeting my hon.
Friend to  discuss this proposal and ensure that we can deliver things like this.
As part of Network North, there will be significant new funding announced for local highway improvements.
I would encourage my hon.
Friend to work with stakeholders to progress this important scheme and ensure that they can bid for that funding when it becomes available.
Can I ask the Prime Minister very simply, for the public record, whether he personally met Mr Akhil Tripathi in April last year prior to Mr Tripathi giving him £38,000 for the hire of a private jet?
All my declarations are made in the usual way according to the usual processes.
