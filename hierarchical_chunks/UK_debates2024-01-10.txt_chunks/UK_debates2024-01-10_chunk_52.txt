If people choose not to go down that route, and if they believe their losses are in excess of that, they can go down the full assessment route.
We are trying to make that as rapid as possible.
It is a process of alternative dispute resolution.
Potentially, things can happen very quickly, but if that cannot be agreed then it goes to an independent panel for assessment.
There is independence at every part of the process.
People going down that route can get interim payments if they are needed, so that they do not suffer financial hardship.
We are keen to make sure not only that people get a fair amount, but that it is also seen to be fair.
Independence is an essential part of that process.
