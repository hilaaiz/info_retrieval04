I welcome my right hon.
Friend’s work in this space.
The EU has taken a slightly different tack from us.
We want to foster innovation in AI, seize the opportunities for our public services and ensure that the jobs are located here in the UK.
That is why we have our domestic track—we will produce a White Paper shortly—and also why we introduced an international track and convened the entire world for the first ever global AI safety summit.
We are certainly leading in this area.
