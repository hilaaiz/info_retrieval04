I am very happy to term this “redress”; it is only about putting people back where they would have been, and trying to make good what has happened to them.
I understand what she says about compensation, but this is there to compensate people financially for losses and impacts on their lives.
I could not agree more that, as well as delivering compensation more quickly and fairly, the No. 1 thing we would like to happen is for more people to come forward.
A simplified process that does not require postmasters themselves to file an appeal will mean that this is done more quickly.
The routes to compensation have been simplified, and we very much hope that people will come forward.
That seems to be our experience right now.
We will continue to engage with the devolved Administrations to ensure that they have everything they need, as they may want to adopt similar measures.
