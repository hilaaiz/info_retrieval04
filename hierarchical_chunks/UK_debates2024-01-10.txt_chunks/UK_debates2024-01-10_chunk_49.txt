The Minister knows that the advisory board has been tied in a Gordian knot for quite a few months, which is why we wrote our letter to the Justice Secretary before Christmas.
He is right that this will be messy whichever way we do it, but it needs to be done, because people are still out there with convictions that need overturning.
I welcome the advisory board having discussions later this afternoon and in the next few weeks on how things should take place, but I urge the Minister—I know he will—to engage with all political parties in this House.
If we can get all parties’ support for the proposal, that will make it a lot stronger.
The point raised by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds)  about the pre-Horizon schemes is important.
I welcome the changes to the compensation, as they will speed things up for some victims, but in the case of those who have died whose convictions are overturned, will their estates be able to access compensation?
Once again, I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for all his work on this campaign over many years and for his work on the advisory board, which has been an essential part of seeking a resolution.
I will of course continue to work cross-party, as I have done all the way through on this matter, from the Back Benches and now from the Front Bench.
I appreciate the support and engagement we have had from all political parties in this area, both Front Benchers and Back Benchers.
Yes, we are cognisant of the pre-Horizon pilot scheme, and we will keep working to make sure the people involved are included in compensation.
Yes, if people have sadly passed away—over 60 have passed away waiting for compensation and justice—the compensation will go to their estate and therefore to their family.
That is an assurance I can give him.
