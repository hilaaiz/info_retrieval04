I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his response to my remarks.
I appreciate his offer to work with us and to stand with us to deliver compensation and the overturning of convictions.
The first step will be legislation; again, we are happy to work with him on that.
That may take some weeks to deliver, but the sooner, the better.
The introduction and passing of that legislation will be a matter for both Houses, but our intention is to get on with that very quickly.
