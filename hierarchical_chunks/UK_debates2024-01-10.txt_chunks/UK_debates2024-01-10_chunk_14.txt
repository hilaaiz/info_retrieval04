A recent study has shown that, through digitisation, the UK’s small businesses can generate £77.3 billion in additional revenue and create 885,000 new jobs in this country.
However, around four in 10 small businesses do not see new technology as relevant to their company and do not see tech investment as offering good value for money, citing a lack of skills and knowledge.
What is being done to ensure that small businesses are not left behind in the technological revolution?
We work very closely with the Department for Business and Trade on this agenda, and we work with the Department for Education on skills in general.
We have fantastic programmes such as Innovate  UK, which is helping to support businesses with the uptake of artificial intelligence.
We recently produced additional guidance, too.
