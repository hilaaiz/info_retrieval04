The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 10 January.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
Happy new year to you, Mr Speaker.
Now then, the Horizon Post Office scandal saw hundreds of innocent people sent to prison—people like a former constituent of mine who went to jail for three years.
During this scandal, the leader of the Liberal Democrats was the Minister in charge of the Post Office.
This is the same Liberal Democrat leader who in the past has called for the resignation of over 30 prominent people in this country who have made mistakes in their jobs.
So does the Prime Minister agree that the leader of the Lib Dems should take his own advice and start by clearing his desk, clearing his diary and clearing off?
This is one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in our nation’s history.
People who worked hard to serve their communities had their lives and reputations destroyed, through absolutely no fault of their own.
The victims must get justice and compensation.
Sir Wyn Williams’ inquiry is undertaking crucial work to expose what went wrong, and we have paid almost £150 million in compensation, to more than 2,500 victims.
But today I can announce that we will introduce new primary legislation to make sure that those convicted as a result of the Horizon scandal are swiftly exonerated and compensated.
We will also introduce a new up-front payment of £75,000 for the vital GLO—group litigation order—group of postmasters.
May I also thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake)  for all his hard work on this issue?
He will set out more details to the House shortly.
We will make sure that the truth comes to light, we right the wrongs of the past and the victims get the justice they deserve.
