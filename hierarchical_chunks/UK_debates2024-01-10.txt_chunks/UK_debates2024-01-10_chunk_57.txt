I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his willingness to work with us.
He and I have discussed the matter in the past few days, and I appreciate his expertise and advice.
Yes, absolutely; this is a very significant step and not one that we would take lightly.
We fully respect the independence of the courts.
We set out very clearly the reasons why this is different—that is important.
We are setting a precedent, but it is clear why we are doing so.
The involvement of private prosecutions is very relevant, and that also relates to work that he has done on the Justice Committee.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Justice has engaged with the people he refers to in the judiciary, to ensure that they understood what we were doing and why we were doing it.
Those conversations were constructive, rather than resisted, but I am very happy to take up my hon.
Friend’s offer to continue that engagement and to discuss the draft Bill with him.
