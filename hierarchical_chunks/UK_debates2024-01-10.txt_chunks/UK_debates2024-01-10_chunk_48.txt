I thank  the right hon.
Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Sir David Davis)  for securing this UQ.
I know the Minister wanted  to make a statement but was overruled by No. 10 so that the Prime Minister got the glory of making the announcement.
A serious point is that had we not got this UQ, there would have been no debate today, which is a disgrace.
