I agree entirely with the hon.
Lady that we need to be proactive in our message to people about coming forward, and in our message from the House that we are working together and that this process is now much more streamlined.
It will not even necessarily require sub-postmasters to make an application for their conviction to be overturned.
That will happen much more quickly, and any access routes we have now for compensation will be made swifter and more rapid.
I think those things alone will mean more people come forward.
As I said, we have seen a good number of new people come forward.
Hudgell, one of the solicitors involved in claims for some of the victims, have had, I think, 130 new people contact them on the basis of the TV programme and possibly because of the new actions we are taking to make sure compensation is more smoothly and easily available.
