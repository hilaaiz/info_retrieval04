I thank my hon.
Friend for holding me to account
and I very much share his sense of urgency.
His constituency has 86% gigabit-capable coverage, so it is above the average, but none the less I understand the frustration that people have when their premises are not covered.
I reassure him that I raised this matter with BDUK yesterday.
I want to get going as fast as possible.
We expect that procurement to be sorted in the summer.
