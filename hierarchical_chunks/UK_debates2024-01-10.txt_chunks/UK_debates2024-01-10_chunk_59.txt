I thank  the right hon.
Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Sir David Davis)  for securing the urgent question.
I am very much looking forward to cross-examining the Minister when he comes before the Business and Trade Committee next Tuesday, when we will be hearing evidence from Mr Bates and his colleagues.
We will also be putting questions to Fujitsu.
Can I push the Minister on the point I made on Monday night?
Three years after the landmark case, 85% of convictions have not been overturned, only 4% of the cases have resulted in a full and final settlement, and we have heard evidence from victims this week already that even when settlements have been made, the cash has not yet been handed over.
Can I ask the Minister again what his target is?
What is his goal, approximate or otherwise?
When will those wrongfully prosecuted have their full and final settlement delivered, in cash?
