I thank the hon.
Lady for her decades of service in the NHS, and commend all the work of our fantastic hard-working nurses in the NHS.
I am pleased that we have delivered early on our manifesto pledge to have 50,000 more nurses in the NHS, together with record numbers of doctors, elective surgical hubs and community diagnostic centres, all of which means that we are now treating more people in the NHS than we have ever done before.
One thing that is hampering progress on tackling the waiting lists is obviously industrial action, so I hope that the hon.
Lady will join the million NHS workers, including nurses, midwives, therapists, paramedics, consultants and specialty doctors, all of whom have reached a fair and reasonable pay settlement with the Government, and urge the junior doctors to do the same.
