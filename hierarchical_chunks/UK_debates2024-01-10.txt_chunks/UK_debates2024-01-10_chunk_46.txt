I welcome this legislation, and I thank the Minister for the amount of work he has done at such great speed.
We are still at a midway point in the journey.
There are still criminal prosecutions to come.
One question that has never been answered is just how much money was taken unlawfully from thousands of innocent men and women.
The Post Office took that money, and we have never known that figure.
Even the most basic accountant knows that it will run into hundreds of millions of pounds.
Could the Minister force the Post Office to publish the grand scale of the money it stole from people?
