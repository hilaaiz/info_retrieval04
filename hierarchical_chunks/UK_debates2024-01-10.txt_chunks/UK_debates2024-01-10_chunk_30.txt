I thank my hon.
Friend for raising what is a deeply concerning issue.
As I have said before, there is no place for antisemitism or the glorification of terrorism in Britain, especially not in our classrooms.
That is why we welcomed the recent report from Lord Mann, the Government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, and in particular his recommendation on how schools can tackle antisemitism.
We will continue to work together with Lord Mann on this vital issue.
I look forward to hearing further suggestions from my hon.
Friend, too.
