I thank my hon.
Friend for her important question.
She is right about the safety and wellbeing of children being paramount in our thoughts.
That is at the heart of the guidance that we have published for consultation.
Parents fundamentally must be involved in decisions about their children’s lives, and their involvement is a key part of the guidance.
She is right that there is a consultation process.
That is an opportunity for everyone to engage with the guidance.
I also agree that those championing safety or talking about the importance of biological sex should absolutely have the freedom to express those views.
She will see those views expressed in the guidance too.
