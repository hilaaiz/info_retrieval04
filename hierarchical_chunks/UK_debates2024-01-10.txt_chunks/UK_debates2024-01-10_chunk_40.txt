I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for the sterling work he did as my predecessor in this job.
Many people recognise the incredible work he did following the outcome of the court case with the compensation schemes that he instigated.
He is right that there is no perfect solution, but we have worked across Government to try to find the best possible one.
If we want a fast solution that, as he said, provides life-changing compensation to people who have been deprived of that in recent years, we believe that this is the best one.
