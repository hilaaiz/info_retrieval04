I thank the hon.
Lady for her remarks.
Although they were prosecuted under different authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the cases were generally prepared by the Post Office itself, so I do not think we have any greater confidence about the status of those convictions than we have in those in the rest of the UK.
We are therefore very keen to engage with the Scottish Administration on what we are doing.
Hopefully, there will be a consistent scheme across the UK.
