The other issue is getting people to come forward again, which has been one of the major problems in getting people to appeal their convictions.
We see the solution that we have adopted as very much the lesser of two evils.
Nevertheless, we are keen to discuss mitigations and safeguards with other Members of the House.
I set out one earlier on—the requirement to sign a statement of innocence—and I am keen to work with him to look at other mechanisms that we can use to ensure that those people who get their convictions overturned and access compensation are actually innocent of the charges.
My right hon.
Friend made the important point about Fujitsu, which has been raised many times.
As he knows, part of what the Government did was to put in place a statutory inquiry, chaired by Sir Wyn Williams.
It is due to complete by the end of the year, and, hopefully, it will report soon after.
At that point in time, we will be able to assess more clearly who is actually responsible.
Many people may have already formed a view on that, but we think it right that we follow a process to identify individuals or organisations who are responsible for the scandal.
Of course, we would expect those organisations to financially contribute.
There are financial and legal measures that we can take.
As regards individuals, it may be that there is sufficient evidence for the authorities to take forward individual prosecutions, and I think many in the House would welcome that.
