I am very much looking forward to appearing before the right hon.
Gentleman’s Select Committee and hearing some challenging questions, which I would welcome.
To be clear, 64% of all those affected by the scandal have received full and final compensation.
He talks about the smaller cohort who have come forward in relation to convictions.
Only 95 have had convictions overturned.
In order to try to expedite the payment of compensation to those people, we have introduced the fixed-sum award route, which is proving very successful.
I am not aware of his point  about people not actually receiving the cash, but I am very happy to engage with him on that, because there is every intention that once a decision has been taken to go down the fixed-sum award route, the sum is paid pretty much instantly.
I am very happy to find out what exactly is happening in those cases.
Where people have gone down a full assessment route, that is understandably more complex, as various considerations about loss, financial forensic information, health and reputational loss—a key facet in most of these cases—will be taken into account.
