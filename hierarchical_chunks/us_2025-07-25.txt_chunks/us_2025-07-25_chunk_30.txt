Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3633, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act.
S. 1582, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation in U.S. Stablecoins Act, and H.R. 1919, the AntiCBDC Surveillance State Act.
While I am opposed to these three bills, I am not opposed to the concept of crypto itself.
