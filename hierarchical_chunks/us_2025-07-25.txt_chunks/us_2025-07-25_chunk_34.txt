professional sports.
I also want to specifically commend the organization's investment in a state-of-the-art performance center in Centennial, purpose-built for the unique needs of professional women athletes.
This facility is a landmark achievement and a powerful statement about the value and importance of women's sports.
Most importantly, the players of Denver Summit FC will serve as powerful role models for our children, demonstrating the limitless possibilities that can be achieved through hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to excellence.
I want to extend my sincerest congratulations and a warm welcome to the players, coaches, staff, and ownership of Denver Summit FC.
We eagerly await the inaugural season and the excitement of cheering on our new home team.
The entire state of Colorado stands with them, and we look forward to celebrating their success for many years to come.
