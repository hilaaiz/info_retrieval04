Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating and honoring the life of a remarkable intern, student, and son, 
Mr. Ian Kalvinskas.
His ambition and legacy will be remembered for many years to come.
We join his family, friends, and community in celebrating a life lived with purpose, and in mourning a loss felt deeply by all who knew him.
