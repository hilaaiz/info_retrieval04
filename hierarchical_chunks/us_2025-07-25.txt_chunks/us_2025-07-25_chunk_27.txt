Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable, hard working, good natured man of labor: Bruce Baumhower from Toledo, Ohio in our 9th Congressional District.
Mr. Baumhower formally retired on June 30, 2025 after serving as the President of United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 12, the longest run of service in the union's history--over a half a century.
He will be honored at a special event prior to Toledo's 2025 Jeep Fest--a celebration he co-founded in 2016--on Saturday, August 2, 2025.
Bruce Baumhower is a Toledo native who graduated from Whitmer High School in 1972.
He started work at Jeep the same year.
Throughout his employment at Jeep, Bruce involved himself in union activities, rising through the ranks after election to Steward, Bargaining Committee and Vice Chairman.
In 1993 he was elected President of UAW Local 12, the second largest UAW local in the nation.
He has been ably at the helm since.
UAW Local 12, based in Toledo, represents approximately 16,000 members at 47 worksites.
His leadership is humble yet reliably strong and honorable, and always visionary.
Throughout Bruce's tenure as leader of UAW Local 12, he has steered the union--and the Toledo community--through crisis and calm.
Most notably, he led the effort to establish the plants and supplier park that built the Wrangler and the Gladiator, two locations that have defined Toledo's skyline and its workforce.
He has been an integral part of redefining Jeep as Toledo's identity and his integrity and work ethic symbolizes Toledo, Ohio--a city whose motto is: Laborare est Orare, ``To Work is to Pray.''
In addition to his duties as President of UAW Local 12, Bruce is president of the UAW's Community Action Program, which coordinates political and community action for all seven Toledo area UAW locals.
