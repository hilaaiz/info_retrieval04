Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to recognize the inspiring young women from the West Brownsville Little League's Senior Team, aged 15-16, for their astonishing achievement in finishing as runner-up as they competed for a spot in the 2025 Little League World Series.
Representing our community to the nation is an unseen achievement in the past 73 years of the team's history in Brownsville.
Competing in softball takes dexterity and discipline, but most importantly, sacrifice.
A tremendous commitment has been made by the participants and their families as they worked towards this exciting goal.
They are showing the country the hard work and team spirit that South Texans have always represented.
These young women have made their community, families, coaches and friends immensely proud, and I encourage them to continue supporting each other in the games ahead.
But most importantly, I encourage them to cherish every moment as they are making history in The Rio Grande Valley.
Rest assured I am cheering for you every step of the way.
