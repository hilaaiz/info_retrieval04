Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following letter, drafted by respected experts--including former Members of Congress--in the field of religious freedom, underscoring the dire state of religious freedom in Nigeria, and calling for that country to be designated a Country of Particular Concern under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998.
Their stark appraisal of the situation, and the immediate threat to the lives of thousands of Nigerians, merits immediate action by the administration.
