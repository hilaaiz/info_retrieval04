Mr. Baumhower currently also serves on the board of Imagination Station and the Regional Growth Partnership.
As one of the founders of Toledo's Jeep Fest, Bruce has further imprinted Jeep on Toledo.
It is said that he and another member had a conversation about Jeep's 75th anniversary.
From that moment, Jeep Fest was born.
Eight years later, it is a three day festival drawing thousands of people from all corners and highlighted by a parade of hundreds of iconic Jeeps.
Currently Bruce serves on the Board of Directors of Jeep Fest and leads off the parade with union members, who are both actively working and retired, all proud of Jeep's continuing and amazing success--America's most popular vehicle.
The parade celebrates and American success story led by union members who show great pride in their roles and led by an energetic President.
The great UAW pioneer Walter Reuther noted, ``There is no greater calling than to serve your fellow men.
There is no greater contribution than to help the weak.
There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.''
Bruce Baumhower epitomizes these words.
His noble spirit guides the Union and the City in which he has played such a pivotal role.
Now as he formally retires, we, wish him well on his journey, knowing he will be spending his time with his wife Kim, three children and eight grandchildren, engaged in all they most enjoy.
I thank Bruce for all he has given to our community and our Nation during a trying era for US automotive manufacturing.
He makes us proud.
May he enjoy a well-earned retirement.
May God Bless him unselfishly and continually.
