Mr. VARGAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Alicia Eugenia White Bell.
Alicia was born in Macon, Georgia on February 22, 1943 to parents John Alfred and Emmie Lucinda White.
They instilled in Alicia and her four siblings the value of education and a strong work ethic.
Alicia received a four-year scholarship to Paine College in Augusta, Georgia and graduated Salutatorian.
A woman of faith, courage, and strength, Alicia touched the lives of many people in San Diego and beyond.
Alicia met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and participated in the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement and the fight for justice and equality.
She also enlisted in the Domestic Peace Corps and worked with migrant workers before becoming a teacher at B.S. Ingram Elementary School and the lead teacher at Gingerbread Head Start Preschool in San Diego.
Alicia also worked for twenty years as a Deputy Probation Officer with the County.
Alicia was deeply committed to serving her community and giving back.
She owned and operated the Fourth District Seniors Resource Center gift shop, provided interior design services to low-income senior community residents at little to no cost, and was a motivational speaker and life coach.
Additionally, Alicia was the owner of ``Just Because'', a founding member of Ladies Involved in Vital Experiences, Inc. (L.I.V.E.), a past president of Encanto AARP Chapter 5417, a former board member and community ambassador for Fourth District Seniors Resource Center, and a coordinator for the Volunteers in Probation program.
Because of her incredible achievements.
Alicia received the Retired Seniors Volunteer Service Award from the County of San Diego and was an honoree for the ``Breakfast for Milady'' San Diego Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.
Alicia's legacy will live on.
My prayers are with her loved ones and may her memory be a blessing.
