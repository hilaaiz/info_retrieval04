made a lasting impact on our community and uplifted many young leaders across the country and in California's Eighth Congressional District.
APAPA's work is making great strides toward creating a more perfect Union.
Civic participation is critical to upholding our democratic ideals, and I am thrilled to see APAPA-SOC working so actively on this mission.
Asian and Pacific Islander Americans' representation at all levels of government is necessary to ensure that the Asian and Pacific Islander community is properly acknowledged and advocated for.
Throughout APAPA-SOC's ten years, its ability to empower Asian and Pacific Islander Americans of all ages has left its community a legacy that promotes civic engagement at the local, state, and national levels of government.
It is my greatest hope that the APAPA-SOC Chapter continues to prosper in the years ahead.
I look forward to seeing APAPA-SOC interns grow into tomorrow's leaders of California and beyond.
The APAPA-SOC's 10th Anniversary and Celebration of Young Leaders banquet is sure to be a wonderful celebration of all the hard work and dedication APAPA-SOC interns have put into strengthening our democracy.
As you celebrate this anniversary, I hope you take pride in how far your APAPA-SOC has come and feel inspired by the continued journey ahead.
On behalf of California's Eighth Congressional District, please accept my gratitude for the good you have done, and continue to do, in our district and my best wishes for continued success in all of APAPA-SOC's future endeavors.
Sincerely, John Garamendi, Member.
