What Sir Brian’s comprehensive report demonstrates is the terrible state that our once envied criminal justice system was left in by the shadow Lord Chancellor and his colleagues.
Does my hon.
and learned Friend agree with Sir Brian that digging ourselves out of the hole in which they left us will require more investment, greater efficiency and structural change?
Is that the debt that we owe to victims of crime in particular, to ensure that they get justice?
It is up to this Government to put right the wrongs that have been done over the past 14 years.
As ever, my hon.
Friend the Chair of the Justice Committee, gives a considered response and he is absolutely right.
There needs to be a recognition of the scale of the problem and two things are required: investment and reform.
When hon.
Members read the report, they will see that Sir Brian is very clear that we need investment.
This Government are already beginning to make that investment, through the additional Crown court sitting days that we have laid on this year; running the system at system max; additional funding for legal aid lawyers and criminal legal aid; and £92 million to keep the sector going, on both the defence and the prosecutorial sides.
We are making that investment but, critically, as Sir Brian makes absolutely clear, that alone will not be enough.[Official Report,  1 September 2025 ; Vol. 772, c. 2WC.]
(Correction)
We need to consider once-in-a-generation structural reforms that will run a sustainable, proportionate system that will allow us to deliver swifter justice for victims.
Investment and reform: that is what we will be getting on with and that is what we will report on in the autumn.
