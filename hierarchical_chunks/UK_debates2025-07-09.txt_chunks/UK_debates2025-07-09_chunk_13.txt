The Prime Minister still does not understand, so I am going to make it very simple for him: this is a mess of his own making—he should not be asking how we would clean it up.
The fact is this Government raised national insurance through the jobs tax, and that is why they have to put up council tax.
The truth is that his catastrophic Budget has created a domino effect that he cannot now control.
We on the Conservative Benches know that you cannot tax your way to growth, but now he is flirting—[Interruption.]
Labour Members are all muttering, but I remember that Budget.
They were laughing and cheering; they had no idea of the mess that they were creating.
They should go and explain to their constituents why unemployment is going up.
What is more worrying is that now the Prime Minister is flirting with Neil Kinnock’s demand for a wealth tax.
Let us be honest about what that means: it would be a tax on all our constituents’ savings, on their houses and on their pensions.
It would be a tax on aspiration.
Will the Prime Minister rule this out?
The right hon.
Lady says that we should not be asking them for advice on the economy.
She is absolutely right about that; we will not be asking for their advice.
What we did in the Budget was stabilise the economy through the measures taken by the Chancellor.
What has that led to?
Four interest rate cuts.
For mortgage holders, that is hugely important.
Compare  and contrast that with what happened under the Liz Truss mini-Budget.
We had the fastest growth in the G7 in the first quarter of this year; wages were up more in the first 10 months of a Labour Government than in the 10 years under the Tories.
So no, we do not need lessons from them.
