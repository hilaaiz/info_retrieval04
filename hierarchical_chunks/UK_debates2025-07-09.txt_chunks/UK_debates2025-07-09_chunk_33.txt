I thank the hon.
Gentleman and all those who perform the civic duty of participating in a jury for their service.
As I said, that will remain a cornerstone of British justice for the most serious cases, but that is not the issue.
The issue is that demand coming into the system simply outstrips the rate at which the courts are able to address and dispose of those cases.
We need to look at the system capacity, the amount of judicial time, the number of prosecutors and defence lawyers, and the availability of suitable court buildings, ushers and criminal legal aid.
We need all that system capacity, and we need to get it working together to address the challenges that others have outlined.
I remind the hon.
Gentleman that not only are 90% of our criminal trials heard in magistrates courts, but it remains a fact that magistrates courts deliver a turnaround of cases on average four or five times faster than in Crown courts.
That is swift justice for victims, and that is why we need to look at whole-system reform.
