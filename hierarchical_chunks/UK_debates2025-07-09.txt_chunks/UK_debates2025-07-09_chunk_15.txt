I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting that exciting proposal.
He is a fantastic advocate for Portland and South Dorset.
Eden Portland is a hugely exciting project.
I cannot confirm funding allocations yet, but our £240 million growth mission fund should support transformative projects that give local leaders real investment to deliver real change.
He makes a compelling case in relation to the fund.
