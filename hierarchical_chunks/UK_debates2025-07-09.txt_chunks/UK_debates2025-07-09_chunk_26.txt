I thank the Prime Minister for leading from the front in promoting the importance of his role as a father and keeping time for family life.
I am delighted that in the past week, the Government have launched a review into parental leave and started to rebuild the legacy of Sure Start by launching our Best Start family hubs.
Both of those will make a huge difference to my constituents in Ribble Valley.
Can he commit to the parental leave review creating some truly ambitious outcomes, so that we can make the UK not only a world-leading place to live and do business, but the best place in the world to live a rewarding family life?
