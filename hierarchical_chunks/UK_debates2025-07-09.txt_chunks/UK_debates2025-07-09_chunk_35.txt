I thank the Minister for her statement and for the recognition of the importance of magistrates courts.
Sadly, Harlow magistrates court was closed by the previous Government—as was Chorley magistrates court, of course.
I recently spoke to a police officer in my constituency who has been a police officer for three years.
He is being asked to gather evidence to go to court for crimes committed before he was even a police officer.
Is it any wonder that victims have lost confidence in the system?
This Government need to ensure that we have fundamental reforms to this process to ensure that people in my constituency get the justice they deserve.
