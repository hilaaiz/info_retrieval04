May I associate myself and my party with the Prime Minister’s comments about the horrifying terrorist bombing of 7/7 here in London?
Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and our emergency services.
May I also join in sending condolences to the family of Lord Tebbit.
He was a man of service—in the RAF, in politics and as a carer for his wife, Margaret.
He will be greatly missed.
After years of Conservative neglect, the special educational needs system is in desperate need of repair, but with parents understandably worried, we already hear Labour MPs planning another rebellion, so may I make this offer to the Prime Minister?
If he genuinely wants to fix the problem and not strip away the rights of children and parents in some cost-cutting exercise, we have 72 votes to help.
Will the Prime Minister look at the five tests for SEND reform that we have published today and work with us to make it happen?
It is telling that when the right hon.
Gentleman asks about the broken SEND system, the Tory Back Benchers laugh; that is how seriously they take their responsibility.
It is an absolute shame.
As the right hon.
Gentleman knows, every week in this House, Members raise the issue with me—I think it has been raised with me more times than anything else.
Everyone knows that the SEND system is broken; guess who broke it, along with everything else?
The system does not work for parents and it lets down children, so we need to reform and change it.
It is not about saving money; we have already invested an additional £1 billion in SEND.
It is about creating a new system that truly supports every child.
We are developing proposals, and we want to work with parents and teachers to get this right.
I would expect the right hon.
Gentleman to welcome that.
