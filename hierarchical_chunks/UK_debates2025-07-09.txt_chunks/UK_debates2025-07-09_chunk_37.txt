The Minister rightly points to the comparative inefficiency between Crown courts and magistrates courts.
The clear issue is that we need new technology to be introduced to Crown courts, so that people who are on trial and victims are served faster, quicker and more expediently.
The reality is that many cases collapse as a result of the evidence not being sufficient or brought fast enough.
Why, then, has the Minister allowed the efficiencies part of the Leveson report to be delayed?
That could bring forward much-needed recommendations that we could action to cut the backlog.
