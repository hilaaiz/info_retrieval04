Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and recognize the Reeves-Reed Arboretum on their 50-year anniversary.
I am grateful to be able to celebrate this incredible milestone with the Reeves-Reed family and our community.
The Reeves-Reed Arboretum is a beautiful natural setting of a forest and gardens that engages, enriches, and teaches its visitors about environmental stewardship.
For the past 50 years, they have shown their dedication to our community through programs and activities for all ages to grow through connecting with nature.
Reeves-Reed has something for everyone, including summer camps for children, gardening and hiking groups, scout events, and many opportunities to learn and reflect.
As a non-profit organization, the Arboretum and its staff are dedicated to their mission of helping our community and being an educational and spiritual resource for its visitors.
Reeves-Reed is also a cornerstone of Summit's cultural landscape, and its 13.5 acres are listed on both the National and State Registers.
As we reflect on the past 50 years at Reeves-Reed they have exceeded the expectations and I know they will continue to do so for the next 50 years to come.
I am honored to have such an amazing community in the 7th Congressional District, and I look forward to what is to come.
