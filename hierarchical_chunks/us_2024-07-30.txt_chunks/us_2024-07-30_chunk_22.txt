Mr. Hughes was also well known for his incredible athletic skills.
Bill played on the Marine Corps football team and was a highly talented bowler.
Bill and his wife Nancy are survived by their three children, William, Martha, and Jennings.
Mr. Hughes was a hardworking individual who will be missed greatly by his family, friends, and coworkers.
I send my most sincere condolences to Bill's wife and three children.
My thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends in this moment.
