Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and congratulate Westfield High School track coach Christopher Tafelski on his recent designation by the U.S. Boys' Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) as the 2024 Boys' High School Track and Field Coach of the Year for the State.
This is not Coach Tafelski's first award from the USTFCCCA, and I am certain it will not be his last.
Coaching for the track and field and cross country programs at Westfield High School since 2004, Tafelski, a WHS alum himself, has worked to build a team that is not only awardwinning, but one with a strong sense of community.
Tafelski has led the renowned WHS track and field and cross country teams to multiple national qualifications and state championship titles among countless other accolades.
I am honored to have such a dedicated coach and educator in out district, and I look forward to seeing both Coach Tafelski and the Westfield track and field and cross country programs continue to thrive in the years to come.
