Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of William Arthur ``Bill'' Hughes, who sadly passed at the age of 96.
Bill served for three years in the United States Marine Corps and attended the FAA Aeronautical Center in Oklahoma City, which launched him into his 28-year career as a dedicated air traffic controller.
After his time in Oklahoma City, Bill and his beloved wife, Nancy, lived in Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Isle of Hope.
After settling down in Isle of Hope, Bill began his second career as a ``starter'' of one of Skidaway Island's golf courses.
