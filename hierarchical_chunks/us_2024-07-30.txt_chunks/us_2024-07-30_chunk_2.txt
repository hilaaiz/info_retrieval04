Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a truly remarkable milestone--the 100th birthday of 
Mr. Jack Richtman, a true American hero.
Jack's life is a testament to resilience, service, and the enduring power of family.
A longtime resident of Elburn, Illinois, Jack served our Nation with distinction during World War II.
Six months after DDay, he landed on the beaches of Normandy, bravely fighting in six battles as a gunner on a mortar unit for the Army's 71st Infantry Division.
His contributions were instrumental in aiding Allied forces in post-war efforts throughout Europe.
