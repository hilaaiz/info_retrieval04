Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Golfweek Super Senior National Championship Winner Stevie Cannady.
Mr. Cannady turned 65 in early January, making 2024 his inaugural season in the Super Senior division.
Prior to his National Championship victory, he had his best finish of 2024 in early May at the Lowcountry Senior invitational, placing in the top 5.
He hit 86 percent of fairways and 89 percent of greens with a final-round score of 70, jumping up to the lead and placing first in the National Championship.
Aside from his many golf achievements, 
Mr. Cannady owns a logistics company specializing in trucking, warehousing, and commercial real estate.
Cannady is a valued member of our community and a force on the golf course.
Congratulations to 
Mr. Cannady on an amazing accomplishment, and I can't wait to see what he achieves next.
