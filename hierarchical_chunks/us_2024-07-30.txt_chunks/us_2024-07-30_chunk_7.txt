Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 76th anniversary of City Market, the supplier to Sea Island Corporation and many other restaurants in South Georgia.
City Market was founded in 1848 in Brunswick by Harold Sigmund and E.W. Stanford, Sr. Upon E.W. Stanford, Sr.'s death that same year, his 18-year-old son and E.W. ``Captain Red'' Stanford, Jr. took over the business.
The two eventually bought out 
Mr. Sigmond and continued building a great reputation for the business.
City Market then moved to its current location on Gloucester Street in 1969.
After his passing, Captain Red left the legacy of City Market to his grandson, Frank ``Little Red'' Owens, Jr., as well as his brother and sons, Walker and Wyatt Owens.
Left to run the packing house was his son-in-law, Bruce Collins, Sr. Through the dedication of the family and its loyal customers, City Market has continued to grow and prosper.
Congratulations to City Market, a true family business, on 76 years of success and hard work.
