Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Sue Harrison, the former President of the Pebble Creek Republican Club.
Sue has distinguished herself by providing exceptional service to the residents of the Pebble Creek area of Goodyear, Arizona.
Sue has worked tirelessly to educate, train, and inspire the next generation of citizens through civic engagement.
The efforts of Sue and the Pebble Creek Republican Club have been pivotal to the success of elected officials and candidates in the Phoenix West Valley.
I am thankful for Sue's leadership and dedication to conservative principles.
I sincerely appreciate her service to the 8th Congressional District and the State.
