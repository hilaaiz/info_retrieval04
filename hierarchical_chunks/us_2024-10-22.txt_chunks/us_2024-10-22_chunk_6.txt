Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Paul Carver, the Chairman of Republican Legislative District 2, which is in the north central area of Phoenix and has a population of over 246,000.
As chairman, Paul has worked tirelessly to educate, train, and inspire the next generation of citizens through civic engagement.
His efforts to ensure Republicans are elected in Maricopa County have been instrumental to the success of Legislative District 2 and beyond.
I am thankful for Paul's leadership and dedication to conservative principles.
I sincerely appreciate his service to the legislative district and to the state.
