Mr. COMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Debra Hembree Lambert on being elected to be the first female Chief Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court.
She has served as a judge for seventeen years, including six years on the Kentucky Supreme Court.
I have had the privilege of getting to know Justice Lambert over the years.
I have always admired her commitment to ensuring every person in Kentucky receives the impartial justice they deserve.
During her time on Kentucky's Supreme Court, Justice Lambert has headed the Kentucky Judicial Commission on Mental Health, which works to address Kentuckians' mental health needs, through improvements to the judicial system.
Justice Lambert serves many counties in the 1st Congressional District, and they are served well due to her hard work and dedication on our state's highest court.
I congratulate Justice Lambert on her election to this prestigious position.
I am confident that Kentucky will continue to greatly benefit from her leadership.
