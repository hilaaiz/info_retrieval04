Ms. JAYAPAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. David Baker on winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
The Nobel Prize award recognizes Dr. Baker's tremendous achievement in utilizing computational protein design to turn amino acids into proteins.
He has made significant strides in the field of biochemistry through his groundbreaking research and has trailblazed various methods to build new proteins.
Dr. Baker is currently a Professor of Biochemistry at the University faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize.
Dr. Baker's research has been described as visionary.
His lab pioneered the field by developing much protein design.
Dr. Baker's research has helped analyze database information about existing proteins to develop new proteins that do not exist in nature.
His success has allowed for the creation of novel proteins to tackle some of the greatest challenges in medicine, technology, and sustainability.
He has deepened scientific understanding of protein prediction and made immense contributions to biochemistry research.
Dr. Baker's career has been remarkable--to date, he has published more than 640 peer-reviewed research papers, been awarded more than 100 patents, and co-founded 21 biotechnology companies.
I was proud to secure $550,000 for the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington where Dr. Baker's lab is housed.
I am committed to ensuring that Washington's 7th Congressional District remains a hub for science and innovation.
Scientists like Dr. Baker are at the forefront of innovation and must have the resources to continue to change our understanding of the world.
On behalf of Washington's 7th Congressional District, I would like to congratulate Dr. David Baker on receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
I am so proud to recognize his tremendous contributions to science and innovation.
