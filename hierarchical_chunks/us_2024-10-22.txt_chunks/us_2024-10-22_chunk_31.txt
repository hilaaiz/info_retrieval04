Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing former Mayor Christopher Brown for his outstanding service and enduring commitment to the Town of Dumfries, Virginia.
His legacy as a public servant, business leader, and admired community member will continue to influence and inspire future generations in Virginia.
