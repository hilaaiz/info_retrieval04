shortly after graduating from Dollar Bay High School in 1969.
After completing training at Great Lakes Naval Training Center, Camp Pendleton, and Coronado, Ray was deployed to Vietnam where he was stationed at TanAn and assigned to a Riverboat base, supporting combat operations throughout Vietnam as a central maintenance hub for U.S. watercraft.
Ray returned home from his service just in time for Thanksgiving in 1971, earning the National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal for his time overseas.
He began his civilian career in the Western UP at the White Copper Mine, and upon its closure, obtained a Civil Engineering Degree from Michigan Technological University.
Ray went on to lead large civil engineering projects throughout the UP, culminating with the critical HW-58 project in Grand Marais.
Ray's emphasis on service above self did not stop there, as he has been incredibly active within the Veteran community, serving in numerous capacities throughout the American Legion, including Post 44 Commander, 12th District Commander, and the 5th Zone Commander--spanning the entire Upper Peninsula over the past 20 years.
As one of the most active and dedicated individuals in the region, Ray also serves the community during Bingo at the Jacobetti Home for Veterans and Marquette County Fair, Boys State, and the Post 44 youth raffle.
Ray also has even coached baseball for the American Legion teams.
Reigniting a passion for the sport he enjoyed in his childhood, Ray's time as a baseball coach has also helped many young men who received his mentorship and guidance--both on and off the field--as they have come through the Legion summer ball program.
