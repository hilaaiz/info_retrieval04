Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gregory ``Don'' Hunsucker, a beloved husband, brother, father, and leader.
Born on August 29, 1947, Gregory was one of two sons born to Gragrie and Jolene (Frazier) Hunsucker.

True to his virtues, Don not only walked again but went on to pursue his athletic aspirations at Parlier High school and even college after.
Parlier High is also where Don met the love of his life, Linda Mae, who he described as the prettiest girl he ever saw.
Lucky for him, her devotion matched his infatuation and the two shared a bond for the next 55 years, dedicating their lives to their greatest gifts, Jerry and Michelle.
As a husband and father, 
Mr. Hunsucker cherished every moment with his family.
Whether it was dressing up as Santa on Christmas or teaching them how to throw a football, he always made sure to not just tell them he loved them but showed them as well.

Representative and Organizer for the Retail Clerks International Association.
Eventually, he became the Union
