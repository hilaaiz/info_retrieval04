Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, today, we gather to pay tribute to a legendary figure in the world of motorsports, Bill Vukovich, Jr., who recently passed away at the age of 79.
Bill Vukovich, Jr., a native of Fresno, California, was not only a highly accomplished racer but also an integral part of a racing dynasty that left an indelible mark on the sport.
Bill Vukovich, Jr. began his racing career in 1965 and continued until 1983 competing in the IndyCar Series and USAC Championship.
His talent and determination on the track earned him recognition, including the title of the 1968 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year.
Over the years, he participated in the Indy 500, achieving six top-10 finishes, including a memorable second-place finish in 1973.
However, what set the Vukovich family apart was not just individual success but their unique status as a three-generation racing family: Bill Vukovich, Jr., his father Bill Vukovich, Sr., and his son Bill Vukovich, III became the first, three-generation family, to compete in the prestigious Indianapolis 500.
Their ascent from being local racing heroes in the heart of the Central Valley to the grandeur of the Indy stage deeply resonated with the local community, providing them with cherished figures to fervently rally behind.
Tragically, alongside their triumphs, the Vukovich family also endured profound losses.
Bill Vukovich, Sr., a two-time Indianapolis 500 champion, tragically lost his life in a racing accident in 1955.
Bill Vukovich, Jr. was just 11 years old at the time, forever marked by the radio broadcast that informed him of his father's fatal crash.
Then, in 1990, another devastating blow struck the family when Bill Vukovich, III lost control of his car during practice at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield, resulting in a fatal crash.
Bill Vukovich, Jr. was 46 when he tragically lost his only son, known affectionately as ``Billy.''
Reflecting on these unimaginable losses, Bill Vukovich, Jr. once said, ``It happened to me twice--the impossible happened twice.''
The biography of the Vukovich family published in 2012, authored by Bones Bourcier, revealed the profound impact of these tragedies, especially the loss of Billy Vukovich, III, on Bill Vukovich, Jr., describing it as a ``total loss of control.''
In 1981, Bill Vukovich, Jr. was rightfully inducted into the Fresno Athletic Hall of Fame, joining his father, who was part of the 1959 induction class, and his son, who was honored in 2007.
Throughout his racing career, Bill Vukovich, Jr. participated in 158 races, achieving Top 10 finishes an impressive 85 times.
His journey included thrilling Saturday nights at Kearney Bowl, a now-defunct dirt oval track in southwest Fresno.
In 2019, the City of Fresno paid tribute to the Vukovich racing legacy by placing a memorial in front of Selland Arena in downtown Fresno.
Today, as we remember Bill Vukovich, Jr., we can find solace in the thought that he has found peace and has reunited with his beloved son.
