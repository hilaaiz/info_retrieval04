Mr. LARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record the following press release from Veterans For Peace, brought to my attention by Jim Brasile, a constituent and leader of a local chapter of Veterans For Peace who cares passionately about the situation in Gaza.
While I may have a difference in opinion with some of the content, I feel that in a democracy, it is important to consider a variety of viewpoints.
Mr. Brasile witnessed the violence of war first-hand when he served in Vietnam as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps.
Since then, he has been a steadfast advocate against conflict and for non-aggression.
I thank 
Mr. Brasile for his service to our country and commend him for his commitment to peace.
