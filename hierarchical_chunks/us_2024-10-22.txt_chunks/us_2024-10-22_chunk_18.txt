Mr. Hunsucker continued to help and honor workers of the Central Valley by becoming President of the UFCW Local 1288 Retiree's Club where he was instrumental in founding Union Park, and Workers Memorial Foundation, Inc.
For all of these efforts and more, Don was named Labor Leader of the Year three times in his lifetime.
In addition to his commitment to labor, Don was extremely involved within his community as well.
For example, he helped raise money for the Cancer Society, Leukemia Society, Muscular Dystrophy and the Fresno State Boosters Club.
He also served as a board member for several organizations including United Way, the Easter Seal Society, and the City of Fresno's Bid Compliance Committee.
Don truly did it all and was more than deserving of all the recognition he received, including the Key to the City of Fresno as well as the City.
Despite his countless achievements, Don always remained true to the virtues he learned as a child and committed his life to fighting for what he felt was right.
He was a leader of the community and his willingness to stand up for others was admired by many.
Although his love and thoughtfulness will be missed greatly by those fortunate to know him, his legacy will live on through the love of his life, Linda Mae, and their greatest gifts, Michelle and Jerry.
