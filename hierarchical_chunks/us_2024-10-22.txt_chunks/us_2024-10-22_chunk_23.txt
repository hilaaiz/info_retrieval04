Mr. Haskins was a founding member of the Cardinal Criminal Justice Academy, serving as Chairman of the Governing Council for 10 years.
His experience on the Executive Committee of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, which included a stint as President, allowed him to advocate for law enforcement officials and improve department practices.
His outstanding service to the Commonwealth of Virginia and City of Salem would last two decades until his retirement at the end of 1995.
The City of Salem elected 
Mr. Haskins in 1996 to serve on City Council.
I worked with 
Mr. Haskins during his time as Chief of Police and as a member.
He was a classic southern gentleman, and it was an honor to know him.
The recognition of 
Mr. Haskins' character and accomplishments is evident.
He received in 1996 the Roanoke College Medal, the highest honor bestowed on Roanoke College alumni who best exemplify the ideals of leadership, integrity and citizenship that Maroons hold dear.
He also received the Boy Scouts.
He is survived by his loving wife, Judith Barrett Haskins; daughters and husbands, Melanie and Scott Leweke of Blue Ridge, Virginia, and Kathryn and Kevin Glasgow of Georgia; and Nadine Kelley of Roanoke, mother of his children.
Also surviving are stepchildren, Will Abernethy of Roanoke, Nathan and Julie Abernethy of Roanoke, Whitney Miller of Dillwyn, and Steve Wilson and Ken Wilson.
Surviving grandchildren are Greg and Sam Glasgow, Emma and Mary Leweke, and step-grandchildren Kaylee and Rachel Goin, Elijah, Nora and Isaac Abernethy.
The City of Salem and the law enforcement community is forever grateful to Chief Haskins, the professionalism he embodied during his law enforcement career, and his dedication to the safety and well-being
