The Minister has told the House that the Government would not impose any new costs on the ceramics industry, but we know that they are going to increase carbon taxes, which will kill off energy-intensive industries.
Does she not see that this is a totally incoherent policy position?
There was no coherence under the previous Government, and there will be coherence under this Government.
We are developing our plan of support for our foundational industries in the industrial strategy.
I know that the Opposition are very keen to see what the industrial strategy will contain.
They will have to wait a few weeks for its publication, but all will be revealed in due course.
