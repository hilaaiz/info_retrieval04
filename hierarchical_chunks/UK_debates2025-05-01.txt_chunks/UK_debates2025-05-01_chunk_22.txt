Pubs and restaurants are part of a thriving hospitality sector in my constituency.
What initiatives is the Department  planning to support such small businesses and boost economic growth in Colne Valley?
Of course, I invite the Minister to visit my constituency and experience our fantastic hospitality sector.
The hon.
Member for Farnham and Bordon (Gregory Stafford)  might not invite Ministers to his constituency, but I am grateful for my hon.
Friend’s invitation—diary permitting, I would be delighted to come along.
Last year, my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State announced our plans for a business growth service, which should make it easier for UK businesses to get Government advice and support in order to grow.
I hope that will make a real difference.
In addition, we are considering what else we can do to unlock better access to finance for small businesses such as those in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
