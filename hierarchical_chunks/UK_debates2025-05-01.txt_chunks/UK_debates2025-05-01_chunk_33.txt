My hon.
Friend  the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Gareth Snell)  is an enormous champion of the ceramics industry, and he is right to bring this question to the House today, but this issue is wider than simply the ceramics sector.
Tata Steel has told our Committee that energy prices are the single biggest factor in its lack of competitiveness, and Nissan has told us that electricity prices at its plant in Sunderland are the highest of any Nissan plant in the world.
We have recommended that the Government bring energy prices in line with our European competitors; can the Minister tell us today that she shares that ambition?
