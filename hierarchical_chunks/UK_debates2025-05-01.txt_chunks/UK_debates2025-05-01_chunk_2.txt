I thank my hon.
Friend for that question, and I commend her for the business roundtable that she hosted.
She is absolutely right, and we recognise that supply chain instability is a critical issue for businesses.
We are therefore working hard to minimise the uncertainty that businesses face, both in exporting and in purchasing from key markets.
Whether through the economic deal with the US that we are seeking to negotiate, the reset of our relationship with the EU, or new opportunities with  India and the Indo-Pacific, we are keen to take down barriers to business.
I have to say that the evidence continues to demonstrate that free and fair trade drives down prices, offers better choices for consumers and, crucially, leads to more stable supply chains.
