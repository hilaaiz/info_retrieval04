The entirety of this Government, however, have been clear that we are not seeking to pick between one market and another—both are absolutely fundamental.
The Chancellor’s comments specifically relate to the  simple truth that there is a much greater quantum of UK-EU trade than UK-US trade.
Equally, though, in all these negotiations, we have to focus on not just what can be done quickly, but what can be done right and in the national interest.
There is no point securing an agreement that does not deliver on our objectives, no matter whom that agreement is with.
We will welcome any support from the Conservatives for the work we are trying to do.
I do believe it is easier politically for this Government to do some trade agreements that are available to the UK; some may not have been politically available to the Conservative Government.
We will continue to do that work, and we welcome all support for it, from across the House.
