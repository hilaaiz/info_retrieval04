I thank my hon.
Friend for her championing of her constituency.
I am still to visit, and I must do that, because I know she has many exciting places for me to see.
Electrifying industry is crucial.
The Climate Change Committee has said that that is the route and that 61% of industry will need to be electrified.
We need to make sure we do that.
We are looking through the spending review process, as I am sure she would expect, at how we can support industries to make that change to electric and how we can help with some of the capital costs, which will lead to lower costs in the longer term.
Making that leap can be difficult, and that is what we are looking at through the spending review.
