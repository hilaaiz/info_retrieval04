I welcome the progress being made in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency—I thought he was about to invite me there, which is often the case at topical questions, but I sadly did not manage to secure an invitation.
I have been absolutely clear: I genuinely wish the inheritance of this Government was a better one in economic terms than the one we received.
I genuinely wish the Conservative Government had not left that black hole and that we had not had to make difficult decisions, but life is sometimes about difficult decisions, and Government and business certainly are as well.
Without investment in infrastructure, without a serious approach to the fiscal rules, which was absent for much of the last Government, and without investment in the health service, we would struggle.
I welcome the success he is talking about; I am always keen to work with him on that.
