The hon.
Member is right to raise this issue, and the figure for manufacturing in Northern Ireland of 15% or 16% is high.
Yesterday, I was with trade unionists from Shorts Brothers—Spirit AeroSystems —to talk about the importance of manufacturing there and the importance of retaining those jobs.
They made the point that these good jobs have helped not just with  people’s lives, but with the sectarian divides.
Bringing people out of poverty and giving them good, well-paid jobs is an incredibly important part of the history of Northern Ireland and of what we need to preserve there.
I will continue to work with him to make sure we protect that manufacturing base.
We of course had huge support in the Budget, with the £2 billion for the automotive sector and the £1 billion for the aerospace sector to support exactly that manufacturing industry.
