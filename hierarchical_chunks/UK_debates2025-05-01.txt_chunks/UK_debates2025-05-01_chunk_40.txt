I thank the Minister very much for her answers.
Manufacturing currently represents less than 10% of the UK economy, but in Northern Ireland it represents 16% of the economy and about one in four families in Northern Ireland are dependent on manufacturing.
It is clear that, as energy prices rise, so do the concerns for such industries.
How can the Government and the Minister offer support to those industries to retain their viability while the Government are finding an energy solution?
