It is good to hear that the trade negotiations with India, which began when we were in government, are progressing well.
There must surely now be an opportunity to reopen talks with Canada, so it can buy more wonderful cheese from the UK.
With the tariff clock ticking, I am sure the Secretary of State recognises that the US deal is the most urgent; many UK jobs are at risk.
However, we heard recently from the Chancellor, when she was in the States, that her bigger priority is discussions with the EU, where we already have zero tariffs and zero quotas.
Does the Secretary of State share the Chancellor’s priorities, or does he think the US is more urgent?
