The Secretary of State says that all the funding required for the nationalisation of British Steel will come out of existing budgets.
We have seen his Department’s budget—we had an estimates day debate in the House not long ago—and there was no unallocated pot.
Could he be a little more specific about exactly which budget the money is coming from?
The shadow Secretary of State points to the statement in which I said that in the previous budget there was a £2.5 billion allocation for the green steel fund.
Of course, that came in addition to the £500 million for the Port Talbot transformation, which was agreed under the previous Government but was not in the Departmental accounts—as he knows, it was in a heavily oversubscribed Treasury reserve.
Yes, the green steel fund will be there to support what we have had to do at Scunthorpe.
Again, as I said when Parliament was recalled, the question there was whether we would pay a significant amount of money for the total loss of the business; give a large amount of money to Jingye, but without the certainty that it would be able to deliver on that plan; or step in and take the action that we did, which I am confident was the right option for value for money and for Scunthorpe.
