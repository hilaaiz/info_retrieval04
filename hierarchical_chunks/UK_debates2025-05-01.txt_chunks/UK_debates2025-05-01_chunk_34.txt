I thank my right hon.
Friend the Committee Chair for his question.
Of course this is a huge issue.
Under the previous Government, industrial energy prices doubled, and as my right hon.
Friend says, we have higher prices than many other countries.
The 3,000 people who responded to our consultation on the industrial strategy said that energy, skills and access to finance were their top three issues, so we are absolutely aware of the issue.
We are looking at what support we can provide and how we can make our country more competitive, both for the people who are looking to invest in the UK and for our existing manufacturing base.
