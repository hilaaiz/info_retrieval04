JLR, the supply chain and the small businesses in it are crucial, not just for the constituency, but in exporting.
I have written to the Secretary of State asking for a meeting, and I am very willing to work with the Government on this.
I recently visited Washington and spoke to Congress people about the damage that tariffs can do.
What is the Minister doing to help not just JLR, but those small businesses, and how we can work together?
I know my right hon.

Member to discuss this issue, because we recognise that this is a key concern of the automotive sector.

One of the roadshows we are organising for small businesses is about that.
