The Secretary of State was asked— What recent steps his Department has taken to encourage small businesses to export.
What recent steps his Department has taken to encourage small businesses to export.
We have begun a series of roadshows, which bring overseas buyers to the UK to meet small businesses here in, for example, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, life sciences, technology, and digital, creative, financial and professional services.
In addition, we are offering new online support to help small and medium-sized enterprises win new export orders to EU markets.
I know from a recent business roundtable I hosted in my constituency of Bathgate and Linlithgow, and from many meetings with industry, that a common barrier to small business exports is supply chain instability.
In the past few years, we have seen massive instability, including from the impact of the pandemic and now from the announcement of tariffs.
Disrupted demand forecasting, increased costs of raw materials and uncertainty are damaging fledgling businesses in growing their exports.
What specific measures is the Department implementing to help small businesses navigate these challenges, and to ensure they can maintain reliable supply chains as we enter another turbulent time for international trade?
