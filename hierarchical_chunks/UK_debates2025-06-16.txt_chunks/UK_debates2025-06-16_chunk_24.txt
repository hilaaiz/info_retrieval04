I thank the Minister for that response.
As an adoptive parent and a foster carer, I know the transformative effect that early permanence can have on the lives of children in care.
It is not right for every child or for every parent, but adoption agencies could make much wider use of it.
Would the Minister be willing to meet me and adoption charities to discuss how we can maximise the benefits of early permanence?
