I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important topic; he is a champion for children in Cannock Chase.
I agree that we should continue to promote early permanence.
Adoption England has published national standards to promote and shape early permanence practice across the country.
I regularly meet the organisations my hon.
Friend has mentioned, but I am more than happy to meet him, too.
