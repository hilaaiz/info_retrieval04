I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of the statement, although when I listened to it, I could not believe my ears.
It was as if this was the Government’s plan all along, when we all know it is another U-turn.
After months of pressure, the Prime Minister has finally accepted our call for a full, statutory, national inquiry into grooming gangs, and I welcome our finally reaching this point.
We must remember that this is not a victory for politicians—especially not for the ones, like the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister, who had to be dragged to this position.
This is a victory for the survivors, who have been calling for this for years.
However, I have been speaking to many who do not have confidence that a Government who ignored their concerns will deliver.
