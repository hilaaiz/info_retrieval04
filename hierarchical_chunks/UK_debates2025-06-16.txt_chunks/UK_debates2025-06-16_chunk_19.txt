Ministers recently announced that they were axing level 7 apprenticeships.
Strangely, they made the announcement during recess; and also strangely, it was only the day after the announcement that they finally answered my parliamentary question from April, revealing that they were making a 90% cut in those apprenticeships.
This is  blowing a huge hole in the NHS workforce plan, leading to a shortfall of 11,000 nurses.
If Ministers will not listen to the many employers saying that this will make it much more difficult for people who are not so well-off to get into the professions, will they at least rule out cutting level 6 apprenticeships next?
I can reassure the shadow Minister that level 6 apprenticeships are a core part of our offer, and we will continue to fund them.
I also say politely to him that we will take no lessons from Liz Truss’s previous Health Minister; that Government left our NHS on its knees, and we are having to rebuild it from its foundations again.
