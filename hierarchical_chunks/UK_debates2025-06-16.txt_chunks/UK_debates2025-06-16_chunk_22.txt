I thank the Minister very much for her answers.
Worryingly, obesity levels are predicted to rise between 20% and 30% in the next five to 10 years.
To combat that, physical education is important, as is the Government looking at children’s diets at school.
Those two things can address obesity, so I am keen to hear the Minister’s thoughts on them.
