I welcome the Government’s plans to create those 120,000 training opportunities for young people, including these higher-level apprenticeships.
However, we know that there are significant shortages of those able to provide training and mentorship.
With only 65% of 55 to 64-year-olds employed, does the Minister agree that there is an opportunity to retrain older workers so they can pass on their experience to the next generation?
