I thank the hon.
Lady for her question and for the concern she has expressed.
The adoption and special guardianship support fund has not been cut.
Demand is ever increasing, and we have chosen an approach to manage tight resources in the face of increasing demand for support.
The adoption and special guardianship support fund still enables those eligible to access a significant package of therapeutic support tailored to meet their individual needs.
