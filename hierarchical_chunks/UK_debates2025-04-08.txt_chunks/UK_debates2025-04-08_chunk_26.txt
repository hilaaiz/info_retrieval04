What discussions she is having with Cabinet colleagues on helping to improve high streets in Liverpool Riverside constituency.
Liverpool City Region combined authority will benefit from the £900 million UK shared prosperity fund, which will allow authorities to invest in local communities such as my hon.
Friend’s.
From the start of 2026-27, her combined authority will receive a single flexible pot through its integrated settlement.
Integrated settlements will allow local leaders across the UK to deliver important projects for their areas, including high streets.
To fulfil our manifesto pledge, we intend to introduce permanently lower tax rates for retail, hospitality and leisure properties—including those on high streets—from 2026-27.
Everton, in my constituency, is the most deprived area in the country, and residents have received a double blow as a result of the imminent closure of Lloyds Bank and the planned closure of the Crown post office, which will have a devastating impact on residents and businesses alike.
Will the Minister agree to meet me to discuss those closures and the desperate need for a banking hub in the area?
As every constituency MP will know, the closure of banking services on our high streets is always a difficult decision.
The Government are committed to championing access by rolling out banking hubs across the country.
We are committed to delivering 350 of those hubs, and 220 have already been announced.
The closure of the post office that my hon.
Friend mentions will trigger a further cash access assessment for her constituency.
I would be pleased to arrange a meeting for her with the relevant Minister to look at the options for her constituency.
