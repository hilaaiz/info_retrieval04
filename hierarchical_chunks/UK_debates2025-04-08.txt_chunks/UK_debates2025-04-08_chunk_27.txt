The Minister’s response is key.
He is right to highlight the issues, whether they are in Liverpool, Everton, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast or Strangford.
In Northern Ireland, we have made the most of over-the-shops apartment conversions as opportunities for housing.
Does the Minister agree that the possibilities for the regeneration of high streets and town centres also include housing opportunities?
We have a shared ambition to ensure that our high streets are thriving communities for the people who live, shop or work there.
We are delivering an integrated settlement for combined authority mayors in England, and have delivered a real-terms increase in funding for the Northern Ireland Executive—the largest since devolution began—to invest in exactly those types of local projects.
