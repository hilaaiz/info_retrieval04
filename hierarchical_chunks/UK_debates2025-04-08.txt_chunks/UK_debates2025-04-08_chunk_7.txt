People up and down the country will be incredibly concerned about what Trump’s trade war means for their living standards and their communities.

Can she confirm that any new trade deals will be brought before this House for a vote before they are ratified?
At the same time as working with our allies abroad to create new export markets, will the Chancellor and the Government commit to a “Buy British” campaign as part of a broader national effort to encourage people to buy British here at home?
