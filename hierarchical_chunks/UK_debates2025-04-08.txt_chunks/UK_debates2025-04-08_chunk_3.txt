This is a time of great concern for millions of people up and down our country, for businesses, and, as an open-trading nation, for our economy at large.
Free trade has been the bedrock of prosperity for our country, and for many countries around the world, for decades.
It has raised billions of people out of poverty.
Tariffs are the enemy of free trade, and we on the Conservative Benches will do whatever we can to assist the Government in getting those tariffs down.
Having said that, of course we will never cease to be an effective Opposition who vigorously hold the Government to account—not least on the disastrous decisions that they have already taken in respect of our economy.
We will be responsible when it comes to these matters, particularly where market sensitivities are engaged.
I want to ask the right hon.
Lady the following questions.
First, could she provide further details of the US negotiations and specifically whether further meetings with Scott Bessent and others have been arranged that involve her?
Secondly, which areas beyond tariffs are being discussed in those negotiations?
Thirdly, which sectors beyond cars and life sciences are being considered for potential Government support?
Finally, could she update the House on what options there are for protecting sectors of the economy that might be affected by the dumping of goods as a consequence of trade diversion?
