I wish to add my voice as an MP from Cornwall to say that some of the actions the Government have taken so far on second homes have been really helpful.
The Renters’ Rights Bill will help with those evictions when people are flipping their houses.
I also ask that we look at the loophole between council tax and business rates, and at the registration or licensing scheme on second homes, which the Government will hopefully bring in soon.
I appreciate the concerns that second home owners may move to the business rates system.
I emphasise that there are requirements that must be met before properties can be assessed for business rates.
Those have recently been strengthened, but we will keep them under review.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to increase the affordability of new homes.
