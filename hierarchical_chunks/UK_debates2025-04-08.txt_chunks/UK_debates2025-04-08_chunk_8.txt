I thank the hon.
Lady for those questions.
This is a time for pragmatism and cool heads, not to rush a response.
We are working closely with business.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Business and Trade announced in the House last week a call for evidence on the response that businesses are looking for.
Ratcheting up barriers to trade and ratcheting up tariffs will not be in our country’s interests, whether in terms of inflation or, indeed, for supply chains.
We need to have cool heads and think about the national interest, not give knee-jerk reactions.
