I thank my hon.
Friend for his remarks.
He is right to say that the £7.5 billion of additional revenue from closing the tax gap is a huge boost to the public finances, which enables us responsibly to fund public services and deliver key priorities.
Those priorities include free breakfast clubs at all primary schools in England.
The first 750 of them are beginning this month via our early adopters scheme, which is worth £450 to parents and carers.
To go further the Government will bring forward their comprehensive child poverty strategy as soon as possible.
