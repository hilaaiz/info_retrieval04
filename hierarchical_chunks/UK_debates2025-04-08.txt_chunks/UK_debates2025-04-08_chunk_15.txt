I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his remarks.
I agree with him about the importance of taking the right action to tackle second homes.
I understand he had a meeting with the Minister for Housing and Planning last week, and I would be happy to follow up any items that arose from that.
Our plan to build more homes includes 4,500 new homes in every year in Cornwall, and I hope he will support those building plans too.
