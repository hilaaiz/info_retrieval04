I thank the Secretary of State for his initial response to the urgent question.
Of course, this situation is a reminder that the people of Northern Ireland were absolutely right to oppose Brexit in that referendum.
I am really disappointed that the shadow Secretary of State started his supplementary question by complaining about the lowest-paid workers in Northern Ireland getting a pay rise—absolutely incredible.
The Secretary of State touched on the trade negotiations between the UK and the United States.
Can he reassure us that the situation in Northern Ireland is absolutely at the heart of those negotiations?
