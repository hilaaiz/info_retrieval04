I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for the invitation to join him in his constituency.
I very much enjoyed the regional reception with business leaders, as I have done in every region and nation across the country during the spending review.
We will continue to work hand in glove with them to unlock investment, create jobs and create growth for everybody, across the whole country.
