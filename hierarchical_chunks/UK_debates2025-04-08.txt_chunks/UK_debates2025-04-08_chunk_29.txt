To follow on from what  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  said, high streets up and down the land, be they in  Liverpool Riverside, St Albans or anywhere else, have just been hit with the double whammy of the jobs tax and higher business rates bills.
What steps are Ministers taking to prevent an epidemic of boarded-up shop fronts in the next 12 months, before the new rate comes in next year?
As I have informed the House already, we are committed to supporting independent businesses and retailers on the high street.
The change to employer national insurance contributions was designed to support smaller businesses in our country; over 50% of businesses will pay the same national insurance as before, or less than they did under the previous regime.
The hon.
Lady alluded to the fact that we are bringing forward permanent deductions in business rate taxation for the retail, hospitality and leisure sector, which will be important for the long-term sustainability of the businesses she mentions.
What assessment she has made of the potential impact of her Department’s regulatory policies on trends in the level of investment.
We have heard from UK businesses that our regulatory system often holds back growth and investment.
We recently published a regulation action plan, and committed to cutting the administrative costs of regulation for businesses by 25% by the end of this Parliament.
We are going further, faster than ever before to streamline regulation and make Britain the best place in the world to do business.
