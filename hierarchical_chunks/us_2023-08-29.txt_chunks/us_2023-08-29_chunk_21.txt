Mr. Speaker, It is my honor to congratulate Howard Seid for his decades of service to fellow Michigan veterans.
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home to such a selfless and devoted individual.
On behalf of my constituents, I wish Howard all the best in his future endeavors.
