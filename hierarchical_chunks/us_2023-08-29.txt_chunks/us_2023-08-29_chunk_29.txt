Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 2023 graduating class of Fairfax County High School Firefighter program.
In 2016, the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department in partnership with Fairfax County Public Schools created its High School Firefighter Program to provide training to students who are considering a career as a firefighter.
Students who participate in this program attend courses taught by qualified instructors at the Fairfax County Fire Academy.
In fact, they receive the same training as new professional and volunteer firefighters.
The course is grueling but upon successful completion, the students will earn a Virginia Certification as Firefighter I & II and Hazardous Materials Awareness and Operations.
Should these students decide to apply to the Fairfax County Fire Academy, this program will make them competitive candidates and will have prepared them for recruit school.
Fourteen seniors and one junior are graduating as the Class of 2023
