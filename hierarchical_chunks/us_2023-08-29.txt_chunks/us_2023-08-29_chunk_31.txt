Mr. Speaker, the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department is 1 of the best fire departments in the country and in the world.
I commend the department as well as the public school system for partnering in the creation of this program.
I also applaud these young people for their desire to learn more about the department and for their interest in protecting our community.
Northern Virginia is fortunate to have such dedicated young citizens.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these students on their successful completion of their program and in wishing them great success in their future endeavors.
