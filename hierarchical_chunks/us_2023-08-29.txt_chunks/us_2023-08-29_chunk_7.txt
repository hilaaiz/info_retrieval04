Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our TX-24 Hometown Hero, retired police chief Jimmy Perdue.
Chief Perdue spent over 40 years in public service, 18 of them serving as the North Richland Hills Chief of Police and Director.
Under his leadership, the North Richland Hills Police Department earned ``Recognized Status'' from the Texas Police Chiefs Association Foundation Best Practices Recognition Program in 2011, a status which the department continues to maintain year after year.
He also served as a past President of the North Texas Police Chiefs Association and as the President of the Texas Police Chiefs Association from 2022-2023.
Chief Perdue continually displayed his dedication to public service by developing the Women of Law Enforcement Conference, leading the city's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, overseeing the design and construction of the North Richland Hills Animal Adoption and Rescue Center, and bringing the SHIELD program to life, a 3-day training course for NRH police officers.
I commend Chief Perdue for going above and beyond for our community and congratulate him on his retirement.
He will be missed.
