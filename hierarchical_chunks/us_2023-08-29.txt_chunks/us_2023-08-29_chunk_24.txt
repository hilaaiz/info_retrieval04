Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate James A. Provost for his decades of service to fellow Michigan veterans and for being named the 2023 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the Year.
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home to such a selfless and devoted individual.
On behalf of my constituents, I wish James all the best in his future endeavors.
