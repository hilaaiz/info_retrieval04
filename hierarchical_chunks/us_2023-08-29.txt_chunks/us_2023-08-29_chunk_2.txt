Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Maddy Sexton.
Earlier this year, Maddy was in a car heading to school with a friend when her friend began to experience a medical emergency.
Maddy demonstrated maturity beyond her years and handled the situation perfectly--she immediately pulled over, called Southlake Fire, and helped take care of her friend before Southlake Fire quickly arrived.
I thank Maddy for going above and beyond to look out for her friend through her vigilance, quick thinking, and maturity.
It is an honor to join Southlake DPS in recognizing Maddy for her contributions to our community.
