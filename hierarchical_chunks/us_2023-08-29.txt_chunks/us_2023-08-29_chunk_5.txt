Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Anne Pottinger, who is highly involved in our North Texas community and always finds a way to help others.
She is a leader in numerous non-profit organizations, including the Freedom Mobility Foundation in Southlake and Holidays & Heroes in Fort Worth.
Through her work with the Freedom Mobility Foundation, Anne helps to provide mobility equipment like track chairs to those in need.
I want to thank Anne for going above and beyond for our North Texas veterans and military families.
