Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Adam Holliday Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and thank them for their work to preserve our Nations heritage, while educating our next generation on the importance of upholding our constitutional values.
As Constitution Day approaches, we remember the words of Benjamin Franklin who was asked by a group of citizens as he exited the Constitutional Convention what type of government had been created.
He replied: ``A republic, if you can keep it.''
Each day we strive to uphold the Republic that was created that day in Philadelphia.
Both in the halls of Congress, and across the country we must remain committed to protecting our constitutional rights that have helped us to become the most prosperous Nation the world has ever known.
As we celebrate Constitution Day, we remember our founding fathers and strive to uphold their legacy.
