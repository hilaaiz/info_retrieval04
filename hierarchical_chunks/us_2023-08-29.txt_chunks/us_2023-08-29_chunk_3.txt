Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Oliver Burke.
Oliver, a rising junior at Greenhill School, recently led his fellow Boy Scouts in a wildflower seed building service project to help preserve the endangered Backland Prairie.
He brought together 50 of his fellow Scouts from rural and urban communities across North Texas--most of whom did not previously know each other--and they made more than 3,800 native wildflower seed balls.
In addition to his leadership in the Boy Scouts, Oliver spent the last year serving on my Congressional Youth Advisory Council and recently participated in our annual Congressional Art Competition.
I thank Oliver for his dedication to service, bringing people together, and bettering our North Texas community for generations to come.
