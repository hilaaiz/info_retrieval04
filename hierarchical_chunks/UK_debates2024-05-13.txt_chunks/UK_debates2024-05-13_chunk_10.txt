Roslyn Gilmore is one of several thousand WASPI women in my constituency.
It has now been six weeks since we had the statement to the House, so I repeat the call again: when can we expect the response to the ombudsman’s report?
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to the answer that I have just given to the Father of the House.
It has to be stressed, quite rightly, that the report was five years in the making, and that was—in part at least—due to the complexities of the matters under consideration.
We are looking at those matters extremely carefully.
Two things cannot be disputed.
The first is that some women came to harm because of what happened.
The second is that the report, and the assessments that came to pass prior to it, were a long time in the making.
I encourage the Secretary of State to look into this matter not just carefully, as he says
and I know he will, but at great pace.
I have made it clear from the Dispatch Box that there will be no undue delay in coming to conclusions on this matter.
