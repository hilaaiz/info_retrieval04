I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing to the attention of the House the important initiatives going on in his patch in Darlington.
Such local programmes have a huge impact in helping autistic people into work and tackling stigma.
Once established, I am sure that the Buckland review task group will be interested to hear direct details of the work being done in his area.
