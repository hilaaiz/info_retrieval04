I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and considerable interest and knowledge in this area, and for the discussions he has held with me on these matters.
As he will know, we are currently going through a 12-week consultation on how PIP can be reformed.
I certainly subscribe to the view that we want to examine the issue of one size fits all and whether there are better ways of looking after people.
