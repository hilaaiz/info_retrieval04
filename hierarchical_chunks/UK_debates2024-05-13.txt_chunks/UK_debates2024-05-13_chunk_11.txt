In evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee on Tuesday, the ombudsman essentially said that the reason it decided to lay the report before Parliament was that it could not trust the Government to deal with it.
I ask the Secretary of State a simple question: does he have confidence in the ombudsman, and does he accept its report?
I have made our position extremely clear: we are considering the report and it will come back to the House in due course and without undue delay.
The ombudsman has, as the hon.
Gentleman indicated, invited the House to express its opinion as well.
That is something that we will consider alongside the matters raised in the report.
