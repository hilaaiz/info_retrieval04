I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend for reminding himself and us that the ombudsman has, unusually, suggested that Parliament should get involved.
Some were asking for £10,000 compensation per person.
The ombudsman has recommended between £1,000 and just under £3,000.
Could the Secretary of State indicate whether he will make a decision, and, if so, when and how much?
