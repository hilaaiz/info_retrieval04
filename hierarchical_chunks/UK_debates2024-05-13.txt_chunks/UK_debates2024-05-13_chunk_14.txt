I thank the hon.
Lady for her points.
If we are trading figures, at the close of business on  7 May 2024 , there were 36,721 applications awaiting decision.
I remind those people listening why this matters.
This is very significant support—demand-led support—for people who are getting opportunities to work or taking on new roles.
This grant can provide up to £66,000-worth of flexible personalised support per person per year.
It is absolutely right that we get the right information from the individual and take time to approve a significant application such as this.
