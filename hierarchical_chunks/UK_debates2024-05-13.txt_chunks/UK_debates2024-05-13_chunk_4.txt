My hon.
Friend is a formidable champion for his area.
As we speak, our partnership team is working with local employers such as Naked Solar to design sector-based work programmes and fill potential vacancies.
I am keen to work with him and his neighbours, because the areas that he named are all good for the high-wage jobs that his constituents deserve.
