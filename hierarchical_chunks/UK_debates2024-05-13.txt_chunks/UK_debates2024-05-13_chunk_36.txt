I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Ogmore (Chris Elmore)  for submitting this urgent question, and the Minister for the constructive way in which he has replied.
This is the second time in a week that Ministers have had to come to this Chamber because of the crisis in one or more of our prisons.
