Let’s get some facts.
On  1 January 2024 , there were 24,874 people awaiting an Access to Work decision, on  1 February , 26,924, on  1 March , 29,871 and on  1 April , 32,445.
Every month, the figure keeps increasing, so since the beginning of 2024 the Access to Work backlog has risen by more than 7,500.
Does the Minister really think this is supporting more disabled people back into work?
