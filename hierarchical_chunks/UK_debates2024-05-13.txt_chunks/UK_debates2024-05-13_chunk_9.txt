I thank my hon.
Friend the Father of the House for his question.
I cannot prejudge the outcome of the very detailed set of considerations.
He makes reference to the amounts involved, which are considerable.
As I have said, it is absolutely right that we look very carefully at the conclusions of that report and listen to what Parliament has to say in that respect.
