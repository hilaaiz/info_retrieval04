My right hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
Work is essential and is at the heart of the reforms we are bringing through.
Indeed the Office for Budget  Responsibility has assessed the impact of our measures with the work capability assessment reforms, for example, as leading to over 400,000 fewer people on those benefits by the end of the forecast period.
I am very proud of that achievement because, as he highlights, that will mean more people have work and the benefits of it.
