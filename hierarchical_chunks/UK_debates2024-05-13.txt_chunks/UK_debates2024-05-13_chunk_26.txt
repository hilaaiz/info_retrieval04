We have successfully halved inflation, but we must get people back into work.
In Bridgend, we have lost the Ford factory and Biomet.
It is about local jobs.
I have always said that maintaining close contact with local employers and working with businesses on the ground is the way to do it.
Could the Secretary of State tell the House what his Department is doing to work with employers to get people back to work?
We do a huge amount with employers both at national level and at local jobcentres.
If my hon.
Friend has not already engaged with his local jobcentre staff, I strongly recommend that he does so.
The results speak for themselves.
Unemployment is around half the level in 2010 under the last Labour Government.
We have near record levels of employment.
Youth unemployment under this Government has fallen more than 40%; under Labour, it went up by almost 45%.
More than 39,000 south-west companies are classed as being in significant economic distress, according to Begbies Traynor’s “Red Flag Alert” report.
The loss of those businesses would deepen regional economic inequality and increase regional unemployment.
What steps is the Minister taking with Cabinet colleagues to ensure that those businesses, which provide vital jobs, find a way out of significant economic distress?
As we have set out, there is a clear and detailed back to work plan, which is working for the reasons that I have given.
If the hon.
Lady has examples of specific employers under the distress that she outlined, the Minister for Employment will be happy to look at what we may be able to do as a Department in her constituency.
