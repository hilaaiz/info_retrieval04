I thank the Minister for that answer and join her in thanking the excellent Department for Work and Pensions staff at both Newquay and St Austell jobcentres.
Through their hard work and under the leadership and policies of the Government, we have achieved an 80.2% employment rate locally, which is well above the national average.
We also have some great opportunities for the jobs of the future coming through in renewable energy, lithium extraction and the space sector.
What more are the Government doing to ensure that local people in Cornwall can grasp those opportunities?
