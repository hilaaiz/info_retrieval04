I welcome my hon.
Friend’s interest in WorkWell, which is a significant intervention.
I am not sure about the Secretary of State’s diary or mine, but we are keen to meet and to highlight the work of the NHS North West London ICB.
It is one of 15 partnerships, which are backed by £64 million-worth of investment.
It will design integrated WorkWell services and deliver them to around 59,000 disabled people so that they can start, stay and succeed in work.
