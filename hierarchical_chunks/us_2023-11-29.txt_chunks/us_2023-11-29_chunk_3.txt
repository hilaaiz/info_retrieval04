Mr. NICKEL.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor the life and legacy of a true champion of the people, Dr. James West, a revered Wake County Commissioner and a beacon of hope for many in our community.
It's with deep sorrow that we mark his passing, but with immense gratitude that we celebrate his legacy.
Dr. James West dedicated his life to public service, always striving to uplift those in need.
From his early days as a college student in the 1960s, peacefully protesting segregation in Greensboro alongside Jesse Jackson, to his extensive service as a Raleigh City Councilman and Wake County Commissioner, his journey was marked by a relentless commitment to justice and equality.
His academic achievements, including a doctorate in education, and a three-decade-long career at the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service at NC State University laid the foundation for his deep understanding of the issues facing our community.
Dr. West was proud to be the first black person in the U.S. to become Director of County Operations for the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, with the responsibility of supervising over 1,000 faculty and staff members.
Dr. West's tenure on the Raleigh City Council, including his time as Mayor Pro Tem, was characterized by his visionary leadership and his ability to forge meaningful partnerships.
His work with the Southeast Raleigh Alliance, which he co-founded, exemplified his commitment to economic empowerment and community development.
In his role as a County Commissioner, Dr. West was instrumental in the creation of the Live Well Wake initiative, aimed at enhancing the health and wellbeing of the community.
His efforts to expand affordable housing and his leadership in the Health and Human Services Committee highlight his holistic approach to public service and his belief that every individual deserves dignity and stability.
Dr. West's legacy is not just in the programs he initiated or the policies he championed, but in the countless lives he touched, the community leaders he inspired, and the unquantifiable impact of his compassion and leadership.
We remember Dr. West for his ``Dr. West-isms,'' his wisdom, and his unwavering faith in the power of community.
He taught us the importance of strengthening our ``spiritual infrastructure,'' and he believed deeply in the potential of every individual.
As we mourn Dr. James West's passing, we also celebrate his extraordinary life--a life dedicated to service, equality, and the betterment of Wake County and its people.
My thoughts are with his family, friends, and all those who were fortunate enough to know him.
