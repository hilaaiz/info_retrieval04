Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William C. ``Bill'' Wade.
Bill Wade passed away on September 29, 2023, in Gulfport, Mississippi, at 74 years old.
He was a dedicated family man and friend.
Bill was a committed member of Bear Creek Baptist Church and served as a deacon for many years.
His faith was important to him, and the members of Bear Creek were well served under his leadership.
Bill retired from education in 2013.
He taught school at Louisville Municipal School District and made a difference in the lives of many students throughout his teaching career.
Serving as a principal at the Kosciusko Public School, Bill led the school and eventually the school district as superintendent of education.
He also worked in the Union Public School District and the Polk County School District in Tennessee as superintendent of education.
Bill's legacy in education continued after his retirement when he cofounded Performance Based Education Company, LLC, which helps students maintain achievement progress by adding capacity and working with school districts to improve their student achievement.
Bill worked as the vice president, contract manager, marketing specialist, and program developer.
