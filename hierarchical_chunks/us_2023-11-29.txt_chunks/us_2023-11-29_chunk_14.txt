Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Joshua Banales for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
Joshua has achieved great things, all while overcoming adversity and challenges along the way.
Students like Joshua, who strive to make the most of their education, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Joshua's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Jefferson Jr./Sr.
High School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Joshua Banales on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
