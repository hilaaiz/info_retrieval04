Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Karlie Candelaria for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
Karlie has achieved great things, all while overcoming adversity and challenges along the way.
Students like Karlie, who strive to make the most of their education, develop crucial skilis and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Karlie's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Wheat Ridge High School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Karlie Candelaria on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award.
