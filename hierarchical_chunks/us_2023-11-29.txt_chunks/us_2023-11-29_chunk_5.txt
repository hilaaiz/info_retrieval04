Mr. THANEDAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the longest serving mayor of the city I so proudly represent, Mayor Coleman A. Young, on the 26th anniversary of his passing.
Born in the throes of segregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mayor Young rose from the humble beginnings of the Great Migration to become a beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for the city.
His journey was marked not just by the offices he held, but by the indomitable spirit he embodied--a spirit that challenged inequality, fought for justice, and tirelessly sought to uplift every resident of Detroit.
As Detroit's first African-American mayor, he broke barriers and built bridges.
He led our city through times of challenge and change, always with an unwavering vision for a more inclusive and prosperous Detroit.
His efforts to integrate the Detroit Police Department and to fight excessive use of force were not just administrative actions, but bold steps towards healing and unity.
His advocacy for affirmative action and his dedication to economic development were testament to his belief in a Detroit that offered opportunity for all.
Under his leadership, Detroit saw the rise of vital infrastructure and community projects, laying the groundwork for the city's future.
As we reflect on Mayor Young's legacy, let us remember his courage, his unwavering commitment to civil rights, and his enduring love for Detroit.
His life's work reminds us of the power of resilience, the importance of visionary leadership, and the unyielding pursuit of equality.
Mayor Young's legacy is not confined to the past; it is a guiding light for our future, motivating us to continue building a city
