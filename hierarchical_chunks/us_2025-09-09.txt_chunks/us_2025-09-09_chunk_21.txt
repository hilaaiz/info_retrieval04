Madeline is currently a student at Padua Academy, an institution known for preparing young women through a strong Catholic education rooted in academic excellence and community service.
She is a role model for her peers, and her Eagle rank reflects not only her perseverance but also her deep commitment to faith, service, and community.
I congratulate Madeline on this spectacular accomplishment and I look forward to seeing what else she achieves.
God bless Madeline and God bless our United States.
The greatest country on the face of the Earth.
