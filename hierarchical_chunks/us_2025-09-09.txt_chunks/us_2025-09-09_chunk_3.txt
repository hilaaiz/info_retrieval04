Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize the Lancaster County Conservation District (LCCD) on their 75th anniversary.
In 1950, the Lancaster County Conservation District, then called the Soil Conservation District, was officially incorporated by the county.
Though the Conservation District had officially been organized since 1938, it only covered the southern part.
The new organization was wholly operated by its volunteer board until they hired their first employee in 1965.
The Lancaster County Conservation District raises awareness of environmental challenges and helps individuals and organizations with navigating them.
Three quarters of a century since its founding, the LCCD has moved beyond its original scope of soil conservation.
New programs include an erosion and sedimentation program, which helps to protect water quality, educational programs such as the Youth Conservation School and the Envirothon, their own Chesapeake Bay and watershed programs, an annual tree sale, and much more.
Just as important is the LCCD's collaboration with farmers and the local community, which makes everything they do possible.
Farmers work with the LCCD because better agronomics and better environmental practices are intertwined.
The LCCD also builds inroads with farmers to increase environmental awareness.
An example of this is their Plain Sect program, which provides outreach to the local Amish and Mennonite communities, which comprise a significant portion of the farms in the district.
With the dedication of 40 employees, the LCCD leads the way in soil conservation and water quality.
We owe our beautiful scenery and quality of life in part to the LCCD, which is why I am grateful for their work in Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.
Congratulations to the Lancaster County Conservation District on 75 years, and I wish them many more years of success.
