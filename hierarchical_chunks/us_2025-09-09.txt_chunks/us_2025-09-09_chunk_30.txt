Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming His AllHoliness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C., and in paying tribute to his decades of ministry for peace, reconciliation and environmental stewardship.
May God continue to bestow his example as a guide to defend religious freedom, choose cooperation over conflict, and secure a healthier, safer America for future generations.
