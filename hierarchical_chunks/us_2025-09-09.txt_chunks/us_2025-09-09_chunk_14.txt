Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Mr. Andrew ``Andy'' C. Mack of Londonderry, New Hampshire, a steadfast pillar for his community who will be remembered for his commitment to service and his great generosity.
Raised in Londonderry, New Hampshire, Andy was a Granite Stater through and through.
Earlier in his life, he served his country honorably in the Army Chemical Corps before returning to Londonderry.
Whether as a town moderator, volunteer firefighter, or Derry Rotarian, Andy spent his life working for the greater good of his neighbors and his town.
He had a vibrant civic life and was known for his handmade, plywood road signs, which boldly shared his views on a variety of topics.
The passing on of Andy's property is just one of many remarkable examples of his dedication to the people around him.
After being owned by his family for seven generations, Andy eventually sold his family farm to the town.
In doing so, he made sure that the land would be used for local schools, civic organizations, and nature conservation.
Andy's passing is a profound loss to Londonderry, but I know that his legacy will live on through those who knew and loved him, including his sons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
His life offers inspiration to Granite Staters across New Hampshire who care about and aspire to make change in their communities.
I am grateful for his memory and for the lasting impact Andy has made on our state.
