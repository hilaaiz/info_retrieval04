Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to celebrate Alexander John Scalice of Galloway Township, whose hard work and dedication have earned him the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest distinction in the Boy Scouts.
Throughout his Scouting journey, Alex earned an impressive 40 merit badges in areas ranging from science, citizenship and communications, as well as serving in elected leadership roles within his troop.
For his Eagle project, Alex designed and built six oar carriers for the Cedar Creek High School Crew team, where he proudly rowed for four years.
Recognizing the financial challenges faced by the program, he secured donations from local businesses and individual supporters, organized a team of volunteers, and led them in completing this project.
His work not only solved a practical problem for his teammates but also provided equipment that will support the program for many seasons to come.
His commitment to service extended beyond Scouting.
Alex volunteered many hours with his church and community, earning two Catholic Scouting emblems, demonstrating his devotion to both faith and country.
As he prepares to study Biology and Pre-Med in college, Alex stands a role model for young people across South Jersey and a source of pride for his family, his troop, and our community.
I congratulate Alex on this outstanding achievement.
God bless Alex and God bless
