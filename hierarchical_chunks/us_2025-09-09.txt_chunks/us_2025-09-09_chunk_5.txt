Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Reverend Dr. William Crowder on his appointment as the next Regional Minister and President of the Living Waters Region of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).
Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Reverend Dr. Crowder was inspired by his mother, who instilled in him a deep sense of faith, discipline, and service.
As a young man, he distinguished himself both as a student leader, serving as student government vice president and president at Central State University, and as an athlete, helping lead his football team to a championship.
Answering his call to ministry, Dr. Crowder entered United Theological Seminary in Dayton, Ohio.
He was licensed by the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) in 1994 and ordained the following year.
Since then, Dr. Crowder has devoted his life to ministry and service, impacting communities far beyond the pulpit.
Working alongside lay leaders of Park Manor and the City of Chicago, he helped bring forward a $34 million senior housing project, secured a $1 million state grant to combat gun violence, and contributed his time and insight on numerous distinguished boards.
Through these efforts, he has lived out his calling to serve others and to strengthen the communities around him.
Reverend Dr. William Crowder's appointment is a testament to his lifelong devotion to faith and service.
His leadership has strengthened congregations, uplifted communities, and left a lasting impact on Chicago and beyond.
