I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
She and I were involved in Young Labour together—only a few years ago, I feel—so it is great to see her finally in this place where she belongs.
She raises the important matter of NHS dentistry and the difficulty that people have getting an NHS appointment, which is particularly acute in Norfolk.
That is why the Government are committed to a rescue plan and to providing another 700,000 NHS dentist appointments, which I hope will relieve that acuteness in Norfolk.
