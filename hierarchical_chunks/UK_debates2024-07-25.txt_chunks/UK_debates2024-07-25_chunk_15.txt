My hon.
Friend is right that the previous Government oversaw VIP lanes that led to millions in waste, and we are still unpicking the impact of that lack of oversight.
I have met the Public Sector Fraud Authority to set out my commitment to strengthening the counter-fraud approach across Government.
As I have said, the counter-fraud commissioner has been introduced to support their work, and will use every means possible to recoup public money, reporting directly to the Chancellor.
In my corner of London, concerns have been expressed about a particular supplier being awarded contracts worth more than £25 million for useless PPE, after being put forward by a former Minister in the VIP lane.
Could the Minister say more about how the Public Sector Fraud Authority and the Treasury will ensure that every penny that can be returned is returned to the public purse?
I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend to hear more about the individual example from their constituency.
As I have said, I have met the Public Sector Fraud Authority.
We have set out that tackling fraud is an absolute priority for the Cabinet Office, and we will use every lever available to us to get back what is owed to the British people.
The Public Sector Fraud Authority is already working closely with the Treasury on the role of the counter-fraud commissioner, and will continue to do so.
How many people affected by contaminated blood products have received compensation.
The infected blood scandal is one of the gravest injustices in our history, and it is vital that we get final compensation to victims as soon as possible.
As of  30 June  this year, the Government have paid more than £1 billion in interim compensation to those infected with infected blood products and bereaved partners registered with existing support schemes.
The total number of recipients of interim payments across the United Kingdom is 4,606.
