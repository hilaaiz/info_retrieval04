I welcome the Minister and the entire ministerial team to their places.
Public sector fraud underwent a massive spike during the pandemic, as  personal relationships trumped proper due diligence.
With billions of pounds still in the hands of fraudsters, it is imperative that the new Government work quickly to recover what was lost.
I therefore also welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s new covid fraud commissioner.
What steps will the Government and her Department take to ensure that the money is recovered as quickly as possible, and indeed that something like this never happens again?
