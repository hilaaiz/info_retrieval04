May I start by offering my warmest congratulations to the Paymaster General?
I offer him my sincerest good wishes in these opening weeks of a new Government.
I start with deep respect for him, and I wish to support him where I can while fulfilling my constitutional responsibility.
It was the privilege of my ministerial life during my six months in office to accelerate and then deliver the legislation to set up the Infected Blood Compensation Authority.
Will the Paymaster General set out what progress has been made, given the urgency of this work?
Is he on track to meet the expectations of Sir Brian Langstaff and Sir Robert Francis, given the engagement he will undoubtedly have had with them already?
First, I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for his welcome.
I pay tribute to the work that he did in government to push this agenda forward.
When I was sat where he now is, I always sought to work on a cross-party basis, while holding the Government of the day to account.
It is good to hear that he will continue to work in that spirit.
With respect to the timetable that he refers to, our aim is still that final compensation payments will begin to be made by the end of this year.
The Infected Blood Compensation Authority is established in law, and the team is working hard to put the operational systems in place to make sure that we start delivering final compensation payments by that target.
