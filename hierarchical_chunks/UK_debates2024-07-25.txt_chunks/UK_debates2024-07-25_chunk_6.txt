I welcome you to your place, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Thank you for allowing me to make my first contribution to the House in this important debate.
In my previous role I was proud to play my part in changing the Labour party, so it is apt that I should give my maiden speech as we discuss changing and modernising this House.
I associate myself with the comments of my hon.
Friends and other Members and congratulate all those who have made their maiden speeches, both today and in the past few days.
