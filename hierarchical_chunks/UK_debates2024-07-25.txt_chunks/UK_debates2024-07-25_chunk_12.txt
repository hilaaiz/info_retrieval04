I thank the right hon.
Member for his question.
I hope to have a good and fruitful dialogue with the civil service unions about pay and many other issues.
It is important that we have public servants who feel valued and motivated, and who do their part on delivering the Government’s objectives.
On the specific issue of pay that he has raised, as I said to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend (Mary Glindon) , the Government will have more to say on civil service pay before the summer recess.
