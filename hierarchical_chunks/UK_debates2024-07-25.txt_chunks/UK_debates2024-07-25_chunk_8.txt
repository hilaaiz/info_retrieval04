I thank the people of Hazel Grove constituency for placing their trust in me.
That trust is a profound responsibility, and I am committed to repaying it through hard work, integrity and service to my community.
I acknowledge the work of my predecessor William Wragg, who served in Parliament from 2015 until he stood down at the last election.
He stood up to those in power when he felt that it was needed, and he spoke openly about poor mental health in a way that I am sure will have helped to break down stigma.
On behalf of all residents of Hazel Grove, I wish him all the best for the future.
