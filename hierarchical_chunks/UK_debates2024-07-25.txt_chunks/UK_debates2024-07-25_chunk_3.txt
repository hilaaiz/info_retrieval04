I thank the House staff for the impeccable welcome that they gave us all as new Members.
I was, for quite a long time, a soldier, so I was brought up on the mantra that two minutes early is three minutes late.
It was therefore no surprise that at five minutes to 7 on the Monday after the election, I was the first in the queue at the top of the ramp.
I saw two armed police officers, but there was also a Doorkeeper, resplendent in his uniform of morning coat and gold badge, and his beard.
Not knowing what to expect, I approached him.
He said, “Good morning, Mr Jopp.”
I was beyond impressed.
He continued, “You might not recognise me under this beard, sir, but I’m Matt, and I was with you in the Scots Guards in Afghanistan.”
I went from being impressed to being deeply touched.
