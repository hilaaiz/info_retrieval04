I thank the Minister for the reply he has just given.
Will he assure the House that he is going to make progress towards a return to full sectoral bargaining?
He must be aware that many thousands of civil servants are not covered by a pay review body or any other bargaining mechanism.
Will he take steps to ensure that all civil servants are bought within the purview of a pay review body bargaining unit as part of a return to sectoral bargaining?
