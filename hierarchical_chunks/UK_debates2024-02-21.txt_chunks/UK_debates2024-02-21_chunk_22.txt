I thank my hon.
Friend, who speaks from a point of authority.
He knows that we have high standards to ensure that GPs provide services from premises that meet all the required criteria, but I understand it is possible for those services to be provided at alternative locations that meet the contract requirements.
I will happily ensure that the Health and Social Care Secretary looks into his suggestions about more flexibility.
He will also welcome our recent plans to expand the range of services available at pharmacies, saving many people time and hassle to get treatment for  seven common ailments at their local pharmacist, easing the pressure on our GPs and speeding up the care that people deserve.
