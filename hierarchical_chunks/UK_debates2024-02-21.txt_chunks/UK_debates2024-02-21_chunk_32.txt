On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Later today we will be voting on very sensitive matters that affect the whole House.
At the start of that debate, Mr Speaker will no doubt announce which amendments, if any, he will allow to be put to the House.
When he was elected, Mr Speaker gave a solemn promise that he would publish the advice he got from the Clerk of the House when he made controversial decisions.
I do not know what he will decide or what his recommendation will be, but could you prevail on Mr Speaker, when he comes back to the Chair, to release the advice he is given by the Clerk on whatever decision he comes to on the amendments to the SNP motion we are debating this afternoon?
