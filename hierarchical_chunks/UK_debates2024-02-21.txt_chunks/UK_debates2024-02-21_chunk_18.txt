The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday  21 February.
The whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the family of Alexei Navalny.
He died for a cause to which he dedicated his whole life: freedom.
To return home knowing that Putin had already tried to have him killed was one of the most courageous acts of our time.
Together with our allies, we are considering all options to hold Russia and Putin to account, and this morning we sanctioned those running the prison where Alexei Navalny’s body still lies.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
I know that my right hon.
Friend will share the horror felt by this House—the oldest people’s assembly in the world—at the acid attack against a woman and two children on the streets of London.
Does he share my anger that we would still have been unable to deport the perpetrator had he been found because of the so-called European Court of Human Rights?
When will we stop bending the knee to this so-called European court—a travesty of a court?
This was a horrific attack, and my thoughts are with the victims and their family.
Obviously, I cannot comment on a live investigation, but speaking more broadly, clearly I do not think that it is right for dangerous foreign criminals to be able to stay in our country.
That is why our Nationality and Borders Act 2022 made it clear that anyone who is convicted of a crime and gets a sentence of 12 months or more will not be granted asylum in the United Kingdom.
That is the common-sense position, which I believe is supported by the majority of the British public, but one that the Labour party voted against time and time again.
