I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his point of order and for giving notice of it.
As he knows, I am not responsible for the accuracy of Ministers’ statements in the House, but I am sure, again, that those on the Treasury Bench will have heard his remarks.
As Chair of the Select Committee, he will have further opportunities to pursue the matter directly with the Secretary of State.
I am pretty sure that is what he intends to do.
