It is brilliant to hear about all of this progress.
What assessment has the Minister made of the value for money cap in connecting the hardest-to-reach households and businesses, of which I have many in my very rural, incredibly beautiful but sparsely populated constituency?
My hon.
Friend’s constituency has very low gigabit connectivity, partly because its geography makes connections very expensive.
That is why we launched one of our very first contracts in Cumbria.
Some 15,000 premises are going to be connected across Copeland, and we are trying to stretch the contract as far as it will go.
For premises that will not be reached, we will look at other technologies so that we can get to them as quickly as possible.
I work closely with Philip Burrows, Denbighshire’s excellent digital officer.
He tells me that Openreach can still impose significant excess charges to connect properties that are declared enabled for fibre.
In those instances, people are unable to claim via the gigabit voucher scheme.
Will my hon.
Friend outline what steps she is taking to address this matter?
