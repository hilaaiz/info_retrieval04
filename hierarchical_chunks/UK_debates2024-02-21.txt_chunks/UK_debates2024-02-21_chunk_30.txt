On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Large numbers of our constituents have come to lobby Parliament today because the issue of Gaza is so close to their hearts.
Only a limited number are being allowed into Westminster Hall, even though there is quite a sizeable amount of space, so many constituents are being forced  to stand out in the rain.
Would it be possible to see what could be done to accommodate more in Westminster Hall as they come in and filter on the green card system?
