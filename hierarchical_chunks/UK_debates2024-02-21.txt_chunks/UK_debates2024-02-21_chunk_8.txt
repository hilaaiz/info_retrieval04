I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the experience of Mr Burrows, who sounds like a very experienced officer.
I would like to hear a bit more detail, because it sounds like the properties he cites have access to a fibre connection and would not be eligible for a voucher.
I would like to know a bit more about the excess charges so that we can deal with any problems.
