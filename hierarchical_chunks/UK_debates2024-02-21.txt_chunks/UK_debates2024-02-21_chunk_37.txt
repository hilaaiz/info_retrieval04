I thank the right hon.
Lady for her point of order.
She raised a number of points.
I have not received any notification that a statement is forthcoming—she did refer to an urgent question yesterday.
I know the right hon.
Lady regularly attends business questions, and this may be something she might like to press the Leader of the House on.
Those on the Treasury Bench have heard what she has had to say and will feed it back.
I am sure that in her role as Chair of the Home Affairs Committee she may have other means to pursue the issues she has raised, in particular in respect of reports that she may be able to ask for, but she will possibly know more than me about that.
