Rossett, outside Wrexham, has little to no connectivity, despite the Ofcom checker predicting that it has a good signal.
This significantly limits residents’ lives.
Ofcom acknowledges that it is a prediction, but Building Digital UK says that, because the Government rely on this prediction, there is little chance of Rossett receiving any benefit from the shared rural network programme.
What would the Minister advise my residents to do?
My hon.
Friend highlights the challenge I have had in answering this question.
The mobile connectivity figures I have for her constituency are extremely high.
This highlights the issue we have with Ofcom’s reporting maps, which are simply not good enough.
We have consistently raised this with Ofcom, and we hope to make progress.
There has been significant improvement in rural broadband connectivity in Northern Ireland as a result of our agreement with the previous Government.
Will the Minister take steps to ensure that small businesses in rural areas across the country can further develop themselves by maximising this advantage?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to highlight the fantastic connectivity in Northern Ireland.
In fact, I think it has some of the very best connectivity in the entire country.
I will look into any spots that are still not covered, and I will happily get back to him.
