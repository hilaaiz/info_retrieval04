The Secretary of State was asked— Whether she has had discussions with Cabinet colleagues on encouraging co-operation between universities and businesses to promote innovation.
Of course, I speak to colleagues on this important topic all the time.
Our science and technology framework is designed to ensure that we do not just challenge university rankings, but translate them into material benefits for the United Kingdom.
My Department has a number of programmes breaking down the barriers between universities and businesses, which have contributed to the nearly 90,000 interactions reported between universities and businesses in 2021-22.
That is a 5% increase on the previous year.
Since we have had the impact assessment of universities globally, many of the new and more innovative small universities have outstripped the more conventional and better-known universities.
Indeed, the Huddersfield health innovation campus is leading in this area.
Does the Minister agree that that innovation partnership offers real opportunities for jobs in the future, and should there not be more incentives to make innovations come faster rather than slower?
I agree with the hon.
Member about the importance of focusing on innovation and collaboration in this area.
The University of Huddersfield received £1.63 million this year through the higher education innovation fund to support knowledge exchange and collaboration with business, and I am sure that we can write to the hon.
Member with more details.
