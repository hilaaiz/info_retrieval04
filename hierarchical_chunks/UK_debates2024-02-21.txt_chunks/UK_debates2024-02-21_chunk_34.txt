On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I wonder if you could give me some advice.
My office wrote to the Home Secretary more than six weeks ago and we have still not received a response from him about an issue raised by a constituent.
It is becoming increasingly clear that Ministers are either wilfully refusing to respond to Members of Parliament or simply, rather worryingly, just treating Members of Parliament with sheer contempt.
What do we do to force Ministers to do their duty and respond appropriately to Members of this House?
