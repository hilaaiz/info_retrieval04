During recess, I took part in a cross-party Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to the UN summit on conflict and security.
One of the seminars was about AI security.
I know the UK held the first ever summit on AI safety, with 28 countries coming together to put forward guidelines.
What update do we have on bringing more countries on board to ensure that AI can be explored safely?
There is a lot of ongoing work, including my conversations with G7 partners; I know that the Secretary of State is meeting with international partners.
I would welcome a meeting and an update from my hon.
Friend on his conversations at the UN and what work is being done there.
