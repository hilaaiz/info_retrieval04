The Committee will soon publish our first report to the House on the funding of public services, and the issue of revenue raising by the Executive continues to be highlighted.
What conversations is the Secretary of State having with the Executive to help deliver longer-term financial sustainability in Northern Ireland?
I have regular discussions with the Executive about the financial situation and about their plans.
The truth is very simple: all Governments around the world, including the Northern Ireland Executive, have choices to make, with the resources available, as to whether they seek to raise revenue to fund more things, including further investment in health.
Those are choices for the Executive to make, but if they do not make those choices, they will have less funds than would otherwise be available to them.
