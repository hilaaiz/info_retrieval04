I thank the hon.
Member for raising this important issue.
There are issues in relation to Northern Ireland in particular that we have to deal with very carefully.
We will always put the national interest first, and that is why I am pleased that talks are ongoing, and they are constructive talks.
I believe that a trade war is in nobody’s interest, and all of the sectors and industries impacted are of the same view, so we will continue to make that progress in the national interest.
