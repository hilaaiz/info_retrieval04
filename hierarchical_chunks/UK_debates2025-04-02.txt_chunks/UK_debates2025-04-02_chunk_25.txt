While the last Government resorted to damaging keyboard diplomacy, this Government are leading, bringing 14 nations together this week to tackle illegal immigration.
Like the Prime Minister, I have seen at first hand how counter-terror powers can disrupt threats before lives are lost.

Under their Rwanda scheme, which was only ever supposed to return, I think, 300 people a year, what we have achieved in nine months would have taken them 80 years.
We have replaced a gimmick with a real deterrent.
