We have had several urgent questions and statements on Gaza over the last few months.
Each time, I have come to the Chamber and asked the Government: what is plan B?
What is plan B when Israel ends the ceasefire, which is what has happened?
What is plan B when Israel’s far-right Government choose their survival over the lives of the remaining hostages, which is what seems to have happened?
What is plan B when annexation of either the west bank or Gaza is not just threatened but actually happens, which is what is happening now?
My question is this: what are the Government doing to turn our allies’ heads from American trade wars and towards the tragedy unfolding in the middle east, to do whatever they can to restore a ceasefire and the road to peace?
My right hon.
Friend, who has been pressing on these issues for some time, is right to raise those questions.
She asks whether there is a plan B.
In  all of my experience, there can be no plan B in Israel-Palestine; there is only one route, which is widely understood by our allies in the region and beyond, and it must be a two-state solution.
The route to a two-state solution must involve compliance with international humanitarian law.
It is clear even from the short exchange that we have already had in the Chamber that the British Government’s policy and the Israeli Government’s policy differ.
They will continue to differ until we return to a pathway to a two-state solution.
There is no plan B.
Our plan A is for a two-state solution, and we will work with our allies in the region, on the Security Council—as we did on Friday—and closer to home in order to pursue those arguments.
