I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this appalling incident, and our thoughts remain with the families of Jim, John Chapman and James Kirby.
Attacks on aid workers are never justified.
The families deserve justice, and we are pressing the Israeli Government to accelerate their investigation, including into whether criminal proceedings should be initiated.
Israel must stop blocking aid to Gaza, the hostages must be released, and we must have an urgent resumption of the ceasefire.
