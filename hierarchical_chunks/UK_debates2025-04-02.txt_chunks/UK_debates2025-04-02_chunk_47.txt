Thank you for granting the urgent question, Mr Speaker.
This is clearly a difficult and dangerous moment for the middle east.
A way must be found through the dreadful impasse that has led to the breakdown of the ceasefire agreement.
As has been said time and again, the key to a sustainable end to the conflict is the release of the remaining 59 hostages so cruelly held by Hamas terrorists since the atrocities of  7 October .
Their continued captivity is intolerable.
The British Government should be able to bring their influence to bear, and the Foreign Secretary should be directly involved in all efforts to find a way through, working with Israeli counterparts, the US and key regional players and mediator countries.
We said that in the Chamber yesterday.
