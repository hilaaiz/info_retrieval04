I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that tragic case, and I pay tribute to the families.
When it comes to cases such as this, I often find it hard  to think how I would respond if I were a family member in such circumstances.
I am not sure that I would have the courage that those families have to campaign in the way that they have done, and I pay tribute to them for it.
We need to get to the bottom of all these issues, wherever they may lie, and that is what we will do.
