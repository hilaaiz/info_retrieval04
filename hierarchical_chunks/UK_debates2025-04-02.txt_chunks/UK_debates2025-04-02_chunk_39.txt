I thank my hon.
and gallant Friends the Members for North East Derbyshire (Louise Jones) and for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr Bailey) for their questions.
Can the Minister confirm that this agreement will close potentially dangerous routes for irregular migration?
Is that possibly one of the reasons the Conservatives opened and presided over 10 rounds of negotiations on it?
