The Minister stated yesterday, as he has today, that the Government are “in regular contact with all those involved in negotiations.”—[Official
Report,  1 April 2025 ; Vol. 765, c. 147.]
That includes the Foreign Secretary, who spoke to his Israeli counterpart last week.
Will the Minister inform the House what direct Minister-to-Minister discussions have taken place about the current military operations?
Were Ministers informed in advance, and have they been given any information about the objectives that Israel is seeking?
Every week we come here to ask questions of Ministers, and it is unclear exactly what level of influence the Government have.
What is the Government’s plan?
What is their vision of a way through?
What discussions have they had in recent days with vital interlocutors?
On humanitarian aid, does the Minister feel that he has made any progress in his efforts to try to unblock the current aid access situation?
We have spoken about this many times.
Will he update the House on what has been happening to British aid while the restrictions remain?
Where is that aid?
