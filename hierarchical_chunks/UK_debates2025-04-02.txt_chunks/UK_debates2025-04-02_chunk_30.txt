Double child rapist and murderer Colin Pitchfork is up for parole for the fifth time.
I know the Prime Minister does not have direct control—nor should he—over the Parole Board, but he does have a view.
I have asked this of all his predecessors, and I will now put the question to him: does he agree that men who brutally rape and strangle to death young women should, as a matter of a principle, spend most of their natural life in prison?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for raising this appalling case, and I absolutely agree with him that there must be maximum penalties for anyone falling into that category.
I saw many of these cases for myself, at first hand, when I was a prosecutor for five years, and worked with the police on really terrible cases, and I know the impact that such crime has on victims.
I thank him for raising this.
(Urgent Question): To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs if he will make a statement on the status of the negotiations surrounding the future sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory.
