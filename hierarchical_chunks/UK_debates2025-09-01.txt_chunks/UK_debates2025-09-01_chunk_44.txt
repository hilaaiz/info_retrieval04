The Home Secretary rightly also mentioned the impact on local authorities.
When individuals leave hotels, many present as homeless, creating an unsustainable burden on councils, including my own.
Will the Home Secretary explain how she is working with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to support councils and ensure that this crisis is not simply shifted from one overstretched system to another?
In recent weeks, constituents have been in touch with me as they are concerned about the number of flags that have gone up on lampposts around our area.
They worry that the flags have been put up by those who seek to divide our community, not bring it together.
Patriotism is a good thing.
We should be proud of our country.
We should be proud that our country welcomed people such as my nan in the 1930s, when she was fleeing the Nazis.
We should be proud of our record of doing our bit.
We should be proud of the British values I see in action across my community every day.
I am proud of those police officers who kept everyone safe during the protests at two hotels in my constituency over the summer; proud of those teachers and pupils who welcome new classmates when they have been placed in one of the hotels; and really proud of those   who volunteer their time to support new arrivals, whether through local churches or other voluntary groups and charities—because that is what patriotism looks like.
