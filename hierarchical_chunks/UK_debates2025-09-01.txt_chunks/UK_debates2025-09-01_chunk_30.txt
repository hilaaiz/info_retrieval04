I thank my hon.
Friend for his crucial question.
That is exactly why we have revived the landmark pensions commission.
We have to confront the reality that we are on track for tomorrow’s pensioners to be poorer than today’s.
Auto-enrolment has been a huge success, with 88% of eligible employees now saving, but 45% of working-age adults, including 3 million self-employed and one in four low earners, are currently saving nothing.
The commission will ensure that we build a pension system that is strong, fair and sustainable.
