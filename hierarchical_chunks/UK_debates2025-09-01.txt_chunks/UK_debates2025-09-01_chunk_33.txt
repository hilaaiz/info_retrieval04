I was delighted to see the establishment of the disability advisory panel a week or so ago.
[Interruption.]
I am so sorry, Mr Speaker; I have a cold.
How will the advisory panel link with the co-production in the Timms review?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend.
We have announced that Zara Todd will be the chair of the Department’s disability advisory panel.
The panel was announced in the “Get Britain Working” White Paper last year.
Separately, we will set up a group to work with me on the review of the PIP assessment.
I will, of course, talk to the disability advisory panel about the arrangements, but they will be separate structures.
Despite his new role in riding to the rescue of the Treasury, is the Pensions Minister still available to fulfil in principle the undertaking he gave me before the recess to have a meeting about the plight of ExxonMobil pensioners and the difficulties in them getting the discretionary surplus benefits to which I think they should be entitled?
Absolutely.
Before we come to the statement by the Home Secretary, I should like to say something about the House’s sub judice resolution.
The case of Epping Forest district council v. Somani Hotels is still active and before the courts, but because the case concerns wider issues relating to the planning consent required for hotels to house asylum seekers, I have decided to grant a waiver so that Members are free to refer to it in proceedings.
However, I remind the House that there are other active criminal prosecutions related to disorder around the Bell hotel and elsewhere, as well as one prosecution of an asylum seeker for alleged sexual offences.
Hon.
Members may refer to the general issues relating to asylum accommodation, but should avoid discussing any specific criminal cases.
