I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I am glad he is visiting Rugby jobcentre, and I encourage all Members across the House to go to their local jobcentres, because their work coaches have the most experience and knowledge about what we need to do to get people into work.
We are creating “jobcentre in your pocket”, so that everyone can have access to  help 24 hours a day.
Letting technology take the strain will mean that our work coaches can do more of what they do best, which is giving people—person to person—the confidence to take up life’s chances.
