I thank the Secretary of State wholeheartedly for that response, and I agree with her.
Because of the lack of action from the last Government, 26.6% of children in Leigh and Atherton are living in poverty.
I welcome the measures that this Government are taking, including the extension of free school meals, but more needs to be done.
Can she reassure us that she is working hard on the child poverty strategy to ensure that it addresses the needs of all children in poverty, including those with disabilities and special educational needs, so that every child can reach their full potential?
