My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
Anyone who comes to our country needs to abide by our laws.
The rules need to be enforced.
We also believe that new partnership and stronger measures are needed between policing and immigration enforcement and the Home Office to ensure that there are proper public safety plans for the asylum estate.
We are drawing up new arrangements, including not only stronger checks at the border but stronger arrangements in local communities.
I recognise the important point that she makes.
