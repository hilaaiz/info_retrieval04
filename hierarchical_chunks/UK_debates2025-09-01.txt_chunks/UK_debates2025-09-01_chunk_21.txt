I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, because he raises an important point that I do not want to let go, which is how many people with a long-term health condition or a disability are desperate to work.
Our own survey of people on sickness and disability benefits found that 200,000 people would work right now if they were given an opportunity.
We need to give people help to tackle their underlying health conditions, which we are doing through our investment in the NHS.
We need to encourage employers to do more to give opportunities to disabled people to work.
Above all, this Government are determined to meet our responsibilities, with £3.8 billion invested into employment support for sick and disabled people—the biggest amount in a generation.
I look forward to working with him and organisations in Swindon to make sure we get that support right locally.
