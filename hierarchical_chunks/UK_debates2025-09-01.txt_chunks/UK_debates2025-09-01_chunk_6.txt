I thank the Minister for his reply; as always, he is very positive in his responses.
He referred to the anti-poverty strategy.
What discussions has he had about the anti-poverty strategy for us in Northern Ireland?
Levels of poverty and mental health issues have risen dramatically, and young people in  particular are under great pressure.
The Minister is always compassionate and understanding; what is he doing in relation to the Northern Ireland Assembly to make things better for us as well?
