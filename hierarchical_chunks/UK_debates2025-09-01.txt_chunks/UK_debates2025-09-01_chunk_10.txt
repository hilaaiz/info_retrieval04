On the points that the hon.
Member raised about the process for winter fuel payments this winter and going forward, I do not agree with the characterisation he chose to present.
Particularly on the tax side, the process will be automatic.
Nobody will be brought into tax or self-assessment purely because of that change; the vast majority of people will have their winter fuel payments automatically recouped through the pay-as-you-earn system; and anyone who wants to can opt out.
I remind Members that the deadline for that is  15 September .
