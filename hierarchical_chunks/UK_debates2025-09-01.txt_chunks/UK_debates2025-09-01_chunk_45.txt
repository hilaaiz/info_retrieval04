I thank the hon.

At the heart of the France pilot that we have developed is the principle that those who arrive on dangerous and illegal small boats should be returned, but alongside that we should also have a legal route for those who apply and who go through proper security checks.
As part of that, we will seek to prioritise people who have a connection to the UK, such as family groups —people who have family connections to the UK.
Families will continue to need to be an underpinning part of the approach.
The House will recall that the Ukraine family scheme was an important part of the response to the situation in Ukraine, for which Labour called in opposition.
