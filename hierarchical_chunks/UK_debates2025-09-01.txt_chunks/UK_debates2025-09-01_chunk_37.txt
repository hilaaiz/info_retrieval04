I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of her statement.
The Government have now been in office for well over a year, and I think it is fair to say that not even their kindest friends would say they think it has gone well, but listening to her statement, it sounds like she thinks everything is fine and that if there are any problems, it is somehow somebody else’s fault.
Is she living in a parallel universe?
After over a year in office, she must now take responsibility for what is happening under this Government.
