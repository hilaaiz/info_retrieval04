I thank the hon.
Member for his question, and I congratulate Members on all sides of this House who have run campaigns to drive up pension credit uptake.
That is very important, and it is why we have seen 60,000 extra awards over the course of the year to   July 2025 compared with the previous year.
That work, which is very welcome, has been done by not just Members but civil society organisations and local authorities.
