Colleagues in Southend jobcentre are working very hard with Southend young people to help them gain skills, experience and confidence.
The team have launched a bespoke employability workshop designed for young people, and recently delivered a regional work experience pilot for college students.
They also work with our great partners, such as the King’s Trust and FirstPoint Training, to provide placements and opportunities, and there is also the employer-led Movement to Work programme.
Young people across the UK who are not in education, employment or training are more than twice as likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds.
What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that support reaches those who need it most?
