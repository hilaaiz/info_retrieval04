I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
We discussed this issue at some length in the statement before the recess.
He knows that the priority for the Labour party has been to raise the state pension by committing to the triple lock throughout this Parliament at a cost of £31 billion a year.
For the new state pension, that will mean an increase of £1,900 a year by the end of this Parliament.
