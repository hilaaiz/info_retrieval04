Thanks to our Conservative winter fuel payments campaign, thousands of pensioners have signed up to pension credit, and millions more pensioners will receive winter fuel allowance, now that the Labour party has admitted that its policy on winter fuel payments was wrong.
However, the Social Security Advisory Committee recently concluded that the Government’s winter fuel plans fall short of delivering their objectives of fairness, administrative simplicity and targeted support.
It seems that the Government have prioritised civil service bureaucracy over helping frozen pensioners.
Does the Minister agree with the Social Security Advisory Committee’s conclusion about their policies?
