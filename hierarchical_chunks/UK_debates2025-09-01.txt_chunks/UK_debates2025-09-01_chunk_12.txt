Around a year ago, the Labour Government inherited from the previous Conservative Government around 3 million pensioners in poverty.
Sadly, last winter’s cuts to the winter fuel payment saw many pensioners pushed into hardship.
In the light of winter fuel price hikes, will the Minister reconsider the Government’s proposals and ensure that moneys are paid to pensioners who missed out on the winter fuel payment last winter?
