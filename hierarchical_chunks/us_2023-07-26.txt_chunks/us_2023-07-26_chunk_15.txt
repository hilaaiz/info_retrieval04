Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a long-time staff member and dear friend.
Christopher Del Beccaro, who is leaving to embark on his next adventure.
Although he will be greatly missed, I could not be happier for the chapter of life he is about to enter with his soon-to-be wife.
Chris has been my right-hand man, serving as Chief of Staff for the last 4 years.
He has earned the reputation of a kind, patient.
and dependable chief.
I could always rely upon him for intelligent, helpful advice when it came to policy and politics.
Even more importantly, he has led my office with a sincere heart.
My staff has often remarked on his compassion and genuine concern for their well-being.
He brought a spirit of laughter and support in both good times and in difficult moments.
Chris stays true to who he is and what he believes, and I know it will bring him much success throughout the remainder of his life.
I thank Christopher Del Beccaro for a job well done.
I am forever grateful for the friendship and support he has given to me, the staff, and the people of our congressional district.
I wish him and his fiance, Evgeniya, all the best with their upcoming wedding in Montenegro and the adventures that lie ahead.
His presence in my office will certainly be missed, but Chris will undoubtedly continue to be a trusted advisor to me.
Once a member of Team McCaul, always a member of Team McCaul.
