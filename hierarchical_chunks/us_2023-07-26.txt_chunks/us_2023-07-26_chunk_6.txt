Representatives and at the U.S. Capitol, 
Ms. Hamlett will enjoy her well-deserved retirement as we thank her for all she's done.
In the 1980s, 
Ms. Hamlett started on Capitol Hill alongside her mother in the Capitol Cafe, working first as a sandwich maker and then as a grill cook.
Within 5 years she was promoted to hostess and handled the cash register for thousands of visitors and hundreds of Members each week.
She later became an elevator operator at the Capitol before becoming a security guard in the House Chamber in 1994.
In 2007, she was elected to serve in her current role as Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms and has served dutifully for the last 16 years.
We all love her for her strict adherence to House Rules and decorum on the House Floor but know she's just as sweet once you get to know her and hear all her amazing stories from her career on the Hill.
On behalf of my colleagues and Florida's Third Congressional District, we wish 
Ms. Hamlett all the best in her retirement and hope she returns to visit us and this amazing place
she's served with honor and integrity during her long career.
I congratulate 
Ms. Joyce Hamlett, and thank her for all she has done to contribute to the history of this institution.
We are forever grateful and hope she enjoys her well-deserved retirement.
