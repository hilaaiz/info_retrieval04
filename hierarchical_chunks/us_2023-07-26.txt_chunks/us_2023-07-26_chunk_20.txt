Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent from my district, Grace L. Morris.
As we celebrate her life, we think of all the memories that she continues to share, as a citizen of our country.
Grace was born in Pittston, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1923, grew up in upstate Pennsylvania and made her family home in Northeast Philadelphia on Lexington Avenue.
Grace attended Saint John's High School and graduated in 1941.
She enrolled in Germantown Nursing School, graduated, and went to work as the head nurse for the psychiatric ward.
Grace then joined the United States Army.
She served on a POW ship that crossed the Atlantic Ocean 5 times--over and back.
Grace earned the rank of 2nd Lieutenant before World War II ended.
Grace attended classes at the University of Scranton for further nursing studies.
Her marriage to Bill Morris took place September 6, 1946.
While raising 5 children, Grace worked as a Private Duty Nurse at Nazareth Hospital and later as a nursing instructor at the Philadelphia Training Institute.
Grace was a devoted wife, remains an amazing mother and grandmother.
Her great-grandchildren now number 10.
She served as the neighborhood nurse and devoted much time to volunteer efforts through Saint Jerome's Parish, and Winchester Swim Club in Philadelphia.
As we celebrate her 100 years of life, we are incredibly grateful for the positive impact she has made on all who know her.
