Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Mount Arlington Fire Department on its 100th anniversary.
This significant milestone represents a century of unwavering dedication, sacrifice, and service to our New Jersey community.
Firefighters are the first responders to danger and the backbone of keeping our neighborhoods safe.
They represent hope and security, safeguarding our homes and businesses while keeping our families safe.
From literally and figuratively putting out the biggest fires to responding to medical emergencies, firefighters exemplify heroism and commitment day in and day out.
Their bravery, resilience, and selflessness in the face of danger have not only protected countless lives but have also inspired the entire community.
I wish the Mount Arlington Fire Department a happy 100th anniversary.
I thank them for their sacrifices, dedication, and overall, keeping our communities safe.
