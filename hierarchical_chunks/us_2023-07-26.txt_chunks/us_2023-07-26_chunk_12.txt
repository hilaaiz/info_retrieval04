Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Judge Robert L. Miller, Jr. upon his retirement from the United States District Court for the Northern District.
Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Judge Miller has served the Hoosier state and our Nation with distinction for more than 4 decades.
Nominated to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, Judge Miller is now retiring as a Senior Judge as well as a Judge of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a position he was appointed to by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2020.
Some of the awards and accolades Judge Miller has been recognized with over the course of his career are the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, the American Inns of Court Professionalism Award for the Seventh Circuit, and an induction into the South Bend Alumni Hall.
As John Adams famously observed, our constitutional republic is supposed function as a ``government of laws, not of men.''
Our Nation depends on dedicated public servants who faithfully uphold the rule of law and ensure that Lady Justice remains blind.
Judge Miller is 1 such person and jurist.
As he prepares to retire and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to congratulate Judge Miller on a distinguished career and a job well done.
I join Hoosiers throughout the Second District and beyond in expressing our gratitude to Judge Miller for his service and in wishing him and his family nothing but the best going forward.
