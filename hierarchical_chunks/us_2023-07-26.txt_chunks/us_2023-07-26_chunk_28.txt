Mr. SCHIFF.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we pay special tribute to the contributions and sacrifices made by our Nation's women during Women's History Month.
It is an honor to pay homage to outstanding women who are making a difference in my Congressional District.
I would like to recognize a remarkable woman.
Evelyn Serrano of the SunlandTujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.
Evelyn is a Cuban immigrant, artist, educator and community volunteer working at the intersection of creative activism, placemaking, land stewardship, memory, and community engagement, and her employment and volunteer activities are indeed a reflection of her collaborative, artistic nature.
She received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art, Master of Fine Arts in Studio Art and Integrated Media from the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), a Master's in Education from Alliant International University, and her teaching credential from the University of California, San Diego.
