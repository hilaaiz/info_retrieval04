Ms. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service and accomplishments of Olivia Morales, my fellow who has fought to protect and improve our education system.
A Florida native, Olivia came to my office ready to protect and nurture the minds of all from kindergarten to post-Grad.
Within Olivia's first few weeks in my office, her passion and intellect shined through.
She immediately got to work developing ideas to help students in dual-enrollment programs, drafting legislation in various areas of education, and assisting in the introduction of the LOAN and American Teacher Acts.
Her dedication has been powerful as we have fought for the minds of underserved and disadvantaged communities.
Oliva's commitment to educational equity led her to complete her undergraduate degree in Public Policy at Duke University and spend a year working as a College Adviser with the Duke College Advising Corps.
After her service with the Corps, she began her doctoral studies in the University of Florida's Higher Education Administration and Policy program.
Olivia has a promising future--she will continue to make a difference and leave her mark on education policy as she continues to fight for a better system.
On behalf of Florida's 24th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Olivia Morales for her dedication to education and passion for a more equitable Nation.
