I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s statement.
It is a real relief, particularly his description of the hell hole that is Gaza.
Many of my constituents in Rochdale feel deeply appalled by the ongoing deaths and suffering of the Palestinian people in Gaza, but they are also deeply appalled by the rising tide of settler violence and expansion in the west bank.
Many of them are desperate for peace in the region, as are many of us in this House today.
What specific steps is the Foreign Secretary taking to actively promote and uphold the independence of the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice?
