I welcome my right hon.
Friend to his position and the restoration of funding to UNRWA.
It is good to see that when we talked about change at the election, we also meant in the international approach of the Government.
I know that he will share the House’s revulsion at the ongoing horror faced by hostages, their families and the innocent civilians in Gaza facing this enduring crisis.
That revulsion is shared by many people in my Peterborough constituency.
It is a privilege to be a voice for them in calling for a ceasefire, the release of hostages, peace and a complete solution to recognise Palestine.
What message would he send to constituents of mine—who have for too long heard discussions about a two-state solution—to say that this time, with a new Government, we have a new approach to deal with the immediate crisis and achieve the recognition of Palestine?
