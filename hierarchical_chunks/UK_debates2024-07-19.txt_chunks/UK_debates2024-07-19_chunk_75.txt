I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s comments, and I congratulate the local authorities that have those local plans.
If those plans are adopted, that is exactly what we want to see; we want to see more local plans, and more engagement with local leaders, so that we can build the houses that people want in their areas, working together with them.
The hon.
Gentleman talked about the green belt, but we have been very clear on the grey belt as well.
We will not get the housing we need just from brownfield sites, although brownfield will be first.
We will work with local leaders, because the mandate the British people gave us at this election was to get the housing that Britain needs.
I am afraid that the last Tory Government did not take this issue on but failed people, and we have a chronic housing shortage.
Everyone should have a place to call home, and we will legislate to make that happen.
