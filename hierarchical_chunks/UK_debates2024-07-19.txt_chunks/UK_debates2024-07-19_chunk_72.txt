I welcome the Foreign Secretary and the whole Front-Bench team to their place—it is wonderful to see.
I also welcome the visit that the Foreign Secretary made to the middle east, and thank him for the time he spent visiting the families of the hostages who have been held in Gaza for nine months now.
I ask him to commit to do everything he can to ensure those hostages are released immediately.
