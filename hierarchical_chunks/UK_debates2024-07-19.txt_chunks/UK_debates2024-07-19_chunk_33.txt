I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement.
May I associate myself with the comments made today about the bereaved and the integral role of our public sector workers throughout the pandemic?
Local government workers across Paisley and Renfrewshire South were on the frontline during the pandemic.
They established temporary mortuaries to bury our dead, and they looked after the children of key workers so that they could go to work.
Could my right hon.
Friend say a little more about how to ensure that local authorities will be treated as an integral partner in our resilience planning and the response?
That is about not just their funding but the respect with which they are treated by Government.
Could he assure us that, in that spirit of co-operation across the four nations, Barnett consequentials given to the Scottish Government will be passed on to their intended recipients?
