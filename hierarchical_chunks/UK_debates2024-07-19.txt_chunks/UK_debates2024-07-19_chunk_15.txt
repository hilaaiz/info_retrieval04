I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement.
Yesterday evening, I walked alongside the covid memorial wall and was moved by the number of hearts, each one representing someone who died from covid.
I extend my sympathies to all the bereaved families who lost loved ones.
Many people of all ages continue to suffer the consequences of the lack of resilience and preparedness due to long covid, so will my right hon.
Friend reassure Members that those children and adults who continue to suffer with long covid—such as the young granddaughter of one of my constituents in Shipley—will not be forgotten as the inquiry continues its work?
