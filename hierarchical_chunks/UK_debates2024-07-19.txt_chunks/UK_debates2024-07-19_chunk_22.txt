I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and ask that he accepts my condolences on the loss of his auntie during the pandemic.
He is absolutely right to draw our attention to the procurement issues that have been highlighted—they are not specifically covered in this report, but they will be.
As he will be aware, this Government will bring forward proposals for a covid fraud commissioner to recover as much as we can of the money that was lost to fraud or waste during that period.
