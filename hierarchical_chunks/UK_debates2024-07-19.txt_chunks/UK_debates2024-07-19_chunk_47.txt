I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement, although I cannot say that it prepared me fully to find myself on the Front Bench on a Friday morning.
He will know the extensive work that we undertook while in government, following the horrific terrorist attack suffered by Israel on  7 October  and the crimes against humanity suffered by her people.
I welcome his visit to the region.
Israel did suffer an appalling terrorist attack—the deadliest in its history.
As we said from the outset, Israel has the right to defend itself in accordance with international humanitarian law, and we must remove Hamas’s capacity to launch attacks against Israel.
