I had the pleasure of meeting Catherine Colonna in her role as the Foreign Secretary of France.
She is a woman of tremendous capability and integrity.
She looked at these issues in depth, she reported and all our allies have continued to fund UNRWA.
She did make a series of recommendations.
That is why I spoke to the UN Secretary-General and to Commissioner-General Lazzarini, who is responsible for UNRWA, to ensure that they are implementing the action plan that came out as a consequence of that review.
In finding the money available for UNRWA and restoring its funding, I have also ensured that there is £1 million of funding to support the implementation of those recommendations.
