I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her question.
She is quite right to point out that the prevalence of a particular health condition can be higher in one part of the community.
As I have said a few times today, the inequalities exposed in the pandemic made the response weaker than it might have been.
If we are to be stronger and better able to handle an emergency like this in the future, we have to address those inequalities.
That is not just in the interests of those it will help directly, but in the interests of all of us, because when it comes to emergencies like this, we are all in it together.
