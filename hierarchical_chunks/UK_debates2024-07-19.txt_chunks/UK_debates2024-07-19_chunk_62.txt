Earlier this year, in one of the only hospitals still functioning in Gaza, I met a mother whose child had been injured by an Israeli airstrike.
With almost 40,000 killed, she asked me to tell the world what was being done to the Palestinians of Gaza.
She assumed that we did not know, because if we knew, surely we would have acted to stop it.
Does the Foreign Secretary agree that, as well as an immediate and lasting ceasefire, accountability is essential in upholding international law, and that the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice are doing vital work on Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories that must be supported and acted on?
Will he meet me to discuss those issues?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her question.
Many in this House will know of her considerable work and the work of her colleagues on behalf of those suffering in Gaza over the past few months.
They will also know just how hard and unbearable it has been for many, many of those working on the ground.
My hon.
Friend makes an important statement about the independence of the work of the ICC and the ICJ.
I believe in the separation of powers, as I think do all democrats in this House.
It is for judges and the judiciary to have the time to reflect and make their considerations and for politicians to step back and respect them in that process.
That is the case in our own country and it must be the case in international courts of law.
Of course I will meet my hon.
Friend and other colleagues and keep them updated.
