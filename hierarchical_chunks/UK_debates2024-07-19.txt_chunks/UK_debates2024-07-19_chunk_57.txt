I thank the Foreign Secretary for his work on moving Government policy on this issue and for putting the situation in Gaza at the top of his agenda.
In particular, I commend the fact that he and the Prime Minister have consistently called for international law to be followed in the conflict.
When will he publish the Government’s assessment of whether any party has breached international law since  7 October  and what the consequences of any such breaches should be?
