I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement and welcome him to his place.
May I also thank Baroness Hallett and her team and associate myself with the comments that everyone here has made to the victims, the bereaved families and frontline workers?
As my right hon.
Friend said, the voices of the bereaved are at the heart of this report, and that is right.
Can he assure me that when the Government are reflecting on the recommendations, that same spirit will be applied so that those insights go into the Government’s response?
