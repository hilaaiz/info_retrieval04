I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Again, I echo her comments on the memorial wall.
Following the election, we have a lot of new Members  in the House; if any of them find themselves with a spare hour, they could do a lot worse than go to the memorial wall, contemplate, and look at the outpouring of grief that is reflected on that wall.
