I welcome the statement from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and was particularly pleased to hear him talk about the role of local government.
Local government was instrumental in the response, and I imagine the inquiry will find that had it had a greater role, there would have been better resilience.
However, as we know, local government financing is in crisis; my own local council is trying to save £100 million this year.
What  reassurance can he give us that local councils will be given the funding they need to have in place the resilience we need for the future?
