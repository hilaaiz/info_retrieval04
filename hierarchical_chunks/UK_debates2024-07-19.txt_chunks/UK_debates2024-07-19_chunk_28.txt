Baroness Hallett deserves credit for putting the voices of the bereaved up front.
If anyone has looked at the actual report, they will find that before we even get into the recommendations, findings and so on, there are quotes from the bereaved that bring home exactly what these losses of loved ones meant to people, and the lasting impact of that.
Here we are some four years on from the beginning of it.
I recognise the conclusion in Baroness Hallett’s clear report and thank her for it.
In Cornwall, our peripherality made it so much harder.
Our local authority’s public health test and trace was halted by the Government on   12 March  when fewer than half a dozen cases were in existence in Cornwall.
PPE came very slowly.
Citizens were making masks and some councillors and officers drove up to Exeter to pick up some.
Care homes and workers in particular were slow to get PPE.
In many care homes in my constituency, there were tragic results.
Will we ensure that local authority public health directors can be more involved with decision making and setting up local solutions such as test and trace?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight the issue of care homes, where it was such a difficult situation throughout the pandemic.
We were trying to get the right PPE to the staff.
It was a huge problem during the early weeks of the pandemic.
I remember raising questions about that, and it just exposed what a scramble for safety there was, particularly in the early months.
She is right to urge us to learn the lessons from that.
