The right hon.
Gentleman asked a couple of questions on consultation with the devolved Administrations.
Yes, that is essential, as is consultation within England with local authorities and elected mayors.
It is important that different parts of the country work together when there is a national emergency.
There were also questions about how this operates within Government and the balance of responsibility between the centre and individual Government Departments.
Baroness Hallett is quite clear that in a truly national emergency the centre has to step up and responsibility cannot be left to individual Departments.
The right hon.
Gentleman was right to conclude with the spirit of co-operation that we need on this issue.
This work is in the national interest and in the public’s interest.
It is the first duty of any Government of any political stripe to do what they can to protect the public.
The challenge is that the risks we face are more complex and more unpredictable than they have been in the past.
As I said in my statement, we cannot fully plan for every risk, but we have to try to have a system in place that gives us the best possible chance of planning for the risks we can see in front of us.
