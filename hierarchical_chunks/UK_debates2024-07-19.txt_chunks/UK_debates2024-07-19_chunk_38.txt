I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He highlights a very important issue that I spoke about in my opening remarks.
It is an important aim of this Government to reduce violence against women and girls.
I can assure him that the Minister put in charge of that will champion the cause with a passion and determination that I think and really hope will lead to results.
Homes should be a place of safety.
Sadly, as he rightly points out, during the pandemic that was not the case for some.
