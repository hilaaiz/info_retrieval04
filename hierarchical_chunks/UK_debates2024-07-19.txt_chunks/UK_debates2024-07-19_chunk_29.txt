I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement.
Mr Speaker, as you will have noticed, and as other people have referred to, the report states that there was a failure to engage appropriately with local government in preparing for the pandemic.
Sadly, that failure continued throughout the pandemic.
I had the dubious pleasure of being the cabinet member for health and social care in Hammersmith and Fulham council throughout the pandemic.
We had to fight to close our care homes because the hospitals, under instruction from the Government, were discharging residents without testing and would not listen to us and would not stop.
We had to fight to get vaccination in our local pharmacies, and we had to fight to establish a local test and trace system, which then reached 99% of people when the Government were only reaching 62%.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that further stages of the inquiry, or what the Government now do, should identify and learn from the previous Government’s failure to engage appropriately with the local authorities not only before but during the pandemic?
