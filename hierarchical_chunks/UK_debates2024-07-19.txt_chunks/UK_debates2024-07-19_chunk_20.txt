I thank the hon.
Member for his comments.
He is quite right: this report covers all parts of the United Kingdom, and it makes a real effort to do so.
The new Prime Minister also made an effort to do so in the days following the election, and one of his first priorities was to visit Northern Ireland.
I agree with the hon.
Member about co-operation—I think it is essential.
Small differences sometimes act to the detriment of the whole effort.
