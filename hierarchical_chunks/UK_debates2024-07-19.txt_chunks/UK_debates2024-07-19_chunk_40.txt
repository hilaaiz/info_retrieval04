I thank my hon.
Friend, who highlights the difficulties people had in not being able to visit relatives and so on.
Being joined up across the UK is really important.
As I said, there is no place in this kind of planning to let what are sometimes small differences get in the way.
We have to work together in a co-operative way.
We are stronger together.
