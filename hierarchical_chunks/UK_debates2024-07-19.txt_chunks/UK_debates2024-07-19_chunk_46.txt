May I start by welcoming the Secretary of State and his team to their places?
They take up their roles in one of the greatest offices of state, which is committed to shaping the future and the safety of our country.
That is, after all, the foremost duty of our Government.
I take this opportunity to put on record my thanks to Lord Cameron, Lord Ahmad and, of course, the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) , for their steadfast determination to end this conflict, and for the humanity that they displayed when faced with a situation of untold horror.
I also thank them for keeping me—in my previous role as Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee —and both Opposition Front Benches fully updated.
I am sure that the current Government will continue with that collaborative approach.
