I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for that question.
I know that he has championed the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people in this House for many, many years.
He pushes me on an important subject.
May I say to him—he is an esteemed lawyer, so he understands why I am choosing my words carefully—that this is a quasi-legal process and it is important that I follow the actions in the appropriate way, with all probity and integrity?
I will consider those assessments when they are made available to me.
I instigated a process on my first day in office.
I am supported in that by our Attorney General, and I hope to be able to make my views known with full accountability and transparency.
