I welcome my right hon.
Friend to his place on the Front Bench, and I thank him for his statement.
He touched on victims of what has been labelled the shadow pandemic—the surge in domestic violence during lockdown.
Does he agree that any lessons learned must include action to protect those for whom the instruction “stay at home” is the most dangerous they can receive?
