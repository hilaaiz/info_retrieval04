I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement.
We all have stories from the pandemic about how we and our families were affected.
That is as true for Members as it is for constituents right across the country.
My family were on the other side of the England-Wales border, and my stepfather was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic.
I was not able to visit him and provide the support to my mother that our family needed.
Will my right hon.
Friend assure me that we will create a joined-up national strategy?
As he rightly notes, the pandemic did not pay attention to our national borders.
Will he assure me that we will work very closely with scientists to ensure that there is a national strategy moving forward?
