I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement.
Like everyone, my thoughts are with the many victims who tragically lost their lives.
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hard-working staff at St Thomas’ hospital in my constituency who cared for so many people in their last dying days, and who cared for the former Prime Minister when he caught covid-19.
You will be aware, Mr Speaker, that the national covid memorial wall is in my constituency—a stark reminder of the many lives that were lost, each heart painstakingly painted by a family member and dedicated to their lost one.
It is a reminder of the many lives that were lost.
Will my right hon.
Friend visit the covid memorial wall with me and meet the families, and look at how we can make that wall permanent?
This is not just about resilience, but about remembering those victims who tragically lost their lives.
