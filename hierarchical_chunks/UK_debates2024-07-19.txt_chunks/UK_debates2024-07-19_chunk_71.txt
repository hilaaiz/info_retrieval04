I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his question, which gives me an opportunity to talk about what I saw on the west bank.
The situation is febrile—it is anxious.
There is tremendous hardship because of the withdrawal of those funds.
It is phenomenally tense, and against that backdrop, people are watching their land being taken from them before their eyes.
As such, the representations that my hon.
Friend has asked me to make are absolutely the representations I made when I spoke to the leadership in Israel, because this simply cannot continue, and we must act to stop it.
