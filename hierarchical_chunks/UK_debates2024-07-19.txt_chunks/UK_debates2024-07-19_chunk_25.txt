I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement, and I welcome his announcement of a review of national resilience.
Does he agree that the many legacies of the pandemic are still very much with us, from the awful personal impacts of bereavement and long covid to the terrible public service impacts on everything from school readiness to social care systems and more?
Does he agree that those impacts were worse than they need have been, as set out by Baroness Hallett yesterday?
In that spirit, does he agree that this Government’s work of renewal must necessarily also be a work of repair?
