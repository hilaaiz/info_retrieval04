The Minister spoke of resilience.
He is aware that Northwick Park hospital in my constituency was the epicentre at the start of the pandemic, and the lack of resilience meant that nurses there had to wear bin bags to protect themselves.
I noted that he spoke of Grenfell in his statement.
That was fundamentally important, because this is not simply about resilience in health.
In that regard, I ask him to look at the issue of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.
The same RAAC that caused problems in our schools was used in many housing developments at the time.
We need to be resilient to any potential disasters in that respect, too.
I echo my hon.
Friend’s tribute to the work of the NHS staff in his constituency.
RAAC in public buildings is part of the Government’s inheritance.
Just because the problem has slipped down the news agenda somewhat, that does not mean that it has gone away.
In time, we will have to address it to ensure that such buildings—whether housing accommodation or public buildings—are safe for people to live in, work in and be treated in.
I congratulate the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on his new role and welcome the tone of his statement.
The report is a stark reminder—if any were needed—that even the most eminent and public-spirited scientists can occasionally be wrong when groupthink affects assumptions.
What can the Government do to ensure that Ministers and parliamentarians have access to the widest possible range of advice—including, where appropriate, dissenting voices—across a whole range of issues?
The hon.
Member is right that groupthink is identified in the report, so it is important for the Government to have access to the widest range of advice, but no part of that, for me or the Government, will be about engaging in anti-science rhetoric or anything of that nature.
A diversity of views, yes; a denial of the facts, no.
