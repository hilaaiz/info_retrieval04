I thank my right hon.
Friend for an important statement, and I welcome him to his new role.
Like many of us in this room, during the pandemic I lost a good friend and Harlow lost an incredible councillor in Councillor Frances Mason, an incredible community champion who served her community until the very end.
In my constituency, NHS staff at Princess Alexandra hospital were on the frontline during this terrible period.
Their feedback to me was that the Government’s initial response to covid was too slow and failed to recognise the seriousness of the issue.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree?
