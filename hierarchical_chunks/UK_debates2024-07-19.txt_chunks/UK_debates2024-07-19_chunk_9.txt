My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to pay tribute to the staff at St Thomas’ and other NHS staff across the country, who did so much to care for people during that very difficult period.
I have visited the memorial wall in her constituency, and she is right: it is an incredibly moving and human experience.
I am very happy to take up her invitation to visit again.
