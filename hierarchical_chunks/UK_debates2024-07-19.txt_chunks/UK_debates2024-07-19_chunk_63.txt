I welcome the Foreign Secretary and his team to their places.
I also welcome the statement, in particular the emphasis on the need for an immediate ceasefire, for the immediate release of all hostages and for a stop to settler violence and expansion in the west bank.
I welcome the resumption of funding to UNRWA.
