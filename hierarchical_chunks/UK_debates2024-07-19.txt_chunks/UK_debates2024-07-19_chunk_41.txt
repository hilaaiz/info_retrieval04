Module 1 of the report finds that pandemic planning did not take pre-existing health inequalities into account.
In my constituency, those inequalities are particularly wide, as we saw at Grenfell Tower.
I welcome the Minister’s statement that the Grenfell inquiry recommendations will be incorporated into the Government’s response.
Does he agree that in that response we must have a far better plan for protecting the most vulnerable in our society, who are often the most disproportionately affected?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his mention of the Grenfell inquiry.
As I said, it is important to take its findings into account.
It is also true that pre-existing inequalities left people more vulnerable.
A national emergency like this exposes weak points and brings them into the a glaring public light, and they weaken the response of the whole country.
The truth is that we have a stronger response as a country if we manage to reduce inequalities, be they on the basis of ethnic minority or of income.
