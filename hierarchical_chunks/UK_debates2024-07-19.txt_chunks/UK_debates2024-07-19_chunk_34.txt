My hon.
Friend is right to draw attention to the important role of local authorities, as other hon.
Members have.
I hope that I have made it clear in my statement and in my responses today that this must be an effort by the whole United Kingdom: central Government, devolved Governments and local authorities in every part of the country.
We are stronger together.
