The points that my hon.
Friend makes about local government are well made.
As I have said, my experience in my local authority area was that I thought the local council stepped up.
Sometimes the issue of who is vulnerable and where they are is much easier for a local authority to know than central Government.
The spirit of co-operation that I called for in my opening statement is in the public interest and the national interest, and it is what we have to do.
If we co-operate, we will be stronger.
