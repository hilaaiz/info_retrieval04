It has now been many months indeed, and it is sadly possible that some of the hostages are no longer alive—there are reports that some have lost their lives.
I have spoken to hostage families, aware that, in this case, their sons may no longer be with us.
Of course, like any parent, they want the body returned.
There are also hostages still in tunnels, and their parents, brothers, sisters and families are unaware of their health at this point in time.
We will continue to do all we can, working with the Israeli authorities and with nations,  such as Qatar, that, importantly, are able to speak to Hamas in a way that this Government cannot, in order to ensure their release.
