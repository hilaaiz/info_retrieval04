Mr. BARR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Federal Medical Center, located in Lexington, Kentucky.
David Paul serves as Warden and Keith Blanke is Associate Warden.
They lead a large staff of dedicated individuals.
In 1935, the United States Narcotic Farm facility opened in the countryside outside.
Known as Narco, this facility's mission was to treat people struggling with addiction, using new and often experimental treatments.
It was a combination prison and hospital with a research facility.
Inmates worked on the farm that was located on the grounds.
They also interacted with each other through playing music, taking painting classes, and participating in social activities.
When it first opened, only men who were arrested for drug-related offenses were housed there; women were admitted in 1941.
In 1967, the farm portion of the operation closed, and the name of the facility was changed to the National Institute of Mental Health, Clinical Research Center.
In 1974, the facility became a Federal prison and was named The Federal Medical Center, Lexington.
Today, The Federal Medical Center, Lexington celebrates 50 years of service.
The Center, operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, serves around 1500 inmates, who each require medical health care.
The Federal Medical Center serves an important role in our Nation's Department.
I would like to offer my thanks and appreciation to each person employed by the Federal Medical Center.
