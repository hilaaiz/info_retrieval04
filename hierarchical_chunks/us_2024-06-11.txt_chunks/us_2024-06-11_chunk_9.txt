Beyond the football field, Maddox is the team captain of the Varsity Men's Soccer Team and the principal cellist of the L.D, Bell Philharmonic Orchestra.
He recently received the 2024 HEB ISD Education Foundation Award of Excellence, which is given to 33 outstanding high school seniors who have worked hard, overcome adversity, found their passion, blossomed, and excelled above their cohorts.
I want to congratulate Maddox on his outstanding achievements, both on the field and off.
