Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Maddox Olatunde.
As quarterback for L.D. Bell High School in Hurst, Maddox Olatunde helped lead the Blue Raiders to victory over their longtime rival, Euless Trinity, for the first time in 25 years.
After completing 18 of 21 passes for 150 yards plus 135 rushing yards and a touchdown, Maddox was selected as the Dallas Morning News ``Inside High School Sports'' Player of the Week.
