Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the Monmouth County Historical Association.
This milestone will be celebrated by its leadership, members, and the greater community at its 49th Annual Garden Party on June 7, 2024.
I would also like to join the Monmouth County Historical Association in honoring the members of its newly formed Advisory Council: Robert Broege, Hope Jones, and Ross Millhiser.
Organized by a group of Monmouth County residents with the intention of preserving and celebrating the county's rich history, the Monmouth County Historical Association has grown immensely since 1898.
In less than 25 years, the group had expanded to several hundred members and procured an extensive collection.
Today, the Association boasts a collection of over 30,000 artifacts, a headquarters, library, archives, and five historic houses.
The Association is a renowned historical organization that continues to fulfill its mission to discover, preserve, and promote the history, genealogy, and biography.
Through its work, the Association provides an anthology of our heritage for future generations.
Its exhibitions explore various topics from the American Revolution to the County's resort towns.
It has received Giles R. Wright Award twice for its recent work to share the stories and experiences of the enslaved in Monmouth County.
In its 125th year, the Monmouth County Historical Association is led by Executive Director Shannon Eadon and a knowledgeable staff as well as its Executive Committee, Board of Trustees, and its new Advisory Council.
The Monmouth County Historical Association continues to play a vital role in the preservation and promotion of the County's rich history.
As it marks its 125th anniversary, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the contributions and efforts of the Monmouth County Historical Association.
