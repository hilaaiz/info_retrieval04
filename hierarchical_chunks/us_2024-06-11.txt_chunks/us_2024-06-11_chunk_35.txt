Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the life.
Tommie was an incredible representation of answering our nation's highest calling.
He served his country with honor in Vietnam and afterward throughout his local community, bringing joy, enthusiasm, and love to everyone he met along the way.
We mourn with his loved ones and thank them for sharing Tommie with us.
