Community North Texas offers patients a sense of hope through support groups, counseling services, resources, and activities free of charge.
In 2016, Mirchelle took on the role of CEO for the organization providing thoughtful, structured psychological and emotional support for patients.
Five years later, she became a grateful client of the organization she's spearheaded for almost two decades after receiving a breast cancer diagnosis.
Even while undergoing four rounds of one type of chemotherapy, 15 weekly treatments of another, and daily radiation for over six weeks, Mirchelle chose to focus on the positives and used what she was dealing with on a personal level to better connect with clients.
I'd like to thank Mirchelle for the incredible work she's done to support and inspire North Texas cancer patients--even through her own cancer journey.
