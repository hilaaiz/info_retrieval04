Mr. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of P.A.S.O.--West Suburban Action Project (Proyecto de Accion de los Suburbios del Oeste), a community-based social justice organization in Chicago whose mission is to build stronger communities where residents can live dignified lives regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic or immigration status.
Since its founding in 2009, P.A.S.O. has become one of the leading immigrant rights organizations through grassroots organizing and coalition building working in collaboration with partners to create systemic, social change that leads to more equitable and just communities for people of all backgrounds.
Over the past fifteen years, P.A.S.O. has been a pillar of our community and a beacon of hope for so many.
From supporting immigrants and refugees training them to defend their rights, to providing health education to seniors and parents, to championing workers rights, and providing free educational opportunities in Spanish, P.A.S.O. supports communities in the quest for change.
I am honored to commemorate P.A.S.O. on their 15th Anniversary.
Congratulations (eFelicidades!).
