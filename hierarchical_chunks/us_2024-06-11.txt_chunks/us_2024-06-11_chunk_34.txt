Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Tommie Frye, a resident of Ypsilanti, Michigan and veteran of the Vietnam War, and to mourn his passing.
His dedication to his country and local community over a long and exceptional life is worthy of commendation.
Tommie served honorably as a medic in the United States Army during the Vietnam War.
He met his wife, Sally Frye, at church while stationed at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.
After finishing his service, he worked at Ford until his retirement.
Throughout his life, Tommie gave much of his time, energy, and resources to Parkridge Community Center in Ypsilanti.
He worked tirelessly with the young people in his community as a beloved mentor, helping to keep them away from trouble and steering them towards successful futures.
His unwavering support as a donor and fundraiser was also vital to Parkridge Community Center's ability to continue operating as a pillar of support for the young people.
Tommie's faith was a crucial part of him.
He was a member.
Olive Church of God in Christ in Ypsilanti, Michigan for his entire life.
He was a pillar of the Mt. Olive community, serving as a deacon, usher, and trustee.
He lived out his faith in every aspect of his life through his service, generosity, love, and compassion for everyone around him.
His faith in God gave him strength in his final days as he went to claim his eternal reward.
Tommie is survived and remembered by his loving wife Sally, to whom he was married for 52 years, his four children, and his thirteen grandchildren.
