Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and career of National Park Service Ranger Tom Lorig, who tragically passed away at the age of 78 on Friday, June 7, 2024, while on the Job in Bryce Canyon, Utah.
Ranger Lorig worked and volunteered as a National Park Service Ranger for fifty-six years.
He became involved with the park service in 1968, working at the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico for five years.
During his career, he served at fourteen national park sites, including Badlands, Bryce Canyon, Yosemite, Zion, and the Dinosaur National Monument, for which he had a particular affection.
He also served for over ten years as a permanent, seasonal, and volunteer park ranger across many of these park sites.
Beyond his service to our national parks, Ranger Lorig was also a registered nurse for forty years in the Seattle, Washington area, demonstrating his commitment to helping people and supporting those who needed it.
I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Ranger Lorig's family, friends, and the Bryce Canyon National Park community.
His loss will be felt by those who knew him and the many he assisted during his impactful career as both a nurse and a Park Ranger.
It is public servants like Ranger Lorig who truly make our country great.
