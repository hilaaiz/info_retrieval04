JoAnne was asked to serve as interim principal for the 2009-2010 school year, which she happily accepted.
Throughout her career, she dedicated herself to serving her students and staff, and this did not go unnoticed.
JoAnne has run into former students many years later who fondly remember her class and the positive impact she made on them as an educator.
In addition to her professional career, JoAnne has given back to her community in many ways.
She volunteered at local soup kitchens and provided patient outreach at Berkshire Medical Center through her church to help those in need.
She is married to her husband Harry, and together, they raised two wonderful children and have many more grandchildren.
In her free time, she enjoys spending time with them and rescuing senior dogs so that they can spend the rest of their years in a warm and loving home.
I'm proud to recognize JoAnne today a lifetime countless students to be successful and live fulfilling lives.
It is an honor to bestow JoAnne with the Patriot Award for her exceptional service to the people.
