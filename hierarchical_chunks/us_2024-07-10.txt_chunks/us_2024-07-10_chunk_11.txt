Mr. Speaker, Edgar ``Eddie'' Peter Guaraldi's legacy is one of committed service to his country, and his community, and most importantly, his family.
It is my distinct privilege to join Mr. Guaraldi's family and friends in recognizing his 100th birthday and to thank him for his service on behalf of a grateful Nation.
