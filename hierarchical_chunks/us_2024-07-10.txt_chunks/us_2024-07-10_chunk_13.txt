Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate Wacker Chemical of Eddyville, Iowa.
Wacker Chemical established its Eddyville plant in 1999 and recently celebrated its 25th anniversary.
Wacker Chemical has been at the forefront of cyclodextrin production since it was first built.
The Eddyville plant plays a central role within our global network of Biotech and Biopharma sites.
From Iowa alone, Wacker produces all the cyclodextrin it sells.
Eddyville is an important pillar of the BioSolutions portfolio and Wacker's growth strategy.
I extend my sincerest congratulations to Wacker Chemical on a tremendous 25 years of business in Iowa and honor its dedication to manufacturing for Iowans.
