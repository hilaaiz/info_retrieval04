Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mrs. Heather Bowers of Frisco, Texas, and present her with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Heather has faithfully dedicated herself to serving our community.
Heather was born in Waco, Texas in 1977 and moved to Carrollton in 1980 where she resided until she married her husband, Jason.
She graduated from the University of North Texas in 2002 with a Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences degree and then moved to Frisco in 2005 where she raised her two children, Macy and Caleb.
Heather has been President of Lone Star Benefits since 2000, buying the agency 4 years ago and building a thriving employee benefits agency with her husband.
Since her move to Frisco, she has been actively involved with numerous community and political organizations in North Texas.
Heather's strength is not only due to her love of lifting weights, but also evidenced by her service to the city through roles on the boards of Frisco Community Development Corporation, Frisco Chamber of Commerce and Frisco Family Services.
She is invested in our youth and schools as a District Improvement Committee and Mindbender Academy Committee member.
Heather's philanthropic passion is notable, as her family and business support organizations such as National Breast Cancer Foundation, Community Council of Greater Dallas and Los Barrios Unidos Community Clinic.
I am proud to recognize Heather today for her outstanding efforts to support those in need and uplift those she works with.
I'm confident she will continue to make a positive impact in our community for many years to come.
It is an honor to bestow Heather with the Patriot Award for her exceptional service to the people.
