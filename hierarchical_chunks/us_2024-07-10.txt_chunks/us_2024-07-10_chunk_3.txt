Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Pastor Dwayne R. Gillison, Sr., as he receives the Community Leadership Award from the Mary B. Talbert Civic and Cultural Club, Inc.
Pastor Gillison's devotion to his faith and public service will be recognized at the 116th Empire State Federation of Women's Clubs Convention.
Pastor Gillison is a proud graduate of the State University of New York Brockport, the Bible College of Rochester, and the Houghton Christian Academy.
In 2022, Pastor Gillison was elevated to Pastor of Mount Olive Baptist Church in Buffalo.
In his ministry, Pastor Gillison has led the construction of the Mount Olive Senior Manor, an affordable housing community for seniors on the East Side.
Working with People Inc., the complex will provide 65 accessible housing units to seniors in need.
