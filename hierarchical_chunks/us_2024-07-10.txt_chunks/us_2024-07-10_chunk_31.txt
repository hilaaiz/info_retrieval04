Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker, to the immediate and extended family, staff, friends, supporters, constituents, colleagues, and wellwishers of my dear friend, colleague, comrade, political ally, and our senior representative on the Cook County Board, I rise to honor Dr. Dennis Deer.
I greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Christ and I am sure that he has already said to Dennis, welcome home my good and faithful servant.
I have known the Deer Family for more than fifty years when I met and worked with his parents; father Herman, Mother Shirley and their neighbors who founded the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Health Center in North Lawndale on West Greenshaw Street, they lived on Greenshaw Street, it was one of the first of ten centers of its kind in the United States, now there are fourteen hundred and they are servicing more than 30 million low and moderate income individuals.
Of course, that portion of Greenshaw Street is now Honorary Shirley Deer Way.
I lived on West Greenshaw Street.
Dennis grew up around community activism and politics.
He took to it like a duck takes to water, attended George W. Collins High School where my wife taught, my friends were principals, teachers and administrators.
He went off to college, returned home, earned additional college degrees, married his high school sweetheart, wonderful wife Barbara, settled in the community, they have three children and he became a leader, worked with President Bobbie Steele, Commissioner Bob Steele, the Turner Family, the Scott Family, Lawndale Christian and the Faith Community to help bring the North Lawndale Community back to a state of optimistic redevelopment and it is on a roll.
