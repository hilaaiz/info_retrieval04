Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Jonathan Delagrave.
Jonathan served as the County Executive of Racine County from April 2015 until his sudden passing on June 28th.
Jonathan, a lifelong resident of Racine County, was a beloved figure in his community.
He served Racine County both as an elected official and a civil servant.
He began as the Town Chairman and later Village President.
Jonathan then worked in the Racine County Human Services Department, becoming Director in 2010.
He was first elected as Racine County Executive in 2015.
His popularity was reflected in his reelections as County Executive in 2019 and 2023, a testament to his leadership and the community's trust in him.
Jonathan constantly worked to make Racine County the best it could be.
He focused on spurring economic growth and workforce development by forging partnerships between local, state, and private entities to benefit all residents.
He championed mental health and fought to expand access to these critical services in Racine County.
Jonathan's dedication to improving the lives of people in Racine County was evident.
I was honored to work together with Jonathan on efforts to preserve our Great Lakes community harbors.
As many of us in Racine County know, Jonathan was a true Wisconsinite at heart.
He was an avid fan of Wisconsin Badgers football and encouraged those who attended his funeral to wear their favorite Badgers attire.
He also established a scholarship in his memory to provide student-athletes with mental health care.
Most importantly, Jonathan was deeply devoted to his family, and a great friend to me and many others.
Jonathan is survived by his son Maguire and daughter Makenzy.
I offer my condolences to his family during this difficult time.
Jonathan will be missed.
