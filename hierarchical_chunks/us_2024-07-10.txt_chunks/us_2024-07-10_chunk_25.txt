Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Coach Michael Murgo of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Coach Murgo has dedicated himself to faithfully serving and uplifting his community.
A native of Bristol, Rhode Island, Coach Murgo attended Colt Memorial High School and Brewster Academy.
During this time, he discovered his passion for sports, and this inspired him to study physical education.
In 1969, Coach Murgo graduated from the University of Rhode Island, where he was recognized for his athletic abilities and distinction in football.
As such, he was selected to play professional football for the Providence Steamrollers.
Coach Murgo began working for the Pittsfield Public School System in 1972 as a physical education teacher, a role he held for over 35 years.
He also served as the football coach for Pittsfield High School for 17 years and led his students to success through physical fitness, teamwork, and discipline.
On top of his professional career, Coach Murgo worked diligently to support his four children so that they had the opportunity to pursue their interests.
He is married to his wife, Ellen, and they will celebrate 52 years of wonderful marriage this year.
I am pleased to recognize Coach Murgo for a lifetime of service as a teacher, coach, and mentor for our youth.
His contributions to our community have been nothing short of outstanding, and I wish him continued success for many years to come.
It is an honor to bestow Coach Murgo with the Patriot Award for his exceptional service to the people.
