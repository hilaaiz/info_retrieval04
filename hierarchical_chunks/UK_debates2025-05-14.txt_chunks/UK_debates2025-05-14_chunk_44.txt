I have been a member of the Conservative Friends of Israel for over 40 years, longer than anybody here.
Hamas is a brutal terrorist organisation that hides its own fighters under hospitals, but it is frankly unacceptable to recklessly bomb a hospital.
It is unacceptable to starve a whole people.
Is the Minister aware that many Friends of Israel worldwide, notwithstanding narrow legal definitions, are asking this moral question: when is genocide not genocide?
I have heard in recent weeks a series of powerful interventions from Opposition Members, and I take them seriously with the weight they hold, particularly  from the Father of the House and my neighbour in Lincolnshire.
We will not move towards making determinations from the Dispatch Box on questions of legal determination, but that does not mean we will wait.
The preliminary judgments of the ICJ and the provisional measures it set out are important, and we will abide by them.
As the Minister has said, the situation is intolerable with one in five Gazans facing starvation; the use of aid as a weapon of war by Israel is inexcusable.
The continued firing of rockets by Hamas and detention of hostages are also inexcusable, and it all must end.
I welcome the UK, with our international allies, calling an urgent briefing on the situation at the UN Security Council.
There, the UN humanitarian chief was clear in his warning about the dire consequences of the situation continuing.
What steps are this Labour Government taking to get more aid in, get the hostages out and bring about the ceasefire and two-state solution that we all in this House desperately want to see?
