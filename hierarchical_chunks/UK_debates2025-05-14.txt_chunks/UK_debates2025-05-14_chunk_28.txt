On behalf of my party, may I offer heartfelt congratulations to His Holiness Pope Leo XIV?
May I also offer our support to the Prime Minister and his family after the appalling arson attacks on his home?
I echo his thanks to our brilliant police and firefighters.
Three years ago, the previous Government were faced with a choice.
Their own Migration Advisory Committee told Ministers that recruiting more care workers required improved conditions, career progression and better pay, but the Conservatives chose not to do that and instead brought in large numbers of care workers from overseas.
The carers looking after our loved ones in care homes should be thanked, not demonised.
Will the Prime Minister now do the things that the Conservatives refused to do, starting with a higher minimum wage for carers?
May I first thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his comments about me and my family?
I really appreciate it.
It is important that we have fair pay for care workers, and that is why we have put in place our fair pay agreement.
This is the first of its type.
It will be applied first to care workers to ensure that they get fair pay, but also a better framework for progression.
As he will know, most people leaving care work are going to the NHS because of the pay and the ability to progress.
Our fair pay agreements will deal with, making sure that in the future those jobs are more secure.
I will just add a declaration of interest: my sister is a care worker—I know at first hand how important the work is and how difficult sometimes the situation facing them is.
