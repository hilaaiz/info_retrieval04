I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this, because the situation in Gaza is simply intolerable and getting worse.
We are working with other leaders urgently to bring about the rapid and unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which is desperately needed—obviously, alongside the release of hostages and getting back to a ceasefire—and that  work is going on through my team 24/7.
I do believe that that is the initial action that needs to be taken, but I still fundamentally believe that, however remote it may seem at the moment, the pathway to a two-state solution is the only way for settled and lasting peace in the middle east.
We will continue with our allies to pursue that path.
