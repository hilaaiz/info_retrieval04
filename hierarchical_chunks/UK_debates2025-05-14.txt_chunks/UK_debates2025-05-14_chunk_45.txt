I thank my hon.
Friend, who I know has been long committed to these issues and used to be an aid worker herself.
She is a doughty advocate on these points.
We remain absolutely committed to a two-state solution.
We are focusing all our diplomatic efforts on ensuring that the current approach is changed, that we return to a diplomatic solution, and that we have a ceasefire, the release of hostages and a move back to that two-state solution, which, as she rightly puts it, is vital.
