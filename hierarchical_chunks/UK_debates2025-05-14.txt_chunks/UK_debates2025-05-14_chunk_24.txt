I thank the Leader of the Opposition for her words about the attacks on me and my family, and many others for their kind messages in the past few days.
The Leader of the Opposition messaged me pretty well straightaway, which I really do appreciate.
She is absolutely right that it was an attack on all of us, on democracy and on the values that we stand for.
