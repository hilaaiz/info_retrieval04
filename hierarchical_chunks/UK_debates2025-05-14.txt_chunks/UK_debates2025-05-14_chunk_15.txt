My hon.
Friend is highlighting the great work coming out of Basingstoke, which will not just contribute to the productivity of local authorities around the country but benefit our entire economy.
I can assure him that this Government are committed to harnessing  the power of British technology, putting it to use for citizens across our country and for productivity in Government, and I look forward to engaging more with the companies he has mentioned.
The use of AI in radiotherapy planning increases productivity twentyfold, yet the Government’s decision to stop funding for AI contouring is estimated to cost waiting lists half a million extra days.
Will the Secretary of State intervene and talk to his friends in the Department of Health and Social Care to make sure that they restore that funding and save lives?
I can assure the hon.
Gentleman that we are investing heavily in AI technology across the NHS for the benefit of patients.
I have visited Huddersfield hospital, where AI has been fully integrated into the radiography department.
I will look into the specific issue that the hon.
Gentleman has raised, and if there are any conversations to be had, I can assure him that we are on the side of patients and of harnessing technology for the good of patients.
