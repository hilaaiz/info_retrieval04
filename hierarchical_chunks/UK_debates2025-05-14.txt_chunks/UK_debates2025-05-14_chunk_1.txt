Maternity services in Yeovil are due to shut on Monday, after a deeply flawed Care Quality Commission inspection in January, and are to be moved to Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton, which does not have capacity for an extra 1,300 births a year.
Although the closure is initially for six months, I have received no guarantee that the services will open again, which is creating huge fear.
Will the Prime Minister or the relevant Minister agree to meet me and colleagues from the south-west to stop this decision?
We have seen the contempt in which the Government hold the WASPI—Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign—women, pensioners and the disabled, and their contempt for Scotland’s energy sector, job creators and the hospice sector, but that is all a function of policy.
Policy is discretional and therefore, for better or worse—usually worse—legitimate.
Adhering to the ministerial code is not a matter of discretion.
To be honest, it is a little beneath the Leader of the House to say, “We don’t announce things to Parliament first every time, but we do some of the time, and sometimes the House isn’t sitting.”
Every example presented to her today relates to a time when the House was sitting.
When will she relay to the Government and the Prime Minister that Members are severely annoyed by the Government’s repeated inaction?
For her information, contrary to what is being said by the three Scottish craws sitting on a wall behind her, there is no such duty on Scottish Government Ministers as that set out in section 9.1 of the ministerial code.
