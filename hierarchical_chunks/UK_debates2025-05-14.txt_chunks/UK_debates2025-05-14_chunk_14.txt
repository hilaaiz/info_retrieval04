I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.
The Government are rightly focused on driving public sector reforms through the smarter use of technology, and in Basingstoke we have seen what is possible.
ICS.AI has already helped Derby city council to save millions of pounds using AI.
GemaSecure, another local firm, is developing home-grown tech to help to protect vital infrastructure from cyber-threats, and TBSC has produced software to reduce costs wasted on unused IT subscriptions by up to 25%.
Will the Secretary of State join me in Basingstoke to meet those firms and others to discuss how his Department can work with them to help to achieve our mission of building a more efficient, secure and modern public sector?
