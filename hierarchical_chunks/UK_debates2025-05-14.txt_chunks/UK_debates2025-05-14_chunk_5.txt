I welcome the investment in my constituency from Project Gigabit’s £157 million deal to upgrade Scotland’s broadband.
The remote jobs market opens up employment opportunities for those who live outside the major cities.
However, several constituents from more rural areas around Bridgend, Armadale, Bo’ness and Bathgate have told me that they have lost out on opportunities for flexible working, and even lost jobs due to poor connectivity.
Can the Minister reassure my constituents that they will not lose out on future opportunities because of where they live?
