Turning to the middle east, for more than 10 weeks Israeli forces have blocked food, water and medicine getting into Gaza.
There is now a humanitarian catastrophe, with 2 million people at risk of famine and one in five facing starvation.
Rather than ending this crisis, the Netanyahu Government are planning to seize all Gaza indefinitely.
I know the Prime Minister will agree that the blockade of Gaza should end and I am sure he will agree that it would be appalling if Netanyahu proceeds with that escalation, but will he act now and pick up the phone to President Trump for a joint plan to recognise Palestine and get food, water and medicine into Gaza?
