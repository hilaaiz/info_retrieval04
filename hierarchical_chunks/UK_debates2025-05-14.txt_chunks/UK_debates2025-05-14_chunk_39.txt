The Minister has repeatedly said that we do everything to observe international law.
Will he please accept that there is a growing body of opinion that says that the UK is not doing that, and that we are not complying with our obligations if we continue to supply parts for the F-35 programme, because these are dropping weapons on children in Gaza?
We cannot say that we  are observing the Geneva conventions, the genocide convention and Rome statute if we continue to supply those goods.
He talks about doing all that we can.
If that is the case, why on earth are we not making it abundantly clear to Israel that trading with it is not an option while this continues?
So in answer to the question “Is he doing all he can?”, there are many people in this place and beyond who think that we are not.
I know my hon.
Friend’s commitment to these issues over a long period of time.
I do not accept the premise of his question.
Whether or not we abide by our legal obligations is a question that will be determined by the courts.
It is being determined by the courts this week, so I will leave it to the courts to make judgments on our obligations.
We are taking all the steps that we can to bring this conflict to a close.
He mentions the vital question of the F-35 programme.
I know this House understands the significance of that programme, not just in Europe but across the world.
The carve-out that we have put in place has been done on the basis of robust legal advice, which is being tested in the courts this week.
We must abide by our obligations to our allies.
We are not selling F-35s directly to the Israeli authorities.
We continue to supply a global spares pool.
That is necessary for the continued function of the F-35 programme, which has critical importance to European security.
We make these judgments calmly and soberly, and we will continue to do so.
