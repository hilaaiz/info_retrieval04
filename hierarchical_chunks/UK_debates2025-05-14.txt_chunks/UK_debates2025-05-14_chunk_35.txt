I thank my hon.
Friend; she is a powerful champion on this issue.
Our principle is that every young person with special educational needs should receive the right support to succeed.
We have immediately announced an additional £1 billion for high-needs funding, including almost £20 million for schools in Lancashire.
We will support special schools, and deliver truly inclusive places and expertise in mainstream schools to help every child thrive.
