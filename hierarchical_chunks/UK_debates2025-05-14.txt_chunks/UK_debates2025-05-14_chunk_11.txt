I really welcome the US-UK trade deal and the fact that the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister kept their commitment not to put online safety on the table in those negotiations.
My Committee’s inquiry into social media misinformation and algorithms has heard evidence that the algorithms in social media drive the spread of misinformation, and we saw the consequences of that in the summer riots.
Will the Secretary of State confirm that, as well as not watering down the Online Safety Act, he will look to strengthen it and is discussing how to do so with our allies in the US?
I reassure my hon.
Friend that I am looking very closely at how we strengthen the online safety regime in order to protect children further into the future.
I have commissioned research into the exact causal relationship between which products young people use and the impact that they have on them, and I will act accordingly from there.
