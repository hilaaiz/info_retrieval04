While the Prime Minister prefers to take to the international stage, back here at home Labour’s Birmingham bin strike is now in its 10th week.
Rubbish is still piled on the streets and recycling goes uncollected, and the reputation of the west midlands is being trashed.
His Ministers continue to wash their hands of this and his mayor does not even want to talk about it.
Will the Prime Minister come to the west midlands and sort this out, because at the moment it is only the squeaky blinders that are winning?
Further evidence of the decline of the Tory party: they say that going to Ukraine at the weekend to try to secure peace for Ukraine, for the security and defence of Europe, is somehow the wrong priority.
That conflict has already massively impacted people in this country through the cost of living crisis and energy.
Ukraine, Europe and we deserve peace, and to live in peace.
Dealing with the bin strikes is a priority.
We continue to call on Unite to suspend the strike immediately and bring the disruption to an end.
We are supporting the council to ramp up the cleaning operation.
We are now collecting over 1,100 tonnes of waste every day and continue to offer our support so that the backlog does not reappear.
Last  week, I visited Sacred Heart primary school in Hyndburn, where the excellent teachers expressed their frustration at the current special educational needs and disabilities system.
One wonderful boy, despite being non-verbal and requiring personal support, has been waiting for over 18 months for an education, health and care plan.
There is a risk that he will not get a place in a school for the year ahead that suits his needs.
How will the Prime Minister ensure that the voices of parents and children are at the heart of the SEND reforms that the Government will bring forward?
