I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman’s comments—I am glad that he is expressing an interest in this issue.
He took part in a Westminster Hall debate on it only a few weeks ago, when I was a bit grumpy with him, for which I apologise.
He makes some good points.
He may not be aware of the campaign, which is already up and running, so obviously the awareness campaign needs to do a bit more work to make him aware of the awareness.
