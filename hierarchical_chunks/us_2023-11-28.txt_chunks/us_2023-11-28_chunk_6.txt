Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor World War II Marine Corps veteran William P. Gosch as he celebrates his 100th birthday which is December 8th.
William P. Gosch was born in North Tonawanda, New York, on December 8th, 1923.
While attending North Tonawanda High School, he showed academic prowess, earning a football scholarship to attend Niagara University.
After graduating from high school in the Fall of 1941, William chose to forgo his scholarship and joined the Marine Corps.
For two years, he served as a rifleman and military policeman in the infamous ``Carlson's Raiders'' in the Eastern Pacific Theatre of World War II.
William Gosch was an exemplary soldier.
His unit was awarded a presidential citation for their heroism in capturing the Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.
During his time as a Marine, he participated in action in Bougainville, Emirau Island, the St. Matthias Islands, Guam, and Okinawa.
Following the Allied victory in World War II, William Gosch worked as a general manager in the Richardson Boat Company before spending time working in the costume jewelry business in Honolulu.
After returning to Buffalo and settling down, his opportunity to dedicate more to the Buffalo community came in 2020 when he was instated as the temporary replacement for the 2nd Ward Alderwoman.
Following this, William received the rare opportunity to collaborate with YouTube documentarian Rishi Sharma, where he promoted awareness of the remaining World War II veterans to an audience of over one million people.
Today, I want to congratulate William on his 100th birthday and express my deep gratitude to William Paul Gosch for his service to our country and the Buffalo community.
As William said in 2020, ``Buffalo is the greatest city in the world.''
it is a great city because of dedicated individuals such as William Paul Gosch.
