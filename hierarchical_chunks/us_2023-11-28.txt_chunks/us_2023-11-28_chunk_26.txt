Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday.
A veteran who served our country with honor and bravery during our darkest hours eighty years ago, he spent the last eight decades continuing that service within his local community and uplifting those around him.
As we celebrate the milestone of a centennial, Michael should know that he is appreciated and valued by his family, friends, community, and nation.
We thank him for his service, and wish him a 101st year filled with laughter, love, and many blessings.
I thank Michael.
