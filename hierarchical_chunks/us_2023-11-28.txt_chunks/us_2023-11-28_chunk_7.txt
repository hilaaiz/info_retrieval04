Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize Mike Budney, Manager of the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, on receiving a 2023 Presidential Rank Award (PRA).
The PRA is one of the highest awards bestowed upon career senior executives by the President of the United States for making extraordinary and lasting achievements for their respective agencies.
During his service at the Savannah River Site, Mike has overseen completion of the tank waste treatment system with the startup of the Salt Waste Processing Facility, spearheaded the Accelerated Basin Deinventory project, saving taxpayers billions of dollars, and broken ground on the Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative, a facility that will bring government, industry, and academia together to develop and share advanced manufacturing technologies.
Leading a workforce of over 12,000 government and contractor personnel to successfully accomplish these critical tasks demonstrates his commitment and service to this nation.
This is in addition to his 29 years of service in the U.S. Navy, including commanding officer of the USS Emory S. Land and the USS Pennsylvania.
I am grateful to Mike for his service in helping to keep America strong and safe.
Congratulations on receiving the Presidential Rank Award, an inspiration for what we can achieve as public servants.
