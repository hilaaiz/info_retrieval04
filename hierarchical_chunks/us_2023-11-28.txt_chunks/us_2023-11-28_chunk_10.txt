veteran August V. Cosentino for his community accomplishments and lifelong dedication to America's values.
In 1951, young August Cosentino enlisted in the United States Air Force and was assigned to attend radio and radar school at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, for one year of intensive training.
Following his training, he was assigned to a forward operations outpost on the 38th parallel of the Korean peninsula, where he aided in directing advanced bombing missions in North Korea.
After the Korean War, August Cosentino married the love of his life, Martha, and together they raised three children: Cindy, Ralph, and David, before Martha passed away on their 59th anniversary in 2012.
To support his family through a growing America, August worked in the sales business before forming his own company--August Cosentino Enterprises, where they supplied the automotive industry with custom made parts.
The Buffalo community played a large part in 
Mr. Cosentino's life.
August served as the president of Kenmore Rotary, where he tirelessly exemplified their motto of ``Service Above Self.''
As a talented musician, August can play the piano, accordion, and stand-up bass.
He has played in several military bands since 1951 and is well known in the Western New York music community.
Mr. Cosentino still plays standup bass weekly in the choir at the Newman Center mass.
I am excited to thank the guest of honor, veteran August V. Cosentino, for his service.
Mr. Cosentino served our country 70 years ago and our grateful community since then, and I hope for many more bright years to come.
