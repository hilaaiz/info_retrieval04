Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Michael Mitroka, a longtime resident of Southgate, MI and veteran of the Second World War, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.
His service to our country is worthy of commendation.
Born on November 20, 1923, Michael enlisted in the Army as a Private in May of 1943.
Over the next two and a half years of service he would traverse the Pacific, seeing combat in places like New Guinea and the Philippines.
The Japanese conquest of the Philippines just a couple of years earlier was one of the worst military defeats in U.S. military history, and the retaking of the islands, though sure to be a long and hard affair, was a point of pride for General MacArthur and the Army.
By the time Michael left the Army as a Sergeant in December of 1945, he had earned the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, a good conduct medal, a purple heart, and two bronze stars, awarded for ``heroic or meritorious service in a combat zone.''
Michael carried on his service after the war by working in his local school district.
He retired in 1985 as the Supervisor of Maintenance, Custodial, and Transportation after 35 years with the Southgate School District.
Michael married his wife, Rosemary, just a few weeks before his discharge from the Army in 1945.
Though Rosemary passed away in 1994, her legacy carries on in their two sons, Paul and Michael Jr., three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
Still an active member of his current and former community, Michael is a member.
Aloysius-Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Royaltown, IL, the American Legion Post 975 in Dowell, IL, and the Knights of Columbus Council Post 3965 in Southgate, MI.
