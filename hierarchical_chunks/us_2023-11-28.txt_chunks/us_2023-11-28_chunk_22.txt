Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mary Ellen Stone for her many years of service for the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center (KCSARC) and congratulate her on her retirement as the Executive Director.
Mary Ellen has served as a steadfast advocate for survivors of sexual assault over the past 44 years throughout King County and Washington State.
She has been a visionary leader in changing the landscape of sexual assault services including prevention, education, and victim advocacy.
She was influential in establishing the state's first accreditation process for sexual assault providers, professionalizing service delivery and ensuring core services to be accessible; and publishing ``He Told Me Not to Tell,'' one of the first educational pieces in the nation for parents to talk with their children about sexual assault.
As a result, KCSARC is nationally recognized for its effective and innovative services.
Mary Ellen has shared her time and expertise in many ways to better inform systems and communities about the needs of victims.
This includes serving on the Seattle Archdiocese Review Board, Mental Illness Drug Dependence Oversight Board, Seattle Chief of Police Search committees, Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, Sex Offender Management Committee, Women's Funding Alliance, and Municipal League Seattle-King County.
My staff and I have had the privilege of working with Mary Ellen on multiple occasions.
Through her productive relationships with several elected officials, Mary Ellen has helped the KCSARC gain exposure at both the state and federal level.
Her passion, tenacity and leadership have shaped KCSARC into the strong, vibrant nonprofit it is today.
