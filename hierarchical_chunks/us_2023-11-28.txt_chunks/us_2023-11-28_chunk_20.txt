Ms. DelBENE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest gratitude for the outstanding service and unwavering dedication of Andy Flick, who served as the Executive Director of the New Democrat Coalition.
During my time as Chair of the New Dems, his tireless efforts were instrumental in advancing our shared vision for pragmatic and innovative solutions to the challenges facing our nation.
From the intricacies of policy research to the dynamic coordination required in the Coalition's daily operations, his contributions have truly made a lasting impact.
Andy's commitment to fostering bipartisan collaboration and ability to navigate the complex landscape of Capitol Hill have not gone unnoticed, and now he serves as the Director of Legislative Affairs for the Vice President.
His strategic insights and meticulous attention to detail were invaluable assets to our team.
As we continue to strive for a more effective and efficient government, I want to take this moment to recognize and thank Andy for his exemplary service.
The New Democrat Coalition and I are profoundly grateful for Andy's hard work, and I am confident that his future endeavors will reflect the same level of excellence he brought to our team.
I wish Andy the best of luck in all his future endeavors and thank him for his outstanding service.
