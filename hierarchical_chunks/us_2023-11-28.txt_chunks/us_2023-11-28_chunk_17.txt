Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Luis MolinaBarraza of Westminster, Colorado for receiving the United States Department of State Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship.
As part of this prestigious honor, Luis traveled to Morocco to study abroad.
U.S. Study Abroad programs are an important component of the federal government's efforts to ensure Americans of all backgrounds have the opportunity to gain global experiences and work across our borders to help address our world's greatest challenges.
The Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship provides exceptional undergraduate students with the opportunity to expand their cultural proficiencies, study critical need languages, and conduct STEM research.
The scholarship has empowered over 41,000 individuals with financial need to engage in people-topeople diplomacy and prepare for distinguished careers in public service.
I commend Luis for pursuing an exemplary international education and representing America abroad as a citizen ambassador.
This scholarship rightly recognizes a commitment to academic excellence.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to recognize Luis' many accomplishments.
