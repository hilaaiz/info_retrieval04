Ms. BYNUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding efforts made by one of my own constituents, 
Ms. Abby Lachman.
Ms. Lachman, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 6, recently visited Washington, D.C. to advocate on behalf of herself and the millions of Americans living with Type 1.
I am impressed by her dedication to advocating for herself and her peers at such a young age and I am eager to see the changes she will make in the future.
I am proud to represent you here in Congress Abby.
I include in the Record the following article written by Noemi Arellano-Summer in the Bend Bulletin highlighting Abby's work.
