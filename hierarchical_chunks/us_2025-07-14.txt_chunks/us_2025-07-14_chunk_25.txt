Mr. Albright, a rising senior at Hempfield High School in Lancaster County, was also the Division Champion at the 2025 North Museum Science and Engineering Fair.
Mr. Albright is the first North Museum Science & Engineering champion to win an award in international competition since 2017.
In both competitions, his project centered on experimenting with and designing fully biodegradable fishing lures as an eco-friendly, costeffective replacement for plastic lures.
The worm-shaped lure, made from a biopolymer recipe, could substitute for traditional soft plastic lures which can break off hooks and sink to the bottom of waterways.
