Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate National Heritage Academies, or NHA as they are known, as they celebrate their 30th anniversary.
It is critical that every child, regardless of income, background, or zip code, has access to a quality education.
National Heritage Academies delivers on this goal!
NHA prepares students from all walks of life for academic success while opening doors to trade schools, community colleges, and four-year universities.
Since 1995, National Heritage Academies has offered quality education opportunities to more than 60,000 K-12 students.
NHA runs over 100 charter schools primarily in my home state of Michigan, but has also expanded into 8 additional states.
One of those schools in Michigan is Vanderbilt Charter Academy in Holland, Michigan, where I served on the board for 5 years.
Charter schools provide families with a tuition-free alternative that offers greater choice in the education their children receive.
National Heritage Academies strives to put kids on a trajectory to reach their full potential and achieve success both in and out of the classroom.
