Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Citizens of the 10th Congressional District and a grateful Nation, I'm honored, humbled, and privileged to recognize United States Marine Corps Corporal George Ivanoff on his 100th Birthday.
I wish him continued great health, love, and happiness in his future adventures, and continued Godspeed.
For his selfless, honorable, and tireless service to our great United States of America, ``Thank You'' will never be enough.
He is the standard by which we all should be judged.
