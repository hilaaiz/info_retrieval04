Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor William (Bill) T. Baglietto who passed away on June 9, 2025, at the age of 96, after a remarkable life of public service, legal distinction, and civic leadership.
Born in San Francisco in 1928, Bill's early years were shaped by hardship.
After his family faced bankruptcy during the Great Depression, they relocated to a cabin in Woodacre, California.
From these humble beginnings, Bill's extraordinary work ethic and intellect carried him far.
He worked his way through high school, college, and law school as a member of the Marin County Fire Department, ultimately graduating as valedictorian from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949.
He earned his J.D. from Berkeley Law in 1952, where he served on the California Law Review--a foundation for what would become a distinguished legal career.
Bill practiced law for 63 years, including 35 years as a partner at Nossaman LLP.
He became one of California's leading experts in business, water, transportation, and public policy law.
Among his many legal contributions, he successfully defended First Amendment rights before the United States Supreme Court.
His commitment to justice, transparency, and public accountability informed both his legal practice and his public service.
From 1960 to 1974, Bill represented Marin and Sonoma Counties in the California State Assembly.
A moderate Republican and tireless advocate for civil rights, he received an outstanding voter rating from the NAACP throughout his legislative career.
Notably, he authored landmark legislation on transparency including the California Public Records Act and the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act--cornerstones of open government in California.
Following his time in the Assembly, Bill was appointed by President Gerald Ford as the first chair of the newly created Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Under his leadership, the CFTC helped modernize and globalize the futures market.
He traveled to Europe and Tokyo advocating for fair, well-regulated markets, and served on the Futures Industry Association Board.
His public service extended to the California Transportation Commission, the Public Utilities Commission, and the University of California Board of Regents--each role reflecting his lifelong commitment to the public good.
Bill received numerous accolades throughout his life, including the UC Berkeley Alumnus of the Year award in 2002.
But to those who knew him well, he will be remembered for his character: principled, pragmatic, and endlessly generous with his time and wisdom.
Bill is survived by his wife of 60 years, Diane; their children Lynn, Bill, Jr., Walter, Shana, and Tracy, and his grandchildren Nicholas, Julian, Nathaniel, Grant, and Layli.
