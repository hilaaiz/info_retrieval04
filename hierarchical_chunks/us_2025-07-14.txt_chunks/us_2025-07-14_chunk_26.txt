Mr. Albright cites his early memories of swimming and fishing on the Susquehanna River with his father as the driving motivation for his desire to keep our community's waterways clean and plastic-free.
I want to congratulate 
Mr. Albright on his achievement at the local and international level, and to recognize the hard work, dedication, and innovative spirit that went into his project.
As a fisherman myself, I am grateful for 
Mr. Albright's contributions to solving the pollution issue.
I wish him continued success in his studies and pursuits.
