Mr. Speaker, Heather Millett should always be recognized as a Hurricane Helene Hero, and I am honored to share these words to honor her unforgettable, lasting contribution and to express my deepest appreciation for her service to the people.
As Legislative Director, Heather played a key role in shaping my office's policy agenda and making sure that the voices of the people we serve were heard in Congress.
Her expertise has made a meaningful and lasting impact on many Americans, especially in areas she cares most about, such as infrastructure projects, veterans' benefits and healthcare, voter integrity, economic development, and reducing regulations.
Heather provided the genius behind many essential pieces of legislation, like the Equal Representation Act, the Promoting Resilient Buildings Act, the Justice for America's Veterans and Survivors Act, and many others.
In just two and a half years working beside me, a new member of Congress, Heather has authored five pieces accomplishments, and I expect many other pieces of her work will soon become law.
Another remarkable achievement of Heather's that leaves a lasting mark on history is her skillful and masterful navigation of the Congressional appropriations and grants processes to secure tens of millions of dollars for essential infrastructure and needs for NC-11.
While the numerous buildings, dams, equipment, and other projects that will improve and save the lives of the people I represent may never bear her name, many of us will see them throughout our lives and know Heather played a key role in securing them.
On behalf of all of us, I thank Heather for her leadership, her loyalty, the example she has set, her steadfast service, and dedication to my district, as well as her lasting impact on the Congress of the United States.
We wish her all the best in her future endeavors and hope she takes with her pride in a job extraordinarily well done.
