Mr. Speaker, Bill Bagley embodied a rare blend of intellect, humility, and commitment to public service.
He believed government could work to improve quality of life for everyone--and he worked tirelessly to prove it.
I respectfully ask that you join me in honoring his enduring legacy and extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who had the privilege to know him.
