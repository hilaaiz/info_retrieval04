The British oil and gas industry is a resilient sector—it has had to be, given this Government’s actions over the past year—and it takes a lot to shock it, but shocked it was when, on  2 July , sadly the Energy Minister claimed to the Scottish Affairs Committee that there was no “material difference” between oil and gas imports and production from the North sea.
Might the Secretary of State take this opportunity to apologise and clarify those remarks, because thousands of workers in the energy industry supply chain in Aberdeen and across the UK are very worried that the Department has such scant regard for them, their work and this world-leading industry?
First of all, Mr Speaker, let me congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on his promotion to shadow Secretary of State.
[Laughter.]
On the specific issue he raises, we will take no lectures from the Conservatives.
Some 70,000 jobs were lost in the North sea on their watch.
And here is the difference: we are building the future.
The Acorn project was talked about for year after year by the Conservatives but nothing was done.
This Government are delivering.
