I welcome the Government’s mission to achieve clean power by 2030.
I know that the Minister will agree that it is vital that we make the transition to net zero as quickly as possible, not only to fight climate change but to lower energy bills.
Does he agree that whereas previous Governments have failed to deliver for the British people, our plans are the single best way to bring down energy bills for families, including in my Battersea constituency, and to provide them with much-needed energy security?
