I thank my hon.
Friend for the question and for the work that he and the whole Committee have been doing on this matter.
His report has been my bedtime reading every night this week as it is an important piece of work.
He is right about two things.
First, where processes are not as well aligned as they should be, we absolutely need to look at what we can do to make sure that they work much more coherently.
The second point his report made, which we are also looking at, is how we bring together things such as the strategic spatial energy plan, the holistic network design and the land use framework to make sure that we have coherent plans across the country, so that we can plan properly our energy system.
