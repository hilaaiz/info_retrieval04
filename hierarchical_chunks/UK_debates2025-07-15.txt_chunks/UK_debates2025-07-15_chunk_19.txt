As someone who grew up in Luton, I am not sure I am allowed to say that I love Watford, because there is an age-old rivalry there—but yes, we know that acting now with our clean energy superpower mission, scaling up renewables, reinforcing the grid and reducing our reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets will mean a cleaner, more secure future for generations to come.
That is why, unlike the Conservatives, we are following the science and showing the leadership that is needed at home and abroad.
Around Beverley, there are proposals for five solar farms, totalling 465 MW.
Can the Minister assure my constituents that the scientific evidence that will be used to assess this will include the cumulative impact of these projects on the area around Beverley?
Yes, of course we look at the cumulative impact of these developments.
Having been in the Department, the right hon.
Gentleman will know that we have an excellent team of scientists led by Professor Paul Monks, who I want to pay tribute to because he is standing down later this year.
I am sure the right hon.
Gentleman would want to do so too.
