I think I said in my statement to the House that Rimmer recognises the uncertainties and the brutal nature of the Afghan Taliban regime.
There can never be no risk in such judgments and decisions, and that is one reason that I and the Government have taken this decision with hard deliberation and serious intent.
I hope the House will back it this afternoon.
I am grateful to the ministerial team for my early briefing, which gave me an opportunity to read a Foreign Affairs Committee report that came out—it was begun in September 2021—in 2022 under the chairmanship of  the right hon.
Member for Tonbridge (Tom Tugendhat) .
It is called “Missing in action: UK leadership and the withdrawal from Afghanistan” and it was excoriating: “The manner of the withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan was a disaster, a betrayal of our allies, and weakens the trust that helps to keep British people safe.”
It said: “the Government should keep better records—securely held—on locally-employed staff”— we have heard that this is one of the many data losses from ARAP— “to ensure that any evacuation can be carried out more effectively.
It should devise a policy, based on clear and fair principles, about the assistance that will be offered to local partners in the event of a security deterioration, and report to us when it has done so.”
I hope that such a policy has been developed, that more lessons have been learnt and that Ministers will report to my Foreign Affairs Committee about where we are now.
I am sure Ministers will report to my right hon.
Friend’s Committee if she invites us to do so.
She is right to make the big argument that anyone providing data to the British Government has a right to expect that personal data to be stored securely, handled safely and not subject to the sort of loss or breach that we saw too often in the early days of the Afghan relocation schemes.
