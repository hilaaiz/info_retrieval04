I welcome the hon.
Lady’s response.
I provided the answers to two or three of her questions directly to the shadow Defence Secretary.
On the steps  we have taken to ensure the reduced risk of data losses and data breaches in future, one can never say never but I am more confident that I was 12 months ago.
I have also given a response on the £7 billion figure.
The estimated full costs of all Afghan schemes that will run to their completion, from start to finish, because of the savings that will derive from the policy decisions we have taken today, will be between £5.5 billion and £6 billion.
The cost of the ARR scheme to date—the cost and the sums committed to bring the 900 principals and their immediate families who are in Britain or in transit—is about £400 million.
On those still to come, I expect the cost to be a similar sum.
