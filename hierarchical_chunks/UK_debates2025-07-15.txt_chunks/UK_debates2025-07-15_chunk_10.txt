The challenges of increasing electricity grid capacity include the ability to get planning consent and to achieve grid connections, as the Minister knows.
In the report that the Select Committee published last week, we referred to the problem of inconsistency in some of the guidance and energy plans over which comes first—the grid connection or the planning consent.
Will the Minister please address  that and ensure that the Government clear up that inconsistency, so that we can move forward with increasing electricity generation and grid capacity?
