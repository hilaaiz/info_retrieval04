I thank the Minister for her answer.
Energy security is important not just to help bring bills down now.
Does the Minister agree that it is also vital for the future and for protecting future generations, including in my constituency of eminently lovable Watford, because those young people are the ones who will face the climate change consequences in the years to come?
