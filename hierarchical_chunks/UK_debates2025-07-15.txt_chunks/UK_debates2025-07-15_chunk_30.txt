With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on a significant data protection breach from February 2022 relating to the Afghan relocations and assistance policy.
It led to the High Court granting an unprecedented super-injunction and the previous Government establishing a secret Afghan resettlement route.
Today I am announcing to the House a change in Government policy.
I am closing that resettlement route, disclosing the data loss, and confirming that the Court order was lifted at 12 noon today.
