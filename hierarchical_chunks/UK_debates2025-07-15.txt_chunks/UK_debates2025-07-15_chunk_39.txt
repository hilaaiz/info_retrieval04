I am pleased this House now has the opportunity to scrutinise this alarming data breach.
It was right that the then Government moved to introduce a new scheme to try to minimise the risk to the Afghan soldiers and their families caught up in this breach involving 18,714 individuals in total.
It is the very least we owe them given the sacrifices they made to support our campaign in Afghanistan, and I welcome the apologies from both sides of the House as a result of this data breach.
There are, however, serious questions raised about how this data breach was allowed to happen under the Conservatives’ watch, and the heightened level of risk it has created for the Afghans involved.
What steps have been taken to address the root cause of the breach and ensure that it cannot happen again?
Reporting by the Financial Times this afternoon suggests that an original relocation scheme considered for all 25,000 Afghan personnel could cost up to £7 billion.
Will he confirm what assessment his Department has made of that figure, and why that was kept hidden from the public?
The immediate priority must be to ensure the safety of all those individuals caught up in this breach, so what assurances can the Secretary of State provide that lifting the super-injunction does not heighten dangers for the individuals concerned?
What steps is he taking to ensure that the individuals whose data was leaked are aware of the incident?
What additional support is being provided to them directly now that the case is in the public domain?
In the light of these developments, can he outline when the casework and final relocations under this and the ARAP scheme will be completed?
