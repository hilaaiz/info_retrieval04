I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a doughty champion of the value of taxpayers’ money, and he makes a very important point.
The commitment I can give goes rather more broadly than that, which is that the Government will seek to make sure that any exit payments always offer value for money and that every pound of taxpayers’ money should be well spent.
In responding ultimately to the consultation that the Government conducted almost a year ago, I will ensure that the point he raised is fully addressed.
