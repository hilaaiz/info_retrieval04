My hon.
Friend says that the Government are committed to doing something, but we are now in 2023, and it was in 2015 that the Government first resolved that something must be done about obscenely high public sector exit payments in excess of 95k.
In the intervening period, the Government have been all over the place, and I wonder whether the Minister could tell me the result of the most recent action, which was a consultation paper in August 2022.
The closing date for that was  17 October 2022 , more than a year ago.
What has happened to that?
My hon.
Friend makes a fair point about the pace with which the Government have been able to proceed.
I will write to him, following his important intervention, with the latest on the prognosis for that.
I hope he will also recognise that it is not correct to say that the Government have done nothing.
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Salisbury (John Glen)  is, as we speak, leading an important piece of work about productivity across all public sector spending.
All my colleagues in government are endeavouring every day to ensure that every pound of Government money is well spent.
My hon.
Friend will recall—this is why it is so important to get this right—that past attempts have not always delivered the desired results.
In 2020, the Government laid legislation—notwithstanding his own prolific endeavours on this, I know that my hon.
Friend is not in general a big advocate of the Government constantly legislating—but in 2020 the Government legislated to introduce a cap on payments.
That was subsequently withdrawn following unintended consequences, and the risk of overriding and conflicting with people’s contractual entitlements.
Let me be clear: my hon.
Friend is absolutely right in his intention.
