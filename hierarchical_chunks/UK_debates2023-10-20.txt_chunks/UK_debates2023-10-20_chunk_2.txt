I thank the hon.
Lady for giving way, because she is making a very important speech.
Protecting people, especially women, from harassment is hugely important.
The Government have a fantastic track record of bringing in legislation to protect vulnerable people.
I had strong concerns about the Bill in its unamended state, particularly on making employers responsible for third-party harassment.
However, yesterday I contacted Denise Rossiter, the chief executive of Essex chambers of commerce, to ask the opinion of Essex businesses.
The message I received back was clear: local Essex employers warmly welcome  the amendments made to the Bill in the other place.
I am delighted the Government have backed them.
I welcome the amendments, in particular Lords amendment 1, and I support the Bill in its amended state.
