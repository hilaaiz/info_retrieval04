I thank my hon.
Friend and office neighbour for making that point, which was also made by Eve Appeal.
I cannot remember the statistics, but there is a stark difference.
I talked about this issue when I met the Minister yesterday and she gently pointed out to me that it is not just in healthcare where women are dismissed as hormonal, premenstrual and so on.
I thanked her for reminding me of that in the gentlest possible way.
