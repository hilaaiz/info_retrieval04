I thank Jonathan for sharing Tilly’s story, and wish him all the best as he moves to Northern Ireland with Tilly’s mum and big sister Emily to start a new job.
I thank Livingston’s Team Jak for their ongoing support for Tilly’s family and many others.
Neither Jonathan nor I want to suggest that the Bill would have saved Tilly, but we hope that it will improve survival rates for  others, and take them beyond the 50% rate given to Tilly.
That is why Jonathan is here today, and why I am here today.
