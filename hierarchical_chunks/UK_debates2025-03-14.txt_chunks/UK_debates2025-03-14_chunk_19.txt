We will have a report on the orphan drug Act in 18 months’ time.
In that period, over 3,500 people will have been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, and many of them will have died.
Why is it going to take us 18 months?
Why can’t we change things now?
Why, in spite of the huge support we have had for the Bill from the Secretary of State for Health, could we not get something much more fierce in it?
It is not a criticism; it is an observation.
I know progress begins slowly, and I am grateful for my hon.
Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West taking up the Bill and for having the calm demeanour that I lack, because I do not think the Whips would have accepted anything that I would have come up with as a private Member’s Bill.
We need a revolutionary attitude.
We either see and harness progress, or we come back next year, the year after and the year after that to ask why there has been no progress.
All of us, individually and communally, need to dedicate ourselves to that progress and to keep asking the questions, being angry and simply refusing to accept that nothing can be done.
