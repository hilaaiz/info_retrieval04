I remember the day my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
I remember my mum and dad picking me up off the floor.
I was supposed to be supporting them, but that did not happen that day.
Dr Lau at Blackpool Victoria hospital explained that my dad’s cancer was terminal.
My dad was initially given chemotherapy to try to shrink the tumours and give us more time.
Later, he was asked to take part in a trial using immunotherapy.
It was explained that the immune system does not recognise cancer as alien and as a threat.
Immunotherapy teaches the immune system to recognise cancer, and enables the body’s immune system to fight back.
My dad was a fighter and he was willing to try anything.
His body struggled with chemotherapy, and after we nearly lost him twice in 12 months it was stopped, but the immunotherapy continued.
He finished the course without any complications.
Once my dad started the treatment, the cancers—there were many—never moved.
To this day, we do not know whether the treatment cured him and he was left with just scar tissue, or whether the cancers lay dormant.
What I can tell the House is that my dad did not die of cancer; it was something else that took him from us.
My family believe that we were given an extra three years of loving and being loved by my lovely dad because of immunotherapy.
We will always be grateful for the Christmas days, the birthdays, the celebrations and sometimes the tears that we were all able to share with my wonderful, caring dad.
