I thank the hon.
Members for Edinburgh South West (Dr Arthur), for Mitcham and Morden (Dame Siobhain McDonagh) and for Birmingham Erdington (Paulette Hamilton), because I have enjoyed working with them on the Bill.
We all have our own stories.
I should state my personal interest.
My sister Georgie is sitting in the Gallery.
She was diagnosed with a GBM—glioblastoma multiforme—nearly two years ago.
I would like to say that she is alive and well, but let me just say that she is alive and she is doing well.
She has been brave, determined and an inspiration to us all.
It is particularly painful as she is a mother of three, a wife, a daughter and a sister.
We have a lot to focus on, and it is on us collectively.
