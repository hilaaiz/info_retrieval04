I emphasise that there are great opportunities in front of us for accelerating research and making broad advances in the battle against rare cancers.
Along with almost half my parliamentary colleagues, I am proud to have pledged my support for the Lobular Moon Shot project, which advocates a boost of around £20 million over five years for research on the basic biology of invasive lobular breast cancer, with a view to developing new treatments.
Despite being the second most common form of breast cancer, lobular breast cancer is in many ways treated like a rare cancer.
It is under-researched, difficult to diagnose through the standard screening mammogram, and often presents fewer symptoms than invasive ductal carcinoma, which makes up the overwhelming majority of breast cancer incidents.
As the hon.
Lady is explaining very well, invasive lobular breast cancer is not classed as a rare cancer.
I am concerned that it would not come within the scope of this Bill, so I  gently ask if it could be widened at the next stage.
As she says, lobular breast cancer has many characteristics of a rare cancer.
