Absolutely.
Last week, I attended a reception for the Eve Appeal.
I was really struck by the fact that early diagnosis was a big feature of what the charity was talking about, and I will come on to that in just a second.
As a consequence of the lack of recognition of the symptoms of rare cancers, too many people are diagnosed too late.
Last week, at an event hosted by the Brain Tumour Charity, I met Gabrielle and her wife and children.
Gabrielle told me how the neurologist to whom she was initially referred did not recognise her brain tumour symptoms, and told her instead to go home, breathe into a paper bag and get some counselling.
If only curing brain tumours was so easy.
Reflecting on the comment made by my hon.
Friend  the Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck) , an observation that I have made on this journey is that so many of the people who have talked about late diagnosis have been women.
That is purely anecdotal, but it seems to be the case.
When I was at the Eve Appeal reception, the point was made that so many women are turned away; the GP tells them that they are hormonal, premenstrual or premenopausal.
My hon.
Friend is making an incredibly important point, with which many across the Chamber will agree.
The statistics are particularly stark for women from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; they are even more likely to be dismissed.
