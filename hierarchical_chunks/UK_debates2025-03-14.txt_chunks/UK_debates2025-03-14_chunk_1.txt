Second Reading I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
We all know someone who has suffered from a rare cancer—a brain tumour, childhood cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, or one of the other cancers on a long list that are unfortunately all too familiar.
Each of them may statistically be considered rare, but collectively they are anything but rare.
Blood Cancer UK states that rare and less common cancers account for 47% of all UK cancer diagnoses—a staggering 180,000 a year.
The irony of the Bill’s title is that so-called rare cancers are not rare.
Common cancers deserve attention, but so too do rare cancers.
I want to share an example of a family in my constituency who were confronted with a rare cancer.
Tilly’s first symptoms were leg pains and loss of appetite.
This was in September 2021, when face-to-face GP consultations were not possible.
On visiting A&E, she was given ibuprofen.
It was thought that she might have a virus.
Six weeks later, she returned to A&E and was transferred to the cancer ward, where she was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma.
On diagnosis, she was given a 50% chance of survival.
Despite undergoing over a dozen rounds of chemotherapy and an operation, she sadly passed away about a year after her first symptoms appeared.
Tilly was just four years old.
Her father Jonathan, a headteacher in my constituency, is in the Gallery.
He reached out to me after reading about the Bill.
He explained his frustration that the development of new treatments for neuroblastoma has been moving at a glacial pace for too long.
The same is true for many other rare cancers.
This slow pace of change is not respected by these cancers, and it meant that Tilly missed her seventh birthday yesterday.
