I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Edinburgh South West (Dr Arthur)  for bringing the Bill to the House, and join  him in paying tribute to our hon.
Friend  the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Dame Siobhain McDonagh)  for her campaigning, and for her powerful speech calling for a revolution in attitudes.
I also thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Calder Valley (Josh Fenton-Glynn)  for his very moving speech.
As somebody who lost a brother much too young, I was deeply moved by his words.
