I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Edinburgh South West (Dr Arthur)  for introducing the Bill and for the courtesy he has always shown me, which must have been difficult at times as I sat shouting at him in Portcullis House about how everything was useless and hopeless.
In my calmer moments, I understand that progress begins with small steps.
I am frustrated that those steps are too small.
I am delighted that there will be one database for trials, but if there are no trials, the database does not get us very far.
