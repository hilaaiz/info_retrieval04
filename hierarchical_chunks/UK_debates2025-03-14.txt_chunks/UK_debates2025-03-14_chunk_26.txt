I thank  the hon.
Member for Edinburgh South West (Dr Arthur)  for introducing this Bill.
I will argue in favour of it today, using three examples: first, the story of a constituent suffering from a rare cancer; secondly, the importance of this Bill for extremely rare cancers; and, lastly, its importance for future research.
