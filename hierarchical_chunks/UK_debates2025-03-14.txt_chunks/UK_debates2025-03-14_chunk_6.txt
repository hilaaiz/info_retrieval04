I thank my hon.
Friend for the powerful way he is introducing his Bill.
My constituent Steph is just 29 years old and is a mam to two little girls.
She was diagnosed with grade 4 glioblastoma, known as astrocytoma, on her birthday last year.
For months prior to her diagnosis, she was treated for migraines by her GP.
Steph knew that she was not suffering from migraines, yet she was rudely dismissed by an A&E doctor, and felt nobody was listening to her.
Steph has since had brain surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
My hon.
Friend knows that early diagnosis and treatment is vital.
Can he assure Steph and her family, and me, that the Bill will help to raise awareness across the medical profession of rare brain cancers?
