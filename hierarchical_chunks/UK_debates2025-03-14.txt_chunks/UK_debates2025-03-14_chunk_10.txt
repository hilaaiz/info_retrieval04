I thank my hon.
Friend for the powerful way in which he is introducing the Bill.
Will he recognise the work of pioneering teams such as the one at Charing Cross hospital, under Imperial College healthcare NHS trust, where Professor Michael Seckl is leading the way in groundbreaking treatment for and research on gestational trophoblastic disease and germ cell tumours?
Does he agree that those centres need support to expand and share their research findings with the rest of the NHS?
