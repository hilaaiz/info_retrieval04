I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question.
We are looking at provisional registration.
As I also mentioned to his hon.
Friend  the Member for Broadland and Fakenham (Jerome Mayhew) , we are very open to the idea of a dental training school at the University of East Anglia.
We need to ensure that we push on the full spectrum of all these measures, because there is a crisis in NHS dentistry and we need to get on and fix it.
