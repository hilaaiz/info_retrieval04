The verdicts and sentences of the 45 are, like the 2020 national security law itself and the treatment of Jimmy Lai, clear violations of the Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong.
Following the meeting between President Xi and the Prime Minister, will my right hon.
Friend please share with the House what steps the Government plan to take to ensure that the joint declaration is adhered to?
I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend for the work that she is undertaking on this matter through her leadership of the Select Committee.
The UK Government have been very clear about these issues.
The right hon.
Lady rightly mentioned the case of the British national Jimmy Lai, whose trial will resume tomorrow and whose case is a priority for the UK Government.
The Foreign Secretary raised it during his first meeting with China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, at the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on  26 July , and, as I have said, the Prime Minister also raised it during his engagement a few days ago.
We will continue to call on the Hong Kong authorities to end their politically motivated prosecution and release Jimmy Lai immediately, and we will continue to press  for consular access and, indeed, exert pressure in relation to the other human rights issues that are of such concern to everyone in the House.
