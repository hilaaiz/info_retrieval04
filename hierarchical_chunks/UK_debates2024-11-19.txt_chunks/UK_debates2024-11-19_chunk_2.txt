I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
He has also been vocal in his support for British citizens who have been arbitrarily detained, and on wider human rights issues.
I commend him for his work on that agenda.
The FCDO point about the toolkit is really important.
The difficult question that we have to ask ourselves is: how have we have reached the situation where one of our citizens is languishing in the jail of a friendly country—a close ally—with all the potential damage to UK-UAE relations that that does?
