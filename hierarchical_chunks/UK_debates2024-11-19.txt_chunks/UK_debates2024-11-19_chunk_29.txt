I thank  the hon.
Member for Rutland and Stamford (Alicia Kearns)  for organising a powerful letter, and I was glad to be able to put my name on it.
Given the concessions that were given to China by the Prime Minister and the particular responsibility that we have to Hong Kong, what did the Prime Minister get out of the meeting?
Can the Minister tell us the read-out from the Prime Minister, and when will she publish her audit?
Following the question from  the right hon.
Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith) , will the audit include the option of sanctions?
