The Minister well knows that there is a lack of dentists in the east of England, because there is no undergraduate training facility.
The nearest place is either Birmingham or London.
He has kindly mentioned the University of East Anglia, which is ready to go with a new building under construction.
It has wide cross-party support, as he also knows from the meeting that he held recently, so when will he make the announcement?
