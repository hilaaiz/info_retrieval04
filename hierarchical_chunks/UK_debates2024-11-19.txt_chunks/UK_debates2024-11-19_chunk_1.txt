I can assure the hon.
Gentleman that the Minister for the Cabinet Office is carefully considering this matter.
If the hon.
Gentleman would like, the Minister for the Cabinet Office will write to him, but he is considering it.
We expect the Infected Blood Compensation Authority to begin making payments to people who are infected under the infected blood compensation scheme by the end of this year.
Payments to the affected are expected to begin in 2025, following a second set of regulations.
Turning to a question raised by the hon.
Member for Perth and Kinross-shire about the independence of IBCA, it is rightly operationally independent.
Parliament would clearly expect the Government to have oversight of a scheme of this size and for there to be proper management, given the amount of public money going into the scheme.
It is true that there are only two non-departmental public bodies that are independent of the Government: one is IBCA and the other is the National Audit Office.
It is absolutely right for IBCA to have that independence.
First, I commend the hon.
Gentleman on securing this debate.
I spoke to him before it.
I have always been a speaker for human rights, as he and the House knows.
Whenever I hear stories like the one he has outlined so well, it tells me that there is injustice.
The friendship between the UK and UAE does not matter; this is about justice and doing right when somebody is discriminated against.
Does he not agree that the inaction of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s—I say that respectfully—in respect of one of our citizens is incredibly concerning?
The fact that Mr Cornelius has served his sentence, only to have the goalposts moved, does not speak of international justice, but injustice.
I believe that our Foreign Office has an absolute duty to advocate for this British citizen.
