I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that follow-up question, but he will recall that, when we met, I and my officials made it clear to him that the UEA has not yet submitted its bid for a dental school.
In that meeting, we said: “Please go back to the UEA and encourage them to submit that bid.
When they do, we will look at it very carefully.”
