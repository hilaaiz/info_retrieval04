It has been reported that the Home Secretary plans to tighten the rules for those arriving on a health and care worker visa, to block most from bringing dependents with them—yet another in a long list of her vendettas against children coming to these isles.
What recent assessments has the Secretary of State made of how that will impact international recruitment and capacity in our already struggling health and care services?

We are seeing real success in social care—the recent Skills for Care workforce report showed that we have 20,000 more care workers in England.
We are doing well on recruitment to social care.
What recent assessment he has made of the effectiveness of emergency department opt-out testing for HIV.
Provisional NHS data shows that opt-out testing has found around 700 cases of HIV during its first year.
In total, it has found more than 2,000 cases of blood-borne diseases, including hepatitis B and C.
