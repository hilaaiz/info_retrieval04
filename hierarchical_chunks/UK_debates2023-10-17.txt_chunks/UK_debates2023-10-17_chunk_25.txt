I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, which is better directed at the BMA.
However, she is right to suggest that we are taking action on minimum service level legislation.
We recognise that industrial action means that services are under increased pressure, with appointments and treatments being cancelled because of the strikes.
The NHS is taking action, prioritising urgent and cancer care, and will of course continue to do so.
It will do its best to maintain appointments and elective procedures, wherever possible, but she is right to say that these strikes and the actions of the BMA are having a devastating impact on patients.
