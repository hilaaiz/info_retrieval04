I thank my hon.
Friend for his answer.
It is not sustainable for the people of West Dorset who have needed dental care for some time when there is a £400 million national underspend in the dental care budget.
The NHS and local dentists tell me that the incompatibility often relates to the national dental care contract, which is up for review.
When does the Minister expect a solution to be found to this contract difficulty?
Will he meet me and the NHS Dorset ICB to discuss the matter in detail to find a solution?
