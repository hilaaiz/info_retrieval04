I thank the Minister for his answer to the question from  the hon.
Member for Darlington (Peter Gibson) .
It is clear that today, HIV is not the death sentence that it once was, because of the progress of medication and healthcare in prolonging life and improving quality of life.
In Northern Ireland we are proactive, as the Minister will know, on PrEP and young people.
We are doing progressive things through the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern Ireland Assembly.
Has the Minister had the opportunity to discuss with the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Health Department how we can work better together?
I always say we are better together in every case.
