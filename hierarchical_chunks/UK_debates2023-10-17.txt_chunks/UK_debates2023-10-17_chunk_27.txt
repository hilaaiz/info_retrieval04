I thank the Secretary of State for his statement, particularly what he said about tech.
On dental provision, I recently met with Dr Khan of Westbury Park dental practice in my constituency to discuss access to NHS dentistry, which is becoming more difficult for many of my constituents.
I welcome the plans we have to increase the number of dentists and I reiterate my support for a dental school at Keele University, but those plans will take time.
In the short term, there is a huge backlog of overseas clinicians waiting to take the registration exam so that they can practise here.
What steps is the Secretary of State taking to expedite this?
