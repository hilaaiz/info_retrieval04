I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend for all his work on this important issue.
We will assess all the evidence and reply before the end of the year.
Opt-out testing is not the only thing we are doing to drive down HIV transmission.
We have had a 40% rise in the number of people getting pre-exposure prophylaxis, and we have increased the number of people testing, with 20,000 free testing kits handed out this year.
We are doing everything we can to meet that visionary goal to stop HIV transmission in this country.
