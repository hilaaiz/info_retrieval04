I thank my hon.
Friend for his supplementary question.
While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the consultation, which closes on  18 December , I can assure him that there will be no sudden changes in the way patients receive their care.
Any move will of course be carefully planned with the full involvement of current teams, and clear information will be provided for parents and families.
NHS England will help as many experienced staff as possible to move to the future centre, and I can reassure my hon.
Friend that that centre will build on all the strengths of the existing service and provide the best quality of care for patients.
