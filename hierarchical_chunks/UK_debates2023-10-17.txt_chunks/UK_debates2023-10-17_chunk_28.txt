He is right that we are taking both long-term and short-term actions.
A key part of the long-term workforce plan is to boost the number of dentists being trained.
In the more immediate term, earlier this year we made legislative changes that give the General Dental Council the flexibility to improve the way professionals are registered, giving more flexibility in terms of the skills mix and, for example, tripling the number of people sitting part 1 this year, so that more overseas professionals can be recognised and qualified to practise in the UK.
