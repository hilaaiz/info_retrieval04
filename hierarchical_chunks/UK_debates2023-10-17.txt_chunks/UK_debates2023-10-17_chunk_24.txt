The Minister has again been referring to “pre-pandemic levels”.
Ministers have a tendency to blame covid for increased waiting times, including in respect of cancer.
I presume they are aware that the number of cancer patients not getting care on time rose in every year since the Conservatives came to power before the pandemic.
How can the Government defend that dreadful record?
We are continuing to support NHS England in increasing cancer treatment capacity.
As I say, I recognise the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
NHS England has instructed integrated care boards to increase and prioritise the diagnostic and treatment capacity for cancer.
As of the middle of this year, we have 93 additional surgical hubs that are currently operational and 123 additional community diagnostic centres, which have delivered more than 5 million additional tests since July 2021, but we know and recognise that we need to do more.
Members will know from my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests that I am an NHS consultant and a member of the British Medical Association.
I congratulate the Minister on the work he is doing to reduce waiting lists, but BMA strikes have led to the loss of more than 1 million appointments,  have delayed the reporting of scans, including scans for cancer, and have disrupted people’s chronic long-term condition treatment.
What is he doing to ensure that there are no further strikes?
What talks is he having on minimum service levels to expand the provision if further strikes do take place?
