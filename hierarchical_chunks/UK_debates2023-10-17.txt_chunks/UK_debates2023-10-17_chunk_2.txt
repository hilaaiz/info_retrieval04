The actual allocations to schools happen in December each year in the normal way, so this situation will not affect the figures that local authorities have informed schools they will be receiving.
Those are based on the October census of pupil numbers and the application of the local formula.
We then fund the local authorities on the basis of the national funding.
The record funding of £59.6 billion equates to an average of £5,300 per primary school pupil and £6,830 per secondary school pupil.
My hon.
Friend raises an important point, and I know she has secured a debate in the House this week to further explore these issues.
She will be aware that there has been a 13% increase in the number of midwifery programme place starters since two years ago.
That is alongside the £165 million added to the maternity budget since 2021 and the key increase in midwifery places in the long-term workforce plan.
