Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Ross K. Baker on his retirement from Rutgers University.
Professor Baker dedicated over 50 years to Rutgers University and his many achievements and contributions should be celebrated.
A Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Rutgers University School of Arts and Sciences, Professor Baker was honored in 2021 with the Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching, which recognizes faculty members whose contributions have been significantly impactful.
I had the distinct pleasure of speaking with Professor Baker's classes numerous times and it was evident that his students valued and internalized his teachings.
Specializing in American Government and U.S. Legislative Politics, Professor Baker brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the classroom.
Throughout his tenure, he also served as a Visiting Professor at Haverford College and the University of Leipzig (Germany), as well as a Fulbright Lecturer at the Swedish Institute of International Relations in Stockholm.
In addition to his academic background, Professor Baker worked for the offices of 
Senator Walter Mondale, Birch Bayh, Franch Church, Chuck Hagel, Patrick Leahy, and Harry Reid.
He also served as a consultant to the Democratic Caucus of the U.S. House.
Likewise, he has published many books and articles and has contributed to USA Today and several NPR programs.
Immediately prior to joining Rutgers in 1968, Professor Baker was a research associate at the Brookings Institute.
He had also worked at the Special Operations Research Office and was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D.
