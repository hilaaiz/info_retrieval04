Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Paul Laurence Dunbar Commemorative Coin Act, which would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue coins in honor.
This bill would recognize one of the first influential African American poets in American literature and benefit the Dunbar Alumni Federation, the alumni association for the Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School in the District of Columbia, which is historic for being the first public high school for African Americans in the United States.
I am a proud graduate of Dunbar, a storied African American high school in our country.
Paul Laurence Dunbar was born on June 27, 1872, to formerly enslaved parents, and went on to pen such classics as Majors and Minors and Lyrics.
He also composed the lyrics to In Dahomey, the first all-African American musical produced on Broadway.
By the late 1890s, Dunbar had become a prominent author, having had his poems published in major national newspapers, including The New York Times.
Dunbar died on February 9, 1906, at age 33.
Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School was established in 1870 as the Preparatory High School for Colored Youth.
It was the first college preparatory high school for African American children in the United States.
The school was renamed for Dunbar in 1916.
The Dunbar Alumni Federation was organized in 2002 to provide scholarships and other financial support to students and graduates of Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School.
The Federation has alumni from more than 35 graduating classes, and supports the school through its scholarship efforts, community activities and other endeavors.
This bill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint 50,000 five-dollar coins, 400,000 one-dollar coins and 750,000 halfdollar coins, with a surcharge on each coin.
The surcharges would benefit the scholarships and similar activities of the Dunbar Alumni Federation.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
