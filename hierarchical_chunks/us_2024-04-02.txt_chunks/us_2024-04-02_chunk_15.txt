Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to commemorate the life of my dear friend, Michael J. Cioffi, who passed away on March 23, 2024 after a courageous battle with cancer and other 9/11-related illnesses.
A resident of Ocean Township, Michael was born and raised in Long Branch and served his hometown's fire department for 14 years before serving with the New York City Fire Department (FDNY).
Although offduty on September 11, 2001, the day of the attack, Michael didn't hesitate to rush into New York City to assist his fellow firefighters and emergency personnel and spent the next several months meticulously working through rubble at the site.
Despite the illnesses he endured as a result of his work at the World Trade Center site, Michael continued to serve with the FDNY until 2020.
Michael was tough and determined, and his duty to serve was profound.
Michael demonstrated character and leadership throughout his life and was deeply committed to each endeavor he undertook.
Michael is survived by his loving family, including his wife Sylvia and six children, Michael Luciano, Sofia, Maryella, Christopher, Jack, and Emma.
His dedication to his family was evident and I am blessed to have had such a wonderful friend in Michael.
Michael should be remembered for his decades of service to Long Branch and New York City as a firefighter, most notably his selfless actions following the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center, which contributed to his health battles.
I know I join with his family, friends, and fellow firefighters in paying tribute to his memory and the ultimate sacrifice he paid in service to our community.
