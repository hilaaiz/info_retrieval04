Safety Grades, four-time Magnet hospital designation, and its first 5Star award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In 2020, 
Ms. Locker championed the greatest governance reorganization in the organization's history while simultaneously guiding the health system through the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The revised governance model reshaped the 41-member representative body into a streamlined Board of 15 Trustees and resulted in the elimination of redundancies, an increase in efficiency, and a greater alignment with Hunterdon Health's mission and strategic direction.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to 
Ms. Locker for her many contributions to residents in the 7th District and across the state of New Jersey.
Ms. Locker is an example of one of the many innovative leaders which makes the 7th District strong, and I congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement.
