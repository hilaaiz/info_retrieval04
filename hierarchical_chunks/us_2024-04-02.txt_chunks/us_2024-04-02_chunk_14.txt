Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in thanking one of the smartest, most dedicated people I know: Amy Markowich.
Although she is stepping back as Executive Director, I know that her commitment to serving her fellow Americans will never waver.
For that, she has the gratitude of her Congress and her country.
I wish Amy and her husband Brian well as they embark on the next chapter of their lives.
