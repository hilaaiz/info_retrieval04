Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the distinguished career for the International President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).
During her more than 20 years of union leadership, Monica has made a lasting impact throughout her career on behalf of working people and the Labor Movement.
Additionally, Monica helped found the Latino Labor Lobbyists group, the IAM's Spanish Leadership Program, and served as Co-Chair of the Women of Labor organization, in which capacity I had the great fortune of working alongside her.
Monica started her career with IAM in 1986 as a Customer Service Agent at Northwest Airlines in Los Angeles, where she was initiated into IAM Local 2785.
She quickly rose as a leader in organizing with her Labor brothers and sisters, and in 1999 became the IAM Transportation Department's Education Representative.
In this role, she initiated and won several organizing campaigns representing airline and railroad workers.
She then joined as IAM Assistant Political and Legislative Director before becoming the Chief of Staff to the International President.
Monica has dedicated decades of her work to expanding the reach and inclusion of the Labor Movement.
Fluent in Spanish, Monica was among the founding members of the IAM's Spanish Leadership Working Group, and was crucial in developing materials and resources for IAM in Spanish.
As Co-Chair of the Women of Labor organization, she helped lift and encourage women in the Labor Movement.
Finally, she was a member of the Executive Committee of IndustriALL Global Union, representing over 50 million workers in 140 countries.
Throughout it all, Monica has been an unwavering voice for working families.
It has been my great pleasure to work closely with her on many projects and priorities over the years, and I know I speak for many when I say that she has been a tremendous asset to the Labor Movement.
