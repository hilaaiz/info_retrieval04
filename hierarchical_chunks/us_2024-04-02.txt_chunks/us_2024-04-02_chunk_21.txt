Mr. GREEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the valiant service of Technical Sergeant Earl Westbrooks to his country and the United States Army.
Sergeant Westbrooks answered the call of duty at the Perry County Courthouse in 1944 at the young age of seventeen.
He completed basic training at Fort McClellan, Alabama, whereupon he served as a noncommissioned officer in World War II and the early days of the Korean War.
Prior to leaving Korea in 1948, Sergeant Westbrooks trained members of the South Korean Army in Chan-ju, which later proved instrumental to the defense from the brutal communist invasion in 1950.
Upon completing his service overseas, Sergeant Westbrooks returned to finish his schooling, which had been cut short by the war, and on the same day his son graduated from Perry County High School, Sergeant Westbrooks earned his GED.
Ever the servant leader, he is deeply involved in his community and an active member of Faith Baptist Church in Linden, Tennessee.
He is also an excellent guitarist and a former player in Minnie Pearl's Grinder's Switch Skillet Lickers, which performed in Odessa, Texas.
A proud veteran, Sergeant Westbrooks is an active VFW member, and he regularly represents WWII veterans at events across West and Middle Tennessee.
While he traded in his military fatigues for civvies, he never stopped serving his country, and you can still find him in Perry County, Tennessee, wearing his World War II and Korea Veterans hats with pride.
Sergeant Westbrooks and the love of his life, 
Mrs. Aline Hinson Westbrooks, celebrated 74 years of marriage earlier this year.
Together, they have three children: Deborah Hardin, Kerry Westbrooks, and Lisa Stayrook.
Technical Sergeant Earl Westbrooks has lived an admirable life marked by service, both to his community and his country.
On behalf of the House of Representatives and as a fellow veteran, I commend him for his service to our district, the state of Tennessee, and the United States
