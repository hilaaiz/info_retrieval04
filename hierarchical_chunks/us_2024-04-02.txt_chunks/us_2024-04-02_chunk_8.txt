Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Springfield native Brad Booker on the incredible achievement of winning an Oscar for his short film ``War is Over''.
This incredible achievement is even more impressive given that Brad was a first time Academy Award nominee.
Booker started his journey towards this incredible achievement in Springfield where he attended Glenwood High School and later Lincoln Land Community College.
Prior to his work on this short film, he worked as an animator at Warner Brothers Studios on films such as Iron Giant, Stuart Little, Spider Man, and Lord of the Rings.
I am honored to congratulate Brad, who still lives with his family in Chatham, on this incredible achievement.
His dedication serves as inspiration to me and all of those who call the Springfield region home.
Congratulations to him, his family, and his colleagues on this remarkable achievement.
I am looking forward to his next project.
