I thank my hon.
Friend for that question because, as the Prime Minister says, we are the party of the builders.
As my hon.
Friend says, the Labour party was created to serve the simple principle that working-class people could run the country.
The Department for Education is working closely with colleges and with us in the Department for Work and Pensions to create construction foundation apprenticeships from this August, which will give many more young people the tools they need for a career in the trades.
That is in addition to DWP support for employers, which we have recently expanded specifically with those trades he mentions in mind.
