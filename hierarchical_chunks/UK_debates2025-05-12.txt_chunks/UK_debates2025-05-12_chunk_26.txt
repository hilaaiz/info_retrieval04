I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I am shocked and saddened to hear about the serious assault against a prison officer that took place on  Thursday 8
May  at HMP Belmarsh.
My thoughts are with the family and colleagues of the brave, hard-working prison officer at this time.
We will not tolerate any violence against prison officers.
Prisoners who are violent towards staff will face the full consequences of their actions.
