The Secretary of State will be aware of our concerns around the changes and the damages they could do to the most vulnerable.
She will also be aware of the implications for the Scottish Government who administer this.
Will she at least give me the assurance that the full details about how the changes will interact with devolved powers will come before a vote is brought to this Chamber?
My right hon.
Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disability is working closely with all the devolved Administrations to ensure that the changes work in every part of the country.
I also say to Opposition Members that we want to ensure that disabled people in Scotland have the same rights, chances and choices to get into work, stay in work and get on in their work, so I hope the hon.
Member will be keen to work with us on those issues, too.
