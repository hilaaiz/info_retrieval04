My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
It is more than a decade since PIP was introduced, and there have been changes in the prevalence of disability, in the nature of long-term conditions, in wider society and in the workplace too.
We have also seen a real increase in recent years in the numbers of younger people and those with mental health conditions, so it is right that we now have a review of the PIP assessment process.
This is a highly sensitive issue, and it will take time, but my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disability and I will be doing this in consultation with disabled people and the organisations that represent them, and we will begin inviting them in from this week.
I also very much hope that all Members of Parliament can feed into this process, including with the organisations in their own constituencies.
