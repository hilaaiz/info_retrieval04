Last week, the Justice Committee visited Wandsworth prison and noted improvements, but from a very low base.
We heard that the poor reputation of some prisons, including rising violence, makes recruitment more difficult.
That is the legacy of 14 years of starving prisons of resources.
What are the current Government doing to improve the recruitment and retention of prison officers?
My hon.
Friend is completely correct: we inherited a prison system in crisis, where prisons were on the edge of collapse.
Reducing violence in prisons is a key priority.
That is why we have taken the actions we have in building new prisons and in the sentencing review: to ensure that we always have prison spaces to lock dangerous people up.
