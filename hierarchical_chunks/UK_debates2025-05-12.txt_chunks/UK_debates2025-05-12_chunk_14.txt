I thank the Minister for that response.
Thanks to the introduction of auto-enrolment, millions of young people are now saving for their retirement, but I have heard worrying reports in Mid Bedfordshire that increases in employers’ national insurance, which have resulted in pay freezes, are now causing people to decide to opt out of pension savings.
Does the Minister recognise that risk to pensions adequacy?
If so, what is he doing to address it?
