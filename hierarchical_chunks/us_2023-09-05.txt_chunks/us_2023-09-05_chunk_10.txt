Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Heroes, Addison Police Department Officers Daniel Gutierrez, and Mark Meraz.
On June 15, 2023, Addison Police Department Officers Daniel Gutierrez and Mark Meraz responded to a call regarding an injured person.
When they arrived on scene, they found a man bleeding excessively from his arm after getting cut with glass.
Officers Gutierrez and Meraz quickly placed a tourniquet on his arm while they waited for paramedics to arrive.
The wounds were severe, and the man lost an extensive amount of blood due to his injuries.
The tourniquet application by Officers Gutierrez and Meraz saved his life while waiting for paramedics to arrive on scene.
The Addison Police Department recently honored them both with the Preservation.
I thank Officer Gutierrez and Officer Meraz for going above and beyond to protect and serve North Texans.
