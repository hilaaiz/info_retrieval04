Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Grapevine Police Officer Patrick O'Neal.
In 2017, Officer O'Neal stalled working on a project to help law enforcement find any area or room on a school campus in an emergency, within seconds.
After realizing this could be lifesaving for officers who are responding to an emergency at a school campus they may not be familiar with, Officer O'Neal embarked on his mission of numbering every door and hallway in Grapevine ISD, then creating digital maps of the floor plans to share across departments.
It took years to gather the information for all the schools in the district.
The maps include detailed information about all doors, their accessibility to police, the most efficient points of entry and directions to specific classrooms, and even indicate which doors require keys to open.
As a result of Officer O'Neal's work, Grapevine Police now have detailed maps of each campus in Grapevine ISD which the police department can access via a digital system on their phone.
Earlier this year, Officer O'Neal was honored with the 2023 State of Texas Law Enforcement Achievement Award for Public Services at the State Capitol.
I'd like to thank Officer O'Neal for his tireless efforts and profound dedication to keeping North Texas students and staff safe.
