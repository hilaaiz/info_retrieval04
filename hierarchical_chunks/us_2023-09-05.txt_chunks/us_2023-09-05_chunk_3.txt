Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brenda and David Hughes, creators of the ``Stay in the Light'' Christmas light exhibit.
Their award-winning ``Stay in the Light'' spectacle was started in memory of their son, Nathaniel, who struggled with depression.
Nathaniel passed away in April of 2019, and the festivities that the Hughes' host are in honor of his memory.
The Hughes family accepts donations of blankets and socks that are donated to Meals on Wheels Senior Services of Rockwall County for the elderly.
Food items and toys are also accepted for donation.
Brenda and David commit over 100 hours and hang 60,000 lights to honor Nathaniel and give back to those in need within their community.
I thank Brenda and David Hughes for bringing extra light to our North Texas community.
