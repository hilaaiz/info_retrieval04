Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eddy Ketchersid, who retired earlier this year as a Senior Minister at the Branch Church in Farmers Branch.
Eddy has been a positive impact on the city of Farmers Branch and the North Texas community at large for 60+ years.
Eddy is an alumnus of Abilene Christian University and a true Texan at heart.
He has served his community in various respects throughout his life.
Eddy has served the city of Farmers Branch as a Community Minister, advocate and member of the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary International, and head of the Metrocrest Mayor's Prayer Breakfast.
He has led many bible studies and prayer groups for the ministry for over half a century.
I thank Eddy for going above and beyond for our community.
His selflessness and dedication do not go unnoticed.
