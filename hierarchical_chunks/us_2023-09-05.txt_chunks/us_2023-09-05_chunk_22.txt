standard of living in historically underserved urban communities.
Founded in 1975 as an affiliate of the National Urban League, the Urban League of Broward County is a community-based organization dedicated to empowering communities and changing lives.
The League helps our underserved communities achieve their highest true social parity, economic self-reliance, power, and civil rights.
The organization promotes economic empowerment through education and job training, housing and community development, workforce development, entrepreneurship, health, and quality of life.
The League helps our community achieve these goals through a variety of programming--from their Summer Enrichment Program, which offers students the opportunity to create, discover, and learn, to ADVANCE-U, which offers a full range of essential economic resources for residents to help them succeed in the workforce, stabilize their finances and build assets.
The Urban League of Broward County's commitment to the health and wellness of Broward's families is extensive, impressive, and inspiring.
I am grateful to the leadership and staff for their tireless efforts to fight for the rights of my constituents and all Americans to live with freedom, dignity, and prosperity.
I thank President and CEO, Dr. Germaine Smith-Baugh, and everyone at the Urban League of Broward County for improving the lives of those in Florida's 25th Congressional District.
