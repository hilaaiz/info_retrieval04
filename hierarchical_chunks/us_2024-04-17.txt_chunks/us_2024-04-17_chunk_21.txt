Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the significance and importance of Education and Sharing Day, a commemoration in honor of The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, and the values of education and moral cultivation for which he stood.
The Rebbe emphasized the significance of moral and ethical education as the foundation of humanity and an essential characteristic of a thriving society.
Throughout his lifetime, his work cultivated hope for a brighter future through the establishment of more than 6,000 educational and social institutions across all 50 states and in 100 countries spanning six continents.
Over the last four decades, the U.S. Congress has set aside ``Education and Sharing Day,'' and the recognition is proclaimed annually by presiding U.S. presidents on the anniversary of the Rebbe's birth, in honor of his commitment to teaching the next generation of Americans the values that make our country strong.
Remembering the Rebbe's message of education and contribution to society, Education and Sharing Day provides the opportunity to recognize our responsibility in ensuring that our Nation's youth have the tools to live a life of purpose and fulfillment.
