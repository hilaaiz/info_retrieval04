Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the excellence of Grand River Preparatory, a High School of Michigan's Third Congressional District.
I commend the faculty at this high school for their dedication, perseverance, and performance.
They were recently awarded with the 2023 AP Honor Roll Platinum Award and the 2023 AP Access Award for their ability to go above and beyond in making college preparatory resources accessible to students.
These awards are given to schools in which the percentage of underrepresented and low-income students involved with the school's AP Program is the same or greater than the percentage of underrepresented students in the school's graduating class.
In 2023, over 4,000 schools participated in the consideration of this award.
On behalf of myself and our West Michigan community, I applaud Grand River Preparatory for becoming the only high school in Michigan to achieve this major accomplishment.
The Grand River Preparatory High School has been a constant example of excellence by outperforming peers in surrounding schools by 3.5 months each year, according to research done by Stanford University.
The school's teachers, students and employees have worked tirelessly to assure that all students can pursue their dreams in an equitable way.
