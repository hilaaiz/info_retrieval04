Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the commitment of my constituent Verla Thomas in getting her father, the late Corporal George Wills of Spring Lake, a Purple Heart medal over 100 years after he was shot and wounded in World War I. I also commend Dr. Chris Petras for his continued research and efforts to help West Michiganders secure such medals from the Army.
Dr. Chris Petras has dedicated much of his time to researching Company F Grand Haven WWI soldiers.
His work has led to 20 Purple Hearts being awarded to veterans, a feat that deserves recognition and applause.
As a member of the Sons of the American Legion Squadron 28 Grand Haven, Dr. Petras got his start in 2019 when he sought out to learn more about a significant figure in the post, Charles A. Conklin.
After digging through National Archives documents, military documents, and numerous publications, he sent over the information he found for review to the U.S. Army who then affirmed Conklin's eligibility for the Purple Heart.
Dr. Chris Petras' determination in ensuring these soldiers are recognized for their sacrifice and service is truly admirable.
I had the great honor of working alongside Dr. Petras to help Verla Thomas acquire the posthumous Purple Heart medal and WWI Victory medal for her father's service.
Several members of the military, veterans, and local residents attended the award ceremony in honor of her father's legacy.
It was a truly touching moment to present Verla with these awards.
She serves as an inspiration for my team and our district as we seek to give others the recognition they deserve.
