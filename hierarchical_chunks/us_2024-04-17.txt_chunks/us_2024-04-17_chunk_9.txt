Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the Tennyson Center for Children in Denver, Colorado.
Established in 1904, Tennyson Center for Children has been committed to serving Colorado's most neglected and abused children.
Their high-quality programs have changed lives and led to successful outcomes for many of those who use their services.
Supporting at-risk youth and keeping families together helps to secure bright futures for children and puts them on a path to success, and Tennyson has worked to support families across Colorado.
Ninety-one percent of the children who rely on Tennyson services have experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse.
To address the complex needs of this population, Tennyson offers a breadth of services, including child and family therapy, parenting support, behavior management, education support, and childcare.
Thanks to these services, 98 percent of families who sought assistance at Tennyson stayed together.
In 2023, I worked with Tennyson to secure federal funding to assist in the construction of the mental health residential treatment center.
This center focuses on the urgent and unmet mental health needs of vulnerable, low-income children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The new center will help Tennyson better serve vulnerable youth in our communities by increasing access to essential mental health treatment.
I look forward to our continued partnership to ensure Tennyson can continue to provide life-changing care to those most at risk of abuse and trauma.
One hundred and twenty-nine years of service to Colorado is a tremendous accomplishment, and I congratulate the entire staff at Tennyson on achieving this milestone.
Tennyson Center for Children is a fixture of our community, and I am honored to recognize its 120th anniversary.
