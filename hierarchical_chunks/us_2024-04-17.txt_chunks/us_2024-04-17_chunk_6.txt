Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Karl Kreiser on his retirement after serving as a coach to Columbia High School Basketball for 28 years.
Karl served a total of seventeen years as the Girls Varsity Head Coach, while also coaching the varsity boys' team for four years and acting as the skipper for the boys' junior high team for an additional seven years.
Karl followed in the footsteps of his father, Elmer Kreiser, the Columbia Boys Basketball Coaching legend who established the program's legacy across the Commonwealth.
Respected on and off the court, Karl's coaching was defined by his mentorship.
The focal point of his leadership was ensuring his players knew the importance of giving back to the people in the community.
The legacy of Coach Karl Kreiser is displayed all around the Crimson Tide gymnasium in the form of banners and trophies adorning the walls.
Over his nearly three decades of coaching, Karl won 431 games.
In his last four seasons with the Girls Varsity Team, Columbia won three section crowns, a league title, while making it to four district championships, and three state playoffs.
