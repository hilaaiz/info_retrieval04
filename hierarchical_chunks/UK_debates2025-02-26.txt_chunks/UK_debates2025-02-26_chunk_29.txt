I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that really important issue.
Yesterday, we introduced our Crime and Policing Bill, which is central to our plan for change and to halving knife crime.
It involves new powers to seize and destroy knives found on private property and a new criminal offence of possessing a bladed article with the intent to cause harm, plus tougher penalties for selling dangerous weapons to under-18s and stricter rules for online sales under Ronan’s law.
We will continue that work.
