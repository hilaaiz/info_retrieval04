I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important and obviously sensitive issue.
We are committed to making progress towards ending paramilitarism once and for all in Northern Ireland.
That is why we have agreed to support a short independent exercise to look at a formal process.
I will make sure that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland keeps her updated.
