On Monday night, there was a brutal double stabbing in my constituency, which adds to a long line of horrific knife attacks that have included three fatalities over the past two years.
I know that the Prime Minister is aware of the particular challenges we face in Bournemouth.
Although crime has been going down, I know there is much more that he will want to do.
Will he join me in praising the crucial work done by organisations such as Changes Are Made, which provide positive activities such as boxing to young people, and will he share what more the Government can do to tackle knife crime in communities such as mine?
