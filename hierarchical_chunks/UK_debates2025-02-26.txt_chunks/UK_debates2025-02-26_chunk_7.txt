The Government’s decision to repeal the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 will mean reopening many inquests and civil cases.
Many of those cases will impact on the police.
Does the Secretary of State accept that that will mean a significant cost to the Police Service of Northern Ireland?
As the hon.
Gentleman is aware, the legacy legislation that the previous Government passed has been found to be flawed and unlawful in a number of respects, and it falls to this Government to clean up the mess that the last Government left.
I am in the process of consultation with many parties.
I have already indicated to the House the proposals that I put forward in the remedial order, and have said that I propose bringing legislation before the House when parliamentary time allows.
It is important that people are able to  pursue civil cases, and the ban on them by the last Government has been found to be unlawful.
Why should people in Northern Ireland not be entitled to an inquest?
My question was about the liability that the Police Service of Northern Ireland might be under following the Secretary of State’s decision.
Police numbers in Northern Ireland are at their lowest ever.
Two weeks ago, Policy Exchange estimated that the cost to the PSNI of the repeal of the legacy Act might well stretch to hundreds of millions of pounds.
If that is the case, will the Government step in to support the PSNI, or are they content to see a reduction in frontline policing and national security?
The Government have provided additional funding to the PSNI in the autumn statement through the additional security fund.
I have read the Policy Exchange report, and it contains a lot of speculation about numbers.
The fact remains that the legislation supported by the Government, of which the hon.
Gentleman was part, has not worked; it was flawed and found to be unlawful.
I am afraid that the Opposition will have to recognise that at some point, and it needs to be fixed.
