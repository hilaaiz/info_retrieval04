I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the way in which he articulated that point.
I am still dismayed to this day by archaic attitudes towards people in social tenancy.
I was a social tenant for a very long time and grew up in a council house.
The issue is the way that these people were treated, especially after this report.
I ask anyone who works in social housing to read the report—or at least the executive findings, if they do not  want to go through the chapters that I went through.
Sir Martin outlines the horrifying way that people were treated.
That is a shame for our country, and we must do better.
Hopefully, the legislation we are bringing forward will bring about a cultural change.
