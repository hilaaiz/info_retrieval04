In my constituency, the planning inspector chose to use the term grey belt to pass a battery energy storage system application before the order was laid in the House to change the national planning policy framework and without recognising the moratorium for local authorities to manage their local plans.
The decision failed to recognise the green belt that protects us against urban sprawl, and it failed to recognise the proximity to a school, a church and a graveyard.
Can the Prime Minister define what grey belt actually is, or is it simply a grey area to allow for inappropriate development?
I am not across the details of the right hon.
Member’s case, as she will understand, but I am in favour of making sure that we can have the infrastructure and the houses we need to grow our economy.
One of the problems we had over the past 14 years was an assertion or rhetoric that we wanted homes and infrastructure, but when the decision for all that came up, the answer was always no.
The answer cannot always be no.
