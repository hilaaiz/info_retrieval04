I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue.
The UK and Canada are close allies and have been for a long time, with a partnership based on a shared history and a shared set of values and a determination to be an active force for good in the world.
We work closely with Canada on issues of the Commonwealth, on NATO and, of course, Five Eyes intelligence sharing.
We will work to strengthen that relationship.
