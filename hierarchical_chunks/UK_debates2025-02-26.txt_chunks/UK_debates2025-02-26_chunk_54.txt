I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for her statement today and the Prime Minister for his statement on  4 September , which made it clear that the lessons from Grenfell are central to this Government’s missions.
Today is another painful step towards truth, justice and change for the bereaved families of the 72 people who lost their lives at Grenfell, the survivors and the community in my constituency of Kensington and Bayswater, many of whom have joined us today.
I pay tribute again to their strength and resilience.
