I thank my hon.
Friend for being such a great champion for Scotland and his constituency.
Grangemouth is really important to communities in Scotland and to the economy in Scotland.
It is not a charity case; it has incredible potential and huge opportunity.
That is why, at the weekend, I was pleased to announce £200 million from the National Wealth Fund to incentivise private investment.
That follows the £100 million in the growth deal that we announced earlier.
This is about securing jobs for decades to come in Grangemouth.
It is a really exciting opportunity and we intend to seize it.
