I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this issue, and I thank him for using his authority and reputation to support this vital cause, which will make a material difference.
I look forward to working with him on it.
We share a commitment to detecting prostate cancer earlier and treating it faster.
We must do that.
Our national cancer plan will improve the way we treat cancer right across the country.
I will make sure he is fully informed of the steps we are taking and will work with him.
