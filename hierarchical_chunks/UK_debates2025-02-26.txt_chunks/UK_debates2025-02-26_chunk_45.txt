May I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for advance sight of her statement and the Government’s response to the phase 2 report?
I echo the Deputy Prime Minister’s sentiments, which are shared across the House.
The tragedy of Grenfell, which claimed 72 innocent lives—54 adults and 18 children—will always remain a scar on our national conscience.
I thank Sir Martin Moore-Bick and his team for their work.
I join the Deputy Prime Minister in offering my deepest apologies to the bereaved, the survivors and the Grenfell community for the failures that led to that horrific night in June 2017—we all remember where we were that night.
I also thank them for their constant and constructive campaigning.
The inquiry’s findings—decades of systemic failure, dishonesty and negligence—are a damning indictment of successive Governments, regulators and industry.
The Government’s response, with its acceptance of all 58 recommendations, is a step forward, and I welcome the commitment to action.
The creation of a single construction regulator, the appointment of a chief construction adviser and the consolidation of fire safety functions under one Department are long overdue reforms.
So too is the focus on professionalising fire engineers and reforming the construction products sector, which the inquiry exposed as riddled with systemic dishonesty from firms such as Arconic, Kingspan and Celotex.
The Green Paper on construction products reform is a promising start, but it must deliver real accountability.
Unlimited fines and prison sentences for rogue executives and, where appropriate, Government officials, cannot remain mere rhetoric.
Ambition must be matched by urgency and scrutiny.
Nearly eight years have passed since Grenfell, yet thousands still live in buildings with unsafe cladding and other fire safety defects.
Although I welcome the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister has accepted the majority of the recommendations, why has she not accepted the inquiry’s recommendation for a single regulator to oversee the testing and certification of construction products, leaving that instead with conformity assessment bodies?
I remind her that the Building Research Establishment, which is itself a conformity assessment body, was strongly criticised for its conflicts of interest.
The remediation acceleration plan is welcome, but its targets of assessing all buildings by July 2025 and completing works by 2027 relies heavily on developers stepping up voluntarily.
What actions will the Deputy Prime Minister take if they do not comply?
Will she work to deliver solutions for non-qualifying leaseholders and those at risk as a consequence of other fire safety defects?
This House needs concrete assurances that no resident will be left behind.
I question the phased approach to implementation stretching beyond 2028.
Justice delayed is justice denied.
The Grenfell community has waited long enough for change.
Why must they potentially wait another parliamentary term for full delivery?
What discussions has the Leader of the House had with parliamentary colleagues on the establishment of a public inquiries Joint Committee to monitor the implementation of public inquiry recommendations?
What is the timetable for the new publicly available record on all public inquiry recommendations since 2024?
On social housing, the extension of Awaab’s law and new standards are positive, but the Government must go further to address the inquiry’s wider lesson.
Residents’ voices were ignored.
Tenant empowerment must be more than a panel or a campaign; it needs legal teeth to ensure landlords act on concerns swiftly.
Justice demands accountability.
The Metropolitan police investigation has our full support, but the pace must quicken.
Those who profited from cutting comers or were criminally negligent must face consequences—not just fines but criminal charges where evidence allows.
Grenfell must be a watershed—a legacy of safety, transparency and respect for every resident.
I make our clear commitment to work with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government, on a cross-party basis, to meet that promise.
