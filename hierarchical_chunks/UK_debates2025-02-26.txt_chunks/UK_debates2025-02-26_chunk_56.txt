I thank and pay tribute to my hon.
Friend for the way he has constructively challenged and worked with us on behalf of his constituents.
I know this report has great personal significance for his constituents, and I pay tribute to his dedicated work as an advocate in calling for truth, justice and change for the Grenfell community.
