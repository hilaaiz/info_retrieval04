I absolutely agree with my hon.
Friend.
At the heart of the new regulatory regime is the requirement that all landlords treat their tenants with fairness and respect, and take action so that the services they provide have fair and equitable outcomes.
Social landlords are required to understand and provide information and support that recognise the diverse needs of their tenants, including those arising from protected characteristics.
That has not been so in the past, and, if I am honest, it does not feel like it is the case today when I speak to residents of the community.
That is why I have pushed the council in that particular area and why this Government are bringing forward legislation that says we respect people.
Whether they are social tenants or private tenants, they deserve a safe and secure home and to be treated with dignity and respect.
