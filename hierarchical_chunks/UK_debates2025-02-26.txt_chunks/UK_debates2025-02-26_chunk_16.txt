I thank the Leader of the Opposition for her words about the forthcoming trip.
It is right, and I think the whole House will think it is right, that Ukraine must be at the table at negotiations.
There can be no negotiations about Ukraine without Ukraine.
That has been my consistent position in all of the  discussions that I have had.
That will continue to be my position, because this is about the sovereignty of Ukraine and the Ukrainians’ ability to decide for themselves the future of their country, so they must be at the table.
