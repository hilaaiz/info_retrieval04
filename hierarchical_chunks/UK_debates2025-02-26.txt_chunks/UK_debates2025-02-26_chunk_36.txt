I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this really important case.
As he says, I met the mother and the family just a few days ago.
It is an incredibly difficult situation for them.
I can assure him that I will do everything I can to ensure the release in  this case.
That includes phone calls as necessary.
I have raised it before and I will raise it again.
We raise it and will continue to do so.
I gave my word to the family that that is what I will do, and I will.
