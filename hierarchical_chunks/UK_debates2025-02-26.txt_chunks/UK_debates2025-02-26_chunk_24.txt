Prior to the election, the Labour party promised to reduce energy bills by £300, yet on its watch, energy bills are about to increase by almost £300.
Is the failure to keep that promise a consequence of Government incompetence, or has the Labour party been caught lying to the public?
We are very proud of the fact that we are pushing forward for energy independence, which will keep our bills lower.
The right hon.
Gentleman knows very well what my position is; however, I note again that he is very quiet on the SNP record, and I will tell hon.
Members why.
Just this week, we have seen the attainment gap widen in Scotland.
Numbers of pupils leaving schools with no qualifications rising; those from deprived areas going to work falling.
Instead of playing the politics of grievance, SNP Members need to take responsibility for their own record.
My constituent Mike Addison was one of a kind.
A physical disability rugby league world champion with England and Warrington Wolves and an avid volunteer for the club and foundation, he was a friend to everyone who knew him.
Tragically, he died at age 45, having taken his own life.
One death by suicide is too many, and every suicide is preventable.
However, Office for National Statistics data puts the rate in the north-west at more than double the rate in London, with a 17% increase last year.
Will the Prime Minister outline what more can be done, working across Government, to help Warrington meet our target of eliminating suicide?
