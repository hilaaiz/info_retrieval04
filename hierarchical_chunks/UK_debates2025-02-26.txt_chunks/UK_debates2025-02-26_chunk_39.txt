Prostate cancer is now our country’s most common cancer, yet there is no national screening programme.
We made progress towards that in government, but there is more to do, which is why I am delighted to have joined the charity Prostate Cancer Research as an ambassador.
I am grateful to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care for his engagement thus far.
Will the Prime Minister ensure that we have a targeted national screening programme for the groups most at risk of prostate cancer, so we can not only save the NHS money and make progress towards the Government’s early diagnosis targets, but, most crucially, save thousands of lives?
