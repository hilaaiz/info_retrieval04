I welcome the Secretary of State’s statement.
All our thoughts are with the victims and their families.
I know the Secretary of State will keep us up to date about the permanent memorial.
However, the big failure that she has not spoken about was the testing regime for the products that were put on Grenfell, and on buildings up and down the country.
Firms deliberately cheated the testing regime system, so products were signed off as safe.
Will she undertake to overhaul safety mechanisms and the  testing regime for products, so that buildings, both the ones we have already and those built in the future, will be safe for the residents who live in them?
