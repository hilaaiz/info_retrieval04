I thank the Secretary of State for her important statement.
The people of Grenfell were treated badly because of who they were, what they looked like and how much they earned.
We say that 72 people were killed in Grenfell, but the police are holding ashes for which they have no name.
Nobody should have to go through this; the families should never have to go through this.
This should never happen again.
Does she agree that, as well as the chief executive officers of the companies, all the people in the council who treated the residents badly and did not listen to them, because of what they looked like, must be held accountable?
Everybody needs to be held accountable.
