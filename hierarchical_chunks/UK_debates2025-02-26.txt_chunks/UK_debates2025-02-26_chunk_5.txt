The Secretary of State will be aware that it has been a year since the Executive was finally re-established.
In that time, they have still been unable to agree a programme for Government.
This morning, we learned that today’s meeting to agree it has been moved again.
Does he agree that, for the sake of the people of Northern Ireland, it is time they got on with it?
As I indicated a moment ago, I look forward to the Executive adopting a programme for Government.
I am aware of what happened earlier today; I am confident that another meeting will be arranged, and I look forward to seeing the programme adopted.
