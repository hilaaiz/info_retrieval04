I hope that the shadow Secretary of State recognises some of the work that we are already doing.
We have brought forward a significant amount of legislation on social tenancy, on empowering tenants through the Renters’ Rights Bill, on protecting leaseholders, and on our remediation acceleration plan.
The Government will deliver those legislative changes as soon as parliamentary time allows.
The legislation commitments are detailed in the plan.
That includes creating certainty on buildings that need remediation and on who is responsible for remediating them; making obligations for assessing and completing regulation remediation clearer, with severe consequences for non-compliance; and giving residents greater control in situations of acute harm where landlords have neglected their responsibilities.
The shadow Secretary of State asks about a single construction regulator.
We accepted that recommendation in principle, but the single regulator will deliver the functions recommended by the inquiry, with two exceptions to avoid conflicts of interest: setting the rules for construction products and policing its own compliance.
We will consult on the design of the regulator in the autumn.
