People in Northern Ireland are sick to the teeth of paramilitaries, the menace of sectarianism and keeping people stuck in the past.
In the light of the announcement yesterday on transition, does the Prime Minister recognise that people will be highly sceptical of the process?
There must be real learnings from the failed transitions of the past.
There can be no rewards for paramilitaries for hanging on, but there must be robust criminal justice, flags off lampposts and streetcorners, and community-funded policing to allow communities that have been brutalised by paramilitaries to finally look forward to a confident and shared future.
