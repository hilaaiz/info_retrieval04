I thank the hon.
Member for his question, and may I pick up on both elements?
First, President Zelensky is a democratically elected leader and suspending elections was precisely what we did in this country when we were fighting in the second world war.
Secondly, yes, the UK has successfully been a bridge between the US and Europe for many years.
It is vital that we continue in that role.
That is why my message to President Trump is that the relationship between our two countries needs to go from strength to strength—it is already strong—while we work at the same time with our European allies.
