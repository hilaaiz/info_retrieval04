I thank the hon.
Member for his commitment and support in taking forward the recommendations that came from the inquiry.
I thank him for his comments about ensuring that we take decisions about the future of Grenfell in the most sensitive of ways.
I absolutely agree with him, and I am committed to taking the next steps respectfully and carefully with the community.
I continue to support the independent Grenfell Tower Memorial Commission as the community choose a design team to work with them on designing a memorial.
