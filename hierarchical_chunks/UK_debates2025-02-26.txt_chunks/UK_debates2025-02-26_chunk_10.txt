The Secretary of State has met suppliers, and my officials meet regularly with horticultural industry representatives.
The next meeting of the horticultural working group is in two days’ time, and the Government are committed to addressing the outstanding issues on horticultural products to ensure that these can move safely within the UK.
The situation remains difficult.
In fact, the Horticultural Trades Association said that it remains “impossible” for some retailers who are trying to order products from GB-based companies for consumers in Northern Ireland.
Everyone can complain about that, but some of us are trying to do something about it.
The Government are the people who can bring pressure to bear to resolve this problem for consumers in Northern Ireland, so what action is being taken to try to resolve it?
Officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are following up specifically with the companies that are most affected, such as seed shipping companies.
Shipping seeds is allowed, using phytosanitary certificates, but business-to-business posting is currently smoother than business-to-consumer posting.
Solutions to this issue are being worked out within the requirements of the Windsor framework, and guidance should be updated shortly.
