I agree that robust oversight of the Government’s implementation of the response is essential for this, and for all public inquiries.
The system needs to be improved and we are taking forward the inquiry’s recommendations on oversight.
We will create a publicly accessible record on gov.uk of recommendations made by public inquiries since 2024, and we will consider making that a legal requirement as part of a wider review of the inquiry’s framework.
On the Grenfell inquiry recommendations, my Department will publish quarterly progress updates on gov.uk until they have all been delivered.
We will report annually to Parliament to enable Members to scrutinise our progress and hold us to account.
On my hon.
Friend’s comments about the council, the council failed in some of its most fundamental duties to keep residents safe, to listen to their concerns and to respond effectively when disaster struck.
The council was right to apologise, but it is clear that more must be done.
I have welcomed the council’s commitment to improvement and culture change, and I have set my challenge to the leader of the council to ensure that those improvements are a reality felt by the council’s residents.
I will continue to engage and keep an eye on that progress.
