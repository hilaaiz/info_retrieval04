I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that tragic case.
My thoughts, and I am sure those of the House, are with the family, friends and teammates of Mike at Warrington Wolves.
She is right  that one death by suicide is one too many and reducing the number is a vital part of our health mission.
We are recruiting an additional 8,500 mental health workers who are especially trained to support people at risk of suicide.
We are committed to taking forward the suicide prevention strategy for England and I am sure the whole House supports that.
