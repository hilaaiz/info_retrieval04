I thank members of Doncaster and Thorne jobcentres for the job fairs they have done, subsequent to my meeting with the Minister at Yorkshire Wildlife Park.
Job fairs do a fantastic job.
Does the Minister agree that many people in their 50s are busying themselves at home, when they could be having a wonderful second career like me?
If he does agree with me, what can he do to help them jumpstart into a new career?
