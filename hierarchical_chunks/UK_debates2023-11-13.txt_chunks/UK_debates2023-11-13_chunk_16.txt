In his conference speech, the Secretary of State said there would be a revolution in employment support for people with health conditions and disabilities.
Does this revolution include a backlog of 22,432 people waiting for an Access to Work decision, with an average delay of 48 days?
Ministers need to get a grip of support for disabled people, rather than vilifying them.
The Government’s lack of real action often prevents disabled people from working.
Labour has a plan for delivery, so instead of endless reshuffles, why does the Minister not ask his boss to call a general election now?
I think I will pass up on the invitation at the end of the hon.
Lady’s question.
The fact is that this Government are concentrating on working hard to support more disabled people into work.
We are unlocking that potential with all the help and support around it.
The hon.
Lady specifically mentioned Access to Work; we now have more than 500 full-time staff members working on that, compared with 375 in March.
We are focused on prioritising job starts and streamlining things to make it easier for claims to be processed and for people to get support quicker, as well as that staffing increase.
We have a comprehensive plan; the hon.
Lady’s plan is hidden somewhere—I am sure we would all love to hear it.
What recent assessment he has made of the adequacy of Government support for pensioners in the context of rises in the cost of living.
The Pensions Minister is unavoidably detained in No. 10, so they have wheeled out the old Pensions Minister to attempt to address the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
The reality of the situation is that April saw the biggest ever rise in the state pension, by 10.1%, thanks to the triple lock.
Every pensioner is entitled to a winter fuel payment and will receive a cost of living payment this winter.
The poorest pensioners will receive a £900 further cost of living payment.
