I thank the Minister for his answer, but many older people in my Falkirk constituency are living below or on the poverty line.
Furthermore, 2 million older people in the UK live below the poverty line, with many more hovering precariously above it.
Research by Independent Age has shown that older people are significantly struggling and urgently need additional cost of living support to help them through the coming winter.
By expanding the eligibility criteria for the existing cost of living payments to people on housing benefits and those who receive a council tax reduction, we could help to support this group of older people who desperately need it.
Will the Minister commit to that?
