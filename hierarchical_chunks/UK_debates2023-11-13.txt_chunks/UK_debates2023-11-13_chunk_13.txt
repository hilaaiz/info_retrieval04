The Minister began answering these questions by claiming credit for having better youth unemployment figures now than in the aftermath of a global financial crisis, which seems  to me to be a low ambition.
As she has heard, we have problems with inactivity and we have more young people who are not doing anything.
What account can she give for the fact that, even after 13 and a half long years of Conservative Government, we have worse youth unemployment than Ireland, Norway and the Czech Republic, and that here it is double what it is in Germany and treble what it is in Japan?
What on earth has gone wrong?
I think that is a reminder to continually speak up for opportunities for our young people.
The current youth employment rate is 53.9%, up three percentage points since 2010.
It has been my absolute mission in this Parliament, over the last four and a half years, to focus on young people, with around 140 new youth hubs to support the complex needs of young people.
I humbly suggest that the hon.
Member goes and looks at the changes that are happening, to see the difference being made in communities up and down the land.
We are not writing young people off; we are making sure that we support them.
I went to see a new youth hub only last week, and the work being done on housing and with partners is innovative.
It means young people with smiles on their faces and their futures in their hands.
What recent assessment he has made of the adequacy of benefit levels in the context of rises in the cost of living.
The Government have never spent more on welfare and benefit support than we presently do.
From April 2023, we uprated benefits by 10.1% and increased the benefit cap levels by the same amount.
That is on top of the cost of living support that has been made to multiple households and individuals to address the rising cost of bills.
