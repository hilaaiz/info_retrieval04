But the number of young people unemployed in Denton and Reddish is still far too high—the latest figures show a 7% youth unemployment claimant count, which is not good enough.
Given that the share of young people not in full-time employment or education rose last year, what more is the Minister doing to make sure that young people in places such as Denton and Reddish get the life chances they deserve?
I absolutely agree that, in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency and more widely, it is absolutely right that young people get the opportunities they deserve.
In fact, since September 2020 the DWP’s youth offer has seen over 600,000 starts.
As I mentioned earlier, our comprehensive support for young people now encompasses those from age 16.
