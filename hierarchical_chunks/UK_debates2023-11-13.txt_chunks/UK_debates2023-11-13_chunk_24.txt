I thank my hon.
Friend for his typically astute question and for his advice in this area over a number of months.
We have gone out to consultation on the work capability assessment.
We have not come to our conclusions on how to move forward, but right at the centre of that will be a strong belief that if people can work, with our support and encouragement, that is the best of all outcomes.
