The proposals in the work capability assessment activities and descriptors consultation will mean some claimants will lose £390 a month if they are reassessed, pushing them even further into poverty.
Will the Minister or the Secretary of State please explain this huge financial impact on low-income people with disabilities or a serious health condition?
No final decisions have been made.
We have had the consultation and we will respond appropriately in the normal way.
May we have specific detail on the help that jobcentres are giving to armed forces veterans, who must live with the consequences of decisions made by Governments?
A very pertinent point after the weekend when we paid tribute in our local communities and after what we saw on the Elizabeth Tower.
The DWP continues to work to identify universal credit claimants who are members of the armed forces community, with 11 dedicated forces champion leads and over 50 armed forces champions across our jobcentre network working with spouses and partners, too.
