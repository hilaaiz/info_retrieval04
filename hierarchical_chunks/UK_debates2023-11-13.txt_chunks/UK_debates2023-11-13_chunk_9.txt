I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question—I will happily take away his second point, have a look at it and get back to him in writing.
I want to assure him and the House that having DWP youth hubs together in one location helps those young people who have been going through very difficult times because of covid.
They help local youth experts and local partnerships to come together and overcome those barriers, and ensure that young people have the skills and confidence sought by local employers to take up the opportunities that are around them, just down the road.
It is really important that we are there to support them through those mixed youth hubs, which are a big focus for me and for our Department.
