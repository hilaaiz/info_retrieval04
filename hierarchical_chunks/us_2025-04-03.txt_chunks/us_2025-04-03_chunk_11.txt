Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a terrific institution that I am proud to represent in Maryland's Fifth District:
Bowie State University.
On January 9, 2025.
the school marked its 160th anniversary.
The school will celebrate that historic milestone with a gala later this month.
The oldest historically Black university in Maryland, Bowie State University (BSU) has been a beacon of opportunity, innovation, and academic excellence in our state and country ever since it was founded as the Baltimore Normal School for Colored Teachers in 1865.
Many of its first students were recently emancipated Marylanders.
The school offered Black Americans a pathway to educational--and economic-- advancement at a time when they were largely barred from such opportunities.
Back in 1865, the school had only a few small rooms and a handful of students.
Today, BSU boasts a 339-acre campus and over 6,350 undergraduate and graduate students.
It offers more than 65 bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and certificate programs.
From quantum computing and artificial intelligence to biotech and pharmaceutical development, BSU students are producing cutting-edge research in the fields that will define the global 21st-century economy.
Indeed, just this year, BSU received the distinguished 2025 Carnegie Research Activity Classification in recognition of its trailblazing research.
