Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable leadership and service of Pastor Kenneth Simmons as we honor his 12th Pastoral Anniversary at Cold Spring Bible Chapel.
Pastor Simmons' influence extends far beyond the walls of the church, making a lasting impact on the lives of those in need.
Along with First Lady Jamelle Simmons, Pastor Simmons has touched the hearts of countless individuals throughout our community.
His work has inspired many to pursue positive change, creating a ripple effect of compassion and support that continues to shape the future.
For over two decades, Pastor Simmons has dedicated his life to mentoring youth, aiding returning citizens in their re-entry to society, and supporting local organizations.
He has worked tirelessly with little league sports organizations, block clubs, and street outreach programs, bringing hope and opportunity to countless families.
One of his most notable contributions has been his work with the Youth Detention Center, where his efforts have transformed the facility, earning recognition from the State Office of Child and Family Services for turning it into a model for the entire state.
Pastor Simmons has also made it a priority to reach out to the less fortunate in our community, providing critical support for those who need it most.
For over a decade, he and his congregation have blessed thousands of youth with school supplies and book bags, ensuring they have the resources needed to succeed in their education.
His dedication to helping the youth in our community, especially in the 14208 area and along Jefferson Avenue, has changed lives and inspired many to follow in his footsteps.
It is an honor to recognize Pastor Kenneth Simmons for his unwavering commitment to serving our community and exemplifying the power of faith, service, and love.
Pastor Simmons' work continues to uplift those around him, and I am proud to stand with him in celebrating this incredible milestone.
I thank him for all that he has done, and may God continue to bless him and his ministry.
