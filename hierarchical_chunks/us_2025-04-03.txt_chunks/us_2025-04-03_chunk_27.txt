Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Mr. John Bernard Owens, affectionately known as ``Gadget,'' a beloved father, grandfather, and community member whose legacy of love, generosity, and devotion to his family will continue to inspire all who knew him.
Born on January 15, 1938, in Buffalo, New York, to the late John and Mary (Blount) Owens, 
Mr. Owens was one of eight children.
He graduated from the Lackawanna School District, after which he spent over 30 years in the industrial industry, eventually retiring from the Buffalo Brake Beam Steel Company.
