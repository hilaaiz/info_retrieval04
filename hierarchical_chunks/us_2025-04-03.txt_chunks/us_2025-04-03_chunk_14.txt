Mr. ISSA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate my constituent, Escondido resident, the secret soldier of the Korean War, and America's true Top Gun hero.
I'm talking about the one and only Captain Royce Williams, who turns 100 tomorrow, on April 4th.
It is difficult to describe what Royce did for more than 30 harrowing minutes more than 70 years ago in the skies over the North Pacific and the coast.
On that day in 1952, Capt. Williams faced seven Soviet MiG-15s.
Alone.
Royce shot down four.
Alone.
He survived dozens of bullet holes to his plane, and a 37-millimeter round to his fuselage.
Six inches to the right or left would have meant certain death.
This was indomitable courage and the demonstration of the highest skill under incalculable duress.
And it was kept secret for 40 years.
We won't stop until Royce Williams receives the recognition he doesn't seek but richly deserves.
I wish a Happy Birthday to Royce.
Next stop: The Congressional Medal
