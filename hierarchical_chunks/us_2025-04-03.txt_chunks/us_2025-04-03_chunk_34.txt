Over the last 10 years, Matt has consistently proved to be a tremendous source of knowledge to the chairs of the Subcommittee on both sides of the aisle, the numerous defense clerks, and his staff colleagues alike.
I am grateful for his counsel as the Subcommittee navigated a challenging period for the defense and security of our Nation.
On behalf of a grateful Nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Matt for his service to our country and wish him the best in his future endeavors.
