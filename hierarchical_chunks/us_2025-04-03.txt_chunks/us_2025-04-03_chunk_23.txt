Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Darrell Rowser, a man whose strength, dedication, and unwavering love for his family left a lasting impact on everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.
Mr. Rowser's commitment to his work, faith, and most importantly, his family, defined the essence of his character.
Born on September 14, 1958, in Buffalo, New York, to his late father Bertin Rowser, and his mother, Marlene Rowser, 
Mr. Rowser was the third Public School system and graduated from Kensington High School in 1976.
He then went on to receive his Associate's Degree at Medaille College.
