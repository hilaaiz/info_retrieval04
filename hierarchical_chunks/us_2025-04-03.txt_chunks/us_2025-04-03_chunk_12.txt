Mr. Speaker, I've worked with many BSU students, faculty, and staff over the decades, and I can personally attest to how impressive they are.
They are leaders not only in their fields but also in our community.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on this milestone.
I have no doubt that BSU's next 160 years will be just as successful as its first 160 years.
