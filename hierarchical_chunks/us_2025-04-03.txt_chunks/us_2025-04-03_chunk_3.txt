Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, a globally revered spiritual and humanitarian leader who has spearheaded an unprecedented worldwide movement for a stress-free, violence-free society.
Through his organizations, including the Art of Living and the International Association for Human Values, Gurudev Shankar has impacted an estimated 800 million people across 180 countries.
His programs have empowered individuals to tackle challenges at the global, national, community, and individual levels.
Gurudev Shankar was born in 1956 in Southern India, where he demonstrated his spiritual and intellectual gifts at an early age.
By the age of four, Gurudev Shankar was reciting the Bhagavad Gita and meditating.
In 1982, during a ten-day period of silence, Gurudev Shankar developed Sudarshan Kriya, a powerful breathing technique that became central to the Art of Living courses, offering stress relief and well-being to millions.
Gurudev Shankar founded The Art of Living as an international nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering peace and human values.
He also established the International Association for Human Values to support sustainable development and conflict resolution worldwide.
His programs have made significant impacts in conflict zones such as Kashmir, Colombia, and Iraq, and have provided trauma relief for war veterans and communities affected by violence.
In addition to his global peace efforts, Gurudev Shankar is committed to education and environmental conservation.
His initiatives have led to the creation of over 1,300 schools providing free education to underserved children in India, and his organization has planted over 100 million trees across the globe.
Furthermore, The Art of Living's prison program has reached over 800,000 prisoners, helping to rehabilitate and reintegrate them into society.
