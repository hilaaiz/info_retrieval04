Ms. LOIS FRANKEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Rabbi David Steinhardt, a distinguished spiritual leader and educator, as he prepares to retire after more than three decades of dedicated service to B'nai Torah Congregation in Boca Raton, Florida.
Rabbi Steinhardt's journey to the rabbinate was shaped by his early experiences as the child of refugees from Nazi Germany and his deep connection to the Conservative Jewish movement, cultivated at Camp Ramah and Congregation Rodeph Sholom in Connecticut.
Ordained in 1982 at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, Rabbi Steinhardt began his rabbinical career in Ohio before joining B'nai Torah in 1994, where he has since become a transformative figure.
His proudest accomplishments include revitalizing the synagogue's religious after-school program, which saw attendance soar from under 40 percent to over 85 percent, and overseeing over 1,000 bar and bat mitzvahs.
His congregants noted that in his congregation of 1,300 families, Rabbi Steinhardt has made it a point to connect deeply with them, even knowing them all by name.
Under his leadership, the synagogue grew significantly, expanding both its staff and its reach in the Boca Raton community.
Rabbi Steinhardt's commitment to Jewish education and community service has left a lasting legacy.
As he transitions to ``rabbi emeritus,'' he will continue to contribute to his congregation and community, while embracing a busy retirement filled with teaching, writing, meditation, and time spent with his family.
It is a privilege to recognize Rabbi Steinhardt today, and I wish him a fulfilling and rewarding retirement, and continued success.
