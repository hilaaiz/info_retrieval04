My contribution will be brief.
I start by thanking the Minister and Lord Anderson in the other place for their hard work with others on bringing the Bill to fruition.
I also thank them for the kindness and courtesy they have shown my constituents Figen Murray and her husband Stuart.
I echo what the Minister said earlier in paying tribute to them and the whole campaign team who have worked so hard on this.
They have asked me to place on the record their view that the other place did a good job in its scrutiny of the Bill; it was cross-party and collaborative, and the considered amendments from the other place will strengthen the Bill.
For my part, I am glad that the thresholds were not further watered down, and I understand that it is important to keep them under review.
This is a good Bill, and it will be a good law.
It will have a deterrent effect and a protective effect, and it will save lives.
I have a special announcement to make: today is Jim Shannon’s 70th birthday.
Hear, hear.
