My hon.
Friend is right that NHS staff, including nurses, should be paid appropriately for the work they are asked to do and will be asked to do in future.
We are working with the NHS Staff Council to ensure that the national job evaluation scheme is implemented fairly and consistently across nursing and all professions.
My constituent Ben has spent two decades working as a nurse.
He tells me that his paramedic and midwife colleagues received automatic pay band increases post qualification while he and his nursing peers did not.
Ben and his hard-working nursing colleagues have missed out on tens of thousands of pounds compared to colleagues in other disciplines.
Does the Minister agree that something must be done urgently to make up for this inequity?
I am absolutely clear that we need to make sure that the job evaluation scheme looks at staff across the piece and that people are rewarded appropriately for the work they are asked to do.
We will do that as part of our discussions with the NHS Staff Council, and we will be working consistently with staff as part of the 10-year plan to ensure that people are rewarded.
We depend on these staff, and we want to encourage them to be part of the NHS workforce.
That is the approach we intend to take.
What steps his Department is taking to reduce the number of people waiting for NHS treatment.
The 18-week standard for elective care has not been met for almost a decade.
That is the legacy of the Conservative party.
Our plan for change commits us to cutting waiting lists from 18 months to 18 weeks by the end of this Parliament through a combination of investment and reform.
Since we took office, the waiting list has reduced by over 190,000.
We achieved our manifesto pledge of 2 million extra appointments seven months early, and waiting lists have fallen five months in a row.
A lot done, but a lot more to do.
Change has begun, and the best is still to come.
