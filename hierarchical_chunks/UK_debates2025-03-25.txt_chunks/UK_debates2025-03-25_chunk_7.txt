I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question.
I have met hon.
Members from the area and made it clear that in principle we support any creation of new teaching capacity for dentistry.
What I have also set out is that, before we can give an instruction to the Office for Students to go ahead with that work, we have to have the settlement of the comprehensive spending review, so we know what our financial envelope is.
We will not have that until June, but certainly we will be looking at that as and when we know whether the funding will be available.
