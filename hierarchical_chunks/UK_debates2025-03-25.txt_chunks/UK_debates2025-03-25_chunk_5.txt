I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for the constructive meeting and discussion that we had on this matter.
As he will know, we are exploring the use of provisional registration for overseas dentists, and we are urging the GDC to arrange more examinations for dentists.
I have a meeting set up in short order with the head of the GDC, and I will keep the right hon.
Gentleman posted on that conversation.
