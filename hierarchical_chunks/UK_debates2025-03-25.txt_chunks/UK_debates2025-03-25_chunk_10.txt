What assessment he has made of the adequacy of the provision of health services for women.
The Government are committed to improving women’s health outcomes.
We have already taken urgent action to tackle the gynaecology list through the elective reform plan, and we recently announced an £11 million trial using AI tools to detect breast cancer cases earlier.
The 10-year health plan will set out how we will tackle the factors that lead to poor health outcomes and the improvements we expect to see.
What assessment has the Minister made of the adequacy of research into and the provision of fibroid treatment for women, taking into consideration that fibroids are three times more likely to appear in black women than in white women?
The Government welcome the work my hon.
Friend has undertaken and the work of the Caribbean and African Health Network in highlighting health inequalities for black women.
She highlights shocking and unacceptable statistics.
The National Institute for Health and Care Research has funded a significant amount of research into women’s health issues, including a £1.5 million trial comparing treatment options for fibroids.
I am happy to make sure she is updated on that work and on the details of that work.
Early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can make a huge difference to the women involved, and, of course, to the prognosis and the cost to the state of health provision.
I welcome the reference in the cancer plan to early diagnosis, but what specifically will the Government do to encourage greater awareness of the full range of breast cancer symptoms, and to encourage women to get early diagnosis and treatment for better outcomes?
