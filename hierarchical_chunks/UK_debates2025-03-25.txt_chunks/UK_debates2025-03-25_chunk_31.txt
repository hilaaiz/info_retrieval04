The media are reporting that the earliest the contract can be broken is September next year.
Can the Minister confirm whether that is the case?
What liability does the taxpayer have for a contract ending today that we cannot get out of until September next year?
The right hon.
Lady is talking about the prime contractor, which in this case is Clearsprings Ready Homes.
As with the other two contractors, the break clauses are with it.
We have approval or not of sub-prime contractors.
Stay Belvedere Hotels Ltd is a sub-prime contractor, and as the Home Office we have withdrawn our approval for it to be in the supply chain.
The shadow Home Secretary has a nerve to come to this House and make that argument when we in the communities saw the damage that the contract he managed did to the public purse.
Shall we revisit some of those greatest hits?
His contract put councils and Clearsprings against each other, pushing up prices and making it impossible for local communities to help those housed there.
He caused absolute chaos.
I have in my hand one of the letters that the hon.
Gentleman’s Government were presenting to people who were refugees, giving them less than five days’ notice of where they were being moved, meaning that school places had to be hastily reorganised and children had to be hastily re-clothed because of the decisions he made on public funds.
Absolutely no savings were made in the way in which he managed the contracts.
Will my hon.
Friend make a commitment and a pledge to all of us who have had to deal with Clearsprings and its chaotic management that when she has the opportunity to renegotiate the contract, or possibly even break it for good, she will put public value for money first and not repeat the chaos of the shadow Home Secretary?
We are doing all that we can with the existing contracts to drive value for money, and we are also looking to pilot some other potential alternatives to supply.
