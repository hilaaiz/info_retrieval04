I thank the Secretary of State for his response, which will give much-needed reassurance to patients across the UK.
Any public body that fails to accurately record sex and instead conflates it with gender puts people at serious risk of harm.
Unfortunately, this type of organisational capture has been widespread across Scotland, with devastating consequences.
Can the Secretary of State assure me that he will raise this issue with his counterparts in the Scottish Government to ensure that NHS Scotland does not put my constituents at risk?
