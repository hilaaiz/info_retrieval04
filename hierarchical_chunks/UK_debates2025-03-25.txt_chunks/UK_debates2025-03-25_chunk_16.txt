I commend the hon.
Member’s campaign activity for improved cancer facilities.
I commend, too, Mateusz’s two half-marathons.
I wonder when the hon.
Member will be doing his half-marathon, but I can guarantee that I will not be joining him.
The fact that this sort of activity is taking place is fantastic.
Local provision for healthcare is managed by the local health system.
I would be delighted to meet him and local representatives as soon as diaries allow.
Cancer care is important for people right across the UK, particularly early diagnosis.
How do the Government plan to raise cancer awareness among young people during Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month and ensure that they are fully aware of the signs and symptoms?
This is a really important issue.
We have reinstated the children and young people cancer taskforce, which I visited a couple of weeks ago.
We have tasked it with ensuring that children and young people are a part of its work.
The Department will be marking Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Awareness Month appropriately.
We encourage all children and young people to get the checks that they need and be aware of cancer symptoms.
What steps his Department is taking to help tackle inequalities in nursing career progression.
I know that this subject is very close to my hon.
Friend’s heart, after many years of NHS service.
Ensuring great careers for NHS staff, including nurses, has been a key theme of our engagement with staff to shape the 10-year plan.
I will shortly set out further measures to improve progression for nurses and their colleagues in other key NHS professions.
