I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his question and for his long-standing commitment to improving mental health services.
Lord Darzi highlighted that those waiting over a year for mental healthcare outnumbered the entire population of Leicester.
We are committed to tackling this.
We will fix the broken system by recruiting an extra 8,500 mental health workers, introducing access to a specialist in every school and rolling out community Young Futures hubs in England.
We will shortly be publishing before Parliament our mental health investment standard report, which will show that when it comes to mental health this Government are putting their money where their mouth is.
Waiting times for patients living in the village of Burton outside Christchurch could be drastically cut if the local integrated care board were to approve the creation of a new branch surgery.
That application has been outstanding for more than four months.
Will the Secretary of State put a bomb under Dorset ICB and get it to approve it straight away?
That sounds like an invitation to commit a criminal offence, and I think I will resist the temptation.
I am sure that the ICB has heard the hon.
Gentleman’s forceful representations, and we will make inquiries to get him an update.
