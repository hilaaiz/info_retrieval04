The Secretary of State and Ministers’ commitment to 700,000 more emergency dental appointments is already taking effect in my NHS area, with an extra 27,000 slots, and the feedback is excellent.
However, constituents have told me that some dentists seem to be removing non-emergency patients from their lists.
Can the Minister please reassure them that their NHS dentists will be there when they need them?
As my hon.
Friend says, we are delivering 700,000 additional urgent appointments.
Patients are not limited to a registered practice in England, and practices are required to keep their status up to date on the NHS website.
Anyone struggling to find a dentist should go to nhs.uk or call 111.
It is also clear that while NHS England is not mandating an approach to the purchasing of these additional appointments, ICBs could consider either buying more appointments through new or recommissioned contracts or modifying existing contracts, and/or using flexible commissioning.
