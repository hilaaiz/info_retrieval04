Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Bernard J. McCullough, better known as ``Bernie Mac'' by his fans.
Born on the south side of Chicago on October 5,1957, Bernie would go on to become a singular comedic talent who spent his entire career in show business, bringing laughter and joy to his audiences.
To his fans and a world that adored him, he was comedian Bernie Mac.
But his real name was Bernard Jeffery McCullough born October 5, 1957 as the second child of Mary McCullough and Jeffery Harrison, who had already made their life transition.
Bernard, or ``Bernie'', as he was affectionately named, grew up in the gang-ridden Englewood Community of Chicago.
Always a leader and not a follower, he gained the respect of most of the gang members without ever joining.
He was forever the clown and always known for making people laugh.
He accepted Jesus Christ at a young age and attended Burning Bush Missionary Baptist Church.
His big break came in 1990 when he won first place with a remarkable performance in the Miller Lite Comedy Search.
From that point, his popularity spread, and he garnered attention prompting Russell Simmons to give him a spot on his groundbreaking show Def Comedy Jam.
Bernard's first stage appearance was so well received that he was invited back to perform a second time.
From that moment on, the Mac Man was a phenomenon.
He would soon go on tour as the opening act for Chaka Khan, Barry White, the Whispers and many other performers.
Bernie made his film debut with the release of Mo' Money in 1992.
His breakthrough performance, however, came in his role as Pastor Cleaver in Ice Cube's hit movie, Friday (1995).
Bernie Mac's comedy was raw, honest, and fearless.
His stand-up often revolved around his personal experiences, delivered with his signature raspy voice and bold stage presence.
He gained widespread recognition as one of the four comedians in the 2000 stand-up film The Original Kings of Comedy, where his set stole the show with its hilarious takes on family and discipline.
The Bernie Mac Show, his self-titled sitcom, was a groundbreaking hit, blending humor with heartfelt moments as he played a fictionalized version of himself raising his sister's kids.
The show earned multiple awards and cemented his place in TV history.
Bernie transitioned seamlessly into acting, appearing in films like Ocean's Eleven, 
Mr. 3000, and Guess Who.
His charisma made him stand out in every role he took on.
Even after his passing in 2008, Bernie Mac remains a beloved figure in comedy.
His fearless approach and unique comedic style continue to influence comedians today, impacting hundreds of lives still.
Bernie launched The Bernie Mac Foundation in Chicago, Illinois in 2005 as Founder and Chairman of the Board to bring awareness to sarcoidosis and build a bridge between awareness and a cure.
He dedicated his mission to informing the community on the impact of sarcoidosis to patients and transform the opinions of treatment.
Bernie used his celebrity to support the Bernie Mac Sarcoidosis Translational Advanced Research (STAR) Center at the University of Illinois Health Sciences System to provide patients with outstanding care.
He was also passionate about patients receiving evaluations in a timely, compassionate and courteous manner for all forms of sarcoidosis.
