Mr. GOLDEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Paul Roger Dionne, who passed away on April 17, 2025.
A pillar of the Lewiston community, Paul spent his life in service to others.
As a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, Paul earned two Bronze Stars and two Vietnamese Crosses.
After returning home, Paul met his best friend and soulmate, Diane (LeBlanc), and they married in 1970.
Together, they built a home and raised two daughters, Melodie and Michelle, and later welcomed five grandchildren.
In addition to Paul's service to his country, he also served the people.
Leading his community as Assistant District Attorney and as Mayor of Lewiston, Paul was instrumental in bringing the University of Maine system to Lewiston (UMLA).
Later in his career, Paul was appointed Maine's first Executive Director of the Workers' Compensation Board, serving under Governors King and Baldacci.
In this role Paul fought for workers' rights and is remembered for his compassion and tact.
However, Paul's greatest impact was on his beloved community of Lewiston.
A staple at every community event, Paul was a member of the Chamber of Commerce, led the Central Maine Medical Center Board of Trustees, and earned recognition as one of Lewiston's Citizens of the Year.
Additionally, Paul coached hundreds of students on the Lewiston High School Mock Trial Team, which he did proudly alongside his daughter.
Remembered by many for his big smile, and his love for one another, he lifted up his community.
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I am honored to pay tribute to Paul Dionne.
