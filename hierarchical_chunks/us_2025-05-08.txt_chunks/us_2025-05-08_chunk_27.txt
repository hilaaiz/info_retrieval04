Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nancy Merkling for receiving the Robert O. Covey Business of the Year Award.
This award pays tribute to the late Robert O. Covey and celebrates businesses in the Crystal Lake area that have demonstrated outstanding success and community involvement.
As the owner and producer of Nancy Merkling Productions, 
Ms. Merkling offers professional photography and mentorship services, inspiring and guiding others who are pursuing careers in the field.
Her vision and artistry distinguish her work in family portraits, headshots, and commercial photography.
