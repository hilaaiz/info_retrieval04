Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the Crystal Lake Strikers, whose contributions to the arts and education have had a profound and lasting impact on the city.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Strikers on receiving this well-deserved award and for continuing to inspire the next generation of performers.
