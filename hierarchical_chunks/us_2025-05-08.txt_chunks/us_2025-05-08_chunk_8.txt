Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding group of interns who have supported the work of the 20th District of California this spring.
These bright and driven young people--serving in my Washington, D.C. office and my Bakersfield, California office-- have brought a spirit of dedication and enthusiasm that enriched our team.
At a time when many young Americans are questioning the role of public service, their eagerness to engage with the federal government on behalf of their communities offers real encouragement for the future With their time in Congress reaching its close, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Jonathan Clark, Justin Gibbins, and Jack Putrino for their work in my Washington, D.C. office, and Ava Dykes for her service in my Bakersfield, California office.
Their hard work and dedication have been invaluable, and I hope that the experiences gained here will serve them well in their future endeavors.
