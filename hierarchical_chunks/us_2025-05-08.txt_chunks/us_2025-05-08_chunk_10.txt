Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 74th birthday of Eric L. Thompson, Sr. Born on April 3, 1951 in Chicago, Illinois.
Eric has been a lifelong resident of Chicago and a beloved member of our community.
As a young man, Eric was inspired by the civil rights advocacy of his parents, who frequently worked with my father, Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. to advance civil rights through Operation Rainbow PUSH.
Eric attended Augustana College and later went on to start his own businesses, T&T Food Service, and Eridor Food Service, Inc., named in honor of his sons, Eric and Dorian.
Through his hard work and keen business skills, Eric has grown his businesses into the preeminent food service providers in the Chicago area.
In addition to being an accomplished businessman, Eric is also known for his friendly spirit and kindness.
To know Eric is to know a friend.
As Eric looks back on 74 wonderful years, I hope he is able to rest on his laurels and enjoy celebrating his accomplishments with his family and friends.
I wish him many more years of good health.
