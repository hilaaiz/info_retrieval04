I thank the Minister for his response.
We have indeed discussed these issues before and will continue to do so, I am sure.
At the weekend, I spent time on two farms in my constituency—at both I met groups of farmers, including members of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, who told me of their huge frustration at being let down by the Government’s policy on farming and the lack of support.
They recognise how vital farming is, including the transition to nature-friendly farming, for this country’s food security, nature protection and climate action.
Does he agree with the farmers in my constituency about how vital the transition to nature-friendly farming is for those issues, and will he give us a date for when he will introduce such policies—
