I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and note that even in those times of distress, woe and horror, some good relationships were formed.
The seasonal worker visa scheme for 43,000 seasonal worker visas was announced a few months ago.
That number includes 2,000 extra for poultry.
At the National Farmers Union conference, the Secretary of State announced a five-year extension to 2030.
That will provide certainty, but my hon.
Friend is right that we need to analyse and assess very carefully what the industry needs to ensure it has the resources required.
