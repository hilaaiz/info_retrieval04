I thank my hon.
Friend for her response.
Harry Parker was 14 years old when he got run over.
The person who took his life did not have a driving licence or any insurance, and did not stop, yet last November the charges were dropped.
This is partially down to section 3ZB of the Road Traffic Act 1988.
Will my hon.
Friend review section 3ZB and meet me to see how we can close the loopholes?
