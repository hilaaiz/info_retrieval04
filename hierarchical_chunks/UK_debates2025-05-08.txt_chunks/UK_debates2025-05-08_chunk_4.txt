What plans he has for future fishing quotas.
On VE Day, it is important that we remember the huge contribution made by fishermen, fishing communities, farm workers and agricultural workers during the last war to keep the country fed.
Later today, I shall unveil a plaque to the members of the Women’s Land Army, one of whom was my aunt, Jean Mead.
They made a fantastic contribution during that period.
We negotiate a range of fishing quotas, and any future quotas will be agreed only if that is in the national interest.
I am pleased that we are engaging closely with industry, trialling new methods to shape future allocations that will both protect stocks and support communities.
A recent poll by the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation showed that 87% of Scots believe the UK should control access to our fishing waters.
Two-thirds of seafood landed in the UK comes into Scotland and it is vital to our economy and to many of our coastal communities.
Will the Minister show the House and rural and fishing communities across the country that the Prime Minister will not negotiate away any control of our waters during his EU reset later this month?
