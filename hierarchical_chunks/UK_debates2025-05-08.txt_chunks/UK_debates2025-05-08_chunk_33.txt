If the Attorney General will meet the hon.
Member for Swindon North to discuss prosecutions by the Crown Prosecution Service under section 3ZB of the Road Traffic Act 1988.

I would like to take the opportunity to extend my deepest condolences to the family of Harry Parker.
Every single death on our roads is completely unacceptable, and increasing the safety of our roads is a priority for this Government.
