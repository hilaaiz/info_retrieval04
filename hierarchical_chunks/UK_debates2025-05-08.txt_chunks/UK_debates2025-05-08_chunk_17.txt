I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his important question.
Of course, we welcome the Climate Change Committee’s assessment.
The Government recognise the need to go further and faster to prepare for the impacts of a warmer world.
For example, we are already taking active steps to include climate adaptation in our flood programme.
For the first time, the Environment Agency’s flood risk modelling integrates potential impacts of climate change on flood and coastal erosion risk.
The investment of £2.65 billion into maintaining flood defences will help to better protect 52,000 properties by March 2026.
