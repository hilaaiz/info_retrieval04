Order.
We have a lot to get through today—come on.
I am always interested to hear reflections from farmers.
I have spoken to other members of the Nature Friendly Farming Network who are very pleased with the progress being made, but of course we want to  go faster and further.
We have over 50,000 people in the schemes and more money is being spent than ever before.
We must recognise the important progress being made.
What steps his Department is taking to help prevent the spread of avian influenza.
I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this extremely serious issue.
To prevent the further spread of disease and manage the risk of avian influenza, DEFRA and the Animal and Plant Health Agency have implemented well-established outbreak structures to control and eradicate disease, restore normal trade and support recovery in local communities.
Avian influenza prevention zones are in force across the UK.
To further protect farmers and help communities, we are currently investing £208 million in the future of the biosecurity labs at Weybridge.
Does the Minister agree that avian influenza remains an existential threat to the poultry industry, and—now that the French have decided to vaccinate their ducks—will he agree to the National Farmers Union request that we introduce the vaccination of seasonal turkeys in order to protect the entire industry?
As ever, the right hon.
Gentleman makes a well-informed point.
Vaccination has been considered for some time.
There are trade issues, but as he says, the fact that the French are changing their position is useful.
The Government are committed to exploring options for vaccination, and a cross-Government and industry avian influenza vaccination taskforce has been established.
It published an initial statement on  7 March  and will report more fully this summer.
