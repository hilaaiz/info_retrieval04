Next month, a planning application for a biodigester near Haverhill and Withersfield in West Suffolk will be decided.
It is the wrong location for many reasons, not least the risk of flooding as the proposed site is on flood risk zone 3 land.
What are the Government doing to prevent development on land susceptible to flooding?
The hon.
Gentleman raises an important point.
Of course, the national planning policy framework is clear that where development in areas at risk of flooding is necessary, local planning authorities and developers should ensure that the development is appropriately flood resilient and resistant, safe for the development’s lifetime and, importantly, will not increase flood risk elsewhere.
We are also looking at other measures, such as sustainable urban drainage systems, to be included in planning as well.
