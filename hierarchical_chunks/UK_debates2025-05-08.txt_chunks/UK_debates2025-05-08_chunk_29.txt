My hon.
Friend raises an important point.
The director of the SFO has expressed strong support for the financial incentivisation of whistleblowers, and the SFO’s five-year strategy commits to exploring options, working with partners in the UK and abroad.
Reform would require careful assessment, and it is right that any suggestions that could enhance the SFO’s efficiency and our ability as a country to tackle serious fraud, bribery and corruption are properly considered.
One thing that concerns me in Northern Ireland is criminal gangs and former paramilitary gangs being involved in all sorts of crime, now including economic crime.
They see business as a way of creating more wealth for their criminal activities.
What is being done to take on these criminal gangs, whose tentacles reach right across the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and, indeed, further afield, which we also have to address?
Criminal gangs have to be taken on and have to be taken out of operation and put in jail.
Do the Al Capone on them—put them in jail for economic crime.
Your problems are solved, Solicitor General.
The hon.
Member is absolutely right that fraud does not stop at national borders, so it is vital that enforcement activities do not stop at national borders either.
That is why the SFO takes co-operation with international partners extremely seriously.
In fact, most recently, the director launched a new international anti-corruption prosecutorial taskforce with Swiss and French partner agencies to strengthen existing ties between these countries and to lead to greater joint working on cases, as well as the sharing of insight and expertise.
I would argue that we need more of those agreements and greater international co-operation to tackle the issue that he raises.
