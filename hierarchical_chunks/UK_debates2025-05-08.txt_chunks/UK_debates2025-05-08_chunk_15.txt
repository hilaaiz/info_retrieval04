I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his words and his praise for the APHA.
These are extremely important subjects.
We face a range of threats.
That is why the Government have increased security in terms of personal imports through the short straits in particular.
On his point about Weybridge, we have had this discussion before.
There is a major programme under way, which  will take a number of years.
It is already a world-leading facility, and this Government are committed to providing the funding that Weybridge needs to do its job.
We are absolutely committed to that, which is why we have announced £208 million this year.
