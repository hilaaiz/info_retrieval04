I am always happy to meet the right hon.
Gentleman.
This and the Yorkshire wolds are under active consideration, as I am sure he is aware.
There is a legal process to be followed ahead of that, but I know his constituency and will be very happy to meet to discuss the matter further.
What steps he has taken to help protect communities vulnerable to flooding.
After 14 years, the Conservatives left our flood defences in the worst condition on record.
We are investing a record £2.65 billion in a thousand projects to better protect 52,000 properties by March 2026.
Following the recent storm season, serious flooding damaged the foundations of Radyr cricket club and exposed electrical cables, which forced the club to close and cancel practice until the site was made safe.
The club is also situated next to important electricity infrastructure, which means up to 930 customers could be put at risk of disruption.
I have been working with Councillor Helen Lloyd Jones to try and find a way forward between National Grid and Natural Resources Wales to establish who will take responsibility for securing the river bank and the electricity infrastructure.
Unfortunately, we are at an impasse, and my constituents continue to be vulnerable to further flooding.
Will the Minister meet me to establish what the UK Government can do to try and help break that impasse before the next storm season hits?
I am sure they have got a meeting already.
