I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his important question.
Everything relating to regulation of water is supported and looked at through the Drinking Water Inspectorate, which carries out an assessment to make sure we have the best water quality in the whole country.
If he requires any further detail, he is welcome to write to me again and I will make sure I find it.
