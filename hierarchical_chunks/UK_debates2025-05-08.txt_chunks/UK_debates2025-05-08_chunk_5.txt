I thank the hon.
Lady for her important question, and I recognise the importance of the Scottish fishing fleet and its contribution.
She will have to wait a little longer to hear the full details of the outcomes of any negotiations, but I have to remind her that the sense of betrayal across fishing communities came under her Government’s watch.
