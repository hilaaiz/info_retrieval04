I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising what I said on an episode of “Any Questions” last week, so that I can be absolutely clear with the House today, and especially to the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse and grooming gangs, that I am very sorry for those remarks, as I made clear over the weekend.
I, and every member of this Government, want your truth to be heard, wherever that truth leads.
Your truly appalling experiences need to be acted on, for those responsible to be accountable and face the full force of the law, and for justice to be served.
I would never want to leave the impression that these very serious, profound and far-reaching issues, which I have campaigned on for many years, should be shied away from and not aired—far from it.
No stone will be left unturned.
