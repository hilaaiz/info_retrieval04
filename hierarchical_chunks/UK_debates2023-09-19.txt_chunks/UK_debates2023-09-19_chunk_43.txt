On the portacabins, I would just like to say that I have been to a number of these schools and met the children.
At the first school I visited, the children were all petitioning me to stay in the portacabins, because they actually preferred them to the classroom.
The portacabins are very high quality—[Interruption.]
That is true.
I advise the shadow Secretary of State to visit some of them herself.
Perhaps the Secretary of State could clarify whether it is 18 or 28 schools that still need temporary classrooms, because we have heard different figures from her and from her ministerial colleague at the Education Committee earlier.
Something headteachers have said to me is that they do not just need the temporary classrooms, but they need some of them kitted out as science labs or design and technology classrooms, for example.
There is a cost to doing that.
It is not just a question of chairs and tables; it is much more.
What is her Department doing to make sure that children have the right classrooms so they can do their assessments, which are already ticking along towards next year’s exams?
I confirm that the project directors and caseworkers have made inquiries requesting potential orders for a further 28 sites.
There are some specialist requirements for science labs or other specialist equipment, and there are a number of things taking place on that.
Schools are sharing science lab equipment in the short term, either with another school or with another part of the school.
We are also looking at mitigations.
In the school I went to see where the children were very happy in their portacabin, they had horizontally propped and mitigated the science labs first, so they were able to use the science labs in combination with the portacabins.
There are also specialist portacabins available, which are being looked at in specific circumstances.
