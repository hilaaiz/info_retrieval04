I thank the Minister for that answer.
As chair of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief, I commend  the hon.
Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns)  on raising this matter.
For me, freedom of religious belief in China is paramount and should be a priority for the Government—I think it is.
To make it happen, we need clear legislation in this place and real power from this Government, and we need to be assured that no company that uses forced labour in China can have its products sold in this country.
Again, I seek confirmation from the Minister that that serious strong will is there.
