There are a couple of things I will point out.
If we had tried to do what the right hon.
Gentleman suggested, we would have delayed the 3.7 GW of clean energy that we secured, which is able to power 2 million homes.
If we want to look at what is going to hurt people and their bills, I would point to his disastrous policies, whether it is the ultra low emission zone, which is hitting people who can least afford it, or his borrowing spree, which will raise inflation.
I am afraid the Secretary of State is quite wrong about that, because Ireland adjusted the price and had 3 GW of offshore wind.
Let us talk about the way that this Government are jeopardising our energy security.
They have delivered—[Interruption.]
Order.
Mr Stuart, I know this is the last day before the recess and you are excited to get some freedom, but let’s save it.
This Government have delivered the worst cost of living crisis in a generation.
There is a pattern here: they banned onshore wind and raised bills, they slashed energy efficiency and raised bills, and now they have trashed offshore wind, raising bills.
That is why we are so exposed.
I know that the right hon.
Lady did not make those decisions, but now that she is the Secretary of State, she needs to tell us, after 13 years of failure, what is she going to do differently?
Let me tell the right hon.
Gentleman about the last 13 years.
We have decarbonised faster than any G7 country, while also growing the economy.
We have grown renewable energy from 7% of our electricity when Labour left power to 50% now.
I am proud of what we have achieved over the last 13 years.
We have a proud record when it comes to climate change and a proud record when it comes to renewable energy, and I am proud to defend it.
We now come to the SNP spokesperson.
