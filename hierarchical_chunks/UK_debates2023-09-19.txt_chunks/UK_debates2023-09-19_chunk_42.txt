I thank my hon.
Friend, the Chair of the Education Committee.
I apologise about the written answer the previous night; we had more recent information at the Education Committee.
The cases are always being assessed and the numbers are always being updated, which is why we choose a date to publish the latest information.
The numbers are moving very quickly.
He is absolutely right: 11 RAAC schools already have temporary buildings that are installed or in use.
There is a further 28 sites, I think, that have made inquiries and requested potential orders.
As he rightly said, there are 180 single classrooms, 68 double classrooms, plus a mixture of toilet provision.
