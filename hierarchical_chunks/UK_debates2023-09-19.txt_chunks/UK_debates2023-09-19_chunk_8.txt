I thank my hon.
Friend for his long-standing support in this area and I can confirm that we are wasting no time in engaging the sector in advance of AR6.
I personally spoke to offshore wind stakeholders following AR5 and confirmed our commitment.
The Minister for Energy Security and Net  Zero held a roundtable with the sector on  12 September .
We are listening to the sector and annual auctions mean we can respond quickly.
