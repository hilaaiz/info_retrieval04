I welcome the Secretary of State to her new role.
I wish I could have welcomed her to her new role on  5 September , when we had the remaining stages of the Energy Bill, but she was not here.
I wish I could have welcomed her on  7 September  for the urgent question on the auction round 5 strike  price, but she was not here for that either, so what has the new Secretary of State been doing in the midst of the chronic energy crisis facing our constituents and allowing her Department to see shovel-ready offshore wind go into abeyance?
What has she been doing?
