I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising this issue today.
I understand that concerns have been raised by local communities about the National Grid electricity transmission plans for network reinforcement between Norwich and Tilbury.
The Minister for Nuclear and Networks, my hon.
Friend  the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie) , has visited the area and will continue to engage with colleagues, but I am also happy to meet local MPs to discuss the matter further.
