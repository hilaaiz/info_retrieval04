Question 2 please.
I know that as chair of the all-party group on the Celtic sea my hon.
Friend is a long-standing supporter of offshore wind.
We have announced that AR6 will open in March 2024 and we have published an indicative timetable.
We are supporting research and development in floating wind technology via the floating offshore wind demonstration programme, announcing up to £160 million in capital grant funding.

Selaine Saxby should be asking a direct question.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I am keen to understand better what more can be done to assist floating offshore wind in AR6 following what happened in AR5.
