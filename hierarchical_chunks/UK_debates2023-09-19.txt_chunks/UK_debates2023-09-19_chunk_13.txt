I wish the Clerk of the House well in the future, and I warmly welcome the Secretary of State to her new role and congratulate her on her appointment to the Cabinet.
I look forward to working together.
Let us start with the truth.
The offshore wind auction that she inherited was a totally avoidable disaster.
It means another lost year for our country and another year of higher bills, and it is because Ministers obstinately refused to listen to warning after warning from industry.
RenewableUK estimates that the auction failure will add £2 billion to bills.
What is the Secretary of State’s estimate of the cost to families of this fiasco?
