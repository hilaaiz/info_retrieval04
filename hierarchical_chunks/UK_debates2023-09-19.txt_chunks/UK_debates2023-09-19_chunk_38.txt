I thank the hon.
Lady for her questions.
As soon as we had information, we took a decision in every case.
When we first saw the incident in 2018, we took a decision and we put out new guidance and warnings.
We put out new guidance in 2021-22.
We started surveys directly in 2022, when the previous Secretary of State started to get more concerned about RAAC in our school estate.
We then sent in surveyors directly, because the responsible bodies were not moving quickly enough.
