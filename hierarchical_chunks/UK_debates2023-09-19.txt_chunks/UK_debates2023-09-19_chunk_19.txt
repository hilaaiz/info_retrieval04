I welcome my hon.
Friend’s work as a member of the Commission for Carbon Competitiveness, and she makes an excellent point.
The £20 billion will be funded through a variety of sources and will be allocated in due course, and early this year the Government  consulted on a range on measures to support decarbonisation, including a carbon border adjustment mechanism.
The Government will provide a response to that consultation in due course.
