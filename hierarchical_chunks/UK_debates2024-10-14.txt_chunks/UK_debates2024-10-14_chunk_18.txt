As a rifleman, I know the importance of training for military operations; it ensures readiness, lethality and survivability.
In addition to the recent announcement that there is no firm timeline for spending 2.5% of GDP, possible cuts to the training budget have been mentioned.
Will the Minister confirm that there will be no cuts to the training budget in either this financial year or the next?
