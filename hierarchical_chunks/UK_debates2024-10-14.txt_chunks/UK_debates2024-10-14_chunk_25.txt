I regularly discuss how best to support Ukraine with international partners.
Last week, I met my Ukrainian counterpart and the new Secretary-General of NATO in London.
Last month at the Ukraine defence contact group in Ramstein, I met nearly 50 other Defence Ministers who came together to commit to continued support of Ukraine, both in the immediate fight and for the long term.
