During his Labour conference speech, the Prime Minister made one of his key announcements: “We will repay those who served us and house all veterans in housing need.
Homes will be there for heroes.”
Hear, hear!
Wait for it.
Last week, the Government confirmed that that would actually be done by exempting veterans from local connection and residency tests, rather than by making dedicated housing available.
Given that it was a key conference pledge, what guarantees are the Government able to offer veterans that homes really will be there for them?
As the hon.
Gentleman will know, Op Fortitude is running and we have had more than 2,000 referrals so far, with 700 veterans put into housing.
We will continue to extend the programme to ensure that every veteran has a home in due course.
