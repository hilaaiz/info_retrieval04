In May, I was privileged to join a group called Help99 in driving some pick-up trucks and other military vehicles to Kyiv for the use of Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can make it easier for such groups to deliver vehicles, which are so desperately needed?
I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend and parliamentary colleagues in all parties for the work they are doing in their constituencies to support our friends in Ukraine.
I would be very happy to meet him to see what we can do to support their work further, because we will support Ukraine for as long as it takes.
