I thank the Secretary of State for his contribution.
He will be aware of the failures of analysis at the start of the full-scale invasion.
Will he consider the report by Phillips O’Brien and Eliot Cohen of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies that looked at some of those failures, so that he is informed for the next process, in terms of support for Ukraine and building support internationally?
