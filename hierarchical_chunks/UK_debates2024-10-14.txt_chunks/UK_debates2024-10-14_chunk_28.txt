I thank the Secretary of State for his answer.
On a recent visit to Ukraine, I visited the Chernihiv oblast, which is a former Russian red line.
There, we saw a large military effort by communities and local government.
Given that large segments of the military in Ukraine are made up differently from our own Ministry of Defence, what discussions is the Secretary of State having to ensure funds are going into community and local government efforts?
