Further to those points of order, Mr Speaker.
Like my colleagues  the right hon.
Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)  and  the hon.
Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Jamie Stone) , I served with Alec Salmond in the Scottish Parliament from 1999.
Alec did not always stay when we did; sometimes he came back here, but he inevitably came back to Scotland, and he became Scotland’s First Minister.
Of course, even before that, as a Scot interested in politics, I was aware of Alec and of his great strength and courage.
I seem to remember that at one point he was not a member of the SNP, and it is always difficult to rebel against your own party, so all credit to him for doing so then over a point of principle.
I was interested in the point made by the right hon.
Member for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale about the Lobby.
I have heard stories from new Labour MPs who were encouraged to think about the way Scotland would be after independence— but for a different reason.
It was suggested to them that Scotland would always vote in a Labour Government if we were to be independent, which just goes to show how astute—and, I suppose, pragmatic—Alec was as a politician.
He was  a great performer in whichever Chamber he was in, and he was always worth listening to.
Obviously, my politics and his were very different, but I shared platforms with him on a number of occasions, and it was always interesting and an education to listen to what he had to say.
My thoughts and prayers go to Moira, of course, and to Gail and the wider family, as well as to all those who knew and loved him.
