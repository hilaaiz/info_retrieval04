Friend is right: alongside military aid, economic support and diplomatic help are required to support Ukraine and put pressure on Russia.
The UK has banned the import of Russian oil and oil products, in line with the steps taken by the US and the European Union.
Importers must now include proof of origin and country of last dispatch as a way of tightening up on the loopholes, and we will not hesitate to take further action if Russian revenues, which fuel the war machine, are not closed off by the sanctions.
