I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to the House.
As a fellow Devon MP, I believe it is important that we have a strong voice on defence, so I am grateful for his question.
The new Government have been very clear that we see AI playing a really important role not just in defence, but across a whole range of technologies.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology is leading on much of that work in his Department.
AI and related technologies are being looked at in relation to the strategic defence review, where we need not only to upscale the innovative work that is already being done by UK technologies, but to provide the skills and the supply chain to ensure that we can continue to deliver, learning the lessons from what we are seeing in Ukraine, in particular.
