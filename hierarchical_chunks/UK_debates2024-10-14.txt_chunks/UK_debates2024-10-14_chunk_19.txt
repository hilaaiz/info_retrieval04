I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place; it is a great job being shadow Minister for the Armed Forces, as I know.
If I may say so politely, the reason there is severe financial pressure on us is that this Government were left with a £22 billion financial black hole by his party.
Let me be clear: supporting our armed forces to train to be the best, to deter aggression and to defeat it if necessary is a priority for this Government.
Despite the economic circumstances his party passed on to mine, we are taking steps to ensure that our armed forces have what they need.
