I have said that the strategic defence review will place people at its heart, and we will place people at the heart of our defence plans.
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right; we follow 14 years of the previous Government’s recruitment targets for all forces being missed every year.
We have a recruitment crisis and a retention crisis.
No plan for the future can deal with that without sorting out recruitment.
May I wholly concur with your tribute to the late Alex Salmond, Mr Speaker?
A critical element of the strategic defence review will be the defence of our overseas territories.
The Foreign Secretary told the House last week that the deal with Mauritius over the Chagos islands has been concluded.
To save us waiting until next year, will the Defence Secretary tell us today how much have we offered to pay Mauritius over 99 years for the privilege of our renting back a military facility that belongs to us in first the place?
Crucially, which Department will pay that bill: the Ministry of Defence or the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office?
The Foreign Secretary said in his statement that full details will be properly set out when the treaty comes before the House.
At that point, the House can scrutinise the deal and approve it or not.
Let me make it clear that we inherited a situation in which the long-standing UK-US military base was put at risk from problems to do with sovereignty and migration.
We have made a historic deal that secures the UK-US base for the future, which is why my counterpart the US Defence Secretary so strongly welcomed it when we reached it.
