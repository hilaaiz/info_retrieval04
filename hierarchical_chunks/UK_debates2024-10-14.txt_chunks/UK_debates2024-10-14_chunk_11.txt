I will indeed.
If the hon.
Gentleman could be so kind as to send me the executive summary, rather than the full report, I will certainly take a look  at it.
What recent estimate his Department has made of the percentage of Russia’s gross domestic product spent on its armed forces in each year since the invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s declared total military expenditure was around 4.7% of GDP in 2022.
In 2023 it was 5.9% of GDP, and the forecast spending this year is up to around 7% of GDP.
As the right hon.
Gentleman knows very well, the public figures almost certainly do not tell the full story about Russian expenditure.
I am grateful to the Secretary of State for putting that on the record.
Does that frightening set of figures not show the scale of the problem and the weight of attack that Russia can bring to bear against Ukraine?
How are we doing with the double demand on our resources—the need to both supply Ukraine with hardware and ammunition, and replenish our stocks of hardware and ammunition in order to fulfil our NATO security requirements?
The right hon.
Gentleman describes the double challenge of continuing to support Ukraine and replenishing our stockpiles, particularly of the weapons, ammunition and systems that we have gifted to Ukraine.
The Government already have £1 billion-worth of contracts for replenishing UK stockpiles across a range of systems, and I can tell him that around 60% of the contracted production will be in the UK.
That is the way we strengthen Britain’s security for the future, but also strengthen Britain’s economic growth and prosperity.
