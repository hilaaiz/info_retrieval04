Thousands of children of armed forces personnel face unaffordable increases to their school fees because of this Government’s ideological decision to charge VAT on education.
That could have the perverse effect of forcing experienced personnel to quit the service of their country just when we should be seeking to maximise retention.
Will the Minister therefore confirm that children of armed forces families will be exempt from the new VAT rise, and furthermore that that exemption will apply from January when the new tax kicks in?
We recognise the extraordinary strain that is sometimes placed on the family of armed forces personnel, including their children.
That is why the continuity of education allowance—an important part of the package that reflects and respects the service—is in place, and it is why we are looking very closely at options to ensure we continue with that.
Earlier this month, a Royal Navy investigation found intolerable misogyny in the submarine service,  following complaints of bullying and sexual harassment.
Forward Assist, a charity based in my constituency that supports survivors, has done research and a number of reports into the prevalence and impact of military sexual trauma.
Will the Secretary of State meet me and that charity to discuss its findings, and how we can support serving personnel and veterans?
I would love to visit that charity with my hon.
Friend in due course.
Any reports of misogyny or wrongdoing in any way are utterly unacceptable.
That is why since entering government we have started a programme of raising our standards with a plan to enact cultural change across defence, with the aim of making defence the best place to work across Government.
