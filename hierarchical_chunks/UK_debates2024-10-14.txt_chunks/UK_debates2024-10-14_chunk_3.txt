The Prime Minister commissioned the strategic defence review within two weeks of taking office.
It will ensure that the UK is secure at home and strong abroad, both now and in years to come.
The review is the first of its  kind in the UK, and I am very grateful to Lord Robertson, General Sir Richard Barrons and Fiona Hill, our three external lead reviewers.
They will make their final report to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and me in the first half of 2025.
I will report the SCR to Parliament.
