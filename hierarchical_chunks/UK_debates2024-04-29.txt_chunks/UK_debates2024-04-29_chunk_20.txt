I thank my right hon.
Friend, who is doing exceptional work to raise awareness of the impacts of SYNGAP1, and has so far raised over £29,000 to support vital research.
As he has pointed out, we are investing record amounts in special educational needs and disability funding.
We review that funding and look at the formula every year; it has gone up by 60% over the past five years—to £10.5 billion—but I am very happy to meet my right hon.
Friend, and look forward to doing so.
We said we would have a cup of tea to talk about this important topic, and I will get that date in the diary soon.
