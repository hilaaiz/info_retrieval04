I thank the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State for their comments about the incident at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in my constituency last week.
There is obviously now a criminal investigation ongoing and a charge of attempted murder, so it would not be wise to speculate, but as education is devolved in Wales,
will the Secretary of State pledge to work with the Welsh Government to ensure safety measures, following the various investigations having completed their work?
