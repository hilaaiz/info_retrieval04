I thank the Education Secretary for all the support that her Department is giving to Bracknell Forest, particularly the £16 million safety valve programme and other SEN initiatives.
Given the high number of good and outstanding schools in Bracknell  and the focus on apprenticeships and T-levels at Bracknell and Wokingham College, might I tempt her please to visit?
