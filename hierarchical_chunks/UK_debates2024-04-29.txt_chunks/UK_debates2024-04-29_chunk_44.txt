I thank the Minister for his responses.
I very much welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement last week about the extra defence spending.
It is important that we support innocent victims who cannot protect themselves.
The UK’s role in the middle east is much appreciated, acclaimed and respected.
Does the Minister agree that in response to recent increased Iranian threats, for instance with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps being responsible for Hamas terrorist attacks across Gaza and the broader middle east, we must do whatever we can within our budget to encourage de-escalation and to try to prevent further attacks by Iran and its supporters?
