The Cass review has established that social transitioning is not a neutral act, and that it introduces significant risk of harm.
Does the Secretary of State agree with me that when a new First Minister emerges in Scotland, they should commit to factual, science-based education in schools and implement the Cass review findings in full, so they do not suffer the same fate as their predecessor?
I would encourage our friends and colleagues in the Scottish Government, whoever they may be at the time, to pay close attention to Hilary Cass’s report.
I think her work has injected some much-needed common sense into the debate, and we are very grateful to her.
This Government will always put the safety of our children first, and that is why the gender questioning guidance we have produced in draft is underpinned by the important principle of parents always being involved in decisions about their children.
The Liberal Democrat-run council in Rutland has announced that it will close our specialist—and “outstanding” rated—SEND nursery, the Parks School.
This comes with the further news that it is also going to close our only leisure centre.
The community is rightly devastated, especially parents who want their children to get the best and most expert support.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that specialist provision must be protected and is absolutely vital, and that the need for this kind of provision is only going to increase?
