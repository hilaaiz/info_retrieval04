I thank my hon.
Friend, who is absolutely right.
We have been hearing negative things about Lib Dem councils from both sides of the House this afternoon, which, sadly, is not surprising.
She is absolutely right to be championing the needs of those parents and children, and I hope the council will listen to her campaign and do the right thing.
