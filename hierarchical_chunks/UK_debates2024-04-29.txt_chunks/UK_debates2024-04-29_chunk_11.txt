It is right that young people can recognise and denounce antisemitism and it is also right that they know something of the history of the region, including the continued expansion of illegal settlements.
But I hope the Minister agrees that right-wing rhetoric and Islamophobia also pose a threat to our young people.
What steps are being taken to ensure that both antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate are treated with equal severity, especially given some of the Islamophobic remarks that have been made by Members and former Members of his own party?
The hon.
Lady is right to call out the wickedness of Islamophobia.
There have been Islamophobic incidents in schools as well, and Tell MAMA is an important resource in that regard.
We will not tolerate anti-Muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out whenever and wheresoever it occurs.
Ms Anum Qaisar is not here to ask the next question, but will the Minister give an answer so that I can bring in the Opposition Front Bencher?
What recent discussions she has had with her counterparts in the devolved Administrations on the potential merits of providing additional financial support to school pupils in the context of increases in the cost of living.
Ministers normally meet colleagues from the devolved Governments, as we were just discussing a moment ago.
The Education Ministers Council was due to be hosted by the Scottish Government in late 2023, but, although we have been watching our doormats, no invitation has arrived.
The UK Government are providing £108 billion over 2022-23 to 2024-25 to help with the cost of living.
