I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and for all of his work on this area.
I know that he has been integral to the “I am a Housebuilder” campaign to encourage more women into the building sector.
Our apprenticeship diversity champions network is supporting gender representation among employers, and it is good news that STEM starts continue to increase year on year—up 7.5% in the last year—but there is more to do, and I look forward to working closely with him on the issue.
