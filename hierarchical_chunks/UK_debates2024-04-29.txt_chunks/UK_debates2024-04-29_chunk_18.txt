I thank the Minister for his response, but what he says about the state of school funding is not the full picture, and he knows it.
Schools’ costs have increased much faster than funding.
In fact, analysis by the National Education Union shows that every single school in Nottingham East had less real-terms funding last year than 14 years ago—that is £1,266 less per pupil on average.
If the Government really cared about the future of children and young people, should they not be funding high-quality education instead of whipping up culture wars?
