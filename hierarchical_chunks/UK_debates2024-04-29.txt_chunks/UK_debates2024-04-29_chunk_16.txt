I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his words welcoming me to my post.
The point I would make is that the 2023 cycle shows numbers rebalancing and returning to a trend of normal growth in applications following the pandemic.
He should also look at the big impact nursing apprenticeships and nursing degree apprenticeships are having on the system.
I am always happy to meet him to discuss these issues, but we do think it is a fairer and more affordable system for both students and taxpayers, and will result in more people being able to access a world-class higher education in our country.
