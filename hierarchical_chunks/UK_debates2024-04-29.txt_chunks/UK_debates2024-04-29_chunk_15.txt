I welcome the Minister to his place; it is good to see him in his new role.
Of course, we miss the former Minister,  the right hon.
Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) .
As my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi)  put it so eloquently, we are in real danger of dissuading and disenfranchising so many young people from getting into the sorts of careers in which they are interested, and particularly into roles such as nursing.
I reiterate that point, because we have seen a 7.3% decline in the numbers of applications for nursing.
At a time when we desperately need more in our health service, what is the Minister doing?
Does he really think this system, which was introduced ahead of his joining the education team, is a fair one?
