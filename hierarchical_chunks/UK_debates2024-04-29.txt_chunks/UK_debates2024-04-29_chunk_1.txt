We will all know somebody with special educational needs or disabilities and understand how vital it is to get a child with special educational needs or disabilities the right support early on.
In recent years, we have seen a massive increase in special educational needs in our country, which is why we have expanded funding to a record level—at £10.5 billion, up by 60% in the last five years—and why we are reforming the system to deal with the increase in demand, including the biggest investment in building special educational needs school places in our country’s history.
Children in Lewisham are waiting on average two and a half years to get an autism diagnosis.
This is wrong and unacceptable.
It is also a national issue, but it is made worse by a shortage of clinical staff.
The Government are failing to recognise the seriousness of the shortage of educational psychologists.
Can the Secretary of State tell me why they have failed and what is being done to recruit more educational psychologists as well as to tackle education, health and care plan waiting times?
