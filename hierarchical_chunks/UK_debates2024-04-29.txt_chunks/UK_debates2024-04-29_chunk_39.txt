I commend the Government’s determination to get aid into Gaza, and I commend the work of the RAF, RFA Cardigan Bay, UK planners and the Hydrographic Office.
As the Minister is aware, I would not expect him to comment on speculation, but some of the best laid and best intentioned plans can run into problems.
Can he assure the House that we would only ever contemplate putting UK boots on the pier if appropriate force protection was in place?
I am grateful to the Chair of the Select Committee, who speaks with characteristic expertise.
He is absolutely right that it would be improper for me, as a Government Minister, to comment on that speculation.
