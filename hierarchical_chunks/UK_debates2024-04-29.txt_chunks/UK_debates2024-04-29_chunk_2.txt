I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
Around half of new EHCPs were issued within the statutory time limit of 20 weeks, and some local authorities are delivering over 90%, but of course we recognise that the system is under pressure, post both the pandemic and the massive rise in demand for special educational needs support.
That is why we have increased the budget and put an improvement plan in place.
With regard to her question about educational psychologists, we are training 400 more, which is a big increase.
