The Secretary of State described special educational needs as “lose, lose, lose” when she was describing the process of parents appealing the judgments of education, health and care plans, which, as I said earlier, often lists a school that is inadequate.
How does she expect parents to get the right school if they are not to appeal, and who has broken the system in the last 14 years?
It was not like that before.
I was actually referring to the fact that parents did not feel they were receiving the best service from the system, the schools did not feel they were giving the best service and the Government felt they were spending a lot more, which is why it was very important that we got a grip and fixed the system.
Of course, we know that there has been a massive increase in demand over the last few years—not even 14 years—so we have had to put in place the special educational needs and alternative provision improvement plan, which is very thorough.
I believe that the result of that plan will be: win, win, win.
What steps is the Department taking to make apprenticeships in building trades more attractive to young people, and especially to women and girls?
