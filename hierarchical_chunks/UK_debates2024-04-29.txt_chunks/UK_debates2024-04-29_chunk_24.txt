Deepfake images and nudification apps pose massive threats to the mental health of girls in particular, and therefore their educational outcomes.
I am pleased that the Government have taken steps to criminalise the creation of such images, but how is the Secretary of State working with Cabinet colleagues to put pressure on internet companies to take the radical action necessary to remove such images, which can have such an impact on girls’ education?
The hon.
Member is of course right that the lead is taken by a different Department, but we are very conscious of the pressures, including from social media, in relation to pornography, deepfake and nudification, as she rightly identifies, and we are working right across Government to make sure those pressures can be eased.
Bearing out feedback from my two excellent local Conservative councils, a recent report from the organisation London Councils highlights a 4.3% drop in the number of pupils in schools in Hillingdon.
At a time of falling numbers on rolls in outer London, will my hon.
Friend commit to work with our schools and local authorities to promote the opportunities for more inclusion for SEND pupils in mainstream schools?
My hon.
Friend makes two important points.
There was a 6% decline in the number of nought to four-year-olds between 2015 and 2021, and we are providing £242 million in this financial year to support schools with managing that.
He is also right that although some children will always need a special school place to have their needs met, many can have their needs met in a mainstream school.
Through our SEND and alternative provision improvement plan, we are making sure that schools are inclusive and make that happen.
