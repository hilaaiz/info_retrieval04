I thank my right hon.
Friend for that very positive response.
In 2011-12, only 63% of children in my borough of Bexley met the expected standard of reading.
Now, after the evidence-based reforms from this Conservative Government, that number is 81%—a real achievement.
There is still much more to be done, but does she share my disappointment that the Labour party opposed those reforms at every opportunity?
