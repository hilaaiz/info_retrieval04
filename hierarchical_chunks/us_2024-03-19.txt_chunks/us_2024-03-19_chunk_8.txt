Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, the Virginia General Assembly proclaimed March 28th as James Solomon Russell Day.
Today, I use to honor his legacy and incredible contributions to our Commonwealth.
Born enslaved in 1857, James Solomon Russell's life journey exemplifies resilience and determination.
After receiving his teaching license in Warren County, North Carolina, and beginning to teach in the area, he attended Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in 1874.
However, due to financial difficulties, he was unable to complete his studies and returned to teach in Warren County.

He dedicated himself to uplifting his community and worked among Zion Union members in Brunswick County.
His tireless efforts included the establishment of schools, senior housing, and the founding of Saint Paul's College in 1888.
Through his leadership, thousands of African American youth were empowered to pursue education, becoming beacons of progress across the Commonwealth.
Despite closing its doors in 2013, James Solomon Russell's indelible mark at Saint Paul's College is kept alive at the James Solomon Russell--Saint Paul's College Museum and Archives in Lawrenceville, Virginia.
I commend the James Solomon Russell Commemoration Committee and the Saint Paul's College Museum Committee for spearheading the community effort to open the museum to the public in 2019.
Moreover, I extend my deepest appreciation to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture Robert F. Smith Center for the Digitization and Curation of African American History.
Their collaboration with the James Solomon Russell--
Saint Paul's College Museum and Archives is invaluable.
The Center's expertise in archiving and digitizing historical records ensures that Russell's story, along with the rich
