Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill to clarify certain due process rights of federal employees serving in sensitive positions.
This bill would overturn an unprecedented federal court decision, Kaplan v. Conyers and MSPB, that stripped many federal employees of the light to independent review of an agency decision removing them from their jobs on grounds of ineligibility.
The case was brought by two Department of Defense (DOD) employees, Rhonda Conyers, an accounting technician, and Devon Northover, a commissary management specialist, who were permanently demoted and suspended from their jobs after they were found to be no longer eligible to serve in noncritical sensitive positions.
In 2014, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, which allowed the decision to stand.
This bill is cosponsored by
