Representative Andre Carson.
Specifically, the decision prevents federal employees who are designated as ``noncritical sensitive'' from appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board if they are removed from their jobs.
Noncritical sensitive jobs include those that do not have access to classified information.
The decision affects at least 200,000 DOD employees who are designated as noncritical sensitive.
Even more concerning is that most federal employees could potentially lose the right to an independent review of an agency's decision because of a rule issued by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that permits agency heads to designate most jobs in the federal government as noncritical sensitive, which went into effect in July 2015.
The decision undercuts Title 5, section 7701 of the Civil Service Act, which ensures due process rights for federal workers, as required by the Constitution.
Stripping employees whose work does not involve classified matters of the right to an independent review of an agency decision that removes them from their jobs opens entirely new avenues for unreviewable, arbitrary action or retaliation by an agency head.
This bill would stop the use of ``national security'' to undo a vital component of civil service protection and of due process.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
