Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Douglas G. Lee on his exceptional decade of service as President of Waynesburg University.
He assumed the office on July 1, 2013.
President Lee devoted the past decade to improving the educational experience for students and serving the Waynesburg, Pennsylvania community.
He managed a $32 million revitalization of the Paul R. Stewart Science Hall and successfully implemented a health and safety plan that allowed students to remain on campus throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
His efforts ensured continued academic excellence and a safe environment for the university's thriving student population.
A Waynesburg University alumnus himself, President Lee graduated from the university in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science degree in business.
His loyalty to the institution deepens his connection to the school's faith, academic mission, and focus on the community.
President Lee continues to serve the university and Pennsylvania's academic community as secretary and treasurer of the Association of Independent Colleges & Universities.
He also serves on the NCAA Division III Board of Governors to help student athletes grow their academic and athletic character.
The Greene County Chamber of Commerce awarded President Lee the Distinguished Service Award to recognize his contributions to the university and community.
President Lee lives out his faith as an elder at his church, a board member of several local charities, and a loving husband and father.
