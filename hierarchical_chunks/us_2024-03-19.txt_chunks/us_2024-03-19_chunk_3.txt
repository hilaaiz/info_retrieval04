Ms. Barrera's parents ended up with nothing saved for retirement after running their restaurant for 20 years.
This motivated her to use her personal experience and academic training to support both small businesses and working families.
In 1994, 
Ms. Barrera founded Accion Texas (later renamed LiftFund) with the commitment to provide small businesses with sorely needed financial support through microloans and ongoing guidance as they navigated complex financial systems.
Today, LiftFund has over 100 employees and has disbursed close to $500 million to small business owners in underserved communities, particularly people of color and low- and moderate-income individuals.
