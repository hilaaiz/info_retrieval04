He formerly served as Executive Pastor for the Luke Church in Texas, where he provided leadership to staff, associate ministers, and diaconate.
As a devoted father and dedicated pastor to the congregants of Central Baptist Church, Rev. Riley has consistently answered the call of public service.
In 2022, Rev Riley earned his Doctorate of Ministry degree in Leadership and Preaching at Virginia Union University's School.
Within his education and ministry, Rev. Riley has strived to establish holistic practices for the next generation of ministers.
His goal of teaching and unifying our communities of faith distinguishes him as a leader for all people.
