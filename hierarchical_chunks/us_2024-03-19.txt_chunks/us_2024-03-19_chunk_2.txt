Mr. CASAR.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to call the attention of the House in celebration of a true Texas visionary, 
Ms. Janie Barrera, for decades of work to provide small business owners and working families with the means to achieve their dreams.
A native of Corpus Christi and a sixth-generation Texan, Ms. Barrera's entrepreneurial spirit began in her youth.
At the age of 12, after her mother denied her request to purchase a new bicycle, Janie went door-to-door selling raffle tickets for her old bicycle and used the proceeds to purchase a new one.
Later, as a waitress in her parents' restaurant, 
Ms. Barrera witnessed both the hard work and the great financial risks of running a small business.
After high school, 
Ms. Barrera became a nun and joined a local covenant.
She ran the Telecommunications Center for the Diocese of Corpus Christi for 15 years.
When a bishop told 
Ms. Barrera that she couldn't get a promotion because of her lack of business experience, she pursued a Master of Business Administration from the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio, Texas.
She left the covenant shortly after graduation.
