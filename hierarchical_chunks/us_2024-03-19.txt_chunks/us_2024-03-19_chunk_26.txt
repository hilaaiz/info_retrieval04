Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Julie Shambarger for the incredible work she has done to revitalize downtown Rochester, Indiana, by spearheading the effort to refurbish and reopen The Times Theater in Rochester.
As is the case with so many venues on Main Streets across America, The Times Theater was an iconic symbol of Main Street Rochester before closing its doors in 2014.
Rather than accept The Times Theater's apparent fate as a project of the past, Julie Shambarger poured her heart and soul into the mission and welcome visitors once again.
Guided by her belief that The Times Theater could be restored as the vibrant heart of the Rochester community, Julie marshalled the effort to acquire the grants and donations needed to renovate The Times Theater so its reopening could be not only a possibility, but a reality.
Today, The Times Theater is host to not only movies but also live music and community events, and it has welcomed over 9,000 guests since reopening last February.
It has elevated the cultural landscape of Rochester and been a beacon of artistic innovation and creative expression.
At a time when many of America's social and civic ties are fraying, places like The Times Theater--places the community can take pride in and congregate at--are all the more important.
I and so many other Hoosiers are immensely grateful to Julie Shambarger for the dedicated and diligent work she has done to bring more energy and life back to downtown Rochester and all of Fulton County.
I look forward to visiting The Times Theater again soon and seeing how Julie Shambarger's efforts will continue to pay dividends in the years ahead.
