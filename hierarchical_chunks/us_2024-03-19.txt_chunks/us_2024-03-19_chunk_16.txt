Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Zarir F. Bhandara, a resident of Irvine and Ervad of the Zoroastrian Temple in the City of Orange, for his dedication to inspiring his community with his spiritual leadership.
Ervad Bhandara has dedicated his life to promoting the message of the Zoroastrian founding prophet, Zarathustra, through prayers, religious classes, and pastoral services.
As a leader of the Zoroastrian community, Ervad Bhandara provides his communities in Orange and Irvine with support, guidance, mentorship, and motivation.
During COVID-19, Ervad Bhandara served his community by visiting hospitals and providing food, counseling, and financial assistance to those in need.
As a way to keep his community connected during trying times, Ervad Bhandara live-streamed prayers with messages of Peace, Unity, Harmony, and Hope, reaching hundreds of people quarantining at home.
Since 2020, Ervad Bhandara has donated his platelets and plasma over 545 times, helping save over 1,635 American lives.
