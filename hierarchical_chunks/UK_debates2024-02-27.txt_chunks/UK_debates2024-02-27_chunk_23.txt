Last week, the Scottish Government announced £24.5 million of public investment in a new cable factory, which will attract a further £350 million of inward investment.
Does the Secretary of State agree that the best way to increase private investment is for the Government to increase public investment, to signal that the UK is open to green investment?
Should not the UK Government therefore invest at least £28 billion a year, so that we can maximise private investment, and so that economic growth from the green transition is also maximised?
As I said, our record on net zero investment is incredibly strong.
In fact, I believe the CBI had a report out this morning showing that our net zero sectors have been growing by 9% in the last year.
We have set out plans for further investment, whether that is in grid connections, supply chain investment through our Gigafund, or reforming capital allowance.
All those things, and not public sector investment alone, attract private investment to this country.
