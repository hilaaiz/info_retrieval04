In the UK, electricity standing charges will balloon by 12%, meaning that people in Scotland who were paying £90 a year in 2021-22 will soon need to find £216 a year—a 138% increase under this Tory Government.

If costs and charges were redistributed to the unit price, consumers would be empowered to pursue reduced usage, knowing that that would translate into lower bills.

Standing charges, as I mentioned, are a matter for Ofgem.
However, Ofgem has listened to public sentiment, and it has recently launched a call for input on standing charges.

What steps she is taking to help increase private sector investment in green technologies.
