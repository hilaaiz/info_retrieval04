I thank my hon.
Friend for his continuing interest in this issue.
The REMA programme is considering a number of options, including sending more efficient locational signals, which I know he is very knowledgeable about, zonal pricing, reform to transmission charging and changes to network access.
The second round of the consultation is imminent.
