I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
As he will know, the Government delivered over £40 billion in support last winter.
We expect the warm home discount to support around 3 million households this winter, with the final figures to be published later.
Since 2011, the warm home discount has delivered over £3.5 billion in support for eligible low-income households.
