I thank my hon.
Friend for recently welcoming me to Carshalton and Wallington.
Wholesale energy prices have fallen significantly since last winter, but we are committed to supporting businesses with their energy bills.
Last winter alone, we delivered about £7.4 billion to support businesses, covering nearly half of many businesses’ wholesale energy costs.
We are continuing the energy bills discount scheme to support eligible businesses with high energy costs until they can take advantage of lower wholesale prices.
