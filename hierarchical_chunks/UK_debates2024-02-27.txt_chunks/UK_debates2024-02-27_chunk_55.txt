I welcome all that the Government have been doing, including on Brimstone and the package of £245 million-worth of ammunition.
However, may I ask specifically about 155 mm shells and the BAE Systems production line?
Has it now got the orders to ensure that it is working at maximum capacity, on a war footing, to produce all it can to support Ukraine and indeed, in due course, our own stockpiles?
