I thank the hon.
Lady for that question, but I am surprised that she did not welcome the recent news that the UK was the first country in the G20 to halve its emissions since the 1990s, as I know that subject is dear to her heart.
As I have said, in 2023, the UK saw around £60 billion of low-carbon private and public investment.
We got that extraordinary success  by encouraging private investment.
Whether through the contracts for difference scheme, our new policies on capital allowances, or the effect of the green industries growth accelerator on the supply chain, the UK is doing everything it can to attract investment, and that is exactly why we have made those achievements.
