I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
As he will know, I cannot comment on a specific proposal.
We need to rewire this country in order to have homegrown energy.
That means hosting new infrastructure, with the presumption that it is above ground and done in a way that minimises negative impacts on food security, which I am confident that any proposals that come forward will do.
Let us make no mistake: we must rewire this country.
We must power the UK more from this country, clean up our energy and reduce our dependence on foreign fossil fuels.
