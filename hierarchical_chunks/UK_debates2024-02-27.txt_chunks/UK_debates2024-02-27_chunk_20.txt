I thank my right hon.
Friend for that answer.
Harmony Energy based in Knaresborough opened Europe’s largest battery farm in Yorkshire in 2022.
It has raised the issue of connectivity challenges being a blockage to investment, so I welcome the connections action plan, which aims to cut connection times by up to 90%.
Battery farms are critical for energy retention and storage, and are particularly helpful for renewables, so may I ask my right hon.
Friend for an update on how the plan is being implemented?
