I thank the Minister for writing to me about one of my concerns, which is litigation costs.
I think new clause 3 looks at that.
He has reassured me that what is in this Bill will go the distance in ensuring that leaseholders are not subject to unjust litigation costs by their landlord.
That is one of the cases highlighted by Liam Spender and many others.
These are hugely complex issues, but we must tackle them.
