I thank my hon.
Friend for her doughty campaigning for nuclear—she is our very own atomic kitten.
We are very positive about nuclear and have set out plans for the largest expansion of nuclear for 70 years.
Overall that will be a good thing for people’s energy bills and the energy security of this country.
