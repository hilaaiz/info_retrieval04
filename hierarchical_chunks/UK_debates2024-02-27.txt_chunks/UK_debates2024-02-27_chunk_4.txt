The Secretary of State was asked— What recent assessment her Department has made of the potential merits of introducing a social energy tariff.
What recent assessment her Department has made of the potential merits of introducing a social energy tariff.
Energy prices are now at their lowest level for two years, with a typical bill set to drop by £238 by April.
Our cost of living package totals over £104 billion, or £3,700 per household on average, over 2022 to 2025.
We are supporting those most in need, with millions of vulnerable households receiving up to £900 in cost of living payments.
Some of us believe in preventative spending.
A House of Commons Library briefing last year estimated that the annual cost to the national health service of treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing is £1.4 billion.
When wider  societal costs are considered, that figure rises to £15.4 billion.
Will the Secretary of State confirm whether the introduction of a social energy tariff would cost less than £15.4 billion?
A social tariff means lots of things to different people, but we are supporting vulnerable people with the cost of their energy bills.
We supported them last winter, paying on average a half of everybody’s energy bills, and we have made additional payments of £900 to support people.
Since 2010, we have increased the proportion of homes that are energy-efficient and insulated to 50%, up from 14%.
