I thank the Minister for his answer.
New nuclear holds the key not only to ensuring energy security but to creating thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs in the areas where it is located, but too often the planning process can take years, even on sites where there is long-established nuclear use.
Has he discussed with ministerial colleagues what can be done to shorten that process significantly?
