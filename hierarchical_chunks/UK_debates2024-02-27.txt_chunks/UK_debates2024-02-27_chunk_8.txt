A year ago, the then Energy Secretary said that if suppliers had wrongly installed prepayment meters in any home, they would have to recompense their customers for the way they had behaved.
One year later, can the Minister tell the House how many individuals who had a prepayment meter wrongly installed have had compensation, how many are yet to receive it and, of those still waiting, when they will get the compensation?
One thing on which we can all agree across the House is that it was absolutely abhorrent that people had prepayment meters forced on them.
We are working our way through the compensation, but I can assure Members that we are doing everything we can to ensure that, when prepayment meters are installed, we are doing exactly the right thing to make sure that everybody is kept safe.
I asked the Minister three questions but did not get an answer to any of them.
Perhaps she can put the figures in the House of Commons Library, because she clearly does not have a clue what they are.
More than 3 million households are in debt to their energy suppliers and almost 10 million households are living in cold, damp and poorly insulated homes.
The Great British insulation scheme is proving to be a great Tory insulation fiasco.
Will the Minister tell me why the insulation scheme is proving to be such a disaster?
We have taken great steps to support people.
For example, last winter we gave unprecedented support to households and businesses.
Of course, debt is a major concern, and I have regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure that we are doing the very best not only to get people out of debt, but to prevent them getting into debt in the first place.
