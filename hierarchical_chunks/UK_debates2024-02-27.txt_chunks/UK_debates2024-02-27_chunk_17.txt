I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
Obviously, I do not know the detail of the case he raised, but I am very happy to meet him following questions to look at it in more detail.
Despite what I said about the quasi-judicial role of Ministers in planning applications, it is really important that all concerns are addressed and looked at, and that the planning application system is thorough, robust and transparent.
