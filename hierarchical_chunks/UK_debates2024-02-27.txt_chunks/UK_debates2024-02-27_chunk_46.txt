I welcome the news that Ofgem has put the price cap down by 12%, which represents a discount of about £20 for every average home.
There is one problem, though: the standing charge is still relatively high.
I know there is an open consultation, but would the Government consider transparency about the standing charge on bills so that the public understand exactly what it does?
