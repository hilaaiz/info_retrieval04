Ukraine is on the frontline, not only of its own battles, but of those of international democracy and law.
We cannot leave the Ukrainians without in a time of need.
Their fight is our fight, so let us look at what the UK Government can do.
We must not allow Putin’s plan to wait until the international community loses interest to succeed.
Will the UK Government prepare an International Criminal Court case against Russia for its bombardment of civilians in Ukraine?
What more can the UK Government do to ensure the safety of Ukrainian skies, and to ensure a united and collective western effort in continued support of Ukraine?
Once again, I am grateful for the hon.
Gentleman’s support and that of the SNP in ensuring that we have this strong consensus across the House in support of the Ukrainians.
As he said, their fight is our fight—I strongly agree.
He is also right about the ICC.
As for where the Ministry of Defence is focused, he makes an important point about the threat in the air.
As I said, air defence has been crucial, but of course that fight takes many forms; we need to look at not only ground-to-air systems, but drones, which have proliferated and had an extraordinary impact.
We know that we cannot provide the F-16, which is the Ukrainians’ fighter of choice, but we have done what we can by providing the elementary flying training and I absolutely assure him that we will do everything we can.
