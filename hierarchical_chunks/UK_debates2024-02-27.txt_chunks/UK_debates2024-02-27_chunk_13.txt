I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question, and reassure her that we take all those concerns incredibly seriously.
I am very happy to meet her and any other Member of Parliament who has concerns about the plans being put forward in their constituency.
As I have said, it is really important that everybody—from Members of Parliament through to those in the community who are affected by or have concerns about plans—can engage with the planning process at every stage.
We will do what we can to address those concerns while meeting our ambitious target of deploying 70 GW of solar by 2035.
