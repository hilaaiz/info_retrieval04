Mr. Bowers has stated that for any community to progress and move forward we all must take an interest in improving the welfare of our fellow citizens.
Not only has he led by that example for decades, but he has helped establish a foundation in the community that would ensure future generations, regardless of where they were from or the challenges they face so that they have the appropriate educational, economic, and social opportunities needed to achieve success.
