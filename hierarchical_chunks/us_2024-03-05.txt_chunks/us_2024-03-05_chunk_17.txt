Mr. Threets took to social media to discuss the vital emotional health resources and educational services that libraries provide.
He wanted to ensure people knew that libraries are not just places with books but offer something for everyone.
Through his social media posts, Mr. Threets shared stories about the vital role libraries play in people's lives and the ``library joy'' he sees in action every day.
Mr. Threets used his viral social media presence to spread kindness and inspire American youth to fall in love with reading and libraries, just as he did.
For his advocacy and outspoken love of libraries, 
Mr. Threets was one of 10 librarians across the country to win the I Love
My Librarian Award for Public Service.
While 
Mr. Threets will be stepping away from his role in the Solano County Library, I know he will continue striving to improve the Solano community and increase literacy rates for young children.
I look forward to seeing his work to expand access to educational resources and make our communities more inclusive.
