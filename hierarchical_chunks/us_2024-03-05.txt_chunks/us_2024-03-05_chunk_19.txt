Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is in the spirit of bereavement that I rise to recognize the remarkable life of former Florida State 
Senator Betty Holzendorf.
As a dedicated public servant, community leader, and advocate for social justice, her impact on the city of Jacksonville and the great State of Florida and its people will be felt for generations to come.
