Mr. Ellison Capers ``E.C.'' Grayson, Jr. and offer my sympathy to his family.
E.C. Grayson, born in 1928 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, was known for his vibrant personality, dedication to family and friends, and lifelong commitment to civil service.
From his early achievements as an Eagle Scout, student leader, and athlete, to his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy, serving during the Korean war and as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, and later as a successful CEO and leader, E.C. left a lasting impact on all who knew him, celebrated in a Memorial Mass on March 1, 2024, in Tiburon, California.
We deeply appreciate his exemplary service and personal courage, which epitomized the highest traditions of Navy service.
I include in the Record the following obituary for E.C. Grayson, Jr.:
