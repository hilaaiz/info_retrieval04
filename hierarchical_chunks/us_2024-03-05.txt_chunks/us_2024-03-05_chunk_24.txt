Mr. RYAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the return of the Shen Yun Performing Arts Company to the David H. Koch theater at Lincoln Center in New York City in April 2024.
Shen Yun Performing Arts was established in New York in 2006 and has become a worldwide phenomenon as they travel to 180 cities every year to perform.
Millions of people travel to see this unique performance time and time again and with the development of new dances each year, the performers, choreographers, and conductors continually develop an amazing show for all to enjoy.
The ancient Chinese traditions that are rooted in virtue, faith, and moral values are brought to life in the performances that feature dancing and singing with performers wearing intricate costumes.
Artistic freedom is essential to a society and Shen Yun expresses that ideal in the face of continued opposition from the Chinese government.
I had the privilege of meeting many members of the Shen Yun community located in my distict and watched the performance in Washington, D.C.
It was a huge honor to see such talent.
I want to thank the members of Shen Yun for their great success thus far and wish them all the best performing at Lincoln Center.
