Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I introduce the Washington, D.C. Area Helicopter Noise Information Exchange Act, which would require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to create and implement a helicopter noise-sharing mechanism for all helicopter operators in the National Capital Region (NCR) and to make such mechanism accessible to the public online.
I got this bill included in the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act (H.R. 3935), which the House passed last year.
Residents of the NCR have been plagued by helicopter noise for years.
Yet, there is no centralized complaint system nor any comprehensive data about helicopter noise in the NCR Helicopter noise can harm health, quality of life, and the structural integrity of homes.
In 2019, I led members of the NCR in requesting that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study helicopter noise in the NCR.
In 2021, GAO recommended that the FAA implement a noise sharing mechanism for helicopter operators in the NCR.
In 2022, the FAA initiated a pilot program with a private company to create a helicopter noise sharing mechanism in the NCR.
After the end of the pilot program, Fairfax and Arlington Counties contracted with the private company to maintain such a mechanism solely for Northern Virginia.
However, the company is not required to share the collected data with any jurisdictions, other than those in Northern Virginia, or the public.
The FAA must be involved in the collection and analysis of helicopter noise data in the NCR to effectively address the impacts on the public, and the public has a right to know the source of the noise.
This bill would direct the creation of a more effective information sharing mechanism, which would allow for better, more comprehensive data on helicopter noise complaints.
This data would in turn help us develop solutions to address helicopter noise.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
