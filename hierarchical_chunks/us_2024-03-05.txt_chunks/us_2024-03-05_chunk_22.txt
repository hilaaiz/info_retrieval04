Senator Holzendorf's passion for justice and equality was matched only by her unwavering determination to create positive change.
After four years in the Florida House, she served with distinction in the Florida State Senate from 1992 to 2002, where her leadership earned her the respect and admiration of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
Beyond her legislative accomplishments, 
Senator Holzendorf was a pillar of her community, known for her kindness, compassion, and incredible cooking.
Her impact extended far beyond the boundaries of Tallahassee and Jacksonville, truly touching the lives of countless individuals throughout Florida.
My heart is with 
Senator Holzendorf's family during this time of mourning.
May they find solace in knowing that her legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of all who had the privilege of knowing her, and may her memory be for a blessing.
