Mr. Bowers grew up in Bascom, FL, the 11th of 13 children.
In describing his upbringing, 
Mr. Bowers considered himself a ``country boy,'' and often recalls the lessons of hard work and ``making a difference'' which his parents instilled in him and his siblings.
This foundation inspired a call to service in the U.S. Army and later, his decades of community service within the Tampa Bay community.
After returning from military service, 
Mr. Bowers moved to Tampa, Florida, eventually settling in a little community called Progress Village.
He went on to study at the University of Tampa, Tampa Bible College and Florida Theological Seminary & Bible College.
