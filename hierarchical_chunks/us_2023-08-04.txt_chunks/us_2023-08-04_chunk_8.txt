Ms. Kim also contributed to many CRS-wide managerial initiatives, including playing an integral role in managing the public release of CRS products and working to increase diversity and inclusion at CRS, including through her efforts to establish a relationship between CRS and the Rangel/Payne summer internship program.
In all of these managerial posts, 
Ms. Kim demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and mentored countless new analysts and younger colleagues, leaving a lasting imprint and legacy of excellence and service on the CRS workforce.
Please join me in expressing the gratitude of this body, and its appreciation on behalf of the American people, to 
Ms. Kim for more than three decades of service to CRS and the U.S. Congress.
Alongside her CRS colleagues, family, and friends, we congratulate 
Ms. Kim on a storied and impactful career and on a well-deserved retirement.
