Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish David City, Nebraska a very happy 150th birthday.
August 6, 1873 marks the day David City was made the county seat of Butler County.
Since 1873, David City has grown and distinguished itself in many ways.
Providing an excellent quality of life for their small town with exceptional education and job opportunities.
While David City is home to just about 3,000, it's the birthplace of notable people--like former U.S. 
Senator Roman Hruska; the founder of Hallmark cards, Joyce Hall; and Catholic Bishop Kenneth Steiner.
Major employers in the City include Timpte, ADM, and David City Public Schools among others.
David City is proud of its Catholic roots.
Aquinas Catholic Schools educates many of the town's people and St. Mary's Church is almost as old as the town itself.
As David City reaches this sesquicentennial birthday, there is much to celebrate.
On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I congratulate David City on 150 years and wish them fun as they celebrate this incredible milestone.
