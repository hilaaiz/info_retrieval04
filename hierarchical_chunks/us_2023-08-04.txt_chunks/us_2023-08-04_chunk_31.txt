Mr. TRONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of Miss Jessica Thompson, a resident of Middletown, Maryland and member of the Frederick County Knucklers marble shooting team.
On June 22, 2023, Miss Thompson won the 100th Annual National Marbles Tournament.
In addition to winning the top title in the girls' division, she won the honor.
These titles earned her a college scholarship.
As this year marks the 100th annual tournament, it is regarded as the oldest children's competitive sport in the United States, having started in 1922.
During the week of June 22nd, young girls and boys from all across the nation gathered to participate in tournaments, engaging in over 1,200 games.
Throughout the intense threeday event, Jessica displayed her exceptional skills by competing in more than 100 games.
With determination and skill, she clinched the championship.
It is with great pride that Maryland's sixth district welcomes the Queen of Marbles home to Middletown, and we wish her continued success in all of her endeavors.
