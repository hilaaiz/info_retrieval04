Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Sisay Senbet on receiving the Tom Miller Advocacy Award for his outstanding work and self-advocacy in Didlake's AbilityOne Program, a federal program that creates employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities.
Sisay immigrated to the District of Columbia from Ethiopia in 2010 and started working for Didlake as a custodian at the Pentagon in 2012.
In 2015, he started working the night shift so he could enroll in college.
He earned his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2019.
Shortly after obtaining his college degree, Sisay was promoted to Site Safety and Health Officer.
In his new role, he conducted work inspections and trained new employees in the proper use of safety equipment.
Last September, he was promoted to Lead Worker and is now responsible for coordinating and leading the Pentagon custodial crew's day-to-day-operations.
In his spare time, Sisay volunteers at his community library, teaching classes and tutoring other individuals with disabilities.
In particular, he helps people with visual impairments use screen reading software to access digital information.
