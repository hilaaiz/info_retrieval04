Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along with the 765,000 people of the 2nd Congressional District, in extending our deepest condolences to the family of 
Mr. Thomas Christopher Chatmon, Jr., his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
May we all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
