Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding musician, dedicated educator, committed community servant, and dear friend of longstanding, 
Ms. Jacqueline Saunders.
She will be honored at the Chancel Choir's 60th Anniversary Gospel Concert at First Missionary Baptist Church of Thomasville, Georgia on Sunday, August 6, 2023.
Jacqueline Saunders has used her life's work to help others to reach their full potential through music, theatre, and education.
It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we occupy here on this earth.''
Ms. Saunders has paid her rent, and she has paid it well.
Ms. Saunders graduated from Morris Brown College in 1973 with a B.A. Degree in English.
During her matriculation at Morris Brown, she was initiated into the sisterhood of Alpha Kappa Kappa Sorority Inc., which makes her a Golden Soror.
She was also a member of the Morris Brown College Wolverine Marching Band.
Her love of knowledge and learning took her academic pursuits to the University of Georgia, Valdosta State College (Now University), Walden University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where she received her M.S. in Counseling Education in 1988.
