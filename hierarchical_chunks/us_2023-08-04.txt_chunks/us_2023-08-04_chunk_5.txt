Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Julie Kim upon her retirement from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) after 33 years of dedicated public service.
During this time, 
Ms. Kim advised Members, congressional staff, and committees on a wide range of foreign policy issues and historic world events with significant ramifications for the security of the United States and U.S geopolitical interests.
