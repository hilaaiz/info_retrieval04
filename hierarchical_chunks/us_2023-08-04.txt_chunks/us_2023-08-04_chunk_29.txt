Mr. LOUDERMILK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated staffer who is moving on to a new venture.
After graduating from Georgia Southern University with a degree in accounting, Logan came to my Congressional office as an intern.
Although he is originally from South Lake Tahoe, Nevada, he quickly became an honorary Georgian.
Logan was college football starter for 3 years at Georgia Southern.
He was named on Sun Belt Conference Academic Commissioner's List and the Sun Belt Conference Academic Honor Role.
Logan has a strong desire to serve, and an even stronger dedication to this country.
Despite having a job offer in hand after graduation, Logan chose to come to D.C. to work as an intern, and immediately made an impact on our office.
When the opportunity arose for Logan to join the staff of my House Administration subcommittee, he didn't hesitate.
He saw it as another opportunity to serve--and he has been invaluable from day 1.
Logan is moving on to the next phase of his life, where he will begin his career in accounting.
Logan has left a lasting impression on our entire team and will be impossible to replace; but I am grateful for his service, and I look forward to seeing him continue to succeed as he enters his new role.
