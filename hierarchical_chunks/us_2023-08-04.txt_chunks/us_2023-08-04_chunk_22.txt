Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize, a dedicated servant leader, seasoned business executive, faithful civil rights activist, great strategic thinker, loving husband, committed father, and friend of longstanding, Thomas (Tommy) Christopher Chatmon, Jr.
Sadly, Tommy transitioned this life from labor to reward on July 22, 2023.
A homegoing service celebrating his remarkable life will be held on Saturday, August 5, 2023, at The Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.
Thomas (Tommy) Chistopher Chatmon, Jr was born in Albany, Georgia, on December 19, 1954, the third of 5 children to the late Thomas C. Chatmon, Sr., and Alma Chatmon.
Raised in a God-fearing family, he became a member of Bethel AME Church, where he was a lifelong member and sang in the choir.
His first fruits of education came as a student at the Hazard Laboratory School for Primary Education and St. Teresa's Catholic School in Albany.
Tommy was also a product of the Dougherty County School System, graduating from Albany High School in 1972.
Tommy made history while at Albany High School, becoming the marching band's first African American drum major.
His love of music continued, and he delayed college after graduating with honors to travel with a band called Eden from 1968 to 1974.
In 1974, Tommy followed in his father's footsteps by attending our Alma Mater, Morehouse College.
He graduated from Morehouse in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in political science.
One of Tommy's proudest moments at Morehouse was when he was selected to serve as a U.S. Congressional Intern, in the office of United States Congresswoman Cardiss Hortense Collins.
After graduating from Morehouse, Tommy returned to his hometown roots in Albany to operate a family-owned business, Chatmon's Beauty Supply, Inc.
He was a great strategic entrepreneur and as Chief Operating Officer for 17 years, he helped grow the family business to 10 retail locations in 4 different states.
