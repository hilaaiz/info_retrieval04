Mr. TRONE.
Mr. Speaker, on June 22, 2023, I was unavoidably detained.
Had I been present, I would have voted ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 285.
I strongly oppose H. Res. 529, a resolution to refer H. Res. 503 from the House floor to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on the Judiciary.
That resolution impeaches President Joe Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to actions taken that involve immigration and the southern border.
President Biden continues to lead with integrity and has done more than any other President to combat substance use disorder and address the mental health crisis.
In the absence of Congressional action, I have been heartened to work with the Biden Administration to make significant and meaningful reforms to address the immigration challenges facing our Nation.
Rather than consider legislation that is purely politically driven, it is my hope that we get back to the serious work of legislating on the real issues our country faces.
for the People.
I also would have voted ``NAY'' on rollcall No. 286.
I strongly oppose H. Res. 461.
condemning the use of elementary and secondary school facilities to provide shelter for aliens who are not admitted to the United States.
Migrants deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I commend anyone who follows the Golden Rule and finds shelter for those most in need.
