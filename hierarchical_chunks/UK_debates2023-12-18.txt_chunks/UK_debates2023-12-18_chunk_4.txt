I thank my hon.
Friend for the question, and I would be delighted for either me or the relevant Minister to meet her.
I know the terrific work she has done, particularly with organisations such as Finito, in getting young people ready for work.
Indeed, I believe she set up the all-party parliamentary group on the future of employability.
I am very happy to have a meeting.
