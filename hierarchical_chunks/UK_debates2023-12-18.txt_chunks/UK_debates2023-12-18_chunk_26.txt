I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that report.
I have looked at it, and it is important that we react to it.
I point to our record of action.
When it comes to further support for households with low incomes, we have heard in the Chamber—indeed, the Secretary of State mentioned this—about raising local housing allowance back to the 30th percentile, which will benefit 1.6 million low-income households by, on average, £800 a year in 2024-25.
When that is added to the national living wage, the uprating of benefits and the availability of work, we are determined that those families will progress.
