What steps his Department is taking to help reduce the number of children in poverty.
In 2023-24 we are spending around £124 billion through the welfare system on people of working age and children.
Evidence shows the importance of work in reducing the risk of child poverty.
With over 900,000 vacancies across the UK, our focus is on supporting parents into, and to progress within, work.
Our recent autumn statement announcements, which included the back to work plan, increasing benefits and increasing the national living wage, are all part of our clear approach to ensuring that everybody gets the right support to progress and thrive.
I hear what the Minister says, but a recent report from UNICEF showed that of 39 OECD and EU countries, the UK came last in terms of improvements in child poverty between 2012 and 2021.
As a result, one in five children in my constituency of Stretford and Urmston are growing up in poverty.
What more can the Minister do to address this truly appalling situation?
