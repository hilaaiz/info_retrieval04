On Friday, pupils at Shaftesbury Junior School in my constituency gave me the lovely Christmas earrings that I am wearing, which they made themselves using computer-aided design.
I am so proud of all their achievements, especially when more than a third of Leicester’s children are growing up in poverty, with all the challenges that brings.
As my hon.
Friends have said, figures from UNICEF show that under this Government the UK has had the biggest increase in child poverty out of the world’s 40 wealthiest countries.
My question is simple: what is the Minister going to do about it?
The hon.
Lady will have heard about our work on the LHA.
I am extremely proud of the difference that it will make to families in her constituency and mine.
With almost 1 million job vacancies across the UK, our firm believe is that supporting all families to progress and do well is the right thing to do.
That comes with the full uprating that we have done this year on working-age benefits and supporting the LHA.
The hon.
Lady made the point that it has been a difficult time, and the household support fund and the cost of living payments, which start again on  6 February , will assist.
