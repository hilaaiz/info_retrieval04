What steps his Department is taking to support the long-term unemployed into work.
It is a pleasure to be back, Mr Speaker.
We are delivering a suite of measures as part of the back to work plan, supporting customers on their journey to employment.

As a Conservative MP from a working-class background, I believe fundamentally in aspiration, hard work and fairness.
