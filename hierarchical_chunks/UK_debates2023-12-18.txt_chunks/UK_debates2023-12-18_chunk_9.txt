I thank my right hon.
Friend, and I hope I am the Minister for getting things done in this brief, as I have been in all my other briefs in my almost five years at the DWP.
I will be leaning very much into those details.
I will be very clear with the House that the focus on youth transitions is really important for the sector and for the individual people we are talking about.
I agree with my right hon.
Friend, and I will be looking into that in the new year.
