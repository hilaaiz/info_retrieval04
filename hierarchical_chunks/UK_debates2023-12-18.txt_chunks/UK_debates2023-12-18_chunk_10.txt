It is a pleasure to welcome the new Minister to her post.
After a week of no news, I was starting to worry that the Prime Minister was not going to appoint anyone.
I think she is aware of the huge Access to Work backlog her predecessor failed to tackle.
Over the last year, it has  reduced by only 942, with a staggering 24,339 still waiting, so hardly a dent has been made.
What will she do to speed this up and ensure that thousands of disabled people are not left waiting months to start work?
