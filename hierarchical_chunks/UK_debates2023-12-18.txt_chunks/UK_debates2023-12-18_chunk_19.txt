I thank my hon.
Friend for what is a very important question, because there has been a great deal of scaremongering about what exactly these powers are about.
I can make it categorically clear from the Dispatch Box that these powers are there to make sure that, in instances where there is a clear signal of fraud or error, my Department is able to take action.
In the absence of that, it will not.
