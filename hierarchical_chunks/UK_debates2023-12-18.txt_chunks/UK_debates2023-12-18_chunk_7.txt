I thank the hon.
Member for his point.
I, too, pressed the previous Minister on this matter, and I shall be pressing myself going forward.
In fact, we met and fed in work involving Thriiver in my constituency, and we have been working with stakeholders, partners and employer organisations to make sure this link is joined up.
We are determined that Access to Work will continue to be fit for purpose, and that we will deliver a modern and efficient digital service.
Our new online portal is part of that.
I think it is key to hear the experiences and to link up with other Departments.
