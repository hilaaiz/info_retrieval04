I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for the opportunity to build on that incredible work, which will be life-changing for many of our constituents.
The people we are talking about today are not statistics; they are humans, and they need to have a real difference in their lives.
For Opposition Members, and everyone else listening today, let me say that I am determined to make sure that those people have a voice across Government and that I use my experience to deliver.
