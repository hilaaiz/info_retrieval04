The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to help fill job vacancies in Stroud constituency.
I had the great pleasure of visiting my hon.
Friend’s jobcentre in April.
Since then, it has been closed temporarily, I believe, and moved to Gloucester.
I am sure there is no connection.

I am really sure, I can reassure  the hon.
Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner) .
Of course, it does a fantastic job in matching jobs through work coaches, jobs fairs, recruitment days and an extensive skills offering.
Work experience is often really hard to nail down—places go to those with friends and family in the sector, and employers are really busy.
That is particularly so for small skilled manufacturing businesses in Stroud, so I am working with employability experts Finito to launch a campaign for low-fuss shadowing work experience across the board.
We want to allow everybody, young and old, to find out more about weird and wonderful jobs, and to allow employers to assess candidates.
Is that something my right hon.
Friend is interested in, and will he meet me to discuss it?
