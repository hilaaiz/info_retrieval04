I welcome my hon.
Friend to her new expanded role in the Department for Work and Pensions.
The last time I raised Access to Work with her, it was about a particular blockage in my constituency, and I thank her for resolving that.
She will know as well as I do that one of the biggest challenges for young disabled people is the transition into work.
What reassurance can she give me that she is prioritising the applications of young people, so that when they move into their first job, that is not impeded by too slow a reaction from Access to Work?
