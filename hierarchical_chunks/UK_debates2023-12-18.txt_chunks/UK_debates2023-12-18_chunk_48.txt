I thank my hon.
Friend for welcoming me to this brief.
I will still be very much focused on young people and those key transitions in their lives.
We have our reform relating to universal support, our fit note reform and our WorkWell partnerships, which launched on  16 November  and will support 60,000 long-term sick and disabled people to start, stay and succeed in work.
The youth hubs we have at the Department for Work and Pensions, which are focused on the under-25s, zero in on this issue in particular.
