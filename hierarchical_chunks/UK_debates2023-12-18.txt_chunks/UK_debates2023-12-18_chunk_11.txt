I thank the hon.
Lady for her welcome to this post, and I hope that I have already spelled out my commitment to delivering in this brief.
I think that prioritising the process of Access to Work claims, renewals and job starts within four weeks is key, as is making sure that those with mental health support needs get additional support and that those who are deaf or hard of hearing also get that focus and that reach.
I assure the hon.
Lady that we have increased the number of staff in this space.
On my handover from the previous Minister, I would take issue with the hon.
Lady about the focus he had on reforming Access to Work and making sure it was fit for purpose, but I am happy to engage with her further.
