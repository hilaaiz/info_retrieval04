According to End Child Poverty, 30% of children in Lewisham East were in poverty in 2021-22, while Lewisham food banks have seen a 42% increase compared to 2022.
That comes after 13 years of this Conservative Government.
To make matters worse, the reported cut to the national household support fund means that more than £13 million for households across Lewisham have been taken away.
Is the Minister really serious about showing the leadership needed to stop families in my constituency from falling into destitution?
I am really serious about supporting our young people.
In fact, in Lewisham the household support fund, which is my domain, has allocated an additional £13.3 million to support the hon.
Lady’s constituents.
There are local hubs for debt management and engagement with the local authority, and warm welcome hubs.
I say to anybody struggling in her constituency to look at the benefits calculators, and indeed help for households, on gov.uk.
Figures from the Trussell Trust show that in the six months between April and September, food banks in the north-east provided a record 26,000 emergency food parcels for children, with the need having doubled over the past five years.
The majority of families who turn to food banks do so because their income, whether from social security or from wages, is too low to afford the basic essentials.
Will the Minister explain why the current design of universal credit is failing these families?
As we have heard from the Secretary of State, 400,000 fewer children are in absolute poverty, and we thank our food banks for the work they do in supporting our communities.
We do take this seriously.
We have added food security questions to the family resources survey, and we will absolutely look at that.
I would point to the hon.
Member’s constituency having been allocated an additional £8 million in the last household support fund for exactly those families.
