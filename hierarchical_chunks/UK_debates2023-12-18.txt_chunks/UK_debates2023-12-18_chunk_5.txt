What steps his Department is taking to reduce waiting times for Access to Work assessments.
Access to Work remains in high demand.
We are increasing the number of staff processing Access to Work claims, and prioritising renewal applications for those with a job start within four weeks.
We are improving the service through increased digitisation to improve the time from application through to decision.
