The Minister is completely out of touch with the reality facing families in Britain today: 3.8 million people face severe hardship this year, including 1 million children.
Quite frankly, that is a shameful figure that has almost trebled since this Government abolished Labour’s Child Poverty Act 2010.
Millions of parents are now worried about how they will feed, clothe or keep their children warm this Christmas, let along how they will buy them presents.
When will the Minister  change course, follow Labour’s lead and deliver a cross-Government child poverty strategy that gives every child the start in life that they deserve?
We will absolutely not follow Labour’s lead—let us look at their record.
People might be worried ahead of Christmas.
Cost of living payments, the household support fund, the benefits calculator and help for households are all out there.
I want the people watching now to know that support is there.
Progression will vary depending on circumstances; we have a tailored approach.
We have 37 district progression leads to help exactly those families that the hon.
Lady talks about.
