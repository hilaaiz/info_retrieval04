I thank the hon.
Lady for lobbying for my elevation and rank in this House.
I am delighted to respond by making it clear to the lobby and to those we are talking about and looking after that that makes no material difference to their day-to-day life.
There is no difference in my convening power or in the day-to-day work.
Our next cross-Government ministerial disability champions meeting is in the new year.
Let me be clear: this is not about rank.
We are sent to this House to serve people and to engage and listen, and I will do that whatever the title or rank.
