During the recent covid inquiry, the former Health Secretary,  the right hon.
Member for West Suffolk (Matt Hancock) , said that statutory sick pay was “far too low” and that if he had a magic wand, he would fix it.
Given that the Secretary of State has the magic wand, as the Minister responsible for this, when is he going to fix it?
I am certainly not going to start making policy up on the hoof at the Dispatch Box this afternoon or promising more money for statutory sickness pay.
That would require discussions across Government, but I note the point that the hon.
Gentleman has made.
