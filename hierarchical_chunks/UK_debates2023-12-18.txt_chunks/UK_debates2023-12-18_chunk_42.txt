I thank my hon.
Friend and note his relentless support for the seafood industry more broadly and the processing industry  in particular.
I understand that the former Minister for Employment, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) , visited Scotland earlier this year to look at that industry.
Work coaches offer tailored employment support to all jobseekers and the flexible support fund is available at the discretion of jobcentres to purchase goods and services, including travel, to support claimants to move from one area to another in order to take up job opportunities.
I know that my hon.
Friend is working hard in his local area to find solutions, and I am always happy to discuss ideas with him.
