It is characteristically astute of my hon.
Friend to zero in on the tie-in, which is an important part of the long-term workforce plan.
Around two thirds of dentists do not go into NHS work after training, so having a tie-in is more pertinent there than it might be elsewhere in the NHS workforce.
I look forward to the Select Committee’s report but, with some of the reforms already in place, we are boosting the number of patients treated.
There were a fifth more dental treatments in 2022 than in the previous year.
We are also making NHS dentistry more attractive with some of the changes to the previous 2006 contract, but we recognise that there is more to do, which is why we will shortly set out our dental recovery plan.
