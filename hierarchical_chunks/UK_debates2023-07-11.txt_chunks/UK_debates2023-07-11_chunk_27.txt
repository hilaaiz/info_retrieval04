If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
Last week, on behalf of the Government, I signed a landmark partnership agreement with the pharmaceutical giant BioNTech.
It aims to deliver 10,000 personalised mRNA cancer immunotherapies, including vaccines, to UK patients by 2030.
This work will harness the groundbreaking mRNA technology that BioNTech used in its world-first cancer vaccine.
Cancer vaccines work by stimulating patients’ immune systems to recognise and eliminate cancer cells, preventing their spread.
Trials for BioNTech’s colorectal cancer vaccine are under way at multiple sites across the UK.
To accelerate trials further, BioNTech is partnering with NHS England’s new cancer vaccine launch pad, a platform that makes it easier for both early and late stage cancer patients to join vaccine trials.
In the coming years, hundreds of patients identified by the launch pad will join trials for BioNTech’s personalised cancer therapies, broadening the treatment options available to cancer patients.
I hope the whole House will welcome the opportunity the deal offers future patients.
The announcement that a new hospital between Winchester and Basingstoke is going ahead is much welcomed by my constituents who will use it, as well as by those from other constituencies.
It will provide a centre of excellence with better medical outcomes.
Will my right hon.
Friend meet local MPs, so we can update him on why the hospital needs to be built as soon as possible?
I am always very happy for my hon.
Friend and other colleagues to meet me or Lord Markham, who leads the capital programme.
It is an important scheme.
We are delivering it through the standardised Hospital 2.0 approach, using modern methods of construction.
We are keen to progress early supported works on site, working closely with colleagues.
