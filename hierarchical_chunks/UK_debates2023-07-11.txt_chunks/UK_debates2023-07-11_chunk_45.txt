I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his contributions on how we can deliver the best pensions for long-term savers.
There are no estimates for the share of the UK.
We are mobilising an additional £50 billion of assets over time.
That is evolution, not revolution.
We would expect—and it is the job of this Government—to present that investment capital with a wave of attractive options across some of the fastest-growing sectors, as the Prime Minister and Chancellor have laid out, and to remove frictions and obstacles as people seek to invest in the UK, creating a conducive environment for that investment but falling short of mandating it, in the knowledge that the allocation to international investments for some of our actively managed schemes already exceeds that of other comparable companies.
On the charge cap, we are this morning publishing a consultation on the new value for money framework.
Clearly, we want to continue ensuring that pensioners benefit from fair charges, but also that that does not come at the expense of the underlying performance that they receive.
