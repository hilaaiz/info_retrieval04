The Minister is aware, I know, of the outstanding campaigning work that my hon.
Friend  the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)  is doing, not least because of the experience of her sister—our late great friend Margaret McDonagh—with glioblastomas.
Over decades now, we have seen no improvements in outcomes, no drug trials of any seriousness and no mandatory training of oncologists.
I have learned through experience that, when the McDonaghs come knocking, it is best to say yes, and if anyone says no, they will be hit by this unstoppable steamroller.
With that cautionary note in mind, might the Minister be prepared to meet me, my hon.
Friend and relevant stakeholders across the Department, NHS England and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to see what more can be done?
There are challenges, I know, but what more can be done to make sure that, for families such as my hon.
Friend’s and Margaret’s, and for thousands of others each year, glioblastomas are not simply a death sentence?
