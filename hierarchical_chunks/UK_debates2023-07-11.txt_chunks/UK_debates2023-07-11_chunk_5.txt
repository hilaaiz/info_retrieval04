Youngsters who try e-cigarettes are at much greater risk of both nicotine addiction and later going on to use tobacco itself, so what consideration have this Government given to banning disposable vapes completely as a way of protecting our young people?
Again, I agree that disposable vapes are a particular concern: in our view, the growth in youth vaping is largely due to the growth in the use of disposable vapes.
That is why we have particularly focused on that issue in our call for evidence, and that is what we are considering.
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of guidance issued by District Valuer Services on the availability of city-centre GP premises.
While it is a very long-standing system, we keep the approach to funding for GP premises under review.
We have taken action in the primary care recovery plan to improve access to section 106 funds, so that new homes always come with the GP infrastructure that is needed.
