I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and I am sorry to hear of his own personal experience.
He is absolutely right that, in relation to children, I am very keen to find a way forward.
The Government are committed to finding high-quality brain cancer research, and we expect to spend more as new research progresses.
The £40 million of funding announced will remain available, and if we can spend more on the best-quality science, we will do so.
We worked really closely with Lord O’Shaughnessy on his review, we have accepted his recommendations and we have put in £121 million to support it.
