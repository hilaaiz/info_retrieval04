I absolutely agree with my hon.
Friend.
The local government pension scheme is a huge opportunity for this country.
In many cases, it is already very progressive.
It is investing in local opportunities and allocating its capital to the sort of private growth assets that we wish to seek.
With £365 billion under management, an increased rate of progress towards asset pooling, which, as the Government have made clear, should attract at least £50 billion, will provide the scale to invest well on behalf of beneficiaries.
That is a great opportunity for us all.
The number of companies listed on the London stock exchange has plummeted to such an extent that the market value of Apple is now greater than the entire FTSE 100.
Recently, Cambridge-based chip giant Arm decided to list in New York rather than in London.
Does the Minister think that the Mansion House compact will reverse the trend of British-based companies deciding to list elsewhere?
Yes.
This is an excellent package, but one way to ensure that investment flows to productive enterprise is to prevent it from being crowded out by growing Government debt, isn’t it?
Our objectives are threefold in that respect: to bear down on inflation; to reduce Government debt, with the benefits that my right hon.
Friend seeks; and to grow the economy.
These are long-term plans and ambitious programmes, and ultimately, the acid test will be how we can grow our economy.
