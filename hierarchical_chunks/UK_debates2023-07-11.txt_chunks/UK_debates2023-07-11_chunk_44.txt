Defined-benefit pension funds have long been under pressure to invest in Government gilts rather than the productive economy, so I welcome the change of direction that the Minister has announced.
He has indicated how much extra pension fund investment will go into high-growth companies in future.
Will he indicate what share of that he expects to go into UK high-growth firms rather than overseas?
He has indicated, I think, a replacement for the current charge caps on pension funds, with a wider value-for-money assessment, but can he indicate when we are likely to see the detail on what exactly he and the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,  the hon.
Member for Sevenoaks (Laura Trott) , have in mind for that?
