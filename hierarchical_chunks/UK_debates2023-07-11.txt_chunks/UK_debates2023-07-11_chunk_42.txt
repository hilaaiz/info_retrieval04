I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
Like my hon.
Friend  the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin) , I warmly welcome the work that my hon.
Friends on the Front Bench have done.
The Mansion House compact is a huge step forward, but does my hon.
Friend the Minister agree that getting the Kent investment review reforms right, particularly on unbundling, will also help us to have high-quality research, enabling better decisions and more investment into high-quality firms?
My hon.
Friend, who knows so much about this topic and has engaged so lucidly on it, is absolutely right about the importance of investment research.
It provides access to markets, makes our UK stock exchanges an attractive international venue, narrows spreads and drives fair valuations for investors and companies seeking investment.
This is one example of where we inherited a European fact pattern that was not quite right for the UK.
I look forward to pensioners, investors, savers and companies benefiting from our research review.
