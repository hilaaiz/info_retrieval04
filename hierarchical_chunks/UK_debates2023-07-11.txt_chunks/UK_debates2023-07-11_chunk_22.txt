I thank the shadow Minister for her question.
To highlight another initiative in West Yorkshire, the Night OWLS—Overnight West Yorkshire Living/Advice Service—helpline has been set up for children and young people.
It is open between 8 pm and 8 am seven days a week for young people to access, in addition to the 24/7 helpline that is available.
I am sure that the shadow Minister will also welcome the fact that we have more   than 400 mental health support teams in schools in England, covering 3 million children, so that they can access mental health support directly at school.
