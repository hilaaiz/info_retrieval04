I refer Members to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
My father, the late Alan Bristow, died of a brain tumour in April 2020.
He was 77, and that was incredibly sad, but when a child dies of a brain tumour, it is unbelievably wicked.
Brain tumours are still the biggest killer of young people.
What can the Minister do to  ensure that appropriate funding is being put into research into brain tumours, especially for younger people, and when will the Government respond to the O’Shaughnessy review into clinical trials in the UK, which would help the brain tumour community?
