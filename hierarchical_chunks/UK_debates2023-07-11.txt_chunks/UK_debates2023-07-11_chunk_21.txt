As my hon.
Friend  the Member for Leeds North East (Fabian Hamilton)  highlighted, all too often, children are stuck on long waiting lists for treatment.
In West Yorkshire, 30,000 children are currently stuck waiting for mental health treatment, and more than 9,000 people have had their mental health referral closed without accessing treatment.
Does the Minister find that acceptable?
If the answer is no, what will her Government do about it?
This picture is not unique to West Yorkshire, but replicated across England.
This Government are letting patients down.
When is the Minister going to act to tackle the crisis in mental health services?
