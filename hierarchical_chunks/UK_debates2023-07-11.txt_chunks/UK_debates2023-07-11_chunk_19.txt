I absolutely pay tribute to the school in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency.
I also point out that Red Kite View is a new unit specifically for young people in his constituency.
That 22-bed mental health unit opened last year and aims to eliminate out-of-area placements for young children with mental ill health.
I am sure that he would welcome that investment in his constituency.
The Joint Committee on the Draft Mental Health Bill reported back in January this year.
One of the most important recommendations we made was about how people, during a period of wellness, could set out how they wish to be treated during a period of illness.
The Government have yet to respond to the Joint Committee, but can we have a mental health Bill in the forthcoming King’s Speech, please?
