I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his support for growth and competitiveness.
We have talked regularly about the need for regulators to improve their performance and deliver better outcomes for those whom they regulate.
He talked about the 5%, and I emphasise that, ultimately, it is a voluntary pact; it is for the individual trustees to make those decisions, and the Government continue to have in place a strong programme of regulation.
However, I hope he respects the fact that there is risk in inaction as well—the risk that our pension beneficiaries do not receive the pensions that they deserve or the sort of performance from their pension that other international long-term savers benefit from.
He raises the issue of defined contribution and the liability for the taxpayer.
Of course, that does not attach to defined-contribution schemes, which is why it is so important that they continue to benefit from the highest-quality regulation.
I and my colleague the pensions Minister remain very committed to that and will continue to work with TPR and the FCA to ensure that that remains the case.
