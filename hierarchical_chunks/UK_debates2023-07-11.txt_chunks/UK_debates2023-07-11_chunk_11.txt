I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, and I am sorry to hear of the experience of her three constituents.
There certainly is hope within the long-term workforce plan.
As she rightly alludes to, we are reliant on researchers to submit high-quality research proposals, and that requires clinicians specialising in this area.
It is something I take very seriously, and I would be very happy to work with her on it.
