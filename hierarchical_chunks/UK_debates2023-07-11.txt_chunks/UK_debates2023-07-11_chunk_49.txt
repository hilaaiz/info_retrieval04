I draw the House’s attention to the fact that I am a trustee of the parliamentary contributory  pension fund.
Forgive me if I am a little sceptical about Government involvement in pension funds.
We have seen how the annual and lifetime allowances, announced at the Dispatch Box by a former Chancellor, have played out.
It was also this Government who took us through McCloud in the public sector.
The Minister said that the average earner who starts saving at 18 could increase the size of their pension pot by 12% over their career.
Can he give the House examples of the assumptions behind that figure, and will he publish the modelling behind it?
The Government Actuary’s Department is the source of those figures, which we published this morning—I draw the hon.
Lady’s attention to that fact.
Clearly, there are a number of assumptions within that.
I do not think it is right to be sceptical.
These are reforms that have been formed with wide consultation, including from across the House.
I hope that we can form a growing consensus so that the industry receives a signal from this place that it is ultimately time to stop talking and to get on with investing.
That is the outcome that we seek.
