I thank my hon.
Friend for his answer, but does he agree that the services offered by pharmacies can be made more efficient?
For example, 62 million prescription items are subject to “split and snip” per year.
That is where, to get the right number of pills, a  pack has to be manually opened up for a couple of pills to be snipped out, then repackaged and relabelled before being reissued.
The spare pills are often thrown away.
Can that system not be better?
