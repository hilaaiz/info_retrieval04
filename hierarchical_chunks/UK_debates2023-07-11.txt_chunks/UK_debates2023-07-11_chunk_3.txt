I thank the Minister for that answer, but Target Ovarian Cancer has found that 40% of women in the UK wrongly believe that their smear test will detect ovarian cancer.
There is currently no viable screening process for ovarian cancer.
However, messaging remains unclear when women are going for their smear test.
What steps are being taken to ensure that information provided at such screening is clear?
