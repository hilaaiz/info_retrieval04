I thank the hon.
Member for that question and join him in paying tribute to  the hon.
Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) , especially after the tragic loss of her sister, for all the work that she has done in campaigning on this issue.
I have spent significant time on the issue and I have met her,  the hon.
Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) , campaigners, charities and other hon.
Members from across the House.
Funding for research is available and, having spoken with the Secretary of State, I know that he is as keen as I am to work with colleagues from across the House.
There are issues that transcend party politics and this is certainly one of them.
I would be very happy to meet the shadow Secretary of State, the National Institute for Health and Care Research, NHS England, the Tessa Jowell Brain Cancer Mission and clinical specialists to find a way forward.
