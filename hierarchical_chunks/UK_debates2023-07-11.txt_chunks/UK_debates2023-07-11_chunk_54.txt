I welcome the announcement of these reforms, but will the Chancellor and the Minister look further at two consequential areas?
First, to make the most of the newly available capital, this country needs to attract the world’s best innovators, insurgents and entrepreneurs.
The Labour party has already said that it does not want them here and will change tax policy to make sure they look to other countries.
This Government need to come forward with measures that say, “We want the best and the brightest to come to the UK.”
