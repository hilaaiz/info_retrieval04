I thank the Minister for that answer, and I am sure—and I know—he will take this very seriously.
I have had three constituents in the last year come to see me who have suffered serious brain tumours, and they have had a very similar pathway, which is basically that after a certain point there is little the NHS can do for them.
In particular, there is a shortage of neuro-oncologists, and one has spent their life savings on private treatment, even though that was difficult to find.
Is there any hope, in the NHS workforce plan, that there will be more oncology training and more support for neuro-oncology, because the survival rate for this cancer is still woefully low?
