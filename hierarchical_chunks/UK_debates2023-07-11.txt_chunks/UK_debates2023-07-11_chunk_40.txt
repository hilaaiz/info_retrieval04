While I hope the scheme succeeds, what liability would fall on the Pension Protection Fund should it fail?
What liability might there be on the taxpayer?
If the scheme works and the value of the funds increases,  what guarantee is there that the pension holder will receive the entire value of that increase and it will not be gobbled up by unnecessary and excessive fees?
