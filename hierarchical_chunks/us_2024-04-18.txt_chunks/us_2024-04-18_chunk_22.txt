Mr. Mickelsen worked tirelessly for fifteen years to construct the Texas Lions Camp based on his original small-scale model.
Famous Kerrville names, including Hal Peterson and Howard Butt of the HEB Grocery Company, donated resources to round out the construction and supplies for Camp.
Over the years, the Camp adapted to allow other special-needs children to participate.
Children living with blindness, hearing and speaking disorders, and various crippled limbs all enjoyed Texas Lions Camp together.
This defied the original prognostications of psychologists in the 1950s, who believed children with varying disabilities could not get along.
However, they learned to help each other and combine their strengths to thrive.
Several hundred adult blind were also trained at the Camp through a contract with the State of Texas for a couple decades into the 1980s.
Every summer, children with physical handicaps such as diabetes, down syndrome, polio, missing limbs, blindness, and other disabilities are accommodated every year at a weeklong camp session at no cost to their families.
Over 82,000 children have attended Texas Lions Camp since it opened in 1949.
The Camp motto is ``All Can Do!''
Campers experience a zip line, climbing wall, ropes course, fishing, boating, swimming, archery, arts and crafts, miniature golf, and much more.
Therapeutic horseback riding was added in the 1980s and became a favorite pastime for campers.
A more recent addition is the family camping experience, allowing the families of kids with special needs to experience Texas Lions Camp.
On a more personal note, my father, Don Roy, attended the Lions Camp in Kerrville when he was recovering from Polio in the 1950s, and still talks about the positive impact it had on him and the other children.
I am grateful to the eight hundred Texas Lions Clubs International that work tirelessly to provide funds for children with special needs to attend Texas Lions Camp.
