Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, Cathi Herrod serves as president of the Center for Arizona Policy.
She has been a pro-life and pro-family warrior for decades in Arizona.
Her efforts at the State Capitol and around Arizona communities have helped to ensure that we cherish our values and respect the dignity of life.
Thanks, in large part, to her tireless work, Arizona is one of the top pro-life and pro-family states in the Nation, and she continues to fight to maintain this standing in the face of overwhelming odds from opposing forces.
During her distinguished career, she has received the Family Champion Award from Focus on the Family, the William Wilberforce Award from Students for Life of America, and the Deborah Award from Family Life Radio.
On behalf of Arizona's Eighth Congressional District, I applaud Cathi Herrod for her service to our state and thank her for her continued action to defend life and family.
