Senator for Legislative District 3, covering the Northeast Valley.
He has served in the Arizona Legislature since 2007.
Before coming to Arizona, John worked as a police officer for the Port Authority of New York and the New Jersey Police Department.
I had the privilege of serving with 
Senator Kavanagh for a number of years when I was a state legislator, and we worked on several policies and reforms that have made a lasting impact for future generations.
John has earned much recognition for his conservative principles during his time in the legislature, including a Lifetime A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, a Lifetime A rating from the American Conservative Union, and a Lifetime A rating from the Center for Arizona Policy.
Arizona's Eighth Congressional District thanks him for his distinguished record of service to his district and our state.
