Senator for Legislative District 2, covering the North Valley.
Throughout her time in public service, Shawnna has been a strong champion for promoting school choice and protecting the most vulnerable among us.
Thanks, in large part, to her work, Arizona is one of the premier states in the nation for school choice and for safeguarding those who cannot defend themselves.
She has served on Arizona's Early Childhood Education and Health Board, the Arizona State Board of Education's Academic Standards Development Committee, and the Arizona Juvenile Justice Commission.
Shawnna is a `can-do' conservative fighter.
She will always stand on her principles, but she looks every day for consensus and for opportunities to enact meaningful policy reforms and enhancements for her constituents.
Arizona's Eighth Congressional District is grateful for Shawnna's commitment and passion for public service, and I am thankful for the example she has left for many to follow.
