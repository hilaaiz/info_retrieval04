Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the extraordinary life of Valerie Denise Campbell--a pillar of the Lake Como community, who was better known as Denise to the people who loved her.
Denise attended Como Elementary School and then went on to Arlington Heights High School to support the desegregation of schools in Fort Worth.
She then went on after high school graduation to attend Texas Women's University in 1975, where she majored in music education.
After college, she began her career at General Dynamics and later had a 32-year career serving North Texas children with Fort Worth ISD, teaching at Burton Hill Elementary.
Denise, a staunch woman of faith, was baptized by the late Pastor G.W. Burton.
As a young girl, Denise began playing piano at the Zion Baptist Church in Church School and eventually on Sunday mornings.
She also was a loving wife, mother, and family member to many.
She was the wife of Wendell Campbell for 47 years, was the mother to three beautiful children, a grandmother, a family member, and was also a loving pet owner.
Denise was sometimes referred to as ``The Music Librarian'' because she was a gifted and talented musician.
She loved music, and her life was dedicated to the Lord, family, and sacred music.
For years, she played at the Zion Baptist Church under the pastoral leadership of the Reverends J.W. Briscoe and Maurice E. Barnes.
Later, she went on to join her husband at the West Mount Moriah Baptist Church, where she was greeted with joy and accolades.
Without taking a break, she began to play the piano and organ there.
I rise again to commemorate her memory and wish my deepest condolences to everyone whose lives she touched.
