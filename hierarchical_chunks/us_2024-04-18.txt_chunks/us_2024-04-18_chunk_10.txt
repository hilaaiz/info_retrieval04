Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a local Green Bay celebrity and Jeopardy champion, Dr. Ben Chan.
In the Spring of 2023, Ben captured the attention of Jeopardy viewers nationwide.
He went on a nine-game winning streak and won more than $250,000 on the trivia show.
While he was competing, the fans were charmed by his positive attitude; oftentimes, he could be seen ``raising-the-roof,'' and he always placed an exclamation point after his name.
He shared stories about his dogs, Ruthie and Chester, who he plans on spending a portion of his winnings on.
Although Ben's winning streak ended over a controversial rule, he was invited back to compete in the Tournament.
Ultimately, Ben has won over $350,000 on Jeopardy.
While Ben has an extensive fan-base nationwide, some of his most loyal fans reside in his hometown.
Ben is an assistant professor of philosophy at St. Norbert College in De Pere.
The college community continues to embrace Ben and his success on Jeopardy.
When he is not on campus, Ben can be found greeting fans in the community.
Recently, he hosted public watch parties for his appearances on Tournament.
Wisconsinites flocked to local restaurants and breweries to cheer him on.
In addition to these events, Ben uses his platform to promote Northeast Wisconsin organizations.
Appleton's Minor League Baseball Team, the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, invited Ben to throw out the first pitch last summer.
He even had the opportunity to shoot the famous Bratzooka cannon, which launches brats into the stands.
When he competed in the Tournament of Champions, he highlighted one of Green Bay's main attractions, Bay Beach Amusement Park.
