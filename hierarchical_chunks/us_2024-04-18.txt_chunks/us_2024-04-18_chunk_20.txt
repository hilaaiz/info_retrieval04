Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Texas Lions Camp in Kerr County.
The Texas Lions Camp was incorporated as a 501(c)3 by the State of Texas on April 4, 1949.
The polio epidemic was rampant during this time, and the Texas Lions were looking for ways to give children affected by polio a place where they could experience some normalcy in their lives.
Congress passed two resolutions that authorized the sale of my predecessors, Congressman Ovie Clark Fisher, was instrumental in the passage of this legislation.
Then-
Senator Lyndon Baines Johnson was also an early supporter.
Mr. Bill Mickelsen, a Lion from Kerrville, traveled tirelessly to Washington, DC to advocate for the ``Texas Lions League for Crippled Children'' camp in Texas.
Mr. Mickelsen and his friend J.C. ``Buddy'' Murray created a detailed scale model of the Camp and eventually constructed the buildings.
However, one of the strings attached to the sale of five hundred and four acres was that the Lions had to raise $100,000 within six months to guarantee construction.
In pursuit of these dollars, the Lions established their ``life membership status.''
A Lion was Governor of Texas at the time, Allan Shivers.
He broadcasted over the radio a call for donations to the Camp.
Mr. Jack Wiech served as the first president State to drum up donations.
As the six-month deadline loomed, the Lions were still $20,000 short of their goal.
Mr. Sealy McCreless of San Antonio wrote a check that pushed the Lions over their goal for the Camp fundraiser.
The next step was to begin construction and raise $150,000 to cover those costs.
The Lions hit the road again for a second fundraising campaign.
