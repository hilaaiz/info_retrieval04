Mr. CARL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Sirmon Family of Baldwin County on their family farm being awarded the 2024 Alabama Farm.
Sirmon Farms is owned by Joel and Patti Sirmon, and Joel's mother, Shirley, and brother, James also help run the 5generation family-owned farm.
At Sirmon Farms, they grow cotton, corn, peanuts, and sweet potatoes across 4500 acres in the Belforest Community.
They will go on to represent Alabama during the Sunbelt Agriculture Expo in the Southeastern Farmer of the Year contest this fall.
Congratulations to the Sirmon Family and their family farm.
I am thankful for the impact they make on our state, and I am proud to be their representative.
