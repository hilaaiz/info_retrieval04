Mr. Speaker, I urge you and our colleagues to join me in honoring the life.
Ken was more than a leader; he was a source of inspiration for all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Through his guidance and encouragement, he paved the way for countless individuals to achieve their dreams and aspirations.
May we continue to cherish his memory for years to come.
