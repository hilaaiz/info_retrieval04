Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Armando ``Curtis'' Hierro is a 36-year-old Cuban-American.
He is the national field director for the Communications Workers of America with years of experience organizing for workers and human rights in Florida.
Curtis has a Bachelor of Arts in History from the University of Central Florida and a certificate in leadership, organizing, and action from the Harvard Kennedy School.
Organizing is a deeply held passion for Curtis.
Curtis was born in Miami, Florida, into a single-mother household where his family faced immense economic challenges, poverty, and homelessness.
Through a strong work ethic, a belief in the power of community, and a commitment to education passed on by his mother and grandmother, he was able to be the first person in his family to attend and graduate college.
While at the University of Central Florida, Curtis organized students to stand up for campus custodial staff in contract fights and support immigrant workers from the Coalition.
From 2012 to 2016, Curtis was a founding member and the first field director for the organization Dream Defenders--a community organization in Florida led by young people of color building power and organizing local and statewide campaigns to address issues of poverty, for-profit prisons, and accountable policing.
Moving on to the Central Florida AFL-CIO as organizing director, Curtis led the AFL-CIO's efforts to directly support the contract fight for fair wages by Disney workers represented by Unite Here and helped organize workers forming their union for the first time with the Communications Workers.
Additionally, Curtis co-led the fight to make Orlando the first city in the southeast United States to adopt a Trust Act to safeguard immigrant communities in 2018.
Curtis now focuses his efforts on supporting CWA members in Florida and across the country in developing their leadership and taking action to build worker power.
