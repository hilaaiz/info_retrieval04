When will the Minister wake up to the fact that working as an apprentice in engineering is a fabulous career choice, and well paid?
Will she come up to Huddersfield to look at Cummins, whose apprentice system is first rate?
I would be delighted to do so on my tour of England.
I could not agree more with the hon.
Gentleman.
My father is an engineer.
It is a fantastic profession, and the more we can encourage apprenticeships right across the board, the better.
Nearly 6 million people have now taken them up.
I would be delighted to come.
