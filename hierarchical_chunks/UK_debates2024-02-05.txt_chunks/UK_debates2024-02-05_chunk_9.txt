I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the value of our local DWP programmes.
In Rother Valley, the Reed in Partnership approach has given vital support to his constituents, helping them into work.
It is vital to keep supporting them to remain there, and that is where that particular programme helps.
Access to Work and our Disability Confident scheme are just some of the initiatives to support disabled people and those with health conditions while in employment.
