I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point, which I appreciate as I have been in that situation of caring for two people.
The primary purpose of the carer’s allowance is to provide a measure of financial support and recognition for people unable to work full time because of their caring responsibilities.
I know there are very strong views on this.
I am looking forward to meeting with Carers UK just after recess—I am afraid I cannot do so before, due to a funeral—and hearing the varying views and how we can continue to support our carers, who in every constituency and community do an amazing job.
