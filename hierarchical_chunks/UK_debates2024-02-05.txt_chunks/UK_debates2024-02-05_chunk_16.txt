I thank the hon.

I agree that behind each of those is somebody we should be concerned about, and I am absolutely looking at this point.
We are continuing to learn from decisions overturned by appeal, and we will continue to make improvements to our decision-making processes to help people to get the correct decision earlier in their claim journey, and to be able to work and have the support where it is needed.
Not everybody on PIP is out of work, so we need to be listening to the needs of the people in those queues.
I am conscious that every one of them is not a statistic but a person who needs our support.
