I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting all the good work that has gone on in his constituency.
I believe he opened a jobcentre only as recently as  30 January  in his constituency.
He is a doughty campaigner for and supporter of employment in his patch.
He asks whether I will visit his constituency.
I would certainly like to consider that, but my hon.
Friend the Employment Minister might also visit, because she just said she was particularly keen to do so.
