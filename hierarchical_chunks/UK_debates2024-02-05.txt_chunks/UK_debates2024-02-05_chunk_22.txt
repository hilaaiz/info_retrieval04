I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, because autism is an issue of great importance to the House and to her personally.
I know about the work that she is doing with Ryan Gibbs, Becca Pierce and Shelly Rankin Jones.
She will know that the Buckland review was instigated in April 2023 and will conclude relatively shortly, with a report being published online.
I look forward to visiting her disability jobs fair in Holyhead at the end of this week.
