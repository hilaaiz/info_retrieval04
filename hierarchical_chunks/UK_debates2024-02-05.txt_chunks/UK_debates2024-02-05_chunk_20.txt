I thank the Minister for her response, but those changes cannot come too soon for my constituent Emily, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in November, is too ill to work, and is finding the benefits system impossible to navigate.
DWP officials have pushed her from pillar to post, unable to decide whether she is eligible for employment and support allowance and universal credit.
She has been forced to fill in countless forms, and was even required to attend a jobcentre appointment over Christmas, despite being seriously unwell.
Does the Minister agree this is simply not good enough, and that we need to put those changes in place so that people like Emily do not have to go through this?
