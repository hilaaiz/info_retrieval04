My right hon.
Friend asks about the evidence and data around the disability action plan.
The plan is there to improve the quality of Government health data, and to increase insight into the needs and barriers that affect disabled people’s daily lives.
Ultimately, we will evaluate the impact of these policies and services, and we will use data, when they are available, to monitor and assess the outcomes of the plan.
We will start work on developing more comprehensive evaluation.
I know that, through her role as the Chair of the Select Committee, she will absolutely measure me and my role in this.
I assure her, the House and all those watching that the plan is absolutely about learning, and delivering on this challenge.
