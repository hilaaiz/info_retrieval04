I thank my right hon.
Friend for his in-depth statement, but there is concern about stretching the Royal Navy.
It is a leading, world-class Navy, but it is suffering from personnel issues in crewing the ships, and responsibility for that lies back at the Treasury providing the revenue streams needed to make sure the capital equipment we have got can be used most effectively.
What representations is my right hon.
Friend making to ensure that the growth in maritime concerns around the world will be met by a commitment from the Treasury?
