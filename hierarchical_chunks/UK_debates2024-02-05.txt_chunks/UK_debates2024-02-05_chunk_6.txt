I agree with the Secretary of State about the cross-party success of auto-enrolment, which has doubled the proportion of eligible employees saving for retirement, but we know  that the current regular auto-enrolment contribution of 8% of earnings is not enough to deliver the standard of living in retirement that most people hope for.
Does the Secretary of State recognise that that minimum level of contribution will need to be increased?
The contribution rates of the employer and employee are a very important matter, and we keep both under review.
