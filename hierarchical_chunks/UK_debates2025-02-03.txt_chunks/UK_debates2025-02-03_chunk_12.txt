It is very important that disabled people get the money to which they are entitled.
There will always be people who are not working, and we need to make sure there is good support for them.
As I said a moment ago, we will set out our proposals on improving the assessment process in the upcoming Green Paper, but we are also very interested in hearing about the Select Committee’s proposals.
People living with disabilities in rural areas such as Glastonbury and Somerton face many barriers to finding work, including lack of opportunities, poor transport and high childcare costs.
How will the Minister support individuals living in rural areas to overcome the barriers to employment and help them to improve their overall quality of life?
We will be doing a lot to support disabled people into work and to remove the barriers that are too often in their way, as the hon.
Lady rightly says.
I have already referred to the disability employment panel we are setting up.
We want to work alongside disabled people to make sure that we get this right and remove the barriers.
The Connect to Work programme, which is being rolled out over this year, will do a lot to help.
However, if there are particular problems in the hon.
Lady’s area that she would like to draw to my attention, I will be very interested to hear about them.
