During covid, assessments for personal independence payments were moved either online or to over the phone.
Today less than 5% of those assessments have returned to face-to-face, so what assessment have Ministers made of that change and are there any links with the rise in fraud?
My hon.
Friend is right to identify that in the PIP space the Department has introduced a blend of phone, video and face-to-face assessments with the aim of delivering a more efficient and user-centred service.
Since telephone and video assessments have been introduced there has been no evidence to suggest that these delivery channels are less effective than face-to-face assessments in detecting fraudulent claims.
In 2023-24, PIP overpayments accounted for just 0.4% of the DWP’s overall spend on PIP but I assure my hon.
Friend we will keep a close eye on that.
Marie Curie research has found that 15% of the three quarters of a million end-of-life carers are living below the poverty line, rising to 22% a year after bereavement.
Given these statistics, will the Minister consider extending the time that carers can claim carer’s allowance from two months to six months after bereavement?
We keep these matters under review.
I have not looked at that particular proposal before, but if the hon.
Gentleman would like to drop me a line I will certainly give it a careful look.
Final question, Dame Meg Hillier.
I applaud the Front-Bench team for its energy in driving the child poverty taskforce, but every decision has consequences and costs.
Will the Minister outline the costs of some of the processes she is looking at changing, particularly the cost of lifting the two-child cap, and if she does not have the figure to hand will she write to me?
