Last week, the right hon.
Lady described herself as the HR manager for the Government’s growth plan, so can Liz from HR tell me which of her colleagues should be fired for the addition of 47,000 people to the unemployment figures in December?
I am proud to say that I want to get Britain working again after we inherited a situation in which a record 2.8 million people were out of work due to health problems, because the Conservatives pushed the NHS to its knees and failed to have a proper plan to get people back into work.
Our mission is to get Britain working and growing again, and that is what our plan will deliver.
Wishful thinking is all very well, but let us talk about the facts.
Those 47,000 people probably spent Christmas worrying about how they would pay the bills without a job, and they are now looking for work in an employment market decimated by Labour’s jobs tax.
How high does the right hon.
Lady forecast unemployment will get under her Government?
The hon.
Lady wants to talk about the facts.
The facts are that we inherited a situation in which we will be spending £20 billion more on working-age, incapacity and disability benefits because of the mess her Government made, and in which there has been a doubling of the number of young people out of work due to health conditions, so people are more likely to be out of work due to poor health in their 20s than in their 40s.
Our radical reforms will give people the right to work and the support they need, and will get the benefits bill on a sustainable footing.
Last month, I brought together local leaders from charities and other organisations to discuss how we can best tackle child poverty in Bracknell Forest.
I welcome today’s update on the progress of the child poverty taskforce.
Does the Minister agree that community leaders are best placed to shape the support needed to tackle child poverty locally?
