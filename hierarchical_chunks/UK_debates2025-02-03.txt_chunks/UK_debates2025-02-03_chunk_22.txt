I was pleased to hear that Labour councillors on Hull city council have voted to condemn the Government’s shameful decision not to compensate WASPI women.
Has that given the Minister pause for thought?
I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue right across the House.
We carefully considered the ombudsman’s report, but as the hon.
Member knows, we do not think it is fair to provide compensation costing up to £10 billion when 90% of affected pensioners knew that the state pension age was rising, and the evidence shows that letters being sent earlier would have made little difference.
This week marks Time to Talk Day, the Mind campaign to destigmatise talking about mental health.
In light of this, will the Secretary of State join me in calling for employers up and down the country to take part in Time to Talk Day and outline what more could be done to end mental health stigma in the workplace?
I absolutely will.
As my hon.
Friend knows, the Government have launched the “Keep Britain Working” review led by Charlie Mayfield, the former chair of John Lewis Partnership.
He is doing precisely that—looking at how we can better support employers to help keep people in work and get them back to work.
Mental health is a real concern for me, with so many young people not in education, employment or training, primarily driven by mental health problems.
This is an issue we have got to sort, because it is terrible for them and for their future, and terrible for the economy too.
