Hundreds of farmers and other small business owners in Westmorland who earn less than the minimum wage are not eligible for universal credit because of the failure of that system to take account of variability of income.
Will the Minister look to put that right so that we can support the people who support us?
We are committed in our manifesto to a review of universal credit and I expect to set out shortly the details of how that review will go forward.
I will be very happy to look at the particular case the hon.
Gentleman raises in the course of the review.
We all know that the best route out of poverty is through well-paid work, but for families in my constituency, where a third of children grow up in poverty, low-paid and insecure jobs are a massive barrier.
What will the Department do to help more families back into work and to alleviate poverty for children growing up in Southampton Itchen?

This is not just about helping our economy grow, it is also about protecting people from poverty.
In all we do to change jobcentres, we want to support people into good, sustainable, well-paid work because that is the best way out of poverty.

What are the Government doing to ensure people do not experience such a significant cliff edge?
