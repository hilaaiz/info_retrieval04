I welcome the “Keep Britain Working” review but, according to last year’s DWP accounts, £4.2 billion of benefits were underpaid to claimants, and the claimants most affected were disabled people.
What will the Government do to ensure that disabled people who may not be able to work get the money to which they are entitled?
