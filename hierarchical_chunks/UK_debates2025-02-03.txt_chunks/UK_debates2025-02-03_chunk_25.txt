I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
The assessment I have made is of a trend that is up, up, up after 14 years of the Conservative party failing to act.
We lost £9.7 billion in fraud and error in the Department for Work and Pensions last year, and we have lost £35 billion since the pandemic.
That is too much, which is why I hope colleagues will support the Public Authorities (Fraud, Error and Recovery) Bill on Second Reading later.
