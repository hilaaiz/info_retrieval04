The Secretary of State was asked— What assessment she has made of the impact of jobcentres on economic growth.
What assessment she has made of the impact of jobcentres on economic growth.
Increasing employment and helping people into good work is essential to growing our economy, which is why our “Get Britain Working” plan sets out our vision to reform jobcentres and build a new jobs and careers service that will meet the different needs of local labour markets, people and businesses.
On Friday, I visited the assessment centre at the west Ealing jobcentre, where staff told me the assessments focus on proving that disabled people cannot work, rather than identifying what jobs they could do if they had the right support.
Many disabled people in my constituency are eager for a good job.
What more could jobcentres and the Department do to help disabled people into work, rather than simply writing them off?
