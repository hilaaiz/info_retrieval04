The Prime Minister was right to authorise the defence of Israel and the avoidance of violence and death, but violence has also erupted in the west bank over the last few days, as he will know.
What concrete steps can we take to protect those civilians?
I have personally repeatedly raised with Prime Minister Netanyahu the issue of settler violence in the west bank, as have my colleagues including the deputy Foreign Secretary.
We have joined with allies in sanctioning the activity of particular individuals where it has been brought to our attention and we will continue to ensure that the Israeli Government do everything they can to reduce tension in the west bank.
It is not conducive to long-term peace in the region, and that is why we have taken action where we can, as well as being explicit with the Israeli Government about our concerns.
Mr Speaker, I knew your father well for a very long time.
He was a fine man, and I am sincerely sorry for your loss.
There was not one single word in the Prime Minister’s statement of condemnation of the Israeli destruction of the Iranian consulate in Damascus, which is the proximate reason for the event everyone is here in concert condemning.
He was not even asked to do so by the Opposition  Front Bench.
Kay Burley is the only person so far to demand that of a Government Minister.
We have no treaty with Israel—at least not one that Parliament has been shown.
The Iranians are not likely to listen to the Prime Minister when Britain occupied Iran, looted its wealth and overthrew its one democratic socialist Government in my lifetime.
Whatever may have happened a few weeks ago, it is absolutely no justification for launching more than 300 drones and missiles from one sovereign state towards Israel—it is as simple as that.
In the hon.
Gentleman’s question, not once did he condemn that action or, indeed, the actions of Hamas in the region.
There is no equivalence between these things whatever, and to suggest otherwise is simply wrong.
