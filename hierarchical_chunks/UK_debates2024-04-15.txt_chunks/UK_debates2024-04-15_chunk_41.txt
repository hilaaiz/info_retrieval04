I thank my right hon.
Friend for the role he has played in ensuring the security of the UK and our allies over previous years.
My statement  alluded to the fact that the Ukrainians were suffering from Iranian drones over the same weekend that this happened.
Not only will I, as always, be taking up his points with all our allies in urging them to do more to support Ukraine, but I know he will have welcomed the recent announcement a few weeks ago of more support from the UK to Ukraine, specifically in the areas of uncrewed platforms on autonomous warfare to make sure the Ukrainians have the ability both to protect themselves and to conduct their operations.
The majority of the 10,000 new platforms we are delivering to the Ukrainians have been developed in the UK, which my right hon.
Friend was keen to ensure we saw the benefits of here at home.
I am glad that has been realised, both supporting Ukraine and its security and bolstering the British defence industry here at home.
