My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
Birth rates are driven by myriad social and economic factors, which I have to concede are beyond my control, but I have spoken with my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer about related issues and recognise that GDP per capita is an important metric, as is overall GDP.
We are ensuring that we invest in a British workforce: my right hon.
Friend the Education Secretary is passionate about apprenticeships and lifelong learning.
We want to be a high-skilled, high-income economy, rather than a low-skilled, mass-migration economy.
That remains the Government’s priority, and we are taking action through our immigration policy to reflect that desire.
Trhas Teklehaimanot Tesfay is one of the elite female cyclists chosen to lead RideLondon next month.
She is also an asylum seeker, living in a hotel in my constituency where the food is so bad it makes her sick and unable to compete.
Last month, an investigation by Sustain found food for asylum seekers that was undercooked, past its sell-by date and infested with insects, which in some cases left them malnourished and hospitalised.
Could the Secretary  of State investigate this scandal and the responsibility of the contractor Clearsprings, so that asylum seekers  such as Trhas are not subject to such dangerous and degrading conditions?
Mr Speaker, I can assure you, the hon.
Gentleman and the House that our contractors are expected to maintain standards and, where they fall below those standards, they will be held to account.
I will absolutely take note of the case that the hon.
Gentleman has raised.
