The Secretary of State was asked— What recent progress his Department has made on reducing net migration.
I put on record my condolences for your loss, Mr Speaker.
The Government have implemented a number of measures to reduce net migration.
Those include restricting overseas students from bringing family dependants to the UK while they study, stopping overseas care workers from bringing family dependants, increasing the salary threshold for skilled worker visas—ultimately to £38,700—and increasing the minimum income requirements for family visas.
We recognise that levels of migration have been too high and, upon my appointment, I immediately took action to bring those figures down.
