I thank my right hon.
Friend for his answer, but one of the main drivers of immigration over the past 20 years or so has been labour shortages caused by falling birth rates.
According to projections by Philip Pilkington and Paul Morland, if birth rates do not increase, immigration will have to rise to over a third of the population over the next 50 years if we are going to maintain a sufficient working-age population.
Immigration on this scale has no democratic consent and obviously my right hon.
Friend has promised repeatedly to reduce net migration, so what discussions has he had with colleagues in the Treasury about this issue?
Does he agree that the Government must have a strategy to address falling birth rates, to ensure that we do not always have to rely on ever-increasing rates of immigration?
