My hon.
Friend is at the frontline of our fight against illegal migration, but legal migration is important.
We have recognised that, for a number of reasons, the figures have been too high in the most recent couple of years and I have listed measures we have taken.
The combined impact of that is that, by our estimations, under the new regime that I have put in place, 300,000 people who would previously have been eligible will no longer be eligible.
That is the order of magnitude of change that we will eventually see once these proposals are fully implemented.
The refusal to allow care workers from overseas to bring a spouse with them comes at the same time as, in Cumbria, we are finding it impossible to fill at least a fifth of all the social care jobs.
Would the Home Secretary explain to constituents of mine who are unable to find people to care for them and their loved ones why it seems sensible to make the lives of people from overseas so miserable in coming over here to care for our loved ones that they do not come at all?
I recognise that, in rural communities, recruitment and retention of staff is difficult and in the hon.
Member’s constituency—a wonderful, beautiful, but very rural constituency—there are particular pressures.
I can assure him that the global supply of potential care workers is very significant.
Actually, the issues about where in the country those people work are more about the internal dynamic within the UK economy than the quantum of people around the world who would seek to work in the UK.
There are plenty of people who would wish to work here, recognising that they are not allowed to bring their dependants with them, but the issue of where in the country those people work is actually a broader issue.
