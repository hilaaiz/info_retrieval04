I thank the Prime Minister for an advance copy of his statement, and for the regular briefings on the developing situation in the middle east.
I also thank him for his warm tribute to your father, Mr Speaker.
Doug Hoyle  was a great servant of our party, respected by all who knew him.
I also join the Prime Minister in offering our solidarity with the victims of the horrific attack in Sydney, and in recognising the heroism of the three British aid workers killed in Gaza while working for World Central Kitchen.
