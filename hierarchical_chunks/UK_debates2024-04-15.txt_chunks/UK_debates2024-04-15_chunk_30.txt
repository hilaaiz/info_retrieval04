My condolences, Mr Speaker, on the loss of your father.
This remains a dangerous moment, yet over the weekend we saw a demonstration of unity and purpose.
We saw the depth of will for normalisation and for a secure  future for all peoples of the middle east.
Restraint is vital if we want to build on the momentum to get hostages home to their families and to get improvements to continuing aid, but to better protect our people, will my right hon.
Friend commit to launching with our allies a new consensus on Iran and a new effort—with combined diplomatic, military and wider expert areas—to limit the extent of the atrocities of Iran?
We need to end the compartmentalisation of threats when we deal with Iran; we must deal with it as one, whether on its nuclear ambitious, the arming of the militia, femicide or transnational repression.
Only with a new consensus will we see that progress, so will he please commit to leading that internationally?
I can give my hon.
Friend that commitment.
That was exactly the subject of our discussions among the G7 leaders yesterday.
She mentions nuclear.
Iran’s nuclear programme has never been more advanced than it is today; it threatens international peace and security.
There is absolutely no justification, at a civilian level, for the enrichment that we are seeing and which the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported in Iran.
I want to reassure her that we are considering next steps on the nuclear file with our international partners, and we are committed to using all diplomatic tools available to ensure that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon, including using the snapback mechanism if necessary.
