I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.
The Liberal Democrats join him in condemning Iran’s attack on Israel: this is an alarming escalation in a conflict that has already seen far too many deaths and far too much suffering.
We support the action taken by the RAF to intercept Iranian drones as we stand up for Israel’s security.
