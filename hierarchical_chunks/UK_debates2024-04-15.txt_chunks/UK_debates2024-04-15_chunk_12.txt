I thank my hon.
Friend enormously for raising this question.
Let me be clear that the hostile activity we have seen from Chinese authorities and state-affiliated groups poses a serious threat to the security and wellbeing of the British people and to our partners and allies across the world.
The Deputy Prime Minister came to this Chamber last month to speak about the pattern of malign activity, including the targeting of our parliamentarians and two malicious cyber-campaigns by Chinese state-affiliated actors.
We must never be afraid to stand up for ourselves and to call out this kind of activity that has targeted both my hon.
Friend and me.
