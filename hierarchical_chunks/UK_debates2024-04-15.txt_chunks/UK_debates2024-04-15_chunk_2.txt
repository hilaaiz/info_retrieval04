I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
We want to not just help with crisis support, but prevent our young people from getting into a position of crisis in the first place, so we are rolling out mental health support teams, ahead of our schedule, across schools.
That is a really important piece of work that will help 44% of the student population, but we want to go even further.
In the 12-month period ending in  March 2021, we increased the number of children and young people aged under 18 who received NHS-funded mental health services to some 758,000.
Of course, we want that support to be there in the community, but importantly we also want to help clinicians to understand that this is just one of several sets of conditions that they should have confidence to work on, in order to look after the child holistically.
