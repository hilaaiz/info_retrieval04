I thank my right hon.
Friend for the leadership he has shown on this issue, and I echo his call for the need to avoid a spiral escalation.
However, we have seen a military attack by Iran on a nation that its regime believes should not exist at all.
Iran has directly or indirectly engineered a war in Gaza, with the aim of thwarting better relations between Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, and Israel.
We now have death and destruction in Gaza in a conflict that no one can win, and where the only beneficiaries are Iran, its proxies and its allies.
We have seen an Iranian journalist attacked on British soil, and we have seen an international vessel being pirated by the IRGC in international waters—another vile example of hostage taking.
So I ask my right hon.
Friend again: why is Iran Air still operating out of Heathrow, and why are Iranian banks still operating in the City of London?
When will the snapback mechanism be invoked, and what can be done to stop the export of Iranian oil to Russia and other countries, which is now keeping the regime afloat?
