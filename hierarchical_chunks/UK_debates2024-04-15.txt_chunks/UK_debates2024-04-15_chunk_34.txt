I thank my right hon.
Friend for his excellent question.
He is right about the importance of air defence, which is why it has repeatedly been one of the key capabilities that we have sought to provide to Ukraine—that is something we have led on for some time.
Ditto, some of the new contracts that we have placed to replenish UK stockpiles, most recently this year, also cover air defence missiles.
More broadly, my right hon.
Friend is right that we need to ensure our industrial production here in the UK is geared to produce the capabilities we need, whether for our own use or for Ukraine’s.
I am pleased to say that the Defence Secretary is working with the industry to ensure that supply chain is there to meet those needs.
