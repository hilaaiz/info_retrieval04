I thank my hon.
Friend for her work in this area.
The issues that she raises are of direct importance to intelligence gathering  and child protection.
My officials have been working closely with Border Force to ensure that its powers keep pace with the digital age.
When the next legislative opportunity arises, if not before, we will carefully consider giving Border Force powers to compel individuals to submit to searches of their devices, if they are suspected of holding child sexual abuse material.
