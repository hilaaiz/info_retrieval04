I thank my right hon.
Friend for his leadership on this issue over a consistent period of time, and he is right to highlight the threats that Iran poses to us.
I want to reassure him that, on all of the areas that he mentioned, active work has been undertaken by the Government.
As I mentioned in my statement, we discussed yesterday on the G7 call the need for and benefit of co-ordinating further measures, perhaps including some of the things that he talked about, among allies in order to have maximum impact both on the regime and the ultimate designations of any future sanctions.
I am pleased that our new sanctions regime, which we implemented at the end of last year, gives us extensive new powers.
I am keen to make sure we use them to good effect, but where we can co-ordinate those with allies, I know he would agree with me that that would be preferable, and I can reassure him that that work is happening at pace.
