Before we begin today’s proceedings, I would like to thank right hon.
and hon.
Members in all parts of the House for their kind messages following the death of my father.
I gained so much from him: a love of cricket, of rugby league and of animals, but most of all, an abiding sense of the importance of public service.
He was a giant of the Labour and trade union movement and a great parliamentarian.
I know he will be greatly missed by his former colleagues in this House and in other places, but most of all by family and friends.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
] I now turn to the election of the Chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee.
I wish to inform the House that I have received a letter from  the hon.
Member for Hazel Grove (Mr Wragg)  informing me of his resignation as Chair of that Committee.
I therefore declare the Chair vacant.
Nominations for the election of a successor are now open, and will close at 12 noon on  Tuesday 7 May .
Nomination forms are available from the Vote Office, the Table Office and the Public Bill Office.
Only Members of the Conservative party may be candidates in this election.
If there is more than one candidate, the ballot will take place on  Wednesday 8 May .
A briefing note with more information about the election will be made available from the Vote Office.
