I thank my right hon.
Friend for his strong support for the state of Israel.
Last year, as Israel and Saudi Arabia were about to strike a transformational agreement, Iran-backed Hamas carried out its massacre on  7 October  with the aim of torpedoing the chance of peace between Israel and the Arab nations.
Last Saturday’s drone attack by Iran being thwarted by Israel and her allies, including Jordan, demonstrates that our countries can work alongside Israel after this new period of contention.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that this represents a new opportunity for Israel and the Arab nations to rebuild relations in the aftermath of  7 October  and bring the hostages home?
