I thank the hon.
Lady for drawing attention to the appalling record of the previous Government on affordable housing, in particular social rented housing.
Over the past 10 years, the number of social rented homes owned by registered providers fell by over 205,000.
We have to take action to better protect our stock and build new social rented homes, but she is absolutely right that further reform is needed of compulsory purchase orders, how they are drawn and the powers available to councils.
We first need to enact the changes that were introduced by the previous Government though the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023, but we intend to go further, and will consult on that in due course.
