It has been reported that the Secretary of State is being lobbied to increase council tax and remove discounts such as the single occupancy discount.
Will she take this opportunity to reassure the House that the Government have no plans to increase council tax, as they assured us before the election?
Yes.
My constituent Tracy was recently issued with a section 21 notice to quit and, at the same time, a section 13 rent increase that she cannot afford.
She fears being made homeless with her children, so she got in touch with Newcastle city council for a council property, but the wait is 27 weeks on average and often much longer.
When will good tenants be protected from unfair evictions and extortionate rent increases?
I am deeply saddened to hear of the plight of Tracy and her children.
Our renters’ rights Bill will protect tenants from arbitrary eviction and empower them to challenge unreasonable within-tenancy rent rises.
I can assure my hon.
Friend that Tracy and others facing similar insecurity will not have long to wait for that Bill’s introduction.
