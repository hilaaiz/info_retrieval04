I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
It was great to visit Blackpool during the general election campaign, and I visited Blackpool on many occasions during my childhood as well.
My Department is working in partnership with Blackpool to unlock significant investment.
I have seen that more needs to be done to unleash Blackpool’s great potential, and I will work with my hon.
Friend on the ongoing regeneration of Blackpool to deliver better-quality housing and a stronger local economy.
And you never know, we might visit the nightlife as well.
