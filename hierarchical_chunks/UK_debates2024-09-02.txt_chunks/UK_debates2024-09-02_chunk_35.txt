I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his comments on my dance moves; that opinion is subjective, like beauty, of course.
On a serious note, I find it astonishing that Conservative Members, after running down the economy in the way that they did,  and after the Chancellor has had to come to the House and talk about the billion-pound black hole, are now trying to claim that this Government are about raising taxes.
This Government are about making sure that working people are better off, and we intend to do that.
