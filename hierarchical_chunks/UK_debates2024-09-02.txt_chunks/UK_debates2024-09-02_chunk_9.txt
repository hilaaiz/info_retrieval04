I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
We want to see greater flexibility, and we want to see more integrated, single-settlement funding pots so that local communities have that flexibility.
We are dealing with a transition from the previous model that we inherited, and it will take time to re-engineer from one to the other.
Initial spending decisions will be a matter for  30 October  but, in principle, I understand exactly what he is saying and the value that communities would take from that.
