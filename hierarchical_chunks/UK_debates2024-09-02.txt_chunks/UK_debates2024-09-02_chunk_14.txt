It is always a pleasure to hear from the hon.
Member, and he is absolutely right.
When I was visiting those communities, I saw them coming together.
I saw the way in which they worked well and the way in which everybody looked out for each other.
It reminded me of why I am in this place and why I do what I do for the great British people and what they do.
In Westmorland, we have a story that has underpinned cohesion for decades.
That is the true story of the Windermere children.
In August 1945, almost half the children who survived the Nazi death camps were rehabilitated on the banks of Windermere at Troutbeck Bridge.
I wonder if the Deputy Prime Minister would agree to meet me, because a group of us, including members of the ’45 Aid Society and the local school, the Lakes school, want to build a lasting memorial at Troutbeck Bridge, on the site where the children were housed, while rebuilding the school that was built on that site.
Will she carry on the cross-party work that we had before the election, and meet me and others from that community to help make that a reality?
I congratulate the hon.
Member on his work in this area.
Either myself or one of my Ministers will be happy to meet him.
