I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I was proud to serve alongside my good friend Jo Cox in this House, and her words about our common humanity and what unites us ring as true as ever.
I have met many local communities, businesses and other groups affected by the acts of deplorable violence that we have seen across the country in recent weeks, including in places such as Stoke-on-Trent and Rotherham.
I heard powerful stories from those who experienced appalling violence, but I also heard about how those communities came together to defend their streets and were united against hatred and thuggery.
I know that my hon.
Friend has been a leader in her own community, and we Ministers will support her and her constituents in the spirit that she has set out.
