I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for her answers.
Sometimes it is easy to dwell upon the negativity, but there are positives as well.
There were positives in my constituency when two people decided to burn down the mosque, because they were caught by the police and they will hopefully be imprisoned, and because the community came together, which is the issue I want to put over.
Across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, there are many people who want to live together.
All the people in the Baptist church that I go to in Newtownards were praying for those people in that church, and that is the Ards and the Strangford that I know.
Sometimes we need to put over the good things as well.
