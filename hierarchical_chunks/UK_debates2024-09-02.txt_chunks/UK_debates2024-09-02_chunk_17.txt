I thank the Minister for expressing the wish of many of us to see this awful system disposed of.
Will he draw his colleagues’ attention to the fact that people like me, living in a leasehold block, have the experience of winning a first tier tribunal hearing against a freeholder, but still awaiting the refunding of the sums of money that were wrongly taken from us in the first place?
The freeholder simply ignores everything and carries on as if nothing had happened.
