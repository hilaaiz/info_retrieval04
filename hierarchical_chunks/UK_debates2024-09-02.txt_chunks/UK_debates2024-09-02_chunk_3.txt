I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I totally agree on the important role that healthy and vibrant high streets play for communities.
Initiatives such as Love Gillingham are vital in bringing local people together to create high streets that work for them.
Ensuring that local authorities and the communities they serve have the tools they need to support the high street is a priority.
With regards to ownership, HM Land Registry is searchable for a variety of information, but I welcome the chance to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss that, and perhaps Love Gillingham as well.
