This evening, a Member of this House was due to speak at an event at Cambridge University.
That event will not go ahead as planned because of safety concerns.
It is absolutely not for us to question operational decision making, but it absolutely is for us to question this Government about legislation and the effects—direct, indirect and chilling—of the decisions they have made since coming to office.
Last year, the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act became law.
In the end, having attracted cross-party support after extensive working with students and academics, it passed all its stages in Parliament and received Royal Assent.
That Act is about protecting free speech on campus, including for visiting speakers, and it is about academic freedom to challenge conventional wisdom and put forward unpopular and controversial opinions.
However, in July this year, the new Secretary of State decided—without any parliamentary debate—not to commence that Act.
