I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and completely understand the concerns that she raises about congestion in the area.
The outlined business case submitted by KenEx, to which she refers, was unfortunately unable to progress further after its submission in 2022, as it lacked critical detail.
Should alternatives be brought forward, I am sure that they will be considered.
