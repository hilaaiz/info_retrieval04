I welcome the Secretary of State’s decision to approve the new roll-on, roll-off shipping terminal at Immingham.
However, as she will be aware, it will put more pressure on the local road network, particularly the A180.
Will she bring forward improvements to the A180, particularly the removal of the concrete surfaces?
Long term, we really need the A180 to be upgraded to motorway status.
