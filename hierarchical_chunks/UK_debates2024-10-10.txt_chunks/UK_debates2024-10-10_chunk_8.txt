Order.
Can I just say to Members who have been here a long time, please speak to the Chair?
They should be speaking through a third party, not directly.
I am trying to take some of the anger out of it.
Please work with me on that.
I am very grateful to you, Mr Speaker, as I am to my hon.
Friend for raising that important question.
He is absolute right.
Average waiting times at the Wood Green centre currently sit just above the national average.
The measures that the DVSA is already taking to reduce waiting times include conducting tests outside regular hours, at weekends and on public holidays, and continuing to deploy examiners from areas with lower waiting times.
That is in addition to producing additional examiners across the country in areas where waiting times are highest.
We will soon set out to the House further steps by which we will bring down waiting times further.
