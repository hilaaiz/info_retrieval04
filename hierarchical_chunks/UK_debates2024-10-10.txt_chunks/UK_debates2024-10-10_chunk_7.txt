I welcome the fact that the Secretary of State has met the chief executive of the DVSA to discuss urgent solutions to the sky-high driving test waiting times.
According to the latest statistics, the waiting time in the Wood Green driving test centre in my constituency was 18.64 weeks.
Will my right hon.
Friend confirm that this issue is a top priority for the Government, so that my constituents can be reassured that driving test waiting times will be drastically reduced?
