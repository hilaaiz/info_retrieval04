I have heard all about the A180 from the hon.
Gentleman, and from my hon.
Friend  the Member for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes (Melanie Onn) , so I know about the issues that it is causing his constituents.
We will write to him with a National Highways update.
The town of Stratford-upon-Avon is one of the most visited locations in the UK, yet for many years we have not had a direct train to the capital.
What steps is the Secretary of State taking to fix the lack of capacity in Chiltern Railways so that my constituents and visitors can travel directly and sustainably to and from London?
That sort of service and provision is exactly what the reforms around Great British Railways are designed to address.
Decisions around infrastructure and operations will be made together so that we can deliver services that make sense for the hon.
Lady’s constituents, for visitors and for the economy as a whole.
One hundred and fifty parishes in Devon wrote to Devon county council last year asking for 20 mph zones, but only six were successful.
Those that were not successful were told that they could pursue the measure through so-called “community self-delivery.”
My constituents think, “But this is what we pay our council tax for.”
Does the Secretary of State understand that?
I am very grateful for the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
It is absolutely my position that if local residents want to design and support local measures around speeding and road safety, they should be supported to do so by their local authorities.
(Urgent Question): To ask the Secretary of State if she will make a statement on freedom of speech in universities.
It was a Labour Government who enshrined in law the right to freedom of expression, and it is a Labour Government who will again uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom on our university campuses—not through creating a culture war, but through working with academics, students and campaigners to get the legislation right.
