The Secretary of State wrote to colleagues and made a written statement on  26 July 2024  on her decision to pause further commencement of the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 in order to consider options.
We have heard concerns from minority groups and others that that Act and its implementation may have unintended consequences and result in disproportionate burdens for universities and student unions.
Many are concerned that it could push providers to overlook the safety and wellbeing of minority groups over fears of sanction and costly action.
I want to provide the House with reassurance that this Government believe that higher education must be a space for robust discussion that exposes both students and academics to challenging ideas.
The decision to pause the Act was made precisely because of the importance of getting this legislation right.
The Secretary of State indicated in her written statement that she would confirm her long-term plans for the Act “as soon as possible”.
Since then, officials and Ministers have engaged with a wide range of stakeholders on the future of the Act.
This includes representatives of higher education providers and academics, including those from the Committee for Academic Freedom, Academics for Academic Freedom and the London Universities’ Council for Academic Freedom.
Those officials and Ministers will continue to engage with stakeholders before any final decision is made.
