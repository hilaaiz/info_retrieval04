Can the Minister reflect on the dire inheritance in education, particularly in the higher education sector?
My hon.
Friend raises an important point about the wider landscape and the challenges facing our higher education sector.
Our universities are not just vital for upholding freedom of expression, freedom of speech, academic debate and rigour; they are also incredible seats of opportunity that must be unleashed up and down this country.
We will continue to do everything we can to support economic growth, which we know is supported by higher education, and indeed by the whole of education.
The Government are committed to that unleashing of opportunity.
