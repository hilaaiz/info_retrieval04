After just 100 days, this is already one of the most anti-growth Governments in history, from investor-scaring taxes to the right hon.
Lady hitting the brakes on our transport infrastructure pipeline, with Northern Powerhouse Rail, the Midlands Rail Hub and road upgrades across the country all on hold.
Growth requires investment and investment requires confidence.
Will she give some to the businesses looking to invest, to the contractors waiting to get started, and, crucially, to the communities that so badly need these upgrades?
I wonder whether the hon.
Lady has spoken to any businesses or infrastructure providers over the past 14 years who have suffered appalling uncertainty and a lack of confidence.
Her Government presided over billions of pounds of waste and failure in the delivery of infrastructure and have cost our economy hundreds of billions of pounds.
I was expecting the right hon.
Lady to say something along the lines of “wait for the Budget”, or “wait for the spending review”, as we have heard many times during this question session.
However, she did not wait for the Budget to give unions a massive pay rise, to re-announce our plan to get HS2 to Euston, or to signal billions of pounds for a new HS2-light.
If she can make those decisions before the Budget, surely she can confirm that every penny of investment that we had committed to transport through Network North will continue to be invested in our country’s transport infra- structure.
The hon.
Lady can wait for the Budget!
Dangerous driving is a major concern, particularly following a serious crash in my constituency last week.
With West Midlands police committed to Vision Zero, what additional support is the Department for Transport providing to help local enforcement and campaigns to tackle speeding and other dangerous driving behaviours?
