I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s comments and recognise much within them.
The rise in antisemitic abuse on higher education campuses is deeply concerning, and this Government take it extremely seriously.
We regularly meet Universities UK to discuss what support universities are offering to Jewish students on campus and how they are tackling antisemitic abuse.
We also regularly meet the Union of Jewish Students, the University Jewish Chaplaincy and the Community Security Trust, and we will continue to do so to make sure that we get this right.
