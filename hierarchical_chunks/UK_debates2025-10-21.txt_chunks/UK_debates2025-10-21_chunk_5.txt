Not only have the Conservatives failed to get in the news, but they have clearly not been reading it either.
There have been no doctors strikes in the NHS since before the summer, and we have sat down with resident doctors and their new leadership to try to avert future strike action.
The hon.

That is why I have asked Baroness Amos to chair an independent investigation into NHS maternity and neonatal services.
Families deserve truth and justice, there must be accountability for failings, and services must improve.
I am committing to doing whatever it takes to provide patients and babies with safe, comfortable and dignified care.
