Whatever the impact of these new online services, the Opposition Front-Bench team have drawn attention to the fact that waiting lists in England have risen for the last three months.
I can inform the House this morning that waiting lists in Scotland are coming down.
Would the Minister like to explain why that is the case?
I am so glad the hon.
Gentleman took the time to ask that question, because while we invest in digital services, Scotland and Scottish patients are still waiting for the most basic digital infrastructure.
While we invest record amounts in Scotland’s budget, the SNP’s excuses keep rising.
What he needs to answer is why Scottish patients are living in a digital desert, while patients here in England are getting more and more sophisticated NHS digital services.
What steps his Department is taking to reduce the time taken for cancer diagnoses.
This Government are investing an extra £26 billion in the NHS, opening up community diagnostic centres at evenings and weekends and delivering 5 million more appointments to catch cancer earlier.
We are making progress: 135,000 more patients have already had cancer diagnosed or ruled out within the 28-day target compared with the previous year—a lot done, and a lot more to do.
A local teacher went to her GP with clear symptoms of a facial tumour but was told it was simply the effects of age.
It took almost two years to receive a confirmed diagnosis, including eight months lost in the system after an urgent referral.
Does the Minister agree that reducing times for cancer diagnosis must start with strengthening systems to support early recognition and  follow-up, so that no one is left waiting?
I wish the Minister well with her own cancer battle and thank her for bravely sharing her experience of living with cancer.
