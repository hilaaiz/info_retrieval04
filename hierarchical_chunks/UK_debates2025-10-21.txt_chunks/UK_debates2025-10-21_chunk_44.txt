In my constituency of Stafford, Eccleshall and the villages, I recently ran a survey, which had a whopping 99% response rate, in support of an urgent treatment centre in my constituency.
Would the Minister agree to meet me to discuss urgent treatment provision in my constituency?
My hon.
Friend does an excellent job in her constituency.
I meet her regularly to discuss issues in her constituency, and I am very happy to discuss the provision of urgent care centres with her.
Greater transparency about NHS data should be used to drive improvements, so what assessment has the Health Secretary made of the impact on the Queen Elizabeth hospital in King’s Lynn of being forced to make savings of £18 million this year?
What impact will that have on the need to reduce waiting times for A&E and cancer treatment, as identified in the league table that he published?
We are putting £26 billion more into the NHS this year, which is investment that was opposed by the Conservative party.
As the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on dyslexia—an issue on which I have campaigned for many years—I remain alarmed at the high number of dyslexic people who still need to use mental health services.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can better serve dyslexic people in Broxtowe and across the UK, and will he consider measures to prevent more dyslexic people from needing mental health services?
I am very grateful to my hon.
Friend for sharing her personal experiences, and I would be delighted to meet her.
