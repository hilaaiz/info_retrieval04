It has been four months and longer since the Home Office announced the national statutory inquiry into group-based child sexual exploitation.
I know that Ministers will have wanted quicker progress.
We on the Liberal Democrat Benches do, too.
We still have no chair, no terms of reference and, most importantly, no justice for the victims who have already waited years.
Now, two members of the victims and survivors liaison panel have stepped down after raising concerns about shortlisted chairs.
They seem to have lost confidence in the process before it has begun.
The Home Office must listen to and act on the concerns of victims—I know that the Minister will agree—and get the inquiry off the ground.
That is the only way to ensure that it proceeds with integrity and the trust of those it is meant to serve.
Now is the time to prioritise justice and prevention over political point scoring—I know that the Minister will agree with me on that, too—because this is an extremely sensitive matter, particularly for the victims.
Will the Minister commit to publishing the terms of reference along with full details of the inquiry’s budget and staffing and a timeline by the end of the month?
If not to that deadline, when will that be published?
