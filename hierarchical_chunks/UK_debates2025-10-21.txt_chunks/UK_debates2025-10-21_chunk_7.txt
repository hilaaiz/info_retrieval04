Safe maternity care depends on adequate staffing, and we on these Benches have been calling for better recruitment and retention of staff in women’s health services for a long time now.
Can the Secretary of State outline what specific measures the Government are taking to address the shortage of midwives and specialist neonatal nurses across England?
We need to make sure that there is better staffing and that we have the right people in the right place.
I should just caution the House, though,  because in recent years there has been an increase in staffing but not a corresponding increase in the quality of care, so we have to make sure we are looking at this issue in a nuanced way.
It is about having the right staff in the right place at the right time to deliver safe maternity and perinatal services, and that is exactly what we will do.
