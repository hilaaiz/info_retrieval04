I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
He will have seen that, in the 10-year plan, we have committed to tie-ins.
Once the current cohort is through its studies, new cohorts will be tied into doing NHS dentistry for a period after graduation.
I am sure that he welcomes that very important measure.
