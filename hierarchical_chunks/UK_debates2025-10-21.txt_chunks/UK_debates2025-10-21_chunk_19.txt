I thank the Minister for her response.
My constituent Ruth Wake, who lives in Brewood, was tragically diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in January last year.
She has gone through chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, and while she has made good process and is in remission, sadly the stem cell transplant has failed after nine and a half months.
Under the current rules, if it fails in under a year she cannot have a second stem cell transplant.
I know the pressures that the Minister is under in terms of her time, but my constituent has so little time.
Could she look at this particular case, and also look at guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which were written over 12 years ago?
Science and treatment have moved so rapidly, and I wonder if the Minister could look at both those points.
