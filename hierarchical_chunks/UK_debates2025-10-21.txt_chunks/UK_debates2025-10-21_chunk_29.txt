Earlier this year, I visited the “hospital at home” team at the John Radcliffe hospital, who run an incredible virtual ward.
I saw them deliver care to Mavis, who is 91.
She was so emotional and grateful for the work they did—we all ended up in tears.
Imagine my disappointment that while I was off, we got an email from the team saying that the funding for that incredible service is no longer there and that they face closure.
This is an example of the best of the NHS.
We want it rolled out to the rest, but if the funding is not there for these nascent services to find their footing, how can we ensure that best practice can be spread across the whole of Oxfordshire and beyond?
The hon.
Lady makes a very valid point: this is about the shift from hospital to community, which we have to drive forward.
In September 2025, 12,522 virtual ward beds were available—an increase from 12,497 in September 2024.
Slowly but surely, we are increasing the number of virtual ward beds and the capability of virtual wards, but there is still a long way to go.
I absolutely accept the point that the hon.
Lady makes.
What steps he is taking to transfer care from hospitals into the community.
The Darzi investigation found that NHS resources are too focused on hospitals at the expense of community care.
Our reforms will turn the NHS into more of a neighbourhood health service.
We have already recruited an extra 2,000 more GPs, we are rolling out 700,000 extra dental appointments, and we have agreed a new contract of investment and reform for community pharmacy.
As part of our 10-year plan, we will be rolling out neighbourhood health centres across the country, starting with the places that are in the greatest need.
