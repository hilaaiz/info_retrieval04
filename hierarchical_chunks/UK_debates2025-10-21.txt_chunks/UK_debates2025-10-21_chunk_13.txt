I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing this crucial issue to light.
Early access to high-quality support is critical for young people struggling with their mental health.
That is backed by us with an extra £688 million this year.
We are hiring more staff, expanding support teams in schools and boosting support in new Young Futures hubs so that children can get the best possible start in life.
Although initially not focused on CAMHS, the scope of the NHS online hospital is a personal priority for the Prime Minister and has the capacity to grow, and we will consider incorporating it when safely able to alongside other services.
