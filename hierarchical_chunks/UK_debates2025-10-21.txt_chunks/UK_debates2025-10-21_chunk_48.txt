I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue, and I offer my sympathy and best wishes to Jules and her family.
Of course, I commend her awareness-raising work, which is really important.
Her experience is one of the reasons why we are rolling out targeted lung screening and starting to use artificial intelligence to detect discrepancies in screening.
