I welcome the changes in the GP booking system, but in many cases it is still very difficult to obtain a GP appointment on the Isle of Wight.
A large factor in that is the difficulty of recruiting GPs to the island.
Will the Minister assure me that he will investigate all options for improving GP recruitment to coastal, rural and island communities, like mine?
