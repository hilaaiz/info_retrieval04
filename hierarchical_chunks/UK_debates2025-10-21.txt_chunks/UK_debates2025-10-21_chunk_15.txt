I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and her well wishes.
We are taking cancer detection seriously in general practice, and there is work to do.
It is why we have recently launched Jess’s rule, which is a patient safety initiative that means when patients return three times with worsening or undiagnosed symptoms, GPs must reflect, review and rethink.
That could include a second opinion, episodic continuity of care or ordering additional tests.
I wish her constituent the very best and offer her my sympathies in her diagnosis.
