I thank the Minister for her continued work.
All victims and survivors have not had their voice heard for too long.
We need to ensure that that happens and I am sure that the Minister is doing that.
Will she confirm what resources are available to ensure that survivors are properly supported through the process?
On system delays, we know that there are still issues with court delays and ensuring we go after all the perpetrators.
Will she give an update on that and on the Jay inquiry recommendations?
