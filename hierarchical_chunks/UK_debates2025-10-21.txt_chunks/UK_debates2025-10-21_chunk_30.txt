I thank my hon.
Friend for his answer, and for the brilliant work that the whole team is doing to put the NHS 10-year plan into action.
Transferring care into the community will give many more patients quick and easy access to specialist care when they need it.
However, access to Parkinson’s nurses—who are worth their weight in gold—remains deeply unequal.
Too often, patients are left without nurses and have to travel a long way to see a specialist nurse.
Worse still, the few Parkinson’s nurses who are available are predominantly funded by Parkinson’s UK.
Can the Minister set out what steps are being taken to increase equitable access to Parkinson’s nurses across the country?
