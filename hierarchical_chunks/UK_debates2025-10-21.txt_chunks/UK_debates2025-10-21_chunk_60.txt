I thank the hon.
Gentleman, who is in a unique category of always asking a question that leads me to further questions that are pertinent.
An inquiry does not usually report to the House while it is ongoing, but I will take that away to see if there is an appetite for that.
All I can say is that there is no institution in the country, including this one here, that does not have skeletons.
Do I think all politicians would not be robust in this?
No, I do not.
I think some would.
I can guarantee that I can point at people, the hon.
Gentleman included, who would show absolute rigour even against his own.
The independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, IICSA, had a judge leading it and it lost the confidence of the victims.
Three people lost the confidence of the victims.
It took two years.
There is not an institution that did not fail those girls.
That is the whole point.
There is no clean skin, but there are brilliant people who whistleblew and who tried, in every one of those institutions.
That is essentially where we are left with this, but I promise rigour in the same way that, when I saw things happening in here, I was rigorous.
