I thank my hon.
Friend.
I think she mischaracterises me as the fiercest of advocates because she, as a grooming victim, with a child born of rape, is the fiercest and bravest.
I could cry, I feel so proud that the Government sought to get her elected.
I have been campaigning for the thing she has fought for with grooming gang victims for nearly a decade.
I met with Ministers of the then Government and nothing was done.
[Interruption.]
The exact thing that she has campaigned for was asked for repeatedly and nothing was done.
I am incredibly proud of her, as it is because of her and this Government that today I can say that that will change.
