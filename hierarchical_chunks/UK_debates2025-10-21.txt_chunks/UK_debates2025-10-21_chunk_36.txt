First, it is great to be in this new role.
I genuinely want to be part of a constructive Opposition, but equally I want to do my role in holding this Government to account.
I note the lack of detail in the Secretary of State’s answers on reorganisation, so can I ask the basics again?
How many people will be made redundant, what will it cost and who is paying?
