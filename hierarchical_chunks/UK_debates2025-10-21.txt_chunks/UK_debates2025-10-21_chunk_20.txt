I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question and offer my best wishes to his constituent Ruth in her treatment.
I thank him for bringing her story to my attention.
I really do appreciate—perhaps more than most—the urgency of the matter.
Although I am unable to comment on individual cases, I understand that one of my ministerial colleagues will be writing to the right hon.
Gentleman directly on this matter in the very near future.
