I am concerned that the disruption caused by an uncosted, unplanned simultaneous reorganisation of  NHS England and the ICBs is affecting patient care.
Before the summer, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended that the RSV vaccine should be given to those over 80 and those in adult care homes.
In July, I asked the Secretary of State to confirm that this vaccine will be available in time for the winter season, and he said, “I can certainly reassure the shadow Minister on this.”—[Official
Report,  22 July 2025 ; Vol. 771, c. 677.]
The winter vaccine programme started three weeks ago.
Why has he not delivered on his promise?
We have.
As my right hon.
Friend has just said, we have delivered on that commitment.
The hon.
Member talks about the reorganisation being a distraction.
If her party had focused taxpayers’ money on patient services rather than ballooning bureaucracy, with costs increasing both among providers and through ICBs, we would not have inherited the mess that we did, and would be able to roll out programmes more effectively.
We have committed to doing that.
