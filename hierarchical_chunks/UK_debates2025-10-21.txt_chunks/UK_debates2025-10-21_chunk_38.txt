Again, the Secretary of State cannot answer.
His answers are too vague.
He is very good at making promises, but the facts are that he is presiding over a reorganisation that has stalled, creating uncertainty for staff.
Waiting lists are up 50,000 in the past three months, hospices are in crisis because of national insurance contribution rises, and we have had strikes again—despite big pay rises—with the threat of more.
If the Secretary of State wants the leadership in the future, perhaps he should show leadership in the NHS now, and tell us not just the plans, but when he will give the details and how he will deliver on his promises to patients.
Waiting lists are lower now than when Labour took office, and that is in stark contrast with the record of the Government in which the shadow Secretary of State served; waiting lists increased every single year they were in charge.
This is the first year in 15 that waiting lists have fallen.
That is the difference that a Labour Government make.
We are only just getting started.
As for leadership changes, we all know why they are calling the Leader of the Opposition “Kemi-Kaze”.
A Channel 4 “Dispatches” documentary recently went undercover at an ambulance centre  in my constituency of Gillingham and Rainham.
It showed exhausted staff working under difficult circumstances—the result of years of Tory neglect and mismanagement of our NHS.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that after the chaos under the last Government, this Administration will put staff and patients first?
Will the relevant Minister come to my constituency to meet healthcare providers and discuss our local challenges?
We know that there have been issues with the urgent emergency care response.
We are absolutely committed to supporting ambulance trusts to continually improve the patient experience.
The urgent emergency care plan for 2025-26 is backed by nearly £450 million of funding.
I am happy to discuss that further with my hon.
Friend.
