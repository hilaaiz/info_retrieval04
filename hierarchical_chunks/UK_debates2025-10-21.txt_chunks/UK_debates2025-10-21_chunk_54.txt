I have to say, it is not taking any longer than the covid inquiry or the infected blood inquiry, which I think each took seven months from their announcement to the appointment of the chair.
I do not remember huge amounts of criticism or bellyaching about that, because we wanted to get those things right.
Actually, getting this right means dealing with lots of different stakeholders and victims with different views.
The process has to be followed that the terms of reference go through the chair.
We have already done some of the work on the terms of reference with victims’ groups, but we cannot publish those—we will do that publicly, as I said—until a chair is appointed.
I will not rush that, because I will take note of all the feedback I receive.
Today, the Government have announced that they will take parental responsibility away where a child is born of rape.
That will protect grooming victims.
Children in this country will no longer be the only proceed of crime that criminals can have lifelong access to.
Does the Minister agree that survivors were failed for too long by a Conservative Government who did not prioritise giving them justice?
That party is led by the Leader of the Opposition, who did not mention grooming when she had the power to do something about it.
Instead, survivors have had to wait for victims and activists to be on the Government Benches, and for the fiercest of advocates to be at the Dispatch Box.
