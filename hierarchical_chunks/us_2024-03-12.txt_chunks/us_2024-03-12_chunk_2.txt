Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this February, I had the privilege of commemorating the 30th anniversary of the tragic passing of a fallen hero, Officer David C. Douglass.
On February 18, 1994, Officer Douglass valiantly answered the call of a burglar in the area and tragically lost his life in the line of duty.
He was not only a dedicated member of the Lower Township Police Department for 18 years but also served as a lieutenant in the Town Bank Fire Department.
His contributions to public safety extended beyond his role in law enforcement; he helped establish the Lower Township SWAT team, instructed at the Cape May County Police Academy, and served as a past president of the Policeman's Benevolent Association.
Officer Douglass was a beloved member of our community, known for his integrity, friendship, and mentorship.
His legacy lives on through his family, including his wife, son, daughter, and stepdaughter, as well as in the hearts of all who knew him.
I thank Officer David C. Douglass for his bravery, his service, and his sacrifice.
He will forever be remembered and cherished in our hearts.
God Bless Officer Douglass and God Bless the United States.
