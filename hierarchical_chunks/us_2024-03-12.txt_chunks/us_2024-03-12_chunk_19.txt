Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the many accomplishments of George Moroz over the last 30+ years.
We thank him for his service, dedication, and leadership in advancing and preserving the cultural heritage of the State of Michigan, and wish him the best in retirement.
