Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Voices of Unity Youth Choir as they head to Auckland, New Zealand to compete in the 2024 World Choir Games.
This honor is well deserved, considering the setbacks the choir has faced over the last few years.
Perhaps the most significant of these recent challenges was the departure of over 40 of their student participants in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This did not hinder Voices of Unity; they rallied by launching the ``Rising With Purpose Rebuilding Initiative,'' which engaged a new wave of talented Northeast Indiana youth.
It was with this soulful new chorale group that Voices of Unity achieved this tremendous success.
Unity will be representing Fort Wayne across the world in the Gospel Music Category of the ``Olympics'' of the chorale world.
This experience will be transformational for the young people involved, and an ideal opportunity for them to represent their community, culture, and Nation to an international audience.
I am proud that our community will be represented by this choir with beautiful song, and I congratulate the singers, staff, and board of Voices of Unity Youth Choir on their great achievement.
