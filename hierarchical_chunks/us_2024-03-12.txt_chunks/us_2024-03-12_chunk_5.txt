Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the honor of celebrating Jayson Cagle, a remarkable young man from Pittsgrove, South Jersey, who has achieved the rank of Eagle Scout with Boy Scouts of America Troop 1058.
Jayson's journey to Eagle Scout is not just a personal triumph but a testament to his unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in his surroundings.
His Eagle Scout project, improving his high school's music room, reflects his dedication to both his community and his passion for music.
As a graduating high school senior this year, Jayson has been accepted into Seton Hall University's School of Diplomacy and International Relations, where he hopes to learn how to serve his country on the global stage.
Jayson's commitment to service and leadership is an inspiration to us all.
I'm proud to congratulate him for his achievements and I wish him all the best.
God Bless Jayson and God Bless the United States.
