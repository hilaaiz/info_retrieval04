Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, the students at Mt. Harmony Elementary School, located in my district, accomplished a terrific feat: they became published authors.
Each grade wrote and illustrated a book documenting their recent visit to the National Mall right here in the heart of our Nation's capital.
I thank their librarian Melaney Sanchez, Mt. Harmony PTA Treasurer Jennifer Franco, National Mall Education Specialist Ranger Jen Epstein, and everyone else who helped make this extraordinary, hands-on learning experience possible.
Together, they took more than 600 kids to Washington, D.C.
During these visits, the students learned about American history and the principles upon which our democracy rests.
From the sculpture of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the statue of President Abraham Lincoln, the dark stone walls commemorating the Americans who died in Vietnam to the quiet fountains that honor the fallen of World War II, they saw monuments and memorials that pay tribute to the men and women who have sustained our country for the past 246 years.
Some of the children even had the chance to sing patriotic songs for Veterans at the World War II Memorial.
Back at school, students worked together to write down their impressions and sketch what they saw on the field trip.
