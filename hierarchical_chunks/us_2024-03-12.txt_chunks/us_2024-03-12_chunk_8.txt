Mr. Speaker, young Americans like the ones at Mt. Harmony give me hope for this country's future.
It is inspiring to see them take such a great interest in America's civic culture and history.
We all ought to be grateful to the educators, parents, and community leaders who gave them that opportunity.
One day, these children will be the guardians of our great American experiment.
They will carry on the same work of the historic figures they learned about on their trip--that sacred American duty `to form a more perfect Union.'
Their authorship of these books proves that they have already started to contribute to that crucial mission.
For that, they have my thanks and the gratitude of the Congress.
