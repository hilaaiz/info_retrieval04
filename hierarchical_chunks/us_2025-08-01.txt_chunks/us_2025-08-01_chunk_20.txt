Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life and enduring legacy of 
Mr. James Milton Hawkins of Bolton, Mississippi--a gifted musician, devoted educator, and man of deep faith.
Mr. Hawkins served his community, his students, and his church with unwavering passion and humility for more than four decades.
Born on August 12, 1950, in Bolton, Mississippi, James was the son of Mae Lillie Atkinson Hawkins and Eldridge Hawkins, Sr.
He was a 1968 graduate of Sumner Hill High School and went on to earn both his bachelor's and master's degrees in music, with a concentration in voice and performance, from Jackson State University.
A product of Mississippi's rich musical and spiritual traditions, James dedicated his life to uplifting others through song, mentorship, and education.
