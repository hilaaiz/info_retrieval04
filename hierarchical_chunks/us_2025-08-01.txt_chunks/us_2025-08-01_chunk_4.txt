Creighton Brothers is still proudly family-owned.
Today, over 180 family members are connected to the business; such a level of generational commitment is rare, and it speaks volumes about the values on which this company was built.
Over the years, Creighton Brothers has faced its fair share of challenges.
Still, through it all, they've stuck to their principles: producing safe, high-quality food, caring for their employees, and supporting the local community.
Just last month, the town of Mentone honored Creighton Brothers as the Grand Marshal of the Egg Festival Parade, celebrating ``100 Years community, and we take immense pride in their success.
As we reflect on what it takes to keep a business running strong for 100 years, we see that it requires hard work, innovation, and an unshakable commitment to people.
I want to congratulate everyone at Creighton Brothers on achieving this remarkable milestone.
Here's to the next 100 years of continued success.
