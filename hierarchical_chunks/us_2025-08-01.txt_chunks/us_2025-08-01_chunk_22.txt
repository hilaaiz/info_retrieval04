Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. James Milton Hawkins was a true servant of the people--a Mississippi treasure whose influence reached far beyond any stage.
His life was a symphony of purpose, faith, and excellence.
On behalf of Mississippi's Second Congressional District, I honor his memory and extend my heartfelt condolences to all who loved him.
