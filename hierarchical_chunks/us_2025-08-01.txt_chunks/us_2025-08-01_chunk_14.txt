on the 10th anniversary of her dedicated service to New Wine Ministries International.
Her ministry is located on James Couzens, and Pastor Salters is a proud resident of Michigan's 12th Congressional District and a steadfast supporter of community empowerment.
Her tireless advocacy for single mothers, families, and the unhoused has transformed lives through a vibrant community pantry, back-toschool drives, and her ``Somebody Loves You Committee,'' which distributes food, clothing, and toiletries to those in need.
Pastor Salters leads with faith and compassion, providing financial literacy programs, Easter baskets, and Christmas gifts for children across the district.
Her leadership reflects the very best of our community: generosity, service, and deep love for her neighbors.
I congratulate Pastor Salters on this incredible milestone and thank her for her unwavering dedication to uplifting those she is called to serve.
May her ministry continue to thrive.
