Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District celebrates the incredible life of Shirley Bailey, a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, sister, and friend.
Shirley was born on December 12, 1936, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to the late Clent and Beulah Cook.
Her family moved to Detroit when she was a toddler.
On May 22, 2025, Shirley peacefully made her transition, leaving behind a legacy of grace, kindness, and devotion to family and faith.
She met her husband Kenneth at Northeastern High School; their 70year marriage brought forth Kenneth Jr., Robert, and Traci.
Shirley was known for her warm smile, legendary meals, and dedication to St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church.
She is survived by her husband Kenneth Sr., her children, a special daughter Barbara Cook-Dent, sister Elaine Williamson, sister-in-law Gloria Peters, 12 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren, and many loved ones.
Shirley Bailey will be deeply missed, but her spirit lives on in the lives she touched.
