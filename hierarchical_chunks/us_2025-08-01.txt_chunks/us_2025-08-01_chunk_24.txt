Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors the remarkable life and legacy of Bishop Earl Jerome Wright, Jr., PhD.
A faithful servant, devoted pastor, and beloved leader in the Church Of God In Christ, Bishop Wright has left behind a legacy rooted in ministry, scholarship, and love.
Bishop Wright served with distinction as the Prelate of the Turks and Caicos Islands Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and as pastor of Loving Restoration Ministries and Greater Miller Memorial Church Of God In Christ.
His ministry was grounded in compassion, community, and unwavering dedication to God's people.
As the son of the late Bishop Earl J. Wright, Sr., and Mother Geraldine Marvell Miller Wright, and the grandson of the late Bishop U.E. Miller, a foundational leader of the Church and architect of the historic Mason Temple in Memphis, Tennessee, he continued a rich legacy of faith and service.
Our prayers and heartfelt condolences are with his beloved wife Lady Elaine P. Wright, PhD, sons Earl Jerome Wright, III and Edmund Wright, and the entire Wright family.
May his memory be a blessing, and may we carry forward the light he so faithfully shared with the world.
