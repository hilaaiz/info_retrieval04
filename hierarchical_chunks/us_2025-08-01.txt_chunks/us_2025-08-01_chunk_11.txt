Mr. CAREY.
Mr. Speaker, this is a great time to celebrate, and I want to offer specific thanks.
First, I would like to recognize Dublin Mayor Chris Amorose Groomes for her leadership and making this community a hub for companies, workers, and families to settle in.
I would also like to thank Sarnova's CEO Brian LaDuke for investing further in our community and seeing the untapped potential here in Dublin.
For those of you who don't know, my team and I have been working with Sarnova for years, and the longer we've worked together, the better results we've delivered for Central Ohio.
Today is a testament to that.
Our relationship has resulted in more jobs and productivity in the community.
As a national leader in equipping our first responders, Sarnova has been critical to saving lives.
I'm sure the first responders using their equipment on a daily basis would agree.
Whether it's police officers, firefighters, or EMS workers, Sarnova has been there to make their jobs easier.
But I firmly believe the best is yet to come for Sarnova, for Dublin, and for all.
As the new facility opens, I can't wait to see what will happen here in the months and years to come.
I want to thank them all, and I look forward to coming and visiting soon.
