Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the rich cultural traditions of the Basque people and to reaffirm the enduring friendship between the Basque Country and the United States.
This year marks the long-awaited return of Jaialdi, one of the largest Basque festivals in the world and the largest of its kind in the United States.
For the first time in over a decade, thousands from around the world are gathering in Boise, Idaho, to celebrate Basque culture through food, music, dance, and community.
Jaialdi--meaning ``festival'' in the Basque language--is a joyous and spirited celebration of heritage and identity.
As one of only two Basque Americans to ever serve in Congress, I am proud to celebrate Basque identity and tradition.
Throughout my career, I have remained committed to strengthening the bond between the United States and the Basque Country.
It is a friendship rooted in shared values, democratic ideals, perseverance, and dedication to community.
I was honored to play a role in bringing a sapling of the Tree of Gernika--an enduring symbol of Basque freedom and resilience--to the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.
The Basque-American community has long enriched the fabric of our Nation, and events like Jaialdi are a testament to its contributions.
As Jaialdi returns to Boise this summer, I offer my warmest congratulations to the organizers, participants, and all who celebrate.
May the friendship between the United States and the Basque people remain strong for generations to come.
