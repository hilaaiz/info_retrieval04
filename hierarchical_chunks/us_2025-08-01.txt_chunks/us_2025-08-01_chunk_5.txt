Mr. MURPHY.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and deep respect that I honor 
Mr. Darrell McNary Collins.
Mr. Collins was a national treasure and has cemented himself as an Outer Banks icon though his work as a Historian at the Wright Brothers National Memorial where he shared the magnificent story of the ``Miracle at Kitty Hawk''.
A faithful student to the history of the Wright Brothers, his over 40 years of learning and research led to him becoming one of the top 3 Wright Brothers historians in the world.
He shared the stories of the rich history of the Outer Banks, including that of his family legacy as part of the Freedmen's Colony and the African American history on Roanoke Island.
But 
Mr. Collins was much more than a historian.
He cared deeply about his hometown of Manteo and its residents.
He was appointed to his late mother's Town of Manteo Commissioner seat upon her death in 2006, serving for the next 18 years.
The town honored his dedication by officially declaring December 17th as the ``Honorable Darrell Collins Day'' to coincide with the Anniversary.
