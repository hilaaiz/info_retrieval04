Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District recognizes the incredible contributions of Betty J. Howard, a native Detroiter and leader in the field of public health.
Beginning her career at Critten Hospital as a staff nurse, Betty's dedication led her to hold several administrative positions.
In 1987, she was promoted to Maternal Child Health Consultant for the City of Detroit Health Department where she co-authored several governmentfunded grants and devoted her time to advancing maternal and adolescent health services.
Betty's impactful career has led her to receive numerous outstanding service awards and certificates of recognition for her work.
In addition to her service in the health industry, Betty is deeply connected to the Detroit community through her membership in organizations including Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Chi Eta Phi Sorority, Inc., and lifelong membership of the NAACP.
