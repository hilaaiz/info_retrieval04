Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I do not for one moment wish to push my luck, but under the circumstances I believe that a statement is very important.
As you know, the Government can interrupt business at any time to make a statement.
Such is the importance of these events—and I notified the office of the Leader of the House that I would make this point of order—that I believe, before the House rises this afternoon, a Minister should come to the House to tell us everything that the Government know about what is going on.
I will leave it at that.
