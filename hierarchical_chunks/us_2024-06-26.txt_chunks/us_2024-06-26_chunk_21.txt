Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Union Pines Vikings, Coach Daniel Proud, and their Principal Andrew McCormick on their undefeated season and winning the NCHSAA 3A/2A/1A women's lacrosse state championship.
The women of Union Pines lacrosse team have brought this year's NCHSAA championship back home to Moore County.
The Vikings defeated Bishop McGuiness High School 20-6 to clinch the title and cap off a perfect 18-0 season.
The coaches and players of Union Pines have brought great pride to both their school and all.
I wish them all the best and hope to see them continue their success next season.
Go Vikings.
