Mr. PENCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eric Jenkins, who was named Indiana Teacher of the Year.
An Indiana native, Eric teaches English at Franklin Community High School, a high school in my district.
Those who know him say that Eric is dedicated to his students and passionate about instilling a love of reading.
