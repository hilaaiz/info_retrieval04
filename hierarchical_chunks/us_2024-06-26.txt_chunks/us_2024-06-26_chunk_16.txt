Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Daniel Flavin, a uniquely integral Southwest Louisiana community leader.
Dan's career spanned business, politics, and philanthropy.
No matter what his means were, he always worked to benefit those around him, his family, and God.
Dan's family moved to Lake Charles in 1972, where he attended and graduated from A.M. Barbe High School.
Mr. Bill Flavin, Dan's Father, was a Veteran of the Korean War and an industrious, self-made man.
Despite generous offers that would force his family to leave the Southwest Louisiana community they had come to love, he resigned from his job and founded what is now the renowned Flavin Realty Inc.
Dan once recalled that even at 86, his father still came to work every day.
