Mr. MIKE GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of CA-27's Edwards Air Force Base who has served with passion for over 20 years.
As a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Air Force, John D. Stock has dedicated his life to serving our Nation and training the next generation of pilots.
John D. Stock's diligent service includes 3500 hours of flight time across two oceans and five continents.
By executing successful operational missions, instructing pilots and aircrew personnel, and volunteering in his local community, his leadership has had a deep impact on the aviation community and beyond.
I want to thank Lieutenant Colonel John Stock for his dedication and service.
Our community is better because of him, and I look forward to seeing how he continues to make an impact on those around him.
