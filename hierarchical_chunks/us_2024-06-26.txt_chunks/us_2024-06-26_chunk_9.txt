Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Drew Hedgecoe of Terry Sanford High School on winning his third consecutive NCHSAA 3A state championship in singles tennis.
On May 11, 2024, Drew defeated South Central freshman Shaw Akula 6-2, 6-3 to clinch the title.
Due to his hard work and dedication, Drew is breaking records on the tennis court and could soon become the second tennis player in NCHSAA history to win four straight singles championships.
Drew has made his school, and all of Cumberland County, extremely proud.
I wish Drew all the best and hope to see him make history on the court and bring home another state championship next season.
