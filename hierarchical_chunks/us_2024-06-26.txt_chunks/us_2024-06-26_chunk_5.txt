Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my hometown newspaper, the Santa Fe New Mexican, on its 175th Anniversary.
The first issue of the paper was printed on November 28, 1849.
The New Mexican has brought stories to life about gold strikes, floods, votes on prohibition, and debates on statehood.
It has shared stories of the struggles and strength of the survivors of wildfires, informed voters about their local candidates, and anointed the best chile in the city.
To keep democracy strong, it made sure voters understood the positions and perspectives of local candidates for office.
Stories matter, and who tells them matters just as much.
That's why it's important that an independent paper with integrity, like the New Mexican, has been telling stories about our communities since it was founded.
Papers like the New Mexican help us be well informed, active citizens.
In 2023, 34 reporters from the New Mexican won first place in the New Mexico Press Association Better Newspapers contest.
Amongst the awards were best investigative reporting, best news writing, best feature photo, and best special section on the recovery from the Hermit's Peak/ Calf Canyon fire in 2022.
Independent journalism is a crucial foundation of democracy.
That's clear now more than ever, as we ward off fake news and alternative facts in the battle for our nation's very soul.
I still get a copy of the New Mexican delivered to my door every day.
Their stories, from high school sports to national news are crucial to the work that I do.
Most importantly, however, they are vital to the fabric.
I like to think that future generations will sit with their cup of cafe and turn the pages to learn about their hometown from the Santa Fe New Mexican.
