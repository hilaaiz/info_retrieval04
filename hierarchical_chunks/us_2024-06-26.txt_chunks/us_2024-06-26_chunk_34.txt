Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels.
For the last halfcentury, the program has been diligently serving homebound members of the community when they need it most.
We thank Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels and its team members for their service, and we are excited to see how the program will continue to serve the community.
