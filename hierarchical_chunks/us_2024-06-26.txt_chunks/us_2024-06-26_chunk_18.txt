Representatives was noted by constituents as an era of major victories and development.
Representative Flavin's greatest legislative work came amid efforts to bolster the Port.
His concerted legislation and advocacy made the Port of Lake Charles our Nation's 10th largest, cementing an irreplaceable source of SWLA economic prosperity for years to come.
This unwavering dedication to community was surpassed only by Dan's intertwined love of family and God.
After retiring from the state legislature in 2005, Dan spent the joyful final years of his life caring for the family business, surrounded by his wife Lisa and their six children, 20 grandchildren, and a community of friends.
Dan's love of God, family, and community made him an exemplary Louisianan by any definition.
His work was always conducted according to our state's unique intersection of government, business, and family values.
Dan is survived by a big, beautiful Louisiana family and a forever grateful community.
On behalf of Louisiana's 3rd District, I thank Mr. Dan Flavin for his generous charity and lifelong service to Louisiana.
As we continue to benefit from Dan Flavin's legacy, I pray the Lord blesses his family and grants his reward in Heaven.
