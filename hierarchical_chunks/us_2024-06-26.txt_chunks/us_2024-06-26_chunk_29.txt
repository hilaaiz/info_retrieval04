Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the accomplishments of Rear Admiral Dana Thomas as she retires from the United States Coast Guard this year.
I applaud RADM Thomas for her dedication and service and congratulate her on this milestone.
Promoted to Rear Admiral (Upper Half) in March 2019, RADM Thomas has had an exemplary military career, previously serving seven years in the U.S. Coast Guard and seven years in the U.S. Army.
She received her Doctor of Medicine and Master of Public Health degrees from George Washington University School of Medicine and Public Health, and her Bachelor of Science in Honors Biology from the University of Maryland, College Park.
She completed Command and General Staff College in 2005.
She served her Internship in General Surgery at Tripler Army Medical Center and her residency at the Naval Aerospace Medicine Institute.
From her work with the Centers for Disease Control and service on the Physician's Professional Advisory Committee to the U.S. Surgeon General, to her current role as Director of Health, Safety, and Worklife for the U.S. Coast Guard, RADM Thomas has continued her commitment to service and public health.
Her experience, knowledge, and steadfast initiative have distinguished RADM Thomas as an outstanding leader who has exemplified honor, integrity, and professionalism throughout her career.
