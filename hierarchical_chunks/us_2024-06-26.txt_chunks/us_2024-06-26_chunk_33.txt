community.
The care and service that they provide to homebound members Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels began in 1974 as a program to provide homebound neighbors with fresh, nutritious meals.
Since then, the program has expanded its services to include pet food delivery, home energy efficiency kits, personal care items, and wellness checks during drop-offs.
Additionally, the program offers recipients a variety of meals that are inclusive of dietary restrictions, nutritional risks, and cultural traditions.
Their delivery of over 120,000 of these meals to over 430 clients every year shows a distinct level of dedication and commitment to the community.
Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels is a community effort.
It is led by the University of Michigan Health Department of Community Health Services and is made possible by the additional support of more than 250 volunteers.
Staff at the Patient Food and Nutrition Services at Michigan Medicine work six days a week to prepare meals while volunteers assist in delivering meals, completing wellness checks, and providing community members with compassion and support.
Many times, they are the difference in isolation as they build connections and care for those they serve.
Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels also works with Lucky Kitchen, Washtenaw County, the Huron Valley Humane Society, DTE Energy, and other local institutions.
This network of partnerships and dedicated volunteers demonstrates the integration of the program in the community, as well as the extent of the impact of the program.
