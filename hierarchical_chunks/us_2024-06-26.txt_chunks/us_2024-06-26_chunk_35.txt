Ms. FOXX.
Mr Speaker, I rise to acknowledge members of the Associated Equipment Distributors from all over the country who came to D.C. for their annual fly-in.
These great men and women are entrepreneurs who provide millions of pieces of equipment to all kinds of industries in our country every year that help our country's economy.
They deserve our admiration and thanks.
They certainly have mine.
