Mr. FROST.
Mr. Speaker, this month, I celebrate the significant contributions of Rosen Hotels to the Central Florida region.
Starting with only one hotel, the Rosen organization has grown to over seven hotels, employing over 4,000 Central Floridians.
The Rosen Hotels were established starting in 1974 and are now celebrating 50 years of service.
Every year, the Rosen organization provides over 500 scholarships that benefit students in the Tangelo Park and Parramore areas.
Most notably, Rosen Hotels has donated millions over its 50 years to creating the UCF Rosen School of Hospitality Management, which now ranks No. 1 in the Nation.
The Rosen hotels have provided employment, welcoming stays, and memories to last a lifetime for many Floridians.
I thank Rosen Hotels, for 50 years of dedication and service.
Their contributions make a profound difference in our community, and we are grateful for their support and commitment to make Central Florida a better place for all.
