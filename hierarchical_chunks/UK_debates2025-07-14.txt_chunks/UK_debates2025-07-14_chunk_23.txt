This afternoon, I visited Centrepoint, where I spoke to young people living in self-contained flats  and met the staff who are working to support those young people.
The Secretary of State will be aware that a coalition of 150 charities supporting young people are calling for a specific youth-focused section in the ending homelessness strategy; estimates show that would save £8.5 billion a year.
Does the Minister agree that it is not only morally right but economically smart to have a youth-specific chapter in that new strategy?
I commend my hon.
Friend for her work on this really important agenda.
I met representatives from the youth homelessness sector at a recent roundtable.
We are determined to ensure that the concerns and interests of young people experiencing homelessness are integrated into our report on ending homelessness, and we are working with the sector to tackle the root causes of youth homelessness.
Eastbourne’s streets are being blighted by severely overgrown grass verges that attract litter, antisocial behaviour and crime.
Will the Minister join me in urging Conservative-run East Sussex county council to urgently get a grip on verge maintenance in Eastbourne in order to help make our grass great again?
The real issue for most councils is that the Liberal Democrats did not make hay when the sun was shining in their coalition years.
Let nobody in local government forget that the seeds of the erosion of local neighbourhood services started in those coalition years, when the Liberal Democrats more than ably abetted the Conservative Government at the time.
