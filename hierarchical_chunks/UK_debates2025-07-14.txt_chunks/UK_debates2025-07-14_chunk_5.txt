I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that question.
He cited the planning practice guidance we have issued, which has a very clear definition of the grey belt and the rules for it.
When it comes to plan making, local authorities must take a sequential approach.
On decision making for applications outside of local plans, he will know that we have imposed very strict laws to ensure viability assessments are not used on those sites.
Where development comes forward and is judged to be appropriate by decision makers—and by the Planning Inspectorate in appeals—those golden rules will also ensure high levels of affordable housing, infrastructure and access to green space.
