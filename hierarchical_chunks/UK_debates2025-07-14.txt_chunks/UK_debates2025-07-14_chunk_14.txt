I thank the former Minister for those representations.
On the point about fair funding and unpicking where money is needed, there is a lot of commonality on this issue in the Chamber.
We absolutely accept that in rural areas the cost of service delivery is higher in some cases, such as for refuse collection and adult social care.
It is common sense that if people have to travel further to pick up bins or make a home care visit, it will cost more money as a result.
