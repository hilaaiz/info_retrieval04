I thank the shadow Minister for that question.
He is absolutely right that our target of 1.5 million new homes, which is extremely stretching—we have never said anything other than that—does not entail units at any cost.
The design and quality of new homes and new places are incredibly important.
He rightly cites the new homes code of practice, and we are giving consideration in the round to whether that can be strengthened—for example, whether it needs to be put on a statutory footing.
In general, we want to drive up the quality of new homes in the places and communities we are creating.
