Select Committees look at the evidence, follow the evidence and make recommendations on the basis of the evidence.
Today, we have heard from the Secretary of State the evidence from the Met Office about the seriousness of the threat, the reality of the nature of the crisis and the fact that that will only grow.
The shadow Minister missed something because he needs to acknowledge not just the costs of taking action but the costs of not doing so.
The Secretary of State read out those costs: £200 billion or 8% of GDP if we get 3° of warming, according to the OBR.
Those opposing climate action in this place can also see the evidence that cheaper driving and home heating are already available to many people, and we should be making them available to as many people as possible.
They also know that switching to low-carbon electricity as much and as fast as we can will make this country safer by getting control of our energy generation and supply.
Does the Secretary of State agree that the patriotic approach is to work together to cut emissions for financial, security, nature and climate reasons?
