I thank my hon.
Friend for the work she has done to champion fair funding across local government, particularly for York.
I absolutely understand the issues.
The fair funding review is meant to do two things.
It takes into account the need—the cost pressures driving local authorities—set against the resource, which is how much local authorities can raise in council tax at a local level.
It is the Government’s role to be the equaliser to ensure that every local authority can afford decent local services, but I absolutely take into account her representations.
