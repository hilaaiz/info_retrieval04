When the Minister has met major house builders, what have they told him about the chances of hitting the Government’s target of building 1.5 million new houses in this Parliament?
Those house builders have expressed their confidence, and their gratitude for the reforms that the Government have carried out.
It is slightly peevish of the right hon.
Lady, who stood for election on a manifesto that committed her party to 1.6 million homes, to say that our 1.5 million homes target is unachievable.
We quite regularly hear from Conservative Members that we are concreting over every inch of England, but at the same time that we cannot meet our targets.
We will meet that target of 1.5 million homes.
