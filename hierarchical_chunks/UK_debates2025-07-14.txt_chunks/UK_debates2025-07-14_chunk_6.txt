I welcome the Government’s bold and ambitious plan to deliver more housing, especially affordable and social homes, in Wandsworth.
The council is already delivering homes, but of the 800 homes in its plan, only 50 are accessible for wheelchairs.
How will the Government deliver more accessible homes, and will the Minister agree to raise the default standard to the M4(2) standard of accessibility and adaptation, so that everybody has the opportunity to live in a safe and accessible home?
