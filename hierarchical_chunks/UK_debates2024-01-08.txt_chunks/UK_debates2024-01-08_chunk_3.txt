Two GPs from Seatown, in my part of Devon, moved to Australia to practise a little over two years ago.
Both are working as full-time GPs, with no gaps in their career, and they now wish to return to east Devon to help ease winter pressures.
Retesting someone who returns to England is lengthy, costly and bureaucratic, and it does not take into account practice in similar primary care settings.
Can NHS England not make it easier for UK-trained GPs working in Australia, New Zealand or Canada to return to general practice in England?
I have received a notification from the petition officer for the constituency of Wellingborough in respect of the recall petition for Peter Bone.
The recall petition closed on  Tuesday 19 December .
As more than 10% of those eligible to sign the petition did so, the petition was successful and the seat is accordingly vacant.
I shall cause the text of the notification to be published in the Votes and Proceedings and in the Official Report.
[The notification will appear at the end of today’s proceedings.]
