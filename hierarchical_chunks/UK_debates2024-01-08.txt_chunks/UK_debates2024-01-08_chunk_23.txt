I thank my right hon.
Friend.
We are working alongside our P3 partners to de-escalate tensions on the blue line and reduce that risk of escalation.
We are continuing our efforts to support the resilience of the Lebanese armed forces, who we have helped elsewhere, with the eventual aim of getting them to the Lebanese southern border and ensuring implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1701.
