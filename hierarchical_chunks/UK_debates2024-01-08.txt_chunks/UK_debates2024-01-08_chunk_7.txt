The Secretary of State is absolutely right to point the finger at the Houthis, but we should not ignore the role of Iran in this enterprise.
What are he and the Government doing with our international partners to ensure that the merchant marine have the confidence to keep using the Red sea, which is critical to the smooth operating of world trade?
We call on the Iranian-backed Houthis to immediately cease these attacks.
The Houthis will bear the responsibility and, I have to say, the consequences should they ignore those warnings.
The right hon.
Gentleman asks what more we have been doing; I issued a statement along with 10 other countries during the break, in which we made clear that consequences will follow if they do not stop this action.
To be clear, the UK will not tolerate the Houthis closing international waterways.
