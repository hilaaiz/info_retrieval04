I did not mention that specifically because I have already made a written ministerial statement to the House.
HMS Richmond is sailing to the region because both HMS Diamond and HMS Lancaster are already there, and eventually they will need to be swapped out.
It is not escalation in terms.
I want to repeat to the right hon.
Gentleman, the House and the country that we will not tolerate trade being impacted globally in the manner in which the Houthis are impacting it.
It will have ramifications on everybody’s bills and on the flow of free trade and goods, and it must come to a halt.
We have made clear through that joint statement that we are prepared to take action if required.
I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman’s commitment to support us in that action.
When the UK took the important step of joining Operation Prosperity Guardian, the Secretary of State gave the House this update in a written statement.
He has done the same today, alongside his comments at questions.
If further action is required to deter Houthi attacks and to safeguard freedom of shipping in the Red sea, will he undertake to provide Parliament with an oral statement?
Yes.
