Friend will know, the Houthis have been causing havoc in that part of the Red sea, in particular attacking ships.
There was a 500% increase in attacks on maritime shipping from November to December, showing that there is no direct connection to the wider conflict in the region but a decision by Houthis to attack free trade.
That is unacceptable.
We are working with our partners, through Operation Prosperity Guardian and other measures, to tackle it.
