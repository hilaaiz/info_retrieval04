In just five days last week, Russia fired 500 drones and missiles at Ukraine.
Putin is stepping up his attacks, so we must step up UK support, but current military aid funding runs out in a matter of weeks.
The former Defence Secretary said—although not today—that without new money it is “very hard to continue the leadership the UK has been taking on Ukraine”.
I asked the current Defence Secretary about the 2024 Ukraine funding in the House in November.
The former Defence Secretary wrote about it eight months ago.
Seven weeks from when I asked, I ask again: when will new military aid funding for Ukraine be announced, and will it be multi-year?
Perhaps the right hon.
Gentleman did not hear my previous answer: it will not be long.
To correct the record for the House, the funding—£2.3 billion—continues through to April this year, so it is not in any way, shape or form in danger of running out.
To reassure the right hon.
Gentleman and the House, I am also in constant contact with Umerov—my opposite number—and many others throughout the Ukrainian system, so they understand where funding is up to and are able to plan accordingly.
What recent assessment he has made of trends in the number of women employed in the defence sector.
A happy new year to you, Mr Speaker, and to all colleagues.
As at October 2023, 55.4% of civil servants are female—a rise of 0.7 percentage points compared with  1 October 2022 —and 11.7% of the UK regular armed forces and 15.9% of Future Reserves 2020 are women, up by 1.2 percentage points and 1.4 percentage points respectively in the past five years.
That means that the trend is in the right direction, but we can do better, and I am confident that we will do so across the defence enterprise.[Official Report,  9 January 2024 , Vol. 743, c. 4MC.]
Happy new year to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House.
