I thank the Minister for his response.
Many of my constituents work in the defence sector, whether at RNAS Yeovilton, Leonardo in Yeovil or Thales in my constituency.
I commend initiatives such as Leonardo’s AeroWomen programme, which aims to increase gender parity in the sector, but I am concerned by the barriers  that women still face.
The women in defence charter aims to have women make up 30% of the UK armed forces by 2030, yet the current number is a meagre 12%.
Has the Minister made an assessment in the last quarter of 2023 of the success of the charter since its launch?
