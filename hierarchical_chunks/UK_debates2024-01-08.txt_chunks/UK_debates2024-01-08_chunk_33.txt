I thank the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her comments about a contact group, which we will look at extremely carefully.
I am grateful for her welcome for the humanitarian aid co-ordinator, who is working flat out on these matters, and also for what she says about the additional funding for food.
The problems at the moment are not a shortfall in funding; they are in getting the food and necessary humanitarian requirements inside Gaza.
