I thank my hon.
Friend for her remarks.
Our contact and heavy involvement with the Red Cross and Red Crescent is happening daily.
In terms of her  core remark, it is the British Government’s endeavour to ensure that there will not be impunity for those who commit these horrendous crimes.
No matter how long it takes, we will do everything we can to ensure that that impunity does not exist.
