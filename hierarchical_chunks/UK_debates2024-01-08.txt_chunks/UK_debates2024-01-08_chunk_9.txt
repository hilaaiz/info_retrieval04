I welcome what the Defence Secretary has to say.
These attacks on Red sea shipping must stop.
They destabilise regional security, disrupt international trade and put civilian and military lives in danger.
We back the UK action with allies in the new maritime protection force, and the joint statement condemning the Houthi attacks that the Secretary of State just mentioned.
He announced today but has not mentioned to the House that HMS Richmond is sailing to the Gulf.
In the light of these escalating tensions, what other Royal Navy ships has he put on stand-by for the region?
