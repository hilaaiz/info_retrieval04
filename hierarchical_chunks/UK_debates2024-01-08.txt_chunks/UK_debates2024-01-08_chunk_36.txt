I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his comments.
The Government respect the role of the ICJ and we will of course follow what is going on with great care.
We have always made it clear that it is up to the courts to determine these matters and that all parties must ensure that their actions are proportionate and necessary and minimise harm to civilians.
