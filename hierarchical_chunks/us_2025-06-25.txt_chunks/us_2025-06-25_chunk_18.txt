Ms. Zubkoff is a big fan of traveling; she has gone on many trips over the years including Panama, Australia, and a surprise birthday cruise this year to South America.
Her favorite souvenirs from these trips are jewelry made by regional artists with local materials.
In her retirement, she plans to travel with her family, including her sister, niece, and nephew.
I congratulate 
Ms. Zubkoff, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking her for her distinguished service to the House and the Nation it serves.
I wish her all the best as she begins this new chapter in her life.
