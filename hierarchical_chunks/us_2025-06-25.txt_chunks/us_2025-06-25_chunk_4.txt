Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of Barbara Kulig as she retires after twenty-six years of service with the Manchester School District.
Barbara has dedicated her time as a Paraprofessional to making a difference in students' education and being involved within the community.
As a lifelong Manchester resident, Barbara dedicated her career to public service and giving back to her community.
She has spent twentyfive years teaching at Hillside Middle School, the same institution she attended for middle school, and she spent her final year teaching at Weston Elementary.
She also previously served as a school bus driver in Bedford.
She has left a lasting impact on the students she has worked with over the years and will be greatly missed by students and staff alike.
Barbara is not only a diligent public servant but also an individual ensuring that the students of the Manchester School District were given the care and resources they needed to thrive and grow into successful young adults.
In all, Barbara Kulig represents the very best of America's public servants--dedicated, thoughtful, and unwavering in her commitment to service to others.
On behalf of a grateful district, I want to congratulate Barbara on a well-deserved and restful retirement.
