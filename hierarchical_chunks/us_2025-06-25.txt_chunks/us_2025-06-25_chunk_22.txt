Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Colonel Derek C. Oakley on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Air Force, concluding an extraordinary career of over two decades in service to our Nation.
Colonel Oakley most recently served as Commander of the 28th Bomb Wing at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.
Under his instrumental leadership, the 28th Bomb Wing, home to the largest operational B-1 combat wing, provided unmatched global strike capabilities and remained a vital part of our national defense.
Since commissioning through Officer Training School in May 2000, Colonel Oakley's record of service has been marked by excellence, professionalism, and an unshakable commitment to duty.
Over the course of his distinguished career, he logged more than 3,400 flight hours, including 991 in combat.
His career has spanned key leadership roles in operations, training, and strategic development.
He has commanded at multiple levels, served on the Joint Staff, and played a vital role in the development of the B-21 Raider, shaping the future of American airpower.
His service has been recognized with many decorations, including the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and multiple Air Medals.
On behalf of a grateful state and Nation, I thank Colonel Oakley for his decades of honorable service.
We in South Dakota are proud to call him one of our own, and we wish him and his family all the best as they begin this new chapter.
