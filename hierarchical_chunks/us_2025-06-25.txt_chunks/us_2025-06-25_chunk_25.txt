Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Epsilon Sigma Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, based in Prince William County, Virginia.
Since its founding on June 13, 2015, Epsilon Sigma Boule has exemplified the highest standards of leadership, scholarship, and community service.
Sigma Pi Phi, also known as the Boule, is the oldest Black Greekletter fraternity, established in 1904 to provide a space for African American men of professional distinction at a time when few such outlets existed.
Its legacy includes names etched into the very fabric of American history--W.E.B. Du Bois, Martin Luther King, Jr., Arthur Ashe, Whitney Young, and so many others whose contributions have shaped our Nation.
Today, its ranks continue to include influential leaders such as Representatives James Clyburn, Bobby Scott, Emanuel Cleaver, and 
Senator Raphael Warnock.
The Epsilon Sigma Boule of Sigma Pi Phi was established to advance this rich legacy in Northern Virginia.
Its members are African American men of accomplishment and service, representing diverse professions and industries.
Together, they have embodied the Fraternity's founding mission by working diligently to uplift and empower their communities through servant leadership and civic engagement.
