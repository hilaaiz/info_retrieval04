Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Sergeant Keith Deutsch, a veteran.
Sergeant Deutsch enlisted in the United States Army in the summer following the attacks of September 11, 2001.
He rose through the ranks quickly, earning five promotions and receiving the Army Commendation Medal, the Bronze Star for Valor, and the Purple Heart.
In 2003, Keith was wounded by an enemy-fired rocket-propelled grenade while serving as an M249 SAW gunner.
His squad leader, Staff Sergeant Mark A. Lawton, was killed in the same attack.
Staff Sergeant Lawton died never having lost a Soldier under his command.
He ran toward fire, shielded his Soldiers, and led from the front.
A proud former Marine, the Army was Staff Sergeant Lawton's retirement position.
After recovering from his injuries, Keith helped pioneer the sport of adaptive snowboarding, competing on the World Cup Tour and in the Winter X Games using prosthetics developed with the Department of Veterans Affairs support.
Keith later returned to New Prague, Minnesota, and reopened his father's business, Ron's Cycle Shop, as a Service-Disabled VeteranOwned Small Business.
Today, it supplies electric bicycles to government agencies under contracts with the State of Minnesota and the Department.
He is also the founder of the New Prague Area Mountain Bike Park.
In October 2025, Keith will run both the Army Ten-Miler and the 50th Marine Corps Marathon as an above-knee amputee in honor of Staff Sergeant Mark A. Lawton.
Sergeant Deutsch's life and career is characterized by great personal sacrifice and exemplary service.
He represents the best that this country has to offer.
I thank him for his service and dedication to our country.
