Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a significant milestone in the agricultural community of Ballico, California--the centennial anniversary of the Cortez Growers Association.
Established on April 18, 1924, by four visionary Japanese immigrants, the Cortez Growers Association began as a small cooperative endeavor to market fruits and vegetables effectively despite language barriers.
The founders employed a bilingual agent, ensuring their enterprise's early success and sustainability.
The association thrived, even through the Great Depression, expanding its membership and operational capacity.
By 1932, twenty-six additional members had joined, and Cortez Growers Association appointed its first full-time manager.
However, the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent internment of Japanese Americans dealt a severe blow to the association.
All members, being of Japanese descent, were either interned or enlisted in the military, many serving in the highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team.
Despite these adversities, the Cortez Growers Association's land was preserved through trust and leased to neighboring farmers, allowing the association to regain its footing post-war.
The resilience and determination of the members during these trying times are a testament to their commitment to their community and country.
In the ensuing decades, the Cortez Growers Association has continued to adapt and thrive.
Transitioning from a diverse crop base to focusing solely on almond production, the association has stayed at the forefront of agricultural innovation and efficiency.
Today, the Cortez Growers Association is a leader in the almond industry and a pillar in agricultural advocacy, helping to found the Almond Alliance.
As we commemorate a century of enduring legacy, the Cortez Growers Association is a beacon of community resilience, adaptability, and success.
The values of faith, family, and dedication to future generations are as alive today as they were a hundred years ago.
With great pride, I recognize the Cortez Growers Association for its century of service to the agricultural community and the nation.
I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Cortez Growers Association for 100 years of service and offer my sincerest wishes for their future.
