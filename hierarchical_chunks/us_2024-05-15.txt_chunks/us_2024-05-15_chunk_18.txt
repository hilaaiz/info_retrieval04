Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and sacrifice of Berrien County Sheriff Deputy Elton C. Stover.
Deputy Stover was born November 21, 1910, in Berrien County and pursued a career in law enforcement, serving in the Berrien Springs Police Department, Comstock Police Department, and served as the Constable of Lincoln Township.
On December 3, 1965, armed gunmen targeted the Farmers & Merchants National Bank in Benton Township.
Berrien County Sheriff Deputies Elton Stover and Gary Mitchell responded to the call for help.
Upon arrival to the scene, Deputies Stover and Mitchell were immediately met with an array of gunfire with both men being struck.
As Deputy Stover laid on the bank floor he was hit with two bullets, smashing through his chest and right leg.
He and Deputy Mitchell were rushed to Mercy Hospital in Benton Harbor, where he underwent what was thought to be a successful surgery.
Unfortunately, Deputy Stover's condition deteriorated, and he passed away during surgery at 2.55 p.m. on December 10, 1965, making the ultimate sacrifice in service to the people.
To this day, Deputy Elton C. Stover remains the only Deputy in the history of the Benton County Sheriff's Department to be killed in the line of duty.
