Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bodhi McBean for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
Bodhi has overcome many challenges along his journey to success, demonstrating perseverance at every step.
Students who strive to make the most of their education, like Bodhi, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Bodhi's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Oberon Middle School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Bodhi McBean on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
