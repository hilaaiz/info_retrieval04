Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, the Assistance to Fire Grants (AFG) and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants provide essential resources to fire departments around the country.
Since their authorization in 2000, these grant programs have provided more than $15 billion in funding nationwide to community fire departments, ensuring that they are prepared for whatever challenges they might face.
It is essential Congress fund these programs as local governments often lack the resources to invest in new firefighting equipment and to cover the costs of hiring and training new firefighters.
I voted in support of the House Amendment to S. 870, the Fire Grants and Safety Act of 2023 because we must continue to deliver these vital funds to our communities.
However, I am disappointed that House Republicans amended this legislation to add an unrelated bill, S. 1111--the Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act.
The reauthorization of the AFG and SAFER grants should not have been packaged with a bill to accelerate nuclear energy deployment, which is a complex issue that deserves its own debate and vote.
I would have preferred to vote on these two unrelated issues separately.
I will continue to support our local fire departments and ensure that they have access to the federal resources they need to keep our communities safe.
