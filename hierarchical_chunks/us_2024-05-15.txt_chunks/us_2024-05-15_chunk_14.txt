Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Faria Land and Cattle as they are awarded the 63rd Annual Farmers of the Year award by the Kiwanis Club.
The Faria Cousins--Steve, Rick, Mike, and Danny Jr.--were born into a family of farmers in Tulare.
From early on in their lives they learned their craft from their fathers, Manuel Faria Jr. and Danny Faria Sr., who like them, learned from his father--Manuel Faria Sr.
Like many family farms in the Central Valley, Faria Land and Cattle was founded by Manuel Sr. after he immigrated to the U.S. from the Azores Islands of Portugal in 1920.
The Cousins are the third generation of Faria farmers, carrying on the family business that has stood for more than a century in the Central Valley.
Today, the Faria Cousins work together to manage the daily operations of the farm and dairy facilities.
Faria Land and Cattle produces a variety of commodities including wheat, oats, alfalfa, and almonds, and operates two dairies, as well as a custom calf ranch operation.
Their commitment to providing highquality products and services to the Central Valley community has been unwavering for more than 100 years.
In addition to their dedication to the family business, the Faria cousins are active members of the Tulare community, having volunteered on several boards of organizations that help to serve the local agricultural community.
As the recipient of this year's award, the Faria Cousins are being recognized for their commitment to Central Valley agriculture and dedication to giving back to the community.
The success of Faria Land and Cattle is a true testament to the Faria family's hard work and perseverance.
I am confident that their work will continue to strengthen the Tulare agricultural community for generations to come.
