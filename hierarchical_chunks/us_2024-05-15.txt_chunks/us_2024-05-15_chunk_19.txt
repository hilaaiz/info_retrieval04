Mr. Speaker, each day, law enforcement officials like Deputy Stover help to keep our communities safe, rush into dangerous situations, and lay down their lives to protect their fellow citizens.
It is my solemn honor to remember Deputy Elton Stover and all fallen law enforcement officers from Michigan's 4th Congressional District, the state, and throughout the country.
