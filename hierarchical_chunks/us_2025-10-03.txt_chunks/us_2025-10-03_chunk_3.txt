Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the week of September 30, 2025, as National Orange Shirt Week.
Also known as National Week of Remembrance, this designation aims to honor those who were forced to attend Indian boarding schools.
From 1819 through the 1960's, thousands of Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their traditional homelands to attend U.S. boarding schools.
At these schools, countless children were stripped of their cultural identities, often through physical, sexual, psychological, industrial, and spiritual abuse and neglect, all with the goal of assimilation into non-Native culture.
This issue is personal to me.
My grandparents, Ruth Stacy and Lawrence Little George, both survived Indian Boarding Schools.
I would not be here today if not for the resilience of my ancestors and those who came before me.
Tragically, many other children of these schools never got to return to their families or their communities.
Hearing the experiences of Indian boarding school victims and survivors serves to not only honor the Native spirit, but also to ensure that these types of injustices can never repeat themselves.
It is for these reasons that I heartily support National Orange Shirt Week.
