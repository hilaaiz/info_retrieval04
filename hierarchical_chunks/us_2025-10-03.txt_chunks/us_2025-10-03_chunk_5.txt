Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors Bishop Tony Shomari Marshall and the House of Prayer Institutional Church in Detroit, Michigan, as they celebrate 25 years of ministry and public service.
Bishop Marshall, the founding pastor, is a revered preacher, educator, chaplain, and author who has dedicated his life to serving people in need.
A committed ``teaching priest,'' he has studied under numerous scholars and earned degrees and certificates from respected institutions, including Taylor University, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Trinity International University, Andersonville Theological Seminary, and Ecumenical Theological Seminary.
Consecrated to the office of Bishop in 2021, he now serves on the Board of Bishops with the Deliverance Tabernacle Fellowship of Ministries.
For 25 years, his church has uplifted Detroit through worship, education, service, and love.
I congratulate Bishop Tony Shomari Marshall and the House of Prayer Institutional Church on this extraordinary milestone.
