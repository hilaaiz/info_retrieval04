Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I am profoundly saddened by the heartbreaking loss of Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, whose life was tragically taken in the recent attack at the Dallas ICE facility.
His death is a sobering reminder of the human toll that violence leaves behind and the fragility of life when communities are confronted with such senseless acts.
At a time like this, my deepest condolences go out to 
Mr. GuzmanFuentes's wife, Berenice Prieto, loved ones, and all who knew him.
Their grief is immeasurable, and they deserve the comfort, compassion, and solidarity of their community as they endure this painful loss.
My prayers are with them, and I hope they find strength in the love and memories they shared with Norlan.
As a community, we must stand together to reject violence and embrace peace and humanity.
Every life lost diminishes us all, and we honor Norlan's memory by recommitting ourselves to building a safer, more compassionate future where gun violence must end.
May his family be surrounded by support and healing in the difficult days ahead.
