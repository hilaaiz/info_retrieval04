Mr. HARIDOPOLOS.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the life and legacy of John J. Meyers, III, a decorated veteran of the United States Navy who passed away on September 14, 2025, at the age of 87 in Sarasota, Florida.
John answered the call to serve his country as a naval aviator.
He trained in Pensacola, flew with Squadron VS-34 aboard the USS Essex, and later served as an instructor pilot at NAS Meridian.
His skill and leadership reflected the very best of our Nation's military tradition.
After his service, John carried those same values into civilian life.
He built a respected career in aviation and financial services, retiring as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch in Sarasota.
But beyond his profession, he was known for his mentorship and kindness.
John J. Meyers lived a life of honor, both in uniform and in his community.
Today, we remember him not only for his service to our Nation but for the positive impact he left on those around him.
May his memory be a blessing, and may his family find comfort in knowing his legacy of service will endure.
