Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, the 12th Congressional District is proud to celebrate the 100th birthday of 
Ms. Mable Emma Jean Wright, who was born October 3, 1925.
We extend our warmest wishes for this joyful celebration and offer heartfelt congratulations on reaching a remarkable milestone.
As a devoted mother of four, grandmother to seven, and greatgrandmother to three, 
Ms. Wright has been a pillar of her family and community.
For thirty-five years, she was an employee of the DMC Harper University Hospital, as well as the oldest and one of the most cherished members of ``I AM'' Temple Detroit for nearly forty-three years.
Her service to the church has been immeasurable.
With deep love and admiration, she is affectionately known as ``Mother Wright'' by fellow church members and friends alike.
The 12th Congressional District honors 
Ms. Wright's blessing of longevity, her legacy of faith and service, and with great pride, we celebrate 100 remarkable years of her life.
I thank her for being a light in many individuals' lives and wish her a wonderful birthday.
