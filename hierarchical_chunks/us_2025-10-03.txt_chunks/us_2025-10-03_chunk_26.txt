Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Walter Grainger, a lifelong resident of Bakersfield, California, who passed away on Sunday, September 14, 2025, at the age of 99.
In May 1944, just weeks after graduating from Kern County Union High School, later renamed Bakersfield High School, Walter enlisted in the United States Navy, where he served honorably during World War II.
He and his four brothers together wore our Nation's uniform in defense of freedom.
After the conclusion of his military service, Walter dedicated his life to education and community.
He taught at Bakersfield High School, Shafter High School, and North High School, where he chaired the Industrial Arts Department, before later working as a safety consultant for the school district.
Beyond the classroom, Walter was a devoted husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and faithful member of First United Methodist Church.
Even in his nineties, Walter continued to serve.
He was instrumental in the design and construction of the Kern County World War II Veterans Memorial at Jastro Park.
His vision and leadership helped shape one of the most beautiful veterans memorials in the West.
Today, that memorial stands as a lasting tribute to all who served, including Walter and his brothers, whose names are engraved in granite for generations to see.
Walter was a deeply respected member of the community, and when he spoke, people listened.
He lived his life with humility, service, and quiet strength.
His legacy is found not only in the memorial he helped build, but in the family he loved, the students he taught, and the community he served.
