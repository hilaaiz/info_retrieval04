Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors the extraordinary life and legacy of Michael ``Mike'' Friedman, a tireless champion of economic justice and workplace democracy.
From his early days as a truck driver and founding member of Teamsters for a Democratic Union to his distinguished legal career.
Mike's life was rooted in advancing the rights and dignity of working people.
As General Counsel at the Center for Community-Based Enterprise, Mike dedicated himself to helping businesses transition to worker ownership, empowering employees, and strengthening communities.
His leadership extended beyond C2BE to the Michigan Center for Employee Ownership, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Detroit Community Wealth Fund, where he shared his expertise and vision for a fairer, more just world.
Mike believed deeply in the power of unions to transform lives, which was reflected in his lifelong advocacy and teaching.
His legacy will continue to inspire all who fight for justice, equity, and workers rights.
Our thoughts are with his wife Barbara Harvey.
We extend our love to his wife, siblings, children, grandchildren, and friends as we celebrate his life, and we are committed to carrying forward his spirit of service, joy, and justice.
