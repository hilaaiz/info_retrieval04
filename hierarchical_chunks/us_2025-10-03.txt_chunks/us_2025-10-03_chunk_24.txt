Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply heartbroken over the loss of Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, who succumbed to his injuries following the horrific shooting at the Dallas ICE facility.
Miguel was a husband, a father, and a hardworking man whose greatest joy was providing for and being present with his family.
His death is an immeasurable tragedy that has left a lasting void for those who loved him most.
My prayers and deepest condolences are with Miguel's wife, Stephany Gauffeny, their four children, and the baby they were expecting, as they face this devastating loss.
To lose a loved one under such violent circumstances is a burden no family should ever bear.
His loved ones should know that they are not alone in their grief--our community mourns alongside them, and we extend every measure of compassion and support possible.
We will always remember Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez as a hardworking father, husband, neighbor, and colleague.
Today, we stand in solidarity with the Mexican community as we grieve this loss together, and we hold on to the hope that his memory will strengthen our resolve to bring an end to the epidemic of gun violence in our country.
