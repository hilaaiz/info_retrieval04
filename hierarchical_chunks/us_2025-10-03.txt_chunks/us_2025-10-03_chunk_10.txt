Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District proudly honors Macedonia Baptist Church as they celebrate 105 years of spiritual worship and leadership in our community.
As part of their milestone celebration, we recognize the unveiling of the new historical marker, commemorating the profound impact the Macedonia Baptist Church has had on the city of Detroit and beyond.
Since its founding in 1920, the Macedonia Baptist Church has remained steadfast in its commitment to serving the spiritual and moral needs of Detroit and its surrounding communities.
The church has consistently demonstrated deep roots and has always cared for the well-being of the community, engaging in meaningful outreach and service projects.
Their 105th anniversary shines a spotlight on the legacy of those whose labor and devotion have made the Macedonia Baptist Church a pillar in both Hamtramck and Detroit.
This ceremony marks a historic occasion of remembrance, celebration, and renewed commitment to building a stronger future together through faith.
The 12th Congressional District honors their service and dedication to creating a place of friendship and learning for our community.
I thank them for being a guiding light rooted in faith and service to all.
