Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions that have been made in our community by one of my constituents, Keith Vick, an active volunteer with Habitat for Humanity of Citrus County since 2022.
In his first full year as a core construction volunteer, 
Mr. Vick has already made an immense impact.
He believes in providing a hand-up, not a hand out to partner families.
As a U.S. Air Force Veteran and a retired first responder, 
Mr. Vick has contributed 434 hours of volunteer time.
He leads by example!
