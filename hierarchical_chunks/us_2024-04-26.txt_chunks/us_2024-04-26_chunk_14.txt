Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in celebrating the extraordinary life of The Honorable Clairmont Jerome ``Pops'' Barnes and in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
May we all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
