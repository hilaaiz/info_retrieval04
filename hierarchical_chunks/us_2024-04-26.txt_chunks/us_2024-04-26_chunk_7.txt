Mrs. LaHaye retired from her role as President of CWA in 2006.
She and Tim returned to Southern California, where they were closer to family.
She continued to serve as Chairman of the board for CWA until her retirement in 2020.
In addition, she continued to accept speaking engagements and served on various boards for Christian colleges and organizations.
Well into her eighties, Beverly still loved to be a voice in the cause and to educate future generations of Christian activists.
Throughout her life, Beverly's family was very important to her.
She invested in them personally and prayerfully.
While her life was very busy, whenever possible, she tried to carve out time to visit her children and grandchildren wherever they were living.
She organized family trips and opportunities for them all to be together.
In 2016, Beverly lost the love of her life, Tim, to a stroke at the age of 90.
They had been married for 69 years.
He was her greatest champion, her encourager, and true soulmate.
Ten months later, her son, Lee, also passed away.
It was a year of incredible loss for her.
She took great solace in the company of her remaining children, nine grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.
Beverly LaHaye was not born into privilege nor blessed with extraordinary skills and abilities.
Her life is a beautiful demonstration of what God can do with a person who is fully devoted to Him.
She was a faithful follower of Jesus Christ all the days of her life and God used her in extraordinary ways to make a difference in the world around her.
