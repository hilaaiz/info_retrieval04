Mr. Vick has become a favorite of the family partners because of his compassion and willingness to share the skills he has acquired throughout life.
As each home is completed, 
Mr. Vick takes it upon himself to go through the final checklist, or ``punch list'', to make sure homes are finished to the high standards set by Habitat.
Each day Keith is out there, he's always in a great mood and ready to work and help others.
He's around enough to know what needs to be done each day.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that 
Mr. Vick has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
