Mrs. LaHaye led teams of volunteers to the jungles of Costa Rica, where they provided much-needed aid to refugees fleeing from their own country.
CWA established a refuge station in the jungle which provided clothes, food, education, medical assistance, and, most importantly, hope to these struggling people.
The influence of CWA has spread throughout the country, with chapters in almost every state.
As chair and founder, Beverly hosted an award-winning radio talk show and appeared in numerous media interviews.
Beverly would not hesitate to accept the opportunity to be the voice of Christian women on national television, often in direct debate against some of the leading feminist and pro-choice voices of the day.
She always conducted herself with grace and dignity and spoke truth with strength and clarity.
Throughout her years in leadership, Beverly has received many awards, including Christian Woman of the Year, the Southern Baptist Convention's ``Religious Freedom Award,'' as well as ``Talk Show of the Year'' in 1993 or the Beverly LaHaye Live radio program.
In 1994, she was honored by the U.S. House of Representatives for service to her country, and in 2016, she was recognized by the Faith and Freedom Coalition with the ``Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award.''
Most recently, in 2023 Beverly was named one of the 50 greatest pro-life leaders in the past 50 years.
