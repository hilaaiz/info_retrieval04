Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with immense pride to recognize and celebrate the centennial anniversary of JE Dunn Construction Group.
This milestone is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and contributions that JE Dunn has made in the construction industry.
Founded in 1924 by John Ernest ``Ernie'' Dunn, this company that began in Kansas City, has now stretched across various generations of the Dunn family, and has only increased their reach beyond Missouri's Fifth Congressional District as the years have passed by.
With over 26 offices nationwide and being placed as the 8th overall largest contractor in the United States, this company has served its community through the principle of enriching lives.
Today, JE Dunn employs more than 1,200 people in Kansas City and 4,000 across the country.
In 1964 when Ernie Dunn passed, the company was worth $1.4 million and now the company is nearing a revenue of $6 billion.
The contributions in the local Kansas City area are important to job creation and sustaining economic growth as the city continues to grow and receive national and international attention.
Through JE Dunn's commitment to the local region, Kansas City began to see an increase in innovation and development in the 1960s with the development of Worlds of Fun, the Hy-Vee Arena then known as the Kemper Arena, among others.
As their mission to serve others in the pursuit of building perfection continues, JE Dunn has been vital in recent developments such as the Kansas City Zoo and building the world's first ever stadium for a women's pro sports team.
The impact of these investments will have a positive ripple effect on our city and community for generations to come.
