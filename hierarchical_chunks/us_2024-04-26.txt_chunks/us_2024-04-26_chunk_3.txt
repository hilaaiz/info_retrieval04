Mrs. CAMMACK.
Madam Chair, I would like to clarify the scope of the prohibitions in Division D of H.R. 8038.
As I understand it, Division D of H.R. 8038 would prevent TikTok from obtaining distribution through app stores and online marketplaces in the U.S. and deprive them of obtaining Internet-hosting infrastructure and services provided by U.S. entities, unless and until it is divested from ByteDance within 270 days of enactment.
When acting in their capacity of providing access to the Internet, Internet service providers (ISPs) do not engage in the activities that would be restricted by operation of Section 2(a)(1).
In providing their customers access to the Internet and connectivity to web sites and online service, ISPs are not engaging in distribution activities prohibited under subparagraph (A).
And in providing access or connectivity to web sites or online services at the request and direction of their customers, ISPs are not engaged in providing any Internet hosting services restricted under subparagraph (B).
