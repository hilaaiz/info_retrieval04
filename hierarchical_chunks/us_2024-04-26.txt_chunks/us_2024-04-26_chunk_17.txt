Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Jacqueline Vandyke, a volunteer with the Gulf Coast Manatees Homeschool Group.
Jacqueline has given so much of herself to make sure children in the program succeed.
As founder of the first non-profit homeschool group in Citrus County, she finds fun and interactive ways for the children to learn.
The children get to go on trips, learn hands-on life skills, all while making friends.
She also is committed to helping install the value of community service in children, spearheading: food drives, feeding programs for the homeless, beautification of church grounds, creating cards for soldiers, and wrapping gifts for cancer patients.
Jacqueline makes sure all kids get a moving up and graduation ceremony.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part It is clear that 
Ms. Vandyke has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
