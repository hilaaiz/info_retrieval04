Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Denise Aiello, a volunteer Peer Specialist with LifeStream Behavioral Center.
She works with the citizens of Citrus County who have substance misuse disorders.
Denise focuses her efforts with pregnant mothers, meeting them at their prenatal appointments, ensuring follow-up with maternity care, and providing resources to address treatment needs, and other material resources.
Denise also works closely with Citrus EMTs responding to overdose calls as part of the CORe program, meeting consumers at the emergency room to offer connections to substance misuse treatments including MAT, counseling, or admission to residential treatment.
Denise will meet with the consumer at their home or outpatient appointment to provide support, guidance, and assistance with paperwork.
She will respond at night and on weekends if a call comes in.
She is dedicated to helping others rehabilitate and recover.
She will make repeated attempts to engage with a consumer, understanding they might need time to recognize and accept that they need help.
Denise is an empathic and dedicated peer who is an asset to the LifeStream family and to the residents.
It is clear that 
Ms. Aiello has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with in the fight against the horrific crime of human trafficking.
I am grateful for her service.
