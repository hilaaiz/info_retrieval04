Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today celebrate the brave first responders of the Pomeroy Fire Department in Meigs County, Ohio, as they are being honored as the Ohio Fire Department of the Year by the State Fire Marshall and the Ohio Department.
The 30 members of the all-volunteer Pomeroy firefighting force have consistently demonstrated a level of training, preparedness, and dedication second to none.
They've proven their commitment to excellence by pursuing advanced training, completing both in-service and multicompany training exercises, enhancing the force's efficiency, loss reduction, and ability to safeguard our community.
I cannot say enough about how much Pomeroy's Fire Department has given back to Meigs County, serving well beyond their roles as first responders--leading food drives, educating the community on fire safety and prevention, and distributing smoke detectors, among many other contributions.
I am pleased to honor the fine men and women of the Pomeroy firefighting force for their justly deserved recognition as the Ohio Fire Department of the Year.
Their service makes our community, Pomeroy, Meigs County, and Ohio, a better place--and I could not be more proud.
Congratulations to them on this well-deserved award.
