I thank my hon.
Friend not only for that question but for the tenacity with which she has backed Kilmarnock to get more funding for her local area in the Budget.
It is an absolute disgrace that the previous Government made promises to communities such as Kilmarnock about funding that they never had an  intention of keeping.
This Government stepped in and funded those projects, chose investment over decline and will deliver growth and higher living standards.
The irony is that the Scottish National party voted against the largest funding settlement in the history of devolution yesterday, but will spend it today.
