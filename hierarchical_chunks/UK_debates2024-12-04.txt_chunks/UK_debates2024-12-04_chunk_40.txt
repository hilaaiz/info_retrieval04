We must also recognise, however, the state of our public services and the mess in which we found the public finances when we came into power.
There was no way we could have left things as they were.
Unlike the Conservatives, there was never any question of Labour ignoring the £22 billion black hole that we uncovered in the public finances.
We had to bring the previous Administration’s fiscal irresponsibility to an end.
We had to ensure that our country lives within its means.
We had to get public services back on their feet while meeting our tough new fiscal rules, which end borrowing for day-to-day spending.
That is what we, as a responsible Government, had to do.
