I welcome the chance to open the debate on behalf of the Government.
The Government’s commitment to farmers is steadfast.
As our amendment makes clear, farmers make an immense contribution to the UK economy and to the nation’s food security.
We recognise and respect the crucial contribution that farmers make to our country’s way of life.
