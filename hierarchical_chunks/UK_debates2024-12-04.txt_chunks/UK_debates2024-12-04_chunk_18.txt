I welcome the swift and decisive action this Government are taking to secure our borders after the Conservatives lost control.
In particular, I welcome the world-first deal struck with Iraq last week to tackle smuggling gangs.
Does the Prime Minister agree that international co-operation, shared intelligence and joint law enforcement are the best way to end the vile smuggling trade?
