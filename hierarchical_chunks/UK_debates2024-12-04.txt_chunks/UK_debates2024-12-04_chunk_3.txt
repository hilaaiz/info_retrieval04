I recently visited Vector Photonics in my constituency, an optical and photonic centre of excellence and a successful spin-out from Glasgow University.
What role does the Secretary of State believe there is for start-up and spin-out tech companies in Scotland’s economic growth?
I wish Vector Photonics well.
Supporting start-ups and spin-out tech companies and the world-leading Scottish universities that often incubate them is an important part of this Government’s steadfast commitment to economic growth.
It was privilege to see at first hand the importance of these spin-outs during my recent visit to Malaysia and Singapore, when I discussed this with the Scottish universities present in those countries and representatives from the Government and business.
Scottish universities punch well above their weight internationally—something we should nurture and be very proud of.
With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I wish Peter MacMahon well as he steps down as Scottish political editor of ITV Border.
Peter has provided outstanding coverage of not just Scottish questions in this Parliament but Scottish politics more generally to my constituents and those across the south of Scotland.
I am sure the Secretary of State will welcome, as I do, the fact that the life of Torness nuclear power station has been extended.
That is good for energy security and for the Scottish economy.
But given that energy is a reserved matter, what more can he do to bring new nuclear development to Scotland?
I join the right hon.
Gentleman in his tribute to Peter MacMahon as he steps down as the political editor of ITV in the Borders region.
He and I share something closely: we both have good faces for radio, but it is always nice to appear with Peter MacMahon on television.
This Government are committed to clean power by 2030, and of course, nuclear is part of that mix.
