I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that issue and I will certainly consider his kind invitation.
We will invest in heritage buildings, restoring pride and ensuring that they serve the needs of local communities.
The National Lottery Heritage Fund has awarded Stoke-on-Trent £250,000 to help preserve the city’s heritage.
Historic England is also funding emergency repairs at the iconic Wedgewood Institute and supporting Re-form Heritage—whose office, I think, is based in my hon.
Friend’s constituency—to employ staff dedicated to delivering heritage projects.
