I thank my hon.
Friend for her Christmas single; there is obviously going to be some rivalry in the race for No. 1 by Christmas—I will not be joining that particular race.
I thank her and Mal Pope for their campaigning.
I remember joining her a few summers ago in the work involving the hampers, which are much needed by her constituents.
I know how much it means to them.
Christmas is a time to think of others, and I pay tribute to her and all those supporting those in need.
This Government will always support the most vulnerable in our society.
