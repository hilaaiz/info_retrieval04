The Prime Minister has rightly spoken about the need to restore and rebuild the public’s trust in British politics.
We believe a crucial part of that is reforming our electoral system to make it fairer and more proportional, and so do a majority of the British public.
This House voted yesterday in favour of a Bill for electoral reform put forward by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney) .
Will the Prime Minister make Government time available so we can consider that Bill about electoral reform and restore the public’s trust in our politics?
