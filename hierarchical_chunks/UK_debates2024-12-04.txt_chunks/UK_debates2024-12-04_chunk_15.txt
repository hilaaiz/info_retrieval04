I thank my hon.
Friend for his question; he is absolutely correct.
The UK Budget chose investment over decline, including investment directly in my hon.

He is also right to say that our hospitality businesses need the rates relief more than ever.
The Scottish Government should use their Budget to deliver growth and investment to help our high streets, and passing on the relief should be the bare minimum.
