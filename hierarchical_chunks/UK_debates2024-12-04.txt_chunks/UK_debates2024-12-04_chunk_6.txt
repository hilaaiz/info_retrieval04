The Secretary of State has said before and he has said again today that one of his top priorities for the Scotland Office is growth.
To grow, the Government need confidence from business.
Let us see how that is going: the verdict from Scottish business to his Government’s Budget is in.
Offshore Energies UK said that “this is a difficult day for the sector.”
The Scottish Hospitality Group has said: “Today’s announcements are a blow to businesses across the country”.
The Scotch Whisky Association said that the increase in spirits duty is a “hammer blow”.
The National Farmers Union Scotland has said that the decisions will cause “huge difficulties” and act as a barrier to those wanting to get into farming.
Given those responses, if not from retail, oil and gas, hospitality, food and drink or financial services, from which sector does he think this mythical growth will come?
