I thank the hon.
Lady for her interest.
She is right that it is important to ensure that every person in the country can be connected.
That is why we have encouraged social tariffs, which have been rolled  out by a large number of operators.
Constituents of hers who are on benefits will be able to access those.
They cost from £10 a month, bringing cheap connectivity to everybody.
