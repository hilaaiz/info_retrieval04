I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important issue.
We are committed to making the UK the best place in the world to be a veteran and to ensuring that they have access to the appropriate physical and mental health support that they deserve.
That is why we have rolled out Operation Restore, Op Courage and Op Nova.
NHS England has been introducing a suite of health services to work more closely with  orthopaedic services.
I know that my hon.
Friend has raised this issue of funding with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, who will be writing back to him with an update in due course.
