I thank the hon.
Lady for her point of order.
I am sure she meant to say that she was indicating that any misleading of the House would be inadvertent.
I am not  responsible, obviously, for responses from Ministers, but the Minister, who is still here, will have heard her comments, as will have those on the Treasury Bench.
Does the Minister wish to speak further to that point of order?
