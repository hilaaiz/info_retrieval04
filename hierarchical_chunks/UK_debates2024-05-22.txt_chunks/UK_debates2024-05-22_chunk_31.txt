I thank my right hon.
Friend for the update to the House.
In London we have the challenge of the Metropolitan police failing to meet their recruitment targets.
The police are under incredible pressure at weekends, policing hate marches and other demonstrations in central London.
Police are being drawn in from outside London to carry that out.
Now that the mayoral election is over, what action is my right hon.
Friend taking with the Mayor of London to ensure that the Met police meet their recruitment targets, and that the police are trained properly and can get on with the job of catching criminals?
