I thank my wife, who is in the Chamber, my daughter and other family members—my father and my father-in-law.
I thank my wife for being there every single day of those many months in hospital.
She could only do that because of the support of family behind her.
In the Public Gallery—they cannot quite see me, unfortunately—are many of the staff from the NHS.
[Applause.]
They took me from where I was, close to death, to where I am today, so I thank them for that.
I am not entirely sure I am that happy that the two surgeons who took this lot off are there, but never mind.
