The Prime Minister continues to play games with the public, so while he does that, let us get back to some serious matters.
I was taken aback this week when a former Prime Minister spoke some sense.
Alas, it was, indeed, David Cameron.
What he said in relation to graduate route visas was that if any restrictions were implemented, it would lead to job losses, university closures and a reduction in research.
Universities Scotland outlines that £5 billion of economic value is at risk.
So, may I ask the Prime Minister: does he agree with the Foreign Secretary?
The Foreign Secretary also said that the levels of legal migration to this country are too high.
That is what I also believe, which is why it is right that we are taking decisive action to bring down the numbers.
And that plan is working.
In the first three months of this year, the visas issued are down by 25% and migration is on its way to being returned to more sustainable levels.
I appreciate that that is a point of difference between the right hon.
Gentleman’s party, and indeed the Labour party, and us.
We believe that that level of migration needs to come down to more sustainable levels, so that we ease the pressure on public services.
Everyone who comes to our country must contribute economically.
That is the migration system that we will deliver.
On the Welsh borders, we are incredibly proud of the Veterans’ Orthopaedic Centre at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in north Shropshire, which treats veterans not only locally, including from my constituency of Clwyd South, but from across Britain, as it is the largest hospital-based veterans service in the UK.
Will the Prime Minister help resolve the centre’s current funding crisis, caused by changes in the NHS funding formula last year, given the fantastic treatment provided by Lieutenant Colonel Carl Meyer and his team for our amazing veterans community across the UK?
