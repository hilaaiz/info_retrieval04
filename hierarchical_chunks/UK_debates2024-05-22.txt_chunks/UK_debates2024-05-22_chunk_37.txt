I thank the Minister for stating his position.
I suggest that perhaps the offer of a further discussion with the Lord Chancellor would be appropriate.
I am sure the hon.
Lady will come back after that if she feels there are further points she wishes to make.
She is very experienced in knowing how to make her views known in the House, so I am sure that that is probably the best way forward for now.
