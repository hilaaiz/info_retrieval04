I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, but that is not a true representation of what the NAO said about the shared rural network.
We are making very good progress and hope soon to be able to share very good coverage maps showing the progress made.
On the roll-out of gigabit, he may be interested to know that the Welsh Government made representations to us about bringing it in-house, because we were making much better progress in England than they were in Wales.
I am very pleased to say that ever since we took it in-house, we have had amazing progress on gigabit roll-out in Wales.
