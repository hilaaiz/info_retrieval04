I thank my hon.
Friend for all her campaigning on this and other online safety-related issues; we have had a number of engagements.
The Government said very clearly that we would explore the issue of data access for researchers into online safety during the passage of the Online Safety Act 2023.
We are aware of the amendments tabled to the DPDI Bill, and I encourage my hon.
Friend to watch this space, as we will be reporting in due course.
