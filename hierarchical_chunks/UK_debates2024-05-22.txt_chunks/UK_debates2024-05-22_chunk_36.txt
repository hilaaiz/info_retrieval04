Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
The hon.
Lady raises an individual case and I am sure the Lord Chancellor would be happy to look at an individual case for her.
She mentioned someone released on sentencing.
Of course, the court or the probation service will look at time served on remand already, so a prisoner may have been on remand for quite a long time at the point that they come to a sentencing hearing.
To repeat the more general rules, which are Ministry of Justice policy: the release under licence up to 70 days prior to the ordinary release point does not apply to any prisoner serving a sentence of more than four years; it does not apply to any prisoner serving a sentence for serious sexual or violent offences; and the prison governor can veto the release of a prisoner considered to be a danger.
Those are the safeguards, but if the hon.
Lady wants to debate the matter in more detail, I am sure my colleague the Lord Chancellor would be very happy to do that.
