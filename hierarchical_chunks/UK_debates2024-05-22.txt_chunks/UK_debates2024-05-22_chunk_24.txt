Thank you, Mr Speaker.
This is an emotional day for me, and if you will indulge me, I will say a few thanks, because a few are due.
Apologies are due, actually, as I have caused the  breaking of so many rules today: there has been clapping; I have got trainers on because my shoes would not go over the plastic feet; and my jacket would not go over the bionic arm.
First, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for being there for me and for coming to visit.
I will tell everybody this little story: the rest of the hospital thought I must be dreadfully ill, because they said, “That guy’s got the funeral director in already.”
[Laughter.]
But you have been, and you have cared for me throughout, and I thank you for that.
The other person in this Chamber I would like to thank is the Prime Minister, who has been with me throughout.
He has not advertised it, but he has been to see me multiple times.
To me, that shows the true depth of the character of the Prime Minister, and I thank him for that.
