I thank my hon.
Friend for his role as rural connectivity champion; I discussed that role yesterday with the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon.
Friend the Member  for Keighley (Robbie Moore).
I am pleased to see that he recently attended a visit to see how the supplier Voneus is investing in a wider solution for premises on Walney island.
I assure him that we already take a technology-agnostic approach to our contracts, with some suppliers using wireless connectivity and exploring fixed wireless access and low Earth orbit satellites.
