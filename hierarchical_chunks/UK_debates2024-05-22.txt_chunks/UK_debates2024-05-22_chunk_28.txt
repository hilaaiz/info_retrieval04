Does my right hon.
Friend agree that this important debate, which touches upon not only public safety but the whole way in which our justice system operates, is best dealt with in a calm fashion?
It is perfectly reasonable to adopt contingency measures, which we hope are often not needed, but the most important thing is to ensure that all parties in this House commit to a consistent and sustained investment in all aspects of the criminal justice system, because we cannot decouple policing from the courts, prisons and the whole of the process.
That is the sensible debate that the country needs to have.
My hon.
and learned Friend, as always, puts it very well.
He is quite right that investment is important.
That is why there are record numbers of police officers.
It is why 20,000 prison places are in the course of being constructed, 5,900 of which are currently operational and 10,000 of which will be operational by the end of next year.
It is why more money is being put into the Crown Prosecution Service.
It is why my right hon.
and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor, who is  here on the Front Bench, is ensuring that legal aid is properly resourced, as is the criminal Bar.
Those are all extremely important initiatives to ensure that the public are protected.
The ultimate measure of public protection, of course, is the overall level of criminality, which, as I have said once or twice before, has halved since the Labour party left office.
