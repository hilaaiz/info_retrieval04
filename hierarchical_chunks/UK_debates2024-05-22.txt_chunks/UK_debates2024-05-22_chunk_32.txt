My hon.
Friend is right to raise the question of police numbers in London.
Whereas across England and Wales as a whole we have record police numbers and 42 of the 43 police forces met their recruitment target, there was one that did not: the Metropolitan police under Sadiq Khan.
In fact, its numbers unfortunately have shrunk in the past year, rather than grown.
I therefore attended the police performance oversight group, which is the special measures group chaired by the chief inspector, just a few days ago, attended by the commissioner and the deputy Mayor, Sophie Linden.
Unfortunately, Sadiq Khan did not see fit to show up to that meeting.
One of the points I made forcefully was the importance of growing police numbers in London.
It is the only force in the country to miss its target, and that must be turned around.
Let me get this right: the Government are boasting that they appointed 20,000 extra policemen and women to prevent crime and protect the public; criminals create and undertake crime; and an instruction is given to the police not to arrest them because the prisons are full.
The Government’s defence is, “It’s all right; the instruction was never acted upon.”
Can the public have any confidence, if it is possible for the police to give instructions today, and maybe again next week, not to arrest criminals?
Can we really believe that crime is being taken seriously in this country?
Crime is taken very seriously, which why it has fallen by 6% in the past year and 55% since 2010.
The right hon.
Gentleman referred to a period of just eight days when a contingency was considered but not used.
The Lord Chancellor, rightly and in a thoughtful and measured manner, has taken steps that will take effect tomorrow to ensure that such a contingency is not required in future.
That is a responsible way of handling the situation.
