Mrs. Bennett's stated mission of filling her students with pride exemplifies the kind of leader she is.
I express great pride in knowing that such a remarkable and kindhearted person has been named the Santa Rosa County Teacher of the Year.
I congratulate her on this welldeserved recognition and look forward to seeing the many musical successes that she and her students will undoubtedly achieve in the future.
