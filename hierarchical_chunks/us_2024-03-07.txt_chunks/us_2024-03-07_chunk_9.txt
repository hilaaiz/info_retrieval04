Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Jacqueline Applegate, President of Bayer Crop Science North America on her retirement.
In the words of her colleagues, Dr. Applegate has been an excellent member of the Executive Leadership Team for the Global Crop Science division.
Dr. Applegate is a scientist by training and began her career at Bayer as a process development chemist at a manufacturing facility in Kansas City, Missouri after graduating from Iowa State University with a Ph.D. in organic chemistry.
Dr. Applegate served as Global President of Vegetable Seeds and Environmental Science, and as the Culture and Change Management Lead for the Bayer/Monsanto integration.
Throughout her career she's made a positive impact everywhere she's been.
Dr. Applegate oversaw more than 11,000 employees and was responsible for the commercial performance of the Crop Science business in the United States and Canada, which is a segment worth more than $8B in net sales.
Dr. Applegate made significant impacts throughout her career, whether through her commitment to assist in the career elevation for each team member or in opening opportunity for the youth who will lead agriculture in the future.
The greatest leaders we have not only take on the issues of today, but they also lay the groundwork for a better tomorrow.
Dr. Applegate certainly fits that description.
