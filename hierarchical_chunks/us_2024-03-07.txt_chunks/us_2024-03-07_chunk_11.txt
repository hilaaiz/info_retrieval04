Mr. MOORE.
Mr. Speaker, I was saddened by the recent and sudden passing of Tammy Holland, who was an anchor in the Ogden, Utah and Hill Air Force Base communities.
Tammy was a native to Colorado, where she grew up hiking, skiing, and riding horses.
She brought her love of the outdoors to Utah and instilled the same admiration for God's creations in her children, Andrew and Avery.
Tammy was easy to be around and quick to welcome anyone as a new friend.
With her husband of 23 years, Tammy built her home centered on faith in Jesus Christ and encouraged family and friends alike to join her in serving others.
It's no easy task raising two kids in an Air Force family, and Tammy was a rock for her husband and children as they made homes in Florida, South Carolina, Ohio, Germany, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Illinois, Missouri, and ultimately, Utah.
Friends and loved ones in each of these communities came to love Tammy for her organizing and compassionate service to the Airmen and their respective families.
Our community is better because of her efforts and her influence will be greatly missed.
It is upon us to carry forward her legacy of service.
I extend my deepest sympathy to Tammy's husband, Col. Jeff Holland, and their son, Andrew, and daughter, Avery, for their loss, and I offer my prayers on their behalf.
