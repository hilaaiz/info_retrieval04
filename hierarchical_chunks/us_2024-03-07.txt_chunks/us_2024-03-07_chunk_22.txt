Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Santa Rosa County Teacher of the Year, 
Mrs. Christal Bennett, for her exceptional efforts in fostering the musical talents of her many students.
A longtime Florida native, 
Mrs. Bennett's extensive history in music education began in the very District in which she now teaches.
From Avalon Middle School to the University of West Florida, 
Mrs. Bennett's exceptional gift of music has exemplified a lifelong dedication to spreading joy throughout her community.
As the Director of Bands at Central School and the recent founder of its very first marching band, 
Mrs. Bennett's leadership continues to find new and influential ways to impact the lives of countless young musicians.
In its first year, the Central School Jaguar Marching Band has already managed to obtain a competition rating of ``excellent'' under her direction.
