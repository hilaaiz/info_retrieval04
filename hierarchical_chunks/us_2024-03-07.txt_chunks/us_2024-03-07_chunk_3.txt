Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life and advocacy of Malphine ``Mafa'' Fogel, who will celebrate her 95th birthday on March 11, 2024.
Malphine was born and raised in Brady's Bend, Pennsylvania.
After graduating as the valedictorian of East Brady High School's class of 1947, she moved to Butler, Pennsylvania.
She began a successful career there with the Butler Eagle newspaper and Nationwide Insurance Company.
In 1957, Malphine married Maurice ``Cubby'' Fogel and shared 57 happy years of marriage before his passing in 2014.
The couple raised three children together: Mary, Marc, and Anne.
Over the years, the Fogel family grew to include nine grandchildren and eight greatgrandchildren.
She also remains closely connected with her seven siblings and travels home to Brady's Bend every Sunday to spend dinner with them.
Last May, I had the honor of meeting Malphine for the first time when she traveled to Washington and advocated for her son's release from a Russian prison.
With the support of Malphine and her family, I proudly introduced the Marc Fogel Act to provide transparency into the State Department's wrongful detainment determination process and ensure that Americans imprisoned overseas are not forgotten.
The Fogel family deserves answers, and we will not rest until Marc returns home.
Malphine built her life on the bedrock of faith and reverence for God, and it continues to guide her through this difficult time.
Every Sunday, she attends Mass at St. Michael the Archangel and was a frequent parishioner at the 24 hour Eucharistic Adoration for 20 years.
Her example of faith, love, and devotion to family provide an inspiring example for all Americans.
