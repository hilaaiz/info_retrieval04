My friend, Brent Olmstead, has had many titles in his distinguished career, but the two most important to Brent are father and husband.
Brent is a devoted family man and raised five children with his late wife, Jane Wittmeyer.
If anyone has earned the right to have a peaceful and enjoyable retirement, it is Brent.
Well done my friend and congratulations.
