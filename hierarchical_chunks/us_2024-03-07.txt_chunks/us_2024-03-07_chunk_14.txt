Mr. Moore was a man of immense talent and his renowned works in film, music, and literature helped shape our culture in Atlanta and beyond.
In 1978, 
Mr. Moore embarked upon one of his greatest gifts when he founded the African American Panoramic Experience (APEX) Museum, where he proudly served as its President until his passing.
The APEX Museum is the oldest Black history museum in Atlanta and a cultural institution.
His work will live on as the museum plans APEX
Phase II, a massive 90,000 square foot expansion that will provide a state-of-theart walk-through history, from African civilizations to contemporary Black America.
Among his many awards and accolades, 
Mr. Moore received the Joseph R. Biden Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award on October 21, 2023.
Most recently, during Black History Month this year, I had the pleasure of recognizing 
Mr. Moore for his pioneering contributions to the preservation and showcasing of Black history and culture in Atlanta at a ceremony in Stonecrest.
I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the outstanding life and legacy that 
Mr. Moore leaves behind for generations to come.
