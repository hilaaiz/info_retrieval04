communities have access to the specialized care they need.
Just like the circuit riders of the American frontier who brought church services to remote towns, today's circuit riders bring child psychiatry, neurology, and other critical specialties directly to our bases.
Cannon may have pioneered this approach, but rural military installations across the country could benefit.
Nearly 50 percent of active-duty bases are in health care deserts, where accessing specialists often means long drives, missed duty, and high costs.
In just over a year, Cannon's program served 160 patients, saved $200,000 in travel voucher costs, and reclaimed 1,400 duty hours.
The circuit rider program saves money, improves mission readiness, and strengthens care for servicemembers and their families.
I urge support for my amendment to expand this cost-effective and proven model to rural bases nationwide.
