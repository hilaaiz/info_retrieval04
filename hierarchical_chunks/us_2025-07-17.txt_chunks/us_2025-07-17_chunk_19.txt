Mr. Samuel Bigler, known as Sam, was a father to Evan and a husband to Cindy.
He was a strong presence in the Lancaster community as a veteran, an Olympic weightlifter, a teacher, a business owner, a volunteer, and much more.
A 1965 graduate of Co]umbia High School, Sam enlisted in the U.S. Army and served between 1966 and 1969.
Having lifted weights since a young age, Sam continued this passion and won numerous national and international titles and awards, culminating in a spot on the 1976 U.S. Olympic Weightlifting team in Montreal, Canada and a tenth-place finish.
Sam attended Millersville State College and received a bachelor's and master's degree in education.
He then served as a reading specialist at Thaddeus Stevens College for 33 years.
During this time, Sam began a rental property business with his wife, Cindy.
Sam was also impactful in his volunteer capacity.
He served on the Millersville Zoning Board, the local Republican committee, and was a mentor to individuals participating in the Lancaster County Veteran's Court program.
Sam's impact on the community cannot be understated, and I am glad to have known him.
As we celebrate the life of Sam Bigler, we offer our prayers of comfort to his family during this time.
