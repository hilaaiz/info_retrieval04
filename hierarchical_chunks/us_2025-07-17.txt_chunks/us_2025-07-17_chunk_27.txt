House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, July 7, 2025.
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Mast: Thank you for your letter concerning H.R. 1765, the ``Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2025.''
I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.
I agree that your decision to forgo action on this bill does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, nor prejudice that Committee's jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future.
As you requested, I will include a copy of our exchange of letters on H.R. 1765 in the committee report on the bill and in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor.
Thank you again for your assistance on this matter.
Sincerely, Brett Guthrie, Chairman.
