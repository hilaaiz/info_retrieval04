and was responsible for printing seven separate publications.
He was dedicated to local, independent journalism and never hesitated to follow a difficult story.
Outside of his public life, 
Mr. Dwight was a loving husband, father, and grandfather.
To those who knew him, he was endlessly curious, and never afraid to try new things.
He always knew how to ask the right questions and was driven by unflinching dedication to the common good.
The mark he left on his community, state, and country will never be forgotten, and for that, we are forever grateful.
