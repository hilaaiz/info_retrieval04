Affairs on the text of H.R. 1765, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2025.
I agree that Foreign Affairs may be discharged from further consideration of the bill, so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.
This agreement is made with the understanding that it does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or prejudice our jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future.
I also request your support for the appointment of an appropriate number of Foreign Affairs conferees to any HouseSenate conference that might occur on this legislation.
I would appreciate it if you could include this letter in your committee report on the bill or place it into the forward to continuing to work together as this measure moves through the legislative process.
Sincerely, Brian Mast, Chairman.
