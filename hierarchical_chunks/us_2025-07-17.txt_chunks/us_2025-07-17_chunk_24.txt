Mr. GUTHRIE.
Mr. Speaker.
I wish to include in the Record the following letters of exchange between the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs with respect to H.R. 1765, the Promoting United States Wireless Leadership Act of 2025.
By these letters, the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs agreed to discharge the bill and forgo further consideration of the measure so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.
I agree that this discharge in no way diminishes or alters the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this measure or similar legislation in the future.
