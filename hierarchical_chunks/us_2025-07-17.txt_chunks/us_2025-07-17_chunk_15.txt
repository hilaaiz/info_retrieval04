For two decades, Reverend Nelson has led Sixth Mount Zion with vision, compassion, and an unwavering commitment to service.
Under his leadership, the church has grown not only in membership, but in its outreach and impact throughout the Richmond community.
He has been a steadfast advocate for the needs of his congregation and a champion for justice, education, housing, and economic empowerment in the city and beyond.
Reverend Nelson's tenure has been marked by a spirit of innovation and inclusivity, fostering a welcoming environment for individuals and families from all walks of life.
His ability to connect faith with action has helped shape the church into a community anchor, offering programs and partnerships that address food insecurity, youth mentorship, and senior care, while serving as a safe gathering place for civic dialogue and community advancement.
In addition to his responsibilities as pastor of Sixth Mount Zion Baptist, Reverend Nelson has remained active in civic life, lending his voice to advance equity, opportunity, and public service.
His leadership extends far beyond the pulpit, touching the lives of countless community members through both his words and his work.
