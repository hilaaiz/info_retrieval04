Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Love Thy City event held in Tyler, Texas, a community-wide initiative that reminds us that service to our neighbors doesn't start in Washington, it starts in the heart and in the home as it extends to every corner of this earth.
Organized by local citizen-leaders, churches, nonprofits, and volunteers of all ages, Love Thy City is a day of service to others rooted in the great command to love our neighbors.
That's a principle that transcends politics and parties.
It transcends race and gender and every difference between us.
It is our shared responsibility to care for everyone around us just as the Good Samaritan did--not because Government would tell us to, but because the Love of Christ propels us to.
Whether it's cleaning up a park, helping a neighbor in need, or simply showing kindness to a stranger, Love Thy City challenges us to use our active faith to lead by example and invest in our communities-- not just with words, but with action.
This is what makes East Texas strong; faith, service, and a deep love for God and for one another.
I'm proud to honor this effort today and to recognize all those who give their time to love their neighbor.
