“the UK is unlikely to meet its NDC”.
That is not least because the committee calculates that just 28% of the required emission reductions for 2030 are covered by credible Government plans.
She will know that targets without plans are cheap.
What concrete plans do the Government have to urgently close that gap?
Does she agree that we must see an ambitious outcome from the global stocktake, with significantly strengthened 2030 NDCs and new economy-wide targets by 2025 that see the richest countries going further and faster?
Does the Minister share my outrage over reports that the UAE plans to use its role as COP28 president to secure oil and gas deals?
What assessment has she made of the impact of that on trust in the negotiations?
Will she explain why the UK is pushing for the phase-out of unabated fossil fuels, rather than of fossil fuels in their entirety?
Does she recognise the view of the High Ambition Coalition, which says that we cannot use abatement technologies to “green-light” fossil fuel expansion?
How will she ensure that any agreement that includes language on abatement has real teeth, delivers real cuts in fossil fuel production, and does not simply allow for the continuation of business as usual?
