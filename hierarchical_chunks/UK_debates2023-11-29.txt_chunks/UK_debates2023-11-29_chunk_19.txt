I thank my hon.
Friend for continuing to champion the new hospital in Kettering.
We are absolutely committed to delivering the scheme for Kettering General Hospital.
As my hon.
Friend will be aware, the new energy centre is vital to the delivery of the new hospital, and we expect that work to begin in the first quarter of next year.
The new hospital programme is working closely with the trust to ensure that the plans are deliverable.
