The UK Government’s series of U-turns on net zero targets has put our ability to meet them at risk.
The Scottish Government are committed to meeting our more ambitious targets, but Europe and the United States are leading the way as this place lags behind, in turn holding Scotland back.
Can the Minister confirm whether the new Foreign Secretary, who famously decided to “cut the green crap”, will be attending COP26?
That move cost UK households £2.5 billion in extra energy costs.
I reassure the hon.
Gentleman that we are committed to ensuring we hit all those targets.
As of September 2022, more than 130 countries, accounting for around 85% of global emissions and more than 90% of global GDP, were covered by net zero commitments.
We are committed to making sure that we hit those targets, and that is demonstrated by our attendance at COP28 and the measures we are taking to ensure we meet the climate challenges.
The Government’s “Mobilising green investment” strategy, published in March, set out that we need $1 trillion a year in green  finance by 2030.
What are the Government’s ambitions at COP28 to agree funding anywhere close to that level?
What more can we do to get our private sector and pension schemes to contribute to that?
My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
We will have those discussions over the two weeks of COP28.
We are trying to ensure that we hit all the global targets, too.
I am sure that those conversations will come up, and we can have a discussion on them later.
