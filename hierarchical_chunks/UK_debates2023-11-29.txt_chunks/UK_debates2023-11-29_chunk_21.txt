Thank you, Mr Speaker, for welcoming my constituent John Farringdon to Parliament this morning.
At 110 years of age, John is among my more experienced constituents, and I know that he would want me to ask the Prime Minister to join us in thanking the staff of Cubbington Mill care home for looking after him so well.
May I also ask my right hon.
Friend to try to find a moment or two to speak to John when he comes to Downing Street this afternoon?
It may be a useful conversation for those who are obsessed with the opinion polls, as John, I think it is fair to say, has some experience in surviving against the odds.
I very much hope that I have a chance to meet John later on.
I join my right hon.
and learned Friend in paying tribute to John’s care home for the incredible care that it provides.
It is great that John is here and I am sure that everyone will enjoy meeting him later today.
