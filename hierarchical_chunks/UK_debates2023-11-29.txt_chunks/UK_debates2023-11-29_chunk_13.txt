The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 29 November.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have other such meetings later today.
Last year, Scotland exported 19 trillion Wh of electricity, worth £4 billion, to the UK grid, yet not only do Scottish generators pay the highest grid connection charges in Europe, but Scots pay among the highest standing charges while London’s are by far the lowest.
Our heating and lighting is switched on a lot earlier and off a lot later than the south of England’s.
Should Scottish households be forced to shiver in the dark this winter to subsidise the richest part of the UK?
As the hon.
Gentleman will know, standing charges are a matter for Ofgem, the independent regulator.
Last week, it launched a consultation asking for views about standing charges.
He will know that because of geographic factors, the UK Government already provide an annual cross-subsidy worth £60 to a typical household in Scotland, but on top of that we are providing considerable support to everyone across the UK with their energy bills this year.
Abigail Mor Edan is four years old.
Released from Hamas captivity last weekend, Abigail is an orphan, after her parents were brutally executed in front of her during Hamas’s rampage on 7 October.
To secure the freedom of Abigail and some other hostages, Israel is taking a huge risk, releasing convicted terrorists, including would-be suicide bomber Israa Jaabis, imprisoned for detonating a gas cylinder in her car in 2015.
Hamas also seem to have broken the ceasefire, by activating three explosive devices.
What steps is my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister taking to continue his welcome, steadfast support for Israel in its fight against not only Hamas, but other Iran-backed terror groups?
