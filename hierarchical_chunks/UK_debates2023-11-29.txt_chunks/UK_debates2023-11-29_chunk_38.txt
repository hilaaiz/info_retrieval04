Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
The hon.
Member for Bootle (Peter Dowd)  was kind enough to notify me of his intention to make a point of order and I have already begun the process of looking into it.
It is fair to say that he is a friend of mine, although I know that many will hold that against him.
He is merely doing his job, and I will make sure that that continues.
I was about to say that the hon.
Gentleman might want to consider raising the issue with Ministers, but that has already happened.
I am grateful to the Minister, and I am sure that the issue will be considered between the two of them.
On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I was very grateful to Mr Speaker for granting my urgent question, but do you have any advice on what can be done when a Minister simply refuses to answer a single question and essentially abuses the procedures of the House?
I asked 12 questions in good faith.
The Minister was on her feet for 49 seconds, during which time we learned that the Secretary of State is at COP, that there is a Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and that the Minister’s granddaughter cares a lot about the planet.
That is all very fascinating but it did not answer a single one of my questions.
How can we do our jobs as Members holding the Government to account when Ministers can stand at the Dispatch Box for 49 seconds and not answer a single question on an issue deemed worthy of an urgent question?
