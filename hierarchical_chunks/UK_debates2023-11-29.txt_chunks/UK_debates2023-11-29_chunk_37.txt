I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving me notice of his point of order.
I certainly agree that he, or any other Member, should not be criticised for pursuing issues of concern to their constituents.
The hon.
Gentleman has put his concerns on the record, and I believe the Minister may wish to make a quick point.
