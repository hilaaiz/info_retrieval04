The Minister will know that a properly resourced and operational loss and damage finance fund must be a litmus test for success at COP28, but there are reports that the Government will be contributing to that fund from their existing climate finance pot.
Does she agree that we cannot tackle ever-increasing challenges from an ever-depleting pot of money?
What plans do the Government have for new and additional finance?
What innovative sources of finance are they looking at?
What assessment have they made of the impact of the UK’s reclassification of climate finance on climate vulnerable countries?
If the Government are serious about leading by example, will they finally reverse the greenlighting of the obscene Rosebank oilfield?
I reiterate that the Government take this issue incredibly seriously, and there are two ways of demonstrating that: the Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart) , who usually deals with such issues, is at COP28 and ready for the conference; and we now have a distinct Department for this issue, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.
We know that we are leaders in the field.
I take this issue seriously, not just for the people of the United Kingdom, but for the planet as a whole.
Thinking about my granddaughter, we really do have a commitment to ensuring that we are doing everything that we can.
