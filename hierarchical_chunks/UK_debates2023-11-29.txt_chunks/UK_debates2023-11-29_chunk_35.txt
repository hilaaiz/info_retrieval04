I thank my hon.
Friend for making those points.
He has worked closely with the Department and seen at first hand the work that we have been doing, and it is good to hear that reiterated in the House.
One of the things that we are looking for is success at COP28, and success would be making sure that we are supporting those five measures but also progressing and making sure that we have a commitment to the world’s future and making a greener climate.
