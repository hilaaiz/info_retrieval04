The Minister can talk the talk, but it is action that counts.
Businesses across every sector, as well as experts in the field, have reacted with horror to this Government’s backsliding and roll-backs on climate action and net zero.
In fact, Aviva’s chief executive, Amanda Blanc, said that the Government were putting our climate goals as a country “under threat” and therefore jobs, growth and investment at risk.
Does the Minister recognise the damage that is doing both at home and to our global standing?
One of the things that this Government are committed to is ensuring that we have skills in place and that the economy is going in the right direction.
We are proud of our record, and our commitment to making sure we get to net zero is demonstrated in all the things we have been doing.
We are international leaders—world leaders—in our commitment to ensuring that we hit those targets.
