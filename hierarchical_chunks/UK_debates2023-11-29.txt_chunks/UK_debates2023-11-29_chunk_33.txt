I welcome that two of the 34 new landscape recovery schemes are in west Cornwall and on Scilly, and I credit the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, Farm Cornwall, the Duchy, other organisations and in particular the landowners for their incredible work to achieve that.
At previous climate change conferences, specifically the Paris summit, we agreed to fix our leaky homes.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can accelerate that effort, especially for low-income families?
