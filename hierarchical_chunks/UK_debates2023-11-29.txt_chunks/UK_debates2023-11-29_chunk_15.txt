As I have said before, we support Israel’s right to defend itself, to go after Hamas and to free hostages, to deter further incursions and to strengthen its security for the long term.
We welcome the extension to the agreement to pause fighting, increase humanitarian aid and release further hostages.
Negotiations are ongoing and highly sensitive, but this has been a welcome first positive step.
We will continue to hold Iran to account for any further escalation from these groups, as well as continuing to work with partners to disrupt and deter Iran’s destabilising activities in the middle east.
