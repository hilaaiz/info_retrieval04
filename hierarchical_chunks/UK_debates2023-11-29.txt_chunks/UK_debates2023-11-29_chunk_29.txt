There were no answers!
Please.
The Minister will answer as she sees fit.
I am sure that at the end you will want to raise a point of order.
That is the time—you cannot have a second bite of the cherry.
I went out of my way to ensure that this issue was covered, so please—I am sure other Members will ask questions, and it is up to the Minister how she answers them.
I am not responsible for that.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this second opportunity for the House to discuss COP28.
At the debate on  16 November , when the Government granted a full day’s debate, only three Back Benchers spoke—me, and the hon.
Members for Putney (Fleur Anderson) and for Strangford (Jim Shannon).
There was not a sign of  the hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) , who is now complaining about the responses to her questions.
By the way, the debate on  16 November  finished early because of how few people spoke.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that “vote blue, go green” is the best way to deliver net zero?
Does she recognise that nature-based solutions are vital to achieve net zero?
Does this not just show again that the Green party is all talk and absolutely no action?
As I have said, it is incredibly important that we head towards our commitments.
Between 1990 and 2021, we cut UK emissions by 48% while growing the economy.
I agree with my right hon.
Friend that if we trust this Government to deliver, we will ensure we are heading on the right path.
The other thing to mention is that net zero is an engine for growth and the revitalisation of formerly industrialised areas of the UK.
Cutting emissions is important not just for the climate, but for our economy.
