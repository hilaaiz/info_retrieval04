Let me be clear: we are talking about the administration of work permits for people from overseas who wish to work in Scotland on a temporary basis.
Just about everyone thinks it would be better administered in Scotland, but the Secretary of State insists that it should be centralised by his Government in Westminster.
His argument would be plausible if the UK demonstrated that it is managing the migration service
well but, given the catastrophe that is the UK immigration system, when will he wake up and realise this would be better done in Scotland, by the people who live there?
I point the hon.
Gentleman to the seasonal agricultural workers scheme.
That is 45,000 people, with the ability to flex it up to 55,000.
Those people come to work in a flexible system across the United Kingdom, and it has proved to be a huge success.
