The Secretary of State has correctly identified that there are some who want to use immigration policy to enforce a hard border between England and Scotland as part of their aim to break up the Union.
Does he agree, and in his assessment did he identify, that we need to ensure that immigration policy is not used as an alternative to offering the rewarding packages that key workers deserve?
Absolutely.
We are one United Kingdom.
We have no physical border.
It is important that we treat immigration equally across the whole United Kingdom and give everyone equal opportunity.
