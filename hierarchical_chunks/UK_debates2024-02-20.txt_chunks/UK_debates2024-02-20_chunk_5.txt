My hon.
Friend is quite right to raise the issue of domestic homicide.
We are determined to act to protect the victims of domestic abuse and ensure that the appropriate punishments are in place for perpetrators.
That is why, following Clare Wade KC’s review, we are increasing sentences by introducing statutory aggravating factors for murders that are preceded by controlling or coercive behaviour, involve overkill, or are connected with the end of a relationship.
Does the Minister agree that wider society’s confidence in the judicial system is often determined by how dangerous offenders are treated?
Does he agree that it is vital that we get the message out there, both to wider society and to potential offenders, that there is the ultimate price to pay, which is a long sentence in prison for criminal offences such as these?
