I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for all the sterling work that he has just outlined, which is making such a huge difference to victims everywhere.
I wish to talk about a case that was raised with me at an advice surgery.
After seeing an advert on the tube, my constituent—a man of very good standing—invested in what turned out to be a fraudulent company to the tune of £93,000.
He was clearly a victim of crime and, mercifully, his bank reimbursed his life savings after some challenge.
He did get financial restitution, but the whole experience had wider, devastating impacts.
Those behind the company were registered in Serbia and, to the best of our knowledge, have never been brought to justice.
As my constituent did not go through the full criminal justice system, may I ask how victims such as he can be supported in cases like this?
