The hon.
Gentleman is right to raise that point.
As he has recognised, we must ensure that our approach to border security is adopted properly throughout the United Kingdom.
I was pleased to be able to have a constructive meeting about the future of the Ukraine schemes with the new Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland last week, as part of the conversations that are taking place with the devolved Governments.
I told her that I would be very willing to meet her again, and I was delighted to see her in her place and taking on those responsibilities.
I am sure that these are matters that she will want to discuss.
On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
You will be aware that the Northern Ireland Assembly was restored two weeks ago.
During the period when it was not sitting, Members of the Legislative Assembly were not fulfilling the full range of their functions, and the Secretary of State reduced their salaries.
I wrote to the Leader of the House last week about a matter of which you may well also be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker: the matter of the abstentionist Sinn Féin MPs who have not fulfilled the full range of their own functions, but have received millions of pounds in representative moneys over not two but 22 years.
While they receive no salary from the House, the money that they do receive is allocated on the same basis as Short money, namely to assist Opposition parties with such processes as scrutiny and preparation for debates, in none of which Sinn Féin participates.
I just wish to ascertain, Madam Deputy Speaker, whether the Leader of the House, having received my letter, has as yet indicated her intention of tabling a motion allowing us to discuss this matter.
