I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
There is a serious point here: our modern GPS tags act as a constant physical reminder that debts to society must be repaid and that breach of a court order will be detected, so that a person who steps over the line, literally or metaphorically, and enters an area from which he is barred knows that he is liable to be returned to court and sent to prison.
We could put the entire Lobby on alcohol tags, but I think that would deal a fatal blow to the UK drinks industry.
