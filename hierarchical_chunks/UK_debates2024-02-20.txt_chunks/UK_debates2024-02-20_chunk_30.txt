Unison, of which I am a proud member, has criticised Government plans to reintroduce employment tribunal fees, on the grounds that the “only people who would benefit from their reintroduction are unscrupulous bosses”.
The Resolution Foundation has found that the lowest-paid workers were least likely to bring a claim, so how can the Justice Secretary defend plans to reintroduce employment tribunal fees, which will disproportionately affect those on low wages and present an obstacle to justice for those who need it most?
The £55 claim issue fee is modest, and this is completely different from the previous fee scheme, so I simply do not accept the hon.
Gentleman’s characterisation.
I am quite happy to defend that small, reasonable fee as necessary to help defray the costs of our system.
What percentage of the backlog in Crown court cases is due to foreign national offenders, and what has been done to reduce that?
Data on foreign national offenders is collected at the point when an individual becomes an offender—in other words, at the point of conviction—but in addition, the Ministry of Justice records the numbers  in custody awaiting trial who are FNOs, and that stands at approximately 3,300.
On driving the figures down, the Home Office is working to increase take-up of conditional cautions, which lead to FNOs being expelled from the UK, in place of prosecution, in appropriate cases.
The Vagrancy Act 1824 is 200 years old this year.
Yes, it was supposedly repealed in 2022, but it remains in force.
The Criminal Justice Bill, unamended, represents a genuine danger to rough sleepers everywhere.
When will Conservative Members stop this madness, and when will we see that 200-year-old piece of legislation taken off the books?
I think the hon.
Lady for her question.
The Criminal Justice Bill deals with repeal provisions for the Vagrancy Act, and we are bringing the Bill back on Report with more on rough sleeping.
