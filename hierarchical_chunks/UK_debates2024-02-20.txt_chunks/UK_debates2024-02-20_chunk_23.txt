Is the Secretary of State aware of a new crime that is spreading throughout the north of England, including in your constituency, Mr Speaker, and in mine?
A group is preying on people who have cavity wall insulation.
Those people get themselves into the legal process and find the expenses are so high that they have to sell their home.
It is an epidemic.
It is also rather like the Post Office scandal.
This is an early warning of a major scandal.
Will the Secretary of State agree to look into this matter as it is very important, especially in the north of England?
