I thank my hon.
Friend for raising her constituent’s case.
Fraud is a pernicious, cruel crime and it can have an appalling impact, as I know from my own experience of prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office.
To support victims in recovering lost funds, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 gives the Payment Systems Regulator further power to mandate reimbursement where needed, and I am glad that that took place in this case.
But to bring wrongdoers to justice, prosecutors, including the CPS, the Financial Conduct Authority and the SFO, regularly co-operate with their international counterparts to make arrests and secure evidence overseas so that, in appropriate cases, defendants can be extradited to face trial in the UK.
The other critical point is that the victims code has been expanded, so that people such as her constituent can get the support they need.
I would invite him, perhaps through the hon.
Lady’s good offices, to look at the support that is available online.
