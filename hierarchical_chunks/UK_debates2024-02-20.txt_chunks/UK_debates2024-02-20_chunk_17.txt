Again, I have a lot of respect for the hon.
Lady, but I am afraid that what she is suggesting does not entirely reflect the facts.
If we compare the figures for 2023 and 2022 for band 3 to 5 prison officers, we see that there are over 1,400 more now, which is an increase of 6.7%.
In HMPPS, sick rates are down in the past year, when just over 12,500 people joined and 7,500 left—again, that reflects an increase.
We are investing in our prison officers and increasing their number, and that is being reflected in retention.
I pay tribute to them for the work they do; we should be talking them up, not down.
I am encouraged by my right hon.
Friend’s comments about the number of additional prison officers recruited.
I have seen many of them and the fantastic work they do, both at  HMP Aylesbury and across the prison estate.
Will he say a little more about how we can ensure that we retain them once they have been trained and they go on to the wings?
This is an incredibly important career—it is key to reducing reoffending—and prison officers deserve credit and the support of everybody in this House.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for that.
He is absolutely right about the importance of not just recruiting new prison officers, but retaining experienced ones in our prisons.
That is why the pay deal done last year with HMPPS staff was hugely important, in recognising the important work that prison officers do day in, day out.
It is also reflected in the fact that the leaving rate for prison officers is down in 2023 from where it was in 2022.
However, there is more to do and we will continue to do it.
