I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point of order and for giving me notice of it.
I have had no indication that the Government intend to table a motion on this matter, and I believe that Mr Speaker has had no such indication either.
However, the hon.
Gentleman will have an opportunity to ask the Leader of the House a question on Thursday when she has announced the forthcoming business.
I hope that that is helpful; I think that that is the direction in which he should go.
