I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that matter on the Floor of the House.
He will understand—I know that he well appreciates this—that it is not for the Secretary of State to be ordering investigations, but, plainly, the matters he raised are serious.
I invite the police and prosecutors to take all appropriate steps to investigate it if that is what is required.
