We need to tackle the revolving door of reoffending in our justice system, yet the reoffending rate, as a proportion of those leaving prison, continues to rise.
Whatever the Secretary of State may say, I have heard time and again that the lack of secure housing, adequate and appropriate healthcare, education, job training and job support means that prisoners are being left to fail after they are released.
It is the victims of crime who suffer when ex-prisoners reoffend.
Can the Secretary of State announce when the Government expect the reoffending rate to go down?
It is important to note that reoffending is down compared with under the last Labour Government.
The hon.
Lady shakes her head, but one can dispute opinions in this House, but not facts.
The reoffending rate in 2010 was around 31%; it is 25% now.
That means fewer people falling victim to crime.
The hon.
Lady refers to accommodation, and she is right to do so.
What she did not advert to is this Government’s decision to provide 12 weeks’ guaranteed accommodation, which did not happen under a Labour Government.
When I went to Luton and Dunstable, I spoke to a probation officer who has done the job for 30 years, and do you know what he said?
It is the single most effective measure to drive down reoffending.
Who did that?
Not the Labour party, but us.
What steps he is taking to increase sentences for dangerous offenders.
Measures in the Sentencing Bill will ensure that those who commit the worst crimes will receive the most severe punishment.
The Bill creates a duty for the court to impose a whole life order for murders currently subject to a whole life order starting point and for those that involve sexual or sadistic conduct, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
The Bill will also ensure that convicted rapists must serve 100% of their custodial term in prison, followed by a licence period.
