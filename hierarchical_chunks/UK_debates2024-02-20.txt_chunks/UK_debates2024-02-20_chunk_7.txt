With reference to his oral statement of 6 December 2023 on Hillsborough: Bishop James Jones Report, , column 341, if he will bring forward legislative proposals to introduce a legal duty of candour on public bodies.
In his excellent report, “The patronising disposition of unaccountable power”, Bishop James Jones called for the creation of the Hillsborough charter for bereaved families, as well as for the imposition of a duty of candour on police officers.
We agree wholeheartedly, which is why the Government have signed the charter alongside the Crown Prosecution Service, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and others, and imposed a  duty of candour on the police.
We are also legislating  to create a strong, permanent and independent public advocate to speak up for victims and their families, and to rigorously hold signatories to the charter to account.
We stand ready to discuss what further steps may be necessary.
The parents of Zane Gbangbola are in the Public Gallery today.
Zane was just seven when he died, following floods 10 years ago this month.
The fire brigade detected hydrogen cyanide multiple times.
His parents, Kye and Nicole, have been fighting for the truth about their son’s death ever since, and a duty of candour would have helped them to get it.
In lieu of that, will the Government establish an independent panel inquiry with full disclosure, so that all the evidence can be reviewed by experts, we can finally get the truth about what happened to an innocent seven-year-old boy, and justice can be done?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for raising this deeply upsetting case, and I know the whole House will be thinking of Kye and Nicole as they continue to mourn the loss of Zane.
The hon.
Gentleman raises a critically important case.
May I suggest that he and I discuss it and see what further steps can properly be taken in this difficult case?
