I welcome the Minister’s acknow-ledgement that more education in prisons means cutting the reoffending rate and that clear link to crime.
I welcome the national regime model and will be interested to see how it plays out, because I have seen chronic staff shortages and sickness absence, in particular at prisons such as HMP Wandsworth, which I have visited.
Those things mean that prisoners are entirely missing out on any education, training and working opportunities.
When will I be able to go back to HMP Wandsworth and see the increase in staff and retention that is needed there?
When will the Government get a grip on the prison officer recruitment and retention crisis?
