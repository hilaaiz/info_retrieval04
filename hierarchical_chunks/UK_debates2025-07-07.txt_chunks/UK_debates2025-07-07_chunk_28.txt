I thank the Chair of the Treasury Committee for her question.
The way I would describe it to the public is that when the Government lose control of the public finances, as the Conservative party did in government, it affects not only the accounts in the Exchequer and the Treasury but the family finances in every house across the country.
People are still paying for the consequences of the last Government not sticking to their fiscal rules and acting irresponsibly.
That is why our fiscal rules are non-negotiable, and we will stick to them.
