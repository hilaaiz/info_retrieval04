I thank my hon.
Friend for raising Molly’s case—our hearts go out to her and her children for the trauma they are living with.
Her case raises many issues, including the need for early intervention in domestic abuse cases, the need to improve therapeutic support for victims and, as my hon.
Friend has said, the desperate need for reform of the rules around property rights in cases of economic and domestic abuse, so that women are not trapped.
I cannot give my hon.
Friend immediate answers on all those issues today, but I can promise that they will all be included in our upcoming strategy on violence against women and girls.
