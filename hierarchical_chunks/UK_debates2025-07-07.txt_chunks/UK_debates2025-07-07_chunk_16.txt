I gently remind the Minister that the number of immigrants in asylum hotels has gone up since the general election.
I recently visited an asylum hotel and saw bikes from Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats in the hotel compound.
Local eyewitnesses confirmed that the illegal immigrants in the hotel had been illegally working.
That creates a pull factor, because people smugglers actively market illegal working opportunities.
It also creates risk for women and girls, who might receive deliveries late at night from these undocumented illegal immigrants.
Will the Minister at least commit now to preventing this illegal working from taking place from the hotels that she runs?
We have had a 50% increase in raids and arrests on illegal working since we came into government, so perhaps the shadow Home Secretary should have spent more time when he was in government enforcing the rules on illegal working.
We are doing more, including extending the law on illegal working to the gig economy.
That measure is in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which he voted against.
