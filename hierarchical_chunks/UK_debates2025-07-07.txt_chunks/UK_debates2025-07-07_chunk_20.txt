I thank the Minister very much for her answer.
I know she is very aware of what we are doing in Northern Ireland, where community  police officers are an important part of our policing.
The relationships they build up over a period of 12 months, 18 months or two years mean that they become a part of the community.
We should share good ideas—we have good ideas, as has the Minister.
Will she take the opportunity to discuss those ideas with the policing Minister and the Chief Constable in Northern Ireland, because I believe that what we do can help here as well?
