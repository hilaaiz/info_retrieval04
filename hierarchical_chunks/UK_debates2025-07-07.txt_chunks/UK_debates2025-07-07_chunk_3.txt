I welcome the hon.
Member’s point about specials.
They play an extremely important role and the drop in the number of specials across the country in the years before the ones to which she refers was even steeper.
I am pleased that Sussex police are getting not just 43 additional neighbourhood police officers, but a further 21 specials into neighbourhood teams this year.
We will continue to look at what more we can do to increase support for specials and get more on the beat.
