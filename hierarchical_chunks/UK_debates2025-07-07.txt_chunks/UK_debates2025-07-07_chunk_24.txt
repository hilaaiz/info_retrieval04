I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
While the clandestine entrant penalty scheme has to be rigorously enforced in order to be effective, it also provides a very fair process of appeal for hauliers against penalties that are not justified by the facts of a case.
I am sure that my hon.
Friend will assist the company in his constituency through that appeal process.
