Before we begin, I should like to take a moment to remember that today is the 20th anniversary of the terrible London bombings in 2005.
The thoughts of the House today are with the victims and their families, and with the emergency services, London’s NHS and the staff of Transport for London, who responded so bravely to the events on that day.
I think we all remember where we were when that horrific news came through.
