I thank the Minister for that answer.
Gwent police are taking on dangerous, illegal off-road bikes, but a related problem is electric bikes, which are sometimes chipped to go faster and have become a new danger.
Will the Minister please look into this?
The bikes can be switched up from being a means to get from A to B into being a real menace.
