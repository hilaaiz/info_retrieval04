I thank my hon.
Friend for welcoming the trade deals that this Government have entered into with the United States, India and the European Union, with whom we got a great deal, especially on food and drink imports and exports, which will result in lower prices on the shelves of our supermarkets across the country.
As my hon.
Friend knows, we have committed to an annual summit with our counterparts in the  European Union, and I am sure that my ministerial colleagues will set out further detail on those negotiations in due course.
