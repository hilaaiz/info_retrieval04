May I associate myself and my Committee with your words earlier, Mr Speaker, regarding the 20th anniversary that we are marking today?
Live facial recognition technology is an effective tool in community and neighbourhood policing.
We know that is being used effectively by the Metropolitan police, but other police forces are nervous because they do not believe that the statutory underpinning is in place.
Can the Home Secretary provide some reassurance about what the Government will do to make sure this technology can be used effectively?
The Committee Chair is right that live facial recognition can play a role in keeping communities safe.
As a result, the Minister for Policing has been meeting not just police forces but other organisations to ensure that we can draw up a new framework to give all police forces the confidence to use facial recognition in the best way in order to keep communities safe.
We need good community policing, but we also need good senior leadership teams in our forces.
A recent review of Warwickshire police showed the leadership and the force management need improvement, and that its response times were inadequate.
Would the Home Secretary look into Warwickshire police?
My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
We want to see standards raised across policing and across all police forces.
That is why the police reform  White Paper will set out new measures to improve performance management across all police forces.
Warwickshire is getting an additional 22 police officers, PCSOs and specials on to the streets.
