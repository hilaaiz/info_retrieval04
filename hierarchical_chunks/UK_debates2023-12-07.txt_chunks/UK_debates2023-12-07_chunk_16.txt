I am grateful for your generosity, Madam Deputy Speaker.
We are just grateful that at least some Conservative Members have turned up.
On  20 October  over 500 homes in Chesterfield, like hundreds across the UK, were flooded, leading to the tragic death of Mrs Gilbert on Tapton Terrace.
Less than a month later, with the impeccable timing that only this accident-prone Government are capable of, the National Audit Office announced that the Government had cut by 40% the number of homes that will be protected from floods by 2027.
Will the Secretary of State at least promise the House that he will never again say to a flood victim that the Government are doing all they can?
I am sure the whole House extends our condolences on the sad loss of Mrs Gilbert.
Our investment in flood asset maintenance is up by £220 million.
As I said, the previous six-year investment was £2.6 billion.
Between 2021 and 2027, we are now investing £5.2 billion.
Yes, there have been pressures on the programme through inflation and covid, as the National Audit Office report shows, but what is not in doubt is the increased funding that this Government are putting into flood protection—the £5.2 billion indicates that—alongside the increased funding for flood maintenance.
What steps he is taking to tackle raptor persecution.
The Government take raptor persecution very seriously.
It is a national wildlife crime and there are strong penalties in place for offences committed against birds of prey.
In 2022, DEFRA more than doubled its funding for the national wildlife crime unit to £1.2 million over three years, in part to target crimes of raptor persecution.
