I thank the Secretary of State for his response.
The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit reports that energy costs and climate change have pushed up food bills by an average of £605 over the past two years, with climate change driving 60% of that increase.
We already import £8 billion-worth of food from countries struggling with extreme weather.
Obviously, we want to support those countries on an international level with climate adaptation.
In terms of our food security here, will the Secretary of State review his predecessor’s decision to secretly scrap the horticulture strategy, which could have helped domestic growers and made us more resilient to the impact of climate change on food security and food prices?
