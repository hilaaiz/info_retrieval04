I welcome my hon.
Friend’s update.
I am sure that I am not alone in having received a large number of template emails on particular subjects.
When I have diligently written back to those individuals, they have said that they did not send the emails.
It is quite clear that hostile actors are collecting our constituents’ email addresses and using them to subvert the democratic process.
Will my hon.
Friend take the message not only back to the Foreign Office, but across the House, that this needs to be investigated and stopped?
