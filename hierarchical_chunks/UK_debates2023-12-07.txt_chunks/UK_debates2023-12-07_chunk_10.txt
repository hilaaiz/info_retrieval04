I can give my hon.
Friend a very strong assurance on that front.
Supporting British farmers is my No. 1 priority.
Indeed, with the Minister for Food,  Farming and Fisheries in the Department, we have someone who has a lifetime’s experience of working as a farmer.
We should be proud of the Red Tractor scheme, which is known around the world for being a high-quality mark of British produce.
I recognise, however, that concerns have been raised and we will launch a review soon into fairness in the horticulture supply chain, but if necessary, I will not hesitate to use the powers in the relevant Act to introduce legislation to tackle contractual unfairness, wherever that exists.
What discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero on the impact of climate change on food prices.
Food prices depend on a range of factors, which have recently included Russia’s war in Ukraine and the subsequent energy price rises.
Supporting our world-class farmers and food producers and driving down inflation are top priorities for the Government.
