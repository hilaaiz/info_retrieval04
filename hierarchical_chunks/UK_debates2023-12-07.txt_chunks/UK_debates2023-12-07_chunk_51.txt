The Minister contributed to a very good debate in the UK-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, which met in Westminster earlier this week, and touched on some of these issues.
We are clearly dealing with hybrid warfare—there is no other phrase for it.
Although I commend the Minister for coming to the House to give us this information, the response of sanctioning two people seems rather mild.
Will he say more about that?
Will he also say something about the co-ordination across western democracies and allies on next year’s year of elections?
We must all co-ordinate so that we can spot patterns in order to deal with this threat.
The hon.
Lady should be reassured that, although today’s announcement pertains to two individuals, it is indicative of a huge and sustained institutional effort to tackle this threat by way of a vastly improved defensive cyber-capability right across our nation.
Our global response is working hand in glove with Five Eyes partners, and there is a huge diplomatic and security effort to make sure this activity is called out and pursued.
That is not just deterrence; it is also enhanced resilience.
Although the number of individuals is small, the hon.
Lady should be reassured that the institutional work is tremendously well resourced and entirely determined.
