The hon.
Lady raises an important point about the impact of climate change on food prices in the future.
That is exactly why the Government passed the Genetic Technology (Precision Breeding) Act 2023 to help to unlock innovation and strengthen food security by enabling our leading scientists to develop crops that will best resist climate change.
It is why the Government published the third national adaptation programme as recently as July, and it is why we have our farming innovation programme—with £270 million of funding—which is focused on driving productivity and ensuring that there is sustainability in the environmental and farming sectors.
What recent assessment he has made of trends in the level of food prices.
October’s consumer prices index price inflation was 10.1%, down from 12.1% in September and the lowest figure since June 2022.
Industry analysts expect food price inflation to continue to decrease, and the Government are providing an average of £3,300 per household to help with the cost of living this year and next.
