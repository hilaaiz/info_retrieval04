The Minister, like the Secretary of State before him, forgot to mention one of the biggest drivers of food inflation in this country.
I will give them a clue: it starts with “Br” and ends in “exit”.
The reality is that the UK is the only G7 country where food price inflation remains above 10%, and the average across OECD countries is 7.4%.
If this Government are not going to follow the SNP’s proposals for price controls on food, what are they going to do to finally get a grip on increasing food prices?
I think the hon.
Gentleman is mistaken.
If we compare prices in the European Union with prices here in the UK, we see that the price of a basket of goods here in the UK is substantially lower than it is for our friends in the European Union.
If Brexit were the problem here, surely those prices would be higher in the UK than they are in the European Union.
I think he is barking up the wrong tree.
What steps he is taking to support British food producers.
The Government are committed to supporting British food producers.
We are investing £2.4 billion a year in England’s farming sector, and we will also look to support more growers through the replacement of the fruit and vegetables aid scheme for England in 2026.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs also sponsors small and medium-sized enterprise masterclasses to signpost and support those businesses.
