Animal welfare is an extremely important issue.
That is why we introduced the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill in the King’s Speech.
We were only able to do that because of our exit from the European Union.
It is right that we put in place a ban to stop the export of livestock and horses for slaughter.

Friend will also be aware of the two private Members’ Bills that are being taken forward to tackle the important issues of pet smuggling and pet theft, which I know are concerns to Members on both sides of the House.
