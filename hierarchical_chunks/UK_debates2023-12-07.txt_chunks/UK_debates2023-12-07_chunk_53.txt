My hon.
Friend makes a very good point.
This affects us all.
It not only affects parliamentarians or those in public life; it affects those in commerce.
The National Cyber Security Centre has published guidance and is available to provide guidance to those businesses that need to ensure they have a higher degree of cyber- security and resilience, particularly those involved in, for example, critical national infrastructure.
This is a refreshing statement, but what action will be taken?
This is a very serious challenge to our democracy.
Indeed, it is not only a serious challenge to Members of Parliament.
I know of a major takeover of a British company by a Chinese entity.
The senior executives said that, when they attended meetings, the Chinese knew information about the company, its secrets and its background that they could have known only by illegal means.
It is everywhere, and it is particularly coming from Russia, China and perhaps Iran and North Korea.
Can we have action?
Yes, we need to train our staff and Members of Parliament, but I was brainwashed as a child by the James Bond novels—maybe you were too,  Madam Deputy Speaker.
We have a wonderful intelligence system, but are our intelligence services up to the job?
Do they need more resources?
