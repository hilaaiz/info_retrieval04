I thank the hon.
Member for his question, which I will answer on behalf of the Secretary of State.
The Department works closely with rolling stock owners and train operators to understand when new and refurbished trains are likely to be required, and to ensure a regular flow of work for train manufacturing companies.
Trains are major assets, with a lifetime of 35 to 40 years, so there will naturally be peaks and troughs in procurement cycles.
The average age of the current fleet is 17 years.
