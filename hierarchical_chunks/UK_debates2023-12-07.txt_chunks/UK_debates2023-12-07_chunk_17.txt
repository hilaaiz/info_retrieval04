I thank the Minister for his response.
There are many long-standing traditions that are worth preserving in our countryside, but raptor persecution is definitely not one of them.
It is a vile practice and we need to do much more to protect our majestic birds of prey.
Have the Minister and the Department considered whether introducing vicarious liability would act as a deterrent to rogue landowners who direct their gamekeepers to commit wildlife crime?
