In January 2022, the then Chancellor said that, clearly, criminals have sought to exploit our covid support schemes, and “We’re going to do everything we can to get that money back and go after those who took advantage of the pandemic.”
What proportion of that money has been recovered so far?
How many of those who took advantage have been sent to jail?
First, I warmly welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place or, rather, back to his place, as I understand that this is his third outing in the shadow ministerial team.
It is pleasing to see his predecessor,  the hon.
Member for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter) , whose name is on the Order Paper.
We look forward to his question.
The shadow Minister will be interested to know that I recently visited the Insolvency Service, which is conducting investigations into the bounce back loan scheme and the like.
We must remember that the covid lending schemes delivered just under £80 billion of finance in almost  record time.
It was called for from across the House and should be supported, but he is right that those who have committed fraud should be investigated.
What assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme.
In 2022, my office received 819 requests to review unduly lenient sentences.
Of those, 139 were referred to the Court of Appeal, and the sentence was increased in 68% of cases.
