I welcome much of the work being done.
As the Solicitor General will be aware, a serving Royal Navy sailor was the subject of a violent attack in Torquay when he attempted to stop a group of yobs stamping a bird to death, but the unduly lenient community sentences and small fines handed down did not reflect the gravity of the offence or provide any deterrent.
What steps will the Government take to review the unduly lenient sentence scheme to cover cases such as that?
