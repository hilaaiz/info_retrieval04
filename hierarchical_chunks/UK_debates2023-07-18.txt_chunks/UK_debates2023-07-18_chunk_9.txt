The effects of climate change are intensifying—NASA has just reported that June was the hottest month ever recorded—so it is important that   the Government stand by their promise to double international climate finance.

What steps he is taking to support the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.
We condemn the Taliban’s decision to restrict the rights of women and girls.
We are working with international partners to urge the Taliban to reverse its decisions to ban women from working for the United Nations and non-governmental organisations, and to deny girls access to education.
