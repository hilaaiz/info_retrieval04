You did not look at me, but I appreciate your calling me, Mr Speaker.
Thank you, very much.
Hon.
Members are right to point out the advantage of education, but for the children in Ukraine it is not just about education, but about the trauma they have had.
What is being done to work alongside those in education and health to enable those young people to deal with the horrors that they have experienced?
As always, the hon.
Gentleman makes important points.
He can be assured that the work we are doing is not only about education, but about providing reassurance and support for these children and young people who are going through extraordinarily challenging times.
