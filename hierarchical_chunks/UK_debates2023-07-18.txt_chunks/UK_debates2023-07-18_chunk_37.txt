I thank the hon.
Member for his work in challenging us in this area.
I would probably push back a bit.
It is complicated to assess loss.
Both I and the right hon.
Member for North Durham sat in on a long call with the HSS panel recently and some eminent lawyers gave us a lot of confidence that this was being done right, on an inquisitorial basis, but it is complicated to assess those losses.
I would refer to Sir Wyn Williams’s comments.
He basically says that we should carry on what we are doing.
He would not necessarily have advised this route in the first place, but what he says now is that the best thing we can do is push on with the frameworks we have in place.
There are three different schemes.
We need to push them on more quickly of course and I am very keen to do that.
