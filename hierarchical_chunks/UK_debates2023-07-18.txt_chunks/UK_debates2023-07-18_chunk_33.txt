The Minister in place at the moment will realise that former colleagues have stood at the Dispatch Box and given excuses.
The procrastination from his Department has been terrible and the effects are ongoing.
Fulsome and full compensation is to be welcomed, but the word that was missing from the Minister’s statement was “timely.”
Therefore, the first part of my question is this: why two years?
Why not two months or two weeks?
Pay the compensation to the postmasters affected.
The second part of my question is about the senior management team.
So far, they have got away with it.
They need to be held to account, as do their IT consultants.
When will something positively be done to bring those people to book?
Again, I know my hon.
Friend was one of the key campaigners on this particular issue.
I cannot speak for previous Ministers—although I have a great regard for my immediate predecessor certainly—who have dealt with this issue.
I have not seen any procrastination and we are driving this as quickly as possible within the Department.
On why not two weeks, rather than two years, settling compensation claims is complicated.
It is about specific instances of pecuniary losses and non-pecuniary losses; it is complicated.
We are keen to get that money out the door as quickly as possible and, as I have said, we are looking at creative ways to do that.
I am just as ambitious as my hon.
Friend is to get that money into the hands of the people who need it.
There have been interim payments of around £20 million on both outstanding schemes—the GLO and overturned convictions schemes.
Nevertheless, full and fair compensation is what we desire.
On people being held to account, I refer my hon.
Friend to what I said earlier.
We need to see the results of the inquiry—that is what Sir Wyn Williams is there  for and we need to see the outcome of his inquiry—and, where he can identify blame, we are very keen to make sure those people are held to account.
