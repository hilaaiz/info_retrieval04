We all want to see a stable western Balkans.
To my mind, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe is in a strong position to cohere those efforts.
Does the Minister agree with that assessment and that the OSCE will need more resources to help achieve the stable western Balkans that we all want to see?
I do agree

We must ensure that efforts to deliver good impact from the OSCE are not derailed by Putin’s machinations.
If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
My right hon.

My right hon.
Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary attended last week’s NATO leaders summit in Vilnius, where a new tranche of military support for Ukraine was  announced.
The new White Paper on international development to 2030 is the subject of a written ministerial statement today.
On Sunday, in Auckland, New Zealand, the UK signed the CPTPP—the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership—which represents more than 500 million people and a GDP of more than £12 trillion, which is larger than the European Union.
As well as the economic benefits to this country, what diplomatic benefits will the agreement bring?
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on getting the letters of the agreement in the right order.
He will know that the agreement spans 12 economies across Asia, the Pacific and now Europe.
By 2040, we hope that it will add £2 billion to our GDP.
