The report states that there are “something like 230-250 late applications to be determined and that there may yet be significantly more” late applications as well.
Can the Minister confirm that those applications will be seriously considered and that those victims may be entitled to compensation?
Can he provide an assessment as to whether the numbers I have quoted are accurate or are actually higher?
