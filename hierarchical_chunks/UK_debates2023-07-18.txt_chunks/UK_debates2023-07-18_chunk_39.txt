I thank my hon.
Friend for the points in his question, and we absolutely agree that we need to accelerate compensation payments.
As I say, we have made significant progress on the HSS scheme.
For the two other schemes—the GLO scheme and the overturned convictions scheme—we need to get those payments resolved as quickly as possible.
There have been around £40 million of interim payments through those schemes, but the full and fair compensation—the final compensation—is where we need to get to.
On holding people to account, he will have heard what I said earlier and I absolutely agree with him on that point.
