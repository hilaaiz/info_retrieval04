I thank my hon.
Friend for the update.
Some 555 individuals have suffered incredible destitution and injustice for far too long.
This has gone on for more than 20 years, and some people have died during this process.
Will he ensure that  the Post Office owns up to what it has done and that the individuals who were responsible for covering this up 20 years ago are brought to justice, rather than this leaving a stain on the reputations of the postmasters and postmistresses, who are totally innocent of any crime?
