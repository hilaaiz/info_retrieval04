I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for his work on this issue.
He is right: 62 people have passed away while awaiting compensation.
It is simply unacceptable.
My Department is looking at creative ways of accelerating the process of providing compensation to the victims.
I agree with my hon.
Friend about the need for people to be held to account, and I spoke about that on a number of occasions from the Back Benches.
It is right that people are held to account.
It is also right that due process is followed.
Sir Wyn Williams’s inquiry is there to identify what went wrong and why and who was responsible, and once that is done we should make a judgment about what happens to those people, but I am keen, like my hon.
Friend, that people are held to account.
