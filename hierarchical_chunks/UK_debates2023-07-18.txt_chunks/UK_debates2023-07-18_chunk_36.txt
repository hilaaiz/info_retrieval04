The victims of the Post Office Horizon scandal should be fully compensated, so that they are put back into the position they would have been in had they not been a victim of this miscarriage of justice in the first place.
The Minister has agreed with that statement from the Dispatch Box before, but it is not happening.
Can I say that it is not a complicated process to be able to quantify their losses and to be able to compensate them fully?
My Committee, I understand the advisory board and the statutory inquiry have suggested that one way to try to improve this is to remove the Post Office entirely from this process and to make it an independent process, properly budgeted, with the requirement to fully compensate the victims in the way I have described.
Why will the Government not just do that?
