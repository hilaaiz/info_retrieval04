I thank the Minister for his answer.
As he said, in Afghanistan, households led by women are effectively banned from leaving the home and are, therefore, wholly dependent on female Afghan aid workers.
With the Taliban now effectively banning female aid workers from delivering humanitarian aid, even a one or two week delay in reaching families means that mothers are turning to appallingly unacceptable negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage.
What is the impact assessment of the Taliban’s policy on the distribution of essential aid and what are the Government doing about it?
