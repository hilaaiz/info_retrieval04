Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you for your strong response to the point of order last week on the threats against me by President Vučić of Serbia.
One colleague here raised the daily reports that we are receiving about extreme identity violence in Darfur, which will only get worse.
As a UK penholder, what are we doing to create a protective wedge between civilians and the militias?
Will my right hon.
Friend show leadership at the Dispatch Box by declaring these as crimes against humanity, because it matters that Britain says that now?
I fully understand what my hon.
Friend is saying about Darfur.
She will know that I first went there with David Cameron in 2006 and saw what was happening on the ground—what George Bush called a genocide.
We will do everything that we can to protect   the civilians there who are in great jeopardy today.
That involves the use of words, as my hon.
Friend said, and actions at the UN.
We will do everything
that we can, as holder of the pen, to ensure that progress is made

Last month the UN’s world food programme announced the cessation of food aid in Ethiopia following the large-scale diversion of supplies.
The UN has this week estimated that 8.8 million people in northern Ethiopia are in need of food aid, and severe malnutrition has increased by 196% over the past year.
Will the Minister set out what the Government are doing to respond to this desperate humanitarian crisis?
We are working incredibly closely with the UN agencies, in particular the World Food Programme.
We are conscious of, have investigated, and I think have now dealt with the issue of food being stolen.
We announced recently that we would spend £143 million on humanitarian support in the horn of Africa.
