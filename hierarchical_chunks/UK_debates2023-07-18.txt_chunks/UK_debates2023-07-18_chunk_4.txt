The other thing that I have always tried to do, which is not in the document but which I recommend in defence procurement, is to never defer—either delete or deliver.
If you defer, it costs hundreds of millions of pounds.
Deferring the aircraft carrier cost £1 billion under the Labour Government.
Deferring the F-35 cost £500 million.
Deferrals create the black holes.
Delete or deliver, but don’t defer.
