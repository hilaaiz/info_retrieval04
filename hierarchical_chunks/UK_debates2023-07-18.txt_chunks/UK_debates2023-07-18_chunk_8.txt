The Minister will realise that £11.8 billion is quite a lot of money.
How do the UK’s international climate finance commitments compare to other G7 and G20 countries, or, historically, to before 2010?
We are a global leader on these issues, as my hon.
Friend knows, and we have set a lead.
Part of that leadership, but only part of it, is in respect of money.
The UK has delivered extraordinarily on its commitments.
For example, we met our previous climate finance commitments, including spending nearly £6 billion between 2016 and 2021.
