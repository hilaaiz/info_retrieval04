I thank the Secretary of State for that reply and for his attentive engagement on the issue.
I understand that British coal staff superannuation scheme trustees wrote to the Department last month with reform proposals.
I urge the Secretary of State to  meet them as soon as possible to rectify the long-standing injustice, especially given the increasing age and declining health of the beneficiaries.
