I welcome the Government’s publication of the “Clean Power 2030 Action Plan” last week.
It will mark a transformative shift towards clean energy that will bring good jobs and industry to the whole country.
The plan proposes the use of the national wealth fund to explore nascent renewable generation projects.
The Minister will know of the potential for tidal range on the west coast.
What steps is the Department taking to explore that potential?
Will she meet me to discuss the potential for tidal range projects in my constituency?
