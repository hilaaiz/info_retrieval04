I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I am glad that he, too—like everyone else in this House, according to my hon.
Friend the Minister for Industry—has constituents who will be benefiting from this work.
The best I can say to him on this issue, which has now been rightly raised a number of times, is that the Minister for Industry will have heard the calls made with real urgency, which I think we all recognise, and will act accordingly.
