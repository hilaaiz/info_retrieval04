The Secretary of State, the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Consumers have all said in this House that the National Energy System Operator’s report shows that the Government’s 2030 target will lower energy bills.
However, the report itself explicitly says that it does not do so, and the chief executive officer of the NESO told the Energy Security and Net Zero Select Committee last week that it “did not set out” to determine “what bills are for consumers.”
Will the Minister explain those inconsistencies and take the opportunity to correct the record?
I suggest that the hon.
Lady actually reads the report.
On page 77, the NESO sets out in black and white the system costs of a clean power system, and then what it calls “Bill components resulting from clean power pathways” and “Other bill changes”.
The total impact in 2030 is to reduce electricity costs by £10 per megawatt-hour.
Of course, as the NESO says, it is for the Government to make the policy choices to reduce energy bills—which we will—but it is absolutely clear that our clean power plan will reduce system costs.
Citizens Advice has found that more than a third of private tenants could not afford to heat their house to a comfortable temperature last winter, and in research published a month ago, it found that 80% of private landlords have no plans to invest in the energy efficiency of their properties in the next five years.
Can the Minister explain what the Government will do to support and incentivise private landlords to drive up minimum energy efficiency standards in their properties, and when they will do it, so that tenants can stay warm all year round?
We know that the quality of too many of our homes in the private rented sector is not high enough.
That is why we are moving forward to introduce minimum energy efficiency standards, so that we can raise those standards, lifting 1 million people out of fuel poverty.
We are running in order to get that done.
