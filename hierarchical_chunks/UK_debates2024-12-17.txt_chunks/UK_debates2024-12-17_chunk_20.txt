Labour’s policy on the North sea will cost the country £12 billion in tax receipts, which would be enough to cover the winter fuel payment for many, many years.
Pensioners will be in the cold this winter, and this is a policy that no other major economy is pursuing.
How can the Government possibly justify it?
These are more fantasy numbers from the right hon.
Lady.
The truth is that the North sea has lost a third of its employment in the past decade.
The only future for the North sea is in what this Government are doing: investing in carbon capture and storage, in offshore wind and in hydrogen.
That is the future.
That is not my figure; it is a figure from industry—£12 billion in lost North sea tax receipts, in addition to £8 billion for an energy company that will not generate energy, and at least £200 billion for a 2030 target that we now know will not cut bills.
Is it not true that pensioners will be sitting in the cold this winter to pick up the bill for this Secretary of State?
No.
The case is that the Conservatives left us dependent on fossil fuels, which led to the worst cost of living crisis in living memory.
The tragedy is that they are doubling down on their failed policy.
The only answer for lower bills is clean, home-grown energy that we control.
