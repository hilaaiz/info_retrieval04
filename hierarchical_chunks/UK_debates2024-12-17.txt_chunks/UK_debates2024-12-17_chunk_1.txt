In the Budget, the Government decided to transfer the mineworkers’ pension scheme investment reserve to members of the scheme.
At the end of last month, the first increase in payments was made to over 100,000 ex-miners and their families.
That has meant an extra 32% rise in people’s pensions each month—an average of £29 per week.
The overturning of that historic injustice demonstrates the difference made by a Labour Government.
