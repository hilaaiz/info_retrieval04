Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to celebrate the legacy of our nation's Rosie the Riveters in recognition of the dedication of the Rosie the Riveter Rose Garden in Garden City.
During World War II countless women from across the nation and right here in Southeast Michigan took over jobs that had been previously performed by men.
Three hundred thousand Rosie the Riveters held our country down during extremely trying times and became icons of women's empowerment and strength.
This Labor Day, I am proud to recognize these women who blazed the trail for women in the workforce and for their contributions to the labor movement and our history.
As we gather to ring a bell for Rosie, please join me and the people of Garden City in Michigan's 12th District Strong as we honor their legacy with the dedication of the Rosie the Riveter Rose Garden.
