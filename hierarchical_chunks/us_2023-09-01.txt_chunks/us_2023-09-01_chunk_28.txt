Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shiela D. Corley for receiving a 2023 University of Kentucky Alumni Association Distinguished Service Award.
This prestigious award is presented to those who have provided extraordinary leadership, dedication, and have a history of diligently serving the UK alumni and community.
Shiela grew up on a farm in the small town of Greenville, Kentucky.
She followed her dream of attending the University of Kentucky, where she received both her bachelor's and master's degrees.
After graduate school, Shiela began her career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a dedicated public servant with the National Agricultural Statistics Service and later the Food and Nutrition Service.
I am pleased that she is currently serving on a detail assignment from USDA to the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I chair.
While living in Washington, D.C., Shiela has been an active member of the University of Kentucky's Nation's Capital Alumni Club, serving as vice president from 2004 through 2009.
She currently serves on UK's Alumni Leadership Advisory Council and is active in the Washington, D.C. community as a member of the Junior League and other non-profits, including the Kentucky Society.
In 2017, Shiela and her family established the Corley Family Endowment in memory of her sister Shannon, who was also a UK alum and avid Wildcat fan alongside Shiela.
The endowment provides support to a member of their hometown community to attend the University of Kentucky.
To date, they have awarded five scholarships, with the first recipient graduating this past May.
Through this endowment, Shiela and her family help others realize their dream of attending the University Wildcat spirit.
It is my distinct honor to recognize Shiela D. Corley for her outstanding servant leadership to the University of Kentucky, USDA, and as part of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee team.
