Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life and service of World War I veteran and hero, Boy First Class, Bert Hunter Lane.
Bert Hunter Lane was born July 29, 1895, in Madison, Suwannee County, Florida, before relocating with his family to Lakeland, Florida in 1909.
Lane attended Lakeland High School, where he made honor roll and played in the band.
As a young adult, Lane was a driver for the Standard Oil Company and Gulf Refining Company and attended First Baptist Church.
After World War I broke out in 1914, Lane moved to Tampa, FL to join the U.S. Coast Guard on April 8, 1917 at 21 years old.
He was given the rank
Boy First Class and placed under the command of Captain Charles Satterlee on the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Tampa, one of six assigned to convoy duty in Europe.
The Tampa, armed with three-inch guns, had successfully escorted eighteen convoys and earned a special commendation for exemplary service.
On September 26, 1918, soon after her 19th convoy, Tampa was torpedoed by the German submarine UB-91.
In just three minutes, Tampa sunk, claiming the lives of 130 in the single largest loss of life for the Coast Guard during World War I.
In 1928, the United States Coast Guard Memorial was dedicated at Arlington National Cemetery, memorializing the 111 coast guardsmen lost that day.
The Purple Heart was not yet authorized, but in 1999 Commandant Admiral James Loy awarded the Coast Guardsmen posthumously for their brave actions.
One hundred five years after Tampa was lost, and 24 years after the first Purple Heart was awarded to one of her crew, no relatives have been located to receive the honor on Lane's behalf.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bert--his heroism, his service and most importantly his sacrifice.
