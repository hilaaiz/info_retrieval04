Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of Leona Yost, an incredible mother, grandmother, greatgrandmother, and Wisconsinite from Oconto.
Leona Yost was born on July 28, 1923.
She was the daughter of Herbert and Mary Whiting, and she grew up on their family farm.
Leona graduated from Lena High School in the year 1941 and after her graduation, she worked at the egg factory in Oconto and later the Grant Store in Green Bay.
In 1943, Leona married George Yost and they proceeded to work together on the George's family farm in Lena.
Leona and George welcomed five beautiful children who went on to bless them with seven grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren.
Leona is noted for having an amazing memory and a deep interest in coin collecting and coin history--she loves to share these passions with her grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Potentially of most importance, she is known throughout Oconto for her delicious potato salad.
Leona has always been an active member of the community.
She was an Oconto County 4-H leader for 37 years working for the Meadow Brook 4-H club.
She also worked for several years for the town of Stiles as an election poll worker.
Leona is a truly selfless woman who has worked hard her entire life to give back to others.
She has lived an incredible life and has now reached a very rare milestone.
I would like to ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing Leona Yost happy 100th birthday.
