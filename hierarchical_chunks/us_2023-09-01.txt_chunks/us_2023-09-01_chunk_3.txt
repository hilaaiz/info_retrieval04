Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a visionary, dynamic, and God-fearing Pastor who has served Halifax County, North Carolina, for 50 years.
Since 1973, when he was licensed to preach, Rev. Dr. Charles Edward McCollum has immersed himself in teaching and preaching the powerful word of God to countless individuals.
For nearly 50 years, Rev. Dr. McCollum has been the Senior Pastor of Oak Grove PromiseLand Ministries in Littleton and Piney Grove Baptist Church in Halifax.
During his pastorate, these churches have grown spiritually and numerically.
Beyond church leadership, Rev. Dr. McCollum's impact on the greater community has been significant.
He served as Executive Director of the Halifax County Black Caucus.
Under his guidance, the Caucus achieved substantial milestones in education and civic engagement.
In addition, his dedication to education has been exemplary, evidenced by his unselfish service on the Halifax County Board of Education, 2 earned doctorate degrees, and the establishment in 1991 of Eastern Carolina Christian College in Roanoke Rapids, NC.
