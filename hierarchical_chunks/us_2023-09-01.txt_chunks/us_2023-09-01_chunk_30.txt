Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Brownwood, Texas Kiwanis Club's continued service to children in their community for 100 years.
The Brownwood Charter has helped thousands of children in their community and across the globe, dedicating countless resources to improving children's health, education, and development.
Their servant leadership has helped impact children's lives from infancy to early adulthood.
They have assisted needy children through scholarships, blood drives, leadership opportunities, and more.
For 100 years, their selflessness and guidance have been inspiring, and their mission will continue to provide children and the Brownwood community the help and opportunities they deserve to have a shining future.
I thank the Brownwood Charter for their selfless service and dedication to improving their community for 100 years.
Their work is emblematic of the values that make our Nation the greatest country in the world.
