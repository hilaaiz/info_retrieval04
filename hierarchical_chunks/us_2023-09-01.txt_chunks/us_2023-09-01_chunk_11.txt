Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 10th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I'm privileged and humbled to honor and commemorate Mr. Richard T. Freistak on the blessed occasion of his 100th Birthday, as well as his tireless service to our Nation and communities.
As a true member of ``The Greatest Generation,'' he has set the standard by which we all should be judged.
I wish him great health, prosperity, love, and Godspeed in his future adventures.
