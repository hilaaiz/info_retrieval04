Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Contra Costa Television (CCTV) as we commemorate Free Speech Week and Community Media Day.
Since its inception in 1994, CCTV has sought to provide community members with critical information, helping to keep our community connected and residents abreast of local issues.
CCTV provides coverage of local government meetings, public safety information, local sports, and other community events with the goal of making local journalism accessible to all.
CCTV livestreams to their website and social media platforms and provides twenty-four hour broadcasting, providing Contra Costans with convenient access to breaking news, important community updates, and more.
CCTV has continually shown its dedication to sharing our community's stories and connecting Contra Costa residents.
CCTV has also partnered with the County Clerk-Recorder-Elections Department and local chapters of the League of Women Voters to provide voters with up-to-date reporting on candidates and ballot measures.
A well-informed public is vital to any healthy democracy and I'm proud of CCTV's contributions to provide locally-produced voter education programming.
CCTV has received many accolades for its outstanding programing.
The Veterans' Voices program received the Western Alliance Video Excellence award in 2016 and 2018 and the California State Association of Counties 2015 Merit Award.
Please join me in honoring Contra Costa Television as we commemorate Free Speech Week and Community Media Day.
