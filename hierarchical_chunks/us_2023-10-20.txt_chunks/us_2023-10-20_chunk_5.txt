Mr. Benn was an amazing journalist with a special talent for crafting his words into storytelling.
He wrote the first article about my scholarship to Princeton University and subsequently, wrote about every major event in my life's journey, from joining the rowing crew at Oxford to getting elected Alabama's First Black Congresswoman.
If anything happened in Selma or the Black Belt, 
Mr. Benn knew about it and reported on it.
Spanning a career of decades, 
Mr. Benn told the history of Alabama's Black Belt--the events, the characters, and all the happenings.
What a gift his writings will leave in the annuals of Alabama's history.
His legacy will live on through the mini-stories and all the lives that he touched.
Rest in peace and power.
On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy
