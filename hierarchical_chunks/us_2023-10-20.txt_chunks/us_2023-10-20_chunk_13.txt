Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I pay tribute to the hardworking men and women of the Lansing Board of Water and Light, a municipally-owned public utility in Michigan's 7th Congressional District for their efforts to restore service following storms that moved through Michigan on Thursday, August 24 and Friday, August 25, 2023.
In a matter of hours, six tornadoes swept across the state, leaving a trail of devastation from west to east.
Five people died, dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of Michiganders were left in the dark due to power outages.
Under these most pressing circumstances, more than 40 percent of LBWL's customers were affected by the storm, including 612 unique power outage locations, 835 downed wires, 47 broken poles, and 187 transformers knocked offline.
In the challenging days that followed the storms, LBWL sent an unprecedented number of crews into the field, calling in mutual aid from across Michigan and around the country.
In total, 45 tree crews, 57 line crews, and 162 spotters worked around the clock in difficult conditions, restoring power to 98 percent of customers in a matter of days.
That effort was born of experience.
After a similarly devastating ice storm hit the region 10 years ago, LBWL implemented all the recommendations from an independent investigation into the storm response, spending millions on proactive tree-trimming, expanding mutual aid agreements, hardening its communication plan, and revamping the entire corporate structure.
This organizational soul-searching has paid off, with vastly improved reliability and response time when it matters most.
The work of LBWL crews, and crews from across the country, was difficult and even dangerous, requiring long hours and high skill to bring the power back for hundreds of customers.
That hard work and dedication deserve recognition here.
