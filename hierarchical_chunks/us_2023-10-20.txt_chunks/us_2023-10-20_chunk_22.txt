Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today along with my colleague, 
Representative Mike Quigley, to celebrate one of Chicagoland's very own, legendary meteorologist Tom Skilling, and his 45-year career as a beloved presence on our local airwaves as he embarks on his well-deserved retirement.
As the longtime chief meteorologist for WGN-TV, Tom Skilling has been one of the most trusted figures on television screens throughout the Chicago area for decades, expertly and calmly explaining the region's often unpredictable weather situations for generations of viewers.
I am especially proud to say that Tom Skilling is an Aurora, Illinois native, and a proud graduate.
After completing his studies at the University of Wisconsin, Tom worked briefly on local television stations in Madison and Milwaukee before landing at WGN-TV, where he quickly became a daily fixture in households throughout Chicago and the suburbs.
Those of us who know Tom and have worked with him over the course of his career know how passionate he is about his work and how talented he is at communicating often complex scientific data to people of all ages and backgrounds.
But his greatest strength is the kindness with which he treats everyone he interacts with; he is always ready to greet a fan with a warm smile and meaningful conversation.
