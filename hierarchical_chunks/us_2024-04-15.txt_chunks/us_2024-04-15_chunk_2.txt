Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bruce Parsons on the occasion of his retirement as Principal of Plymouth Regional High School.
Bruce first came to New Hampshire as the principal of Wentworth Elementary School in 1991.
Soon after, Bruce transferred to Plymouth Regional High School as Assistant Principal and was promoted to Principal in 1993.
He has held that position ever since--more than 30 years.
Among his many accomplishments, Bruce's colleagues have called him an effective leader, creative problem solver, and passionate educator.
I commend Bruce on his retirement after three decades with Plymouth Regional High School and his unwavering dedication to our state's students.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's Second Congressional District, I thank Bruce for his years of service to our community and for being a part of what makes the Granite State such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a family.
I am honored to recognize and congratulate Bruce on his retirement and wish him the best of luck in the years ahead.
