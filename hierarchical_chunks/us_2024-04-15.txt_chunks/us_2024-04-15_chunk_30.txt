Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate the members of the St. Gregory Armenian Church as they mark 90 years of upholding the sacred traditions, values, and teachings of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
As we reflect on the countless blessings bestowed upon St. Gregory, and the blessings bestowed upon the community they serve, we look to the future with great optimism and renewed vigor.
I wish them much growth, spiritual enlightenment, and enduring unity for the next 90 years and beyond.
Congratulations from the United States.
