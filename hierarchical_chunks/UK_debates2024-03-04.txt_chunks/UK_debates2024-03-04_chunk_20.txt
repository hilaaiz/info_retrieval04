This week’s Budget will be a big one for young people—16 and 17-year-olds—who are starting work or making important education choices, yet they currently have no say on  who will be the next Government.
We on the Opposition Benches believe in our young people.
Will the Government act now to give 16 and 17-year-olds a say in the next general election?
The hon.
Lady makes a case for lowering the voting age—one that I do not support and the Government do not support.
The age of 18 is seen as the age of maturity in this country and many others across the world.
It seems to have served us pretty well up to now
and I see no particular reason to change it.
Will the Minister join me in congratulating South Staffordshire Council on serving an enforcement notice to rebuild the Crooked House pub?
Will he also look favourably at measures I will be bringing forward to ensure that heritage pubs are better protected, because, as he will know, the Crooked House and many others have had no protections at all?
My hon.
Friend makes an important argument, and the case of the Crooked House reinforces what he has long campaigned for: better protection for heritage pubs.
I look forward to working with him and Lord Mendoza to achieve just that.
