I thank my hon.
Friend for his advocacy for the fund and for his constituents in Bury.
The community ownership fund works alongside existing community asset transfers and supports them by funding the costs of renovation and refurbishment.
We cannot fund the cost of purchasing publicly owned assets where the public authority would credit a capital receipt, except in the case of parish, town and community councils, but I am happy to meet him to discuss this issue further.
