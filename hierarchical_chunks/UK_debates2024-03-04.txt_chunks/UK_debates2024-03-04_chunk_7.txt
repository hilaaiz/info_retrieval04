I thank my hon.
Friend for his answer, and I am delighted that we have recently been able to bring £78 million of investment to Clacton.
Freeports will be a major contributor towards levelling up, and in my view levelling up also means better transport infrastructure, but not enough is getting through to bus services in my patch.
