I welcome the Minister’s earlier assurance about Afghans who fought with or otherwise supported our troops against the Taliban.
Can he explain, for the benefit of those of us not au fait with the details of this dispute, for what reason these reports were not published earlier, and at what level the decision not to publish was taken?
Had they been published sooner, would the inspector have been out of a job, and would we have been looking for a replacement?
