For almost two years this Tory Government have failed to appoint an independent adviser on Islamophobia.
The former adviser has criticised the Government for their failure to engage, and revealed that he could not even get them to provide terms of reference for his role.
Does the Minister agree that this Government lack the political will to tackle this pernicious hatred, or even to call it out?
I strongly disagree.
We plan to appoint a new independent adviser on anti-Muslim hatred, and we will update the House shortly.
