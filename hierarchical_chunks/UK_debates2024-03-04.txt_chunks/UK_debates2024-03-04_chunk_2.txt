The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support rough sleepers and homeless people to move into accommodation.
What steps he is taking to help reduce the number of families in temporary accommodation.
We are investing almost £2.4 billion over three years to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping, which is an unprecedented amount.
That includes over £1.2 billion through the homelessness prevention grant, which councils can use flexibly to prevent homelessness and help families to move out of temporary accommodation.
Last week, an additional £107 million was allocated to councils through the single homelessness accommodation programme, providing 808 homes for people sleeping rough.
