pillar in the Indianapolis community.
He supported the Irsay Family YMCA, Peyton Manning Children's Hospital, the Indiana Black Expo, Wheeler Mission Center for Women & Children, and Gleaners Food Bank.
He was also a dedicated advocate for mental health, courageously sharing his own journey to break the stigma surrounding addiction and mental illness.
Through the Irsay family's generous support of Kicking the Stigma, they invested over $31 million to improve mental health awareness, research, and treatment across Indiana and the nation.
Jim was also a cultural icon, cultivating one of the world's greatest music and historical collections, sharing it generously as a ``traveling museum'' to inspire and educate.
Whether on stage with his band or quietly supporting those in need, Jim's generosity and spirit touched countless lives.
Above all, Jim cherished his family--his wife Margaret, his three daughters, and ten grandchildren, whom he loved deeply and supported unconditionally.
His devotion to family, football, and community defined his life and will leave a legacy in Indianapolis and beyond.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jim Irsay--a man whose passion, leadership, and kindness made a profound difference in the lives of Hoosiers and NFL fans everywhere.
May his memory inspire us all to serve with the same dedication and heart.
