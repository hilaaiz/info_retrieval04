Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I offer these remarks in honor of Emory & Henry College head football coach Curt Newsome, who stepped down from his position this summer.
Coach Newsome dedicated his life to the sport of football, earning coaching positions at several academic institutions throughout his career.
Coach Newsome was born in Hampton, Virginia on October 29, 1958.
His pursuit and interest in a career in football was great.
He decided to move to the opposite end of Virginia to play at the collegiate level at Emory & Henry College, now University.
Coach Newsome played as a defensive tackle.
Upon graduation, 
Mr. Newsome began a coaching career at Ervinton High School in Nora, Virginia.
During a 16-year time span, the high schools of Ervinton, Kecoughtan, and Heritage benefitted from Coach Newsome's leadership and drive.
He received praise and recognition from fans, players and fellow coaches, resulting in his 1998 selection as the AP and VHSL Virginia State Coach
The coaching journey did not end there.
His hard work caught the attention of Virginia universities and their football programs.
Coach Newsome landed a coaching opportunity at James Madison University in 1999.
In 2004, he helped JMU reach the FCS National Championship game, where they would defeat Montana 31-21.
This victory became JMU's first NCAA Division I-AA championship.
From 2006 to 2012, Coach Newsome worked for Virginia Tech football as an offensive line coach under Hall of Fame coach Frank Beamer before returning to JMU.
In 2014, Coach Newsome became head football coach for his alma mater, Emory & Henry.
In his first season, Coach Newsome was named Old Dominion Athletic Conference Coach of the Year as he compiled an 8-2 record for the Wasps that season.
Coach Newsome compiled six winning seasons during his Emory & Henry tenure as head coach and oversaw the team's transition from NCAA Division III to NCAA Division II.
His lifelong commitment to Virginia football and the players he coached is well documented, serving various coaching roles at the high school and collegiate levels.
I wish my fraternity brother in Beta Lambda Zeta, Coach Newsome, well in his retirement.
I thank him and Southwest Virginia thanks him for his contributions to the game of football in our region.
