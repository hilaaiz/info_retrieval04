Mr. Anderson was a well-respected member of his community.
He loved God and he loved his family.
He was a member of Stanton Christian Church and the Powell County Lions Club.
Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife Candace, his son James, and his daughter Josi.
It is my honor to lift up the life of this dedicated public servant.
