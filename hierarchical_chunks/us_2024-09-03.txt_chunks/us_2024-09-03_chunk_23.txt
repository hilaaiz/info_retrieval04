Mr. SABLAN.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pacific Defense Small Business Incentive Act of 2024, which would allow small businesses in the Pacific Insular Areas to become more active participants in the defense industrial base.
Specifically, my legislation would authorize an incentive payment equal to five percent of a Department of Defense contract to prime contractors who subcontract to a small business concern in the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, or American Samoa.
Providing access to defense contracts is critical, especially as the United States continues to execute its Indo-Pacific strategy, promoting a free-and-open region and defending Pacific Island interests.
Empowering our small businesses located at the forefront of the IndoPacific will not only streamline defense projects and initiatives but will also spur local economic growth in our U.S. Pacific Insular Areas.
My bill, the Pacific Defense Small Business Incentive Act, seeks to bridge the gap between Pacific-based entrepreneurs and prime contractors throughout the United States by incentivizing strategic partnerships.
Continued defense buildup in areas like the Marianas further necessitates the need for local business participation.
This bipartisan legislation provides an impetus for contracting like the Indian Incentive Program authorized by Congress in 1988, which has been considerably impactful for Native American and Native Hawaiian small business concerns.
The DOD Office of Small Business Programs under the Biden Administration has emphasized that America's small businesses are ``essential to U.S. national security'' and the ``heartbeat of the U.S. economy''.
I could not agree more but add that Pacific small businesses are indeed America's small businesses.
The gentlelady from American Samoa, 
Ms. Radewagen, is an original cosponsor of the bill.
I urge all my colleagues to consider this crucial legislation and the elevation of Pacific small businesses in defense contracting.
