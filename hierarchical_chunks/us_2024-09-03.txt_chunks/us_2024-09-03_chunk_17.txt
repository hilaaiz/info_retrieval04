Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of Barry Brown, who sadly passed away this August at 69 years old.
Barry was a Savannah native through-and-through.
After graduating from Savannah High School, he dedicated over 20 years to serving the Savannah and Tybee Island communities.
From serving on the Planning Commission, the City Council, and as Mayor Pro Tem, Barry's natural-born leadership set a valuable example for everyone around him.
