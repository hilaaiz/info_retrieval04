Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Michael A. Burget, who is entering a well-deserved retirement after three decades deep passion for public service,

In 1987, 
Mr. Burget began his military career as he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserves.
For six years, he served as a hospital corpsman and a fleet corporal.
Mr. Burget then joined the United States Air Force Reserve, serving with distinction for 29 years and rising to the rank.
During his 35 years of military service, 
Mr. Burget has been a tireless advocate for ensuring active military and veterans have access to essential mental health resources.
