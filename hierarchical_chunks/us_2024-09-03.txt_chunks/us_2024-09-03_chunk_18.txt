Mr. Brown also faithfully served over 25 years on the Marine Rescue Squadron and belonged to both the American Legion Post 154 and the Tybee Island Republican Club.
Mr Brown is survived by his wife Sunni, his son Brandon, and his four grandchildren.
We deeply honor and thank 
Mr. Brown for his service to the Savannah and Tybee Island communities over the years.
I send my most sincere condolences to the Brown family.
They, along with Barry's friends and all those who were blessed to know him, are in my thoughts and prayers today.
