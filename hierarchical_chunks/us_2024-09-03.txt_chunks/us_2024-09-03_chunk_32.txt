Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of these special places: the Residence Inn on Amelia Island in the free state.
The Residence Inn is perfectly situated in the heart of Amelia Island close to downtown, delightful shops and restaurants, and of course, the crystal blue surf that makes us a top destination.
The Residence Inn is a great community partner, and under the leadership of General Manager Bob Hartman, they sponsor many events on the island, making it a better place to live and visit.
The hotel is truly a home away from home for many travelers, and I experienced their hospitality firsthand.
When our house was damaged by an unexpected fire, we lived in the Residence Inn for 6 months.
The entire staff, from management to maintenance went above and beyond to make a difficult time for our family better, ensuring we felt at home.
The folks at Residence Inn are true leaders of our state's travel, hospitality, and tourism industries.
I am profoundly grateful to their employees who welcome visitors with their positive attitudes and their exemplary services that always exceed expectations.
