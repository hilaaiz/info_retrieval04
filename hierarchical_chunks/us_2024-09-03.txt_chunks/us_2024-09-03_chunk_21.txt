Mr. HARRIS.
Mr Speaker, two weeks ago I learned with great sadness about the passing.
Gordon F. Lee, a retired officer with the Easton Police Department who passed away on Monday, August 19, 2024, at the age of 46.
During his time at the Easton Police Department, Sgt. Lee served with the K-9 unit, trained new officers and recruits as instructor and was a member of the department's SWAT Critical Response Unit.
Before that, he honorably served with the U S. Marine Corps.
Sgt.
Lee retired from active duty with the Easton Police Department in February of 2024.
Sgt.
Lee dedicated his life to helping others, putting his own life on the line to protect and serve the community he so much loved.
His determination and hard work made him an outstanding leader, an excellent teacher and invaluable friend and mentor to so many in the Maryland police community and beyond.
I would like to express my sincere condolences to the Lee family and the entire Easton Police Department.
The Eastern Shore is forever grateful for Sgt.
Lee's commitment and dedication.
