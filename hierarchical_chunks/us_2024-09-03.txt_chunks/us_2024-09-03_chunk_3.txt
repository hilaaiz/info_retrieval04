Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bobby Stephen's Annual Saint Patrick's Day event in Manchester, New Hampshire.
Since its inception in 1978, this cherished tradition has brought together the community in a celebration that goes beyond mere festivity.
Over the years, Bobby's event has become a cornerstone of charitable giving in our state, raising funds to support educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth throughout New Hampshire.
The origins of this event can be traced back to Bobby's restaurant, the Vault, where a small gathering of friends and patrons first came together to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day.
What began as a modest celebration has evolved into a significant fundraiser, drawing hundreds of attendees each year.
Through the Bobby Stephen's Fund for Education, the proceeds from this event have provided scholarships to New Hampshire citizens, enabling them to further their career goals through postsecondary education.
Bobby's unwavering dedication to this cause has made a tangible difference in the lives of countless students and their families.
As we mark the grand finale of this event in its ``sunset'' year of 2024, it is fitting to reflect on the enduring legacy that Bobby's Saint Patrick's Day celebration has created.
Across four decades this event has not only raised over $500,000 in scholarships, it has also fostered a deep sense of community among its participants.
The funds raised have empowered students, supported educational advancement, and reinforced the values of generosity and service that Bobby has championed throughout his life.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to extend my gratitude to Bobby Stephen for his exceptional commitment to our community.
We thank Bobby for his tireless efforts and for creating a tradition that has touched so many lives.
As this event comes to a close, its legacy will continue to inspire us all to join together in support of our youth and the future
