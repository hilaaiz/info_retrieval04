Ms. Whitney-West has spent the last 20 years at NorthPoint deeply committed to improving the lives of those in and around Minneapolis.
She has also served on the boards of Minnesota Association of Community Health Centers, and the African American Leadership Forum.
While Ms. Whitney-West will be truly missed at NorthPoint, I am sure that the strong foundation she built will ensure NorthPoint's long-term success and positive role in our community for generations to come.
Ms. Whitney-West's leadership and dedication to public health is invaluable--her life's work serving others has made Minneapolis a healthier, more equitable place for all.
