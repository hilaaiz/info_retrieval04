Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of my constituent, Frank Charles Bielecki, who turns 100 years old on August 28th of this year.
Mr. Bielecki has dedicated his life to our country, his family, and Michiganders.
Bielecki served in the United States Army for three years, where he worked as a Private and Tec 5 Cook at Fort Custer in Michigan.
Bielecki spent 60 wonderful years with his wife Dorothy Joan Kulak, and he is a proud father to three sons, a grandfather of seven, and a great grandfather of eleven.
Before retiring in 1986, he worked at Rapistan Conveyors in Grand Rapids for over 31 years.
When asked about his secret to longevity, Bielecki recalls always working hard, staying healthy, and eating plenty of Vernors and Little Debbie Honey Buns.
From raising generations of Michiganders to serving our country, Bielecki has inspired so many people across the Third District.
I applaud the positive impact he continues to make in our West Michigan community.
