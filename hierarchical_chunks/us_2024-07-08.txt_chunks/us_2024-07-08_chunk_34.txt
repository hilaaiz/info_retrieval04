Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life of a great and good man, Narsai David, and in extending our most sincere condolences to his wife Venus and his son Daniel.
We are a better Nation because of this exceptional man who was a dear friend and mentor to me.
