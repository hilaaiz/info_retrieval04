Ms. ESHOO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of an extraordinary American, Narsai Michael David.
Narsai David, the child of Assyrian immigrants, was born in South Bend, Indiana on June 26, 1936 and grew up in Turlock, California.
He died in his home in Berkeley on June 20, 2024 from injuries suffered as a result of a fall.
Narsai David graduated from Turlock High School and the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied math and pre-med.
He worked in a restaurant during college and after owning a printing company for two years, he worked at a restaurant in Berkeley where he eventually became a partner.
In 1970 he launched a catering business and one of his first clients, rock impresario Bill Graham, introduced him to many of the legends of the era.
In 1976 Narsai opened his eponymous restaurant in Kensington, California, and was in the vanguard of the food revolution of the 1970's.
He also owned a vineyard in the Napa Valley where he produced Cuvee and Cabernet Sauvignon.
Narsai David's inviting smile, warm voice and passion for food and travel made him a widely beloved and highly regarded writer of a cooking column in the San Francisco Chronicle and commentator on KCBS radio and television for many years.
Reminiscing about Narsai, his colleagues at KCBS remember his signature bow ties, and how he would begin with ``I'm Narsai David to say....'' and launch into his news reports.
He never said anything negative on the radio or television about a restaurant or chef, and when he was hosting a dinner he would tinkle his fork on a glass and say ``good evening, good evening and a very good evening,'' all with a sparkle in his eye.
Narsai was a generous philanthropist who was affiliated with the Assyrian Aid Society of America and Alameda County's Meals on Wheels program.
His pride in being an Assyrian American was evident to all, and his gourmet enterprises all reflected the culture.
