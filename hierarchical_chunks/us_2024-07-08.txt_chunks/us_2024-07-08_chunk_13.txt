Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable career and leadership of Stella Whitney-West, who is retiring after 17 years as Chief Executive Officer of NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center in Minneapolis.
NorthPoint, one of my district's Federally Qualified Health Centers, serves thousands of my constituents every year, Federally Qualified Health Centers make up the fabric of our country's health safety net-- and 
Ms. Whitney-West's leadership has been instrumental in making NorthPoint a shining example of the FQHC model.
In fact, it should be noted that NorthPoint was the first FQHC to be designated as a Health Care Home by the Minnesota Department.
Ms. WhitneyWest began her career at NorthPoint as Chief Operating Officer in 2004.
When she became the Chief Executive Officer in 2007, she led NorthPoint through a transitional time of several renovations and expansions to better serve our community.
Throughout 
Ms. Whitney-West's tenure, she and her staff have prioritized fostering partnerships with other organizations throughout the city to expand their reach of care.
NorthPoint's role in serving our community during the COVID-19 pandemic is immeasurable.
Under 
Ms. Whitney-West's steadfast leadership, NorthPoint was a cornerstone of health and wellness for those who needed it most; not only by providing critical care and information, but also access to countless other resources like food and housing support.
The positive impact that NorthPoint has on my district cannot be overstated, and it is thanks in large part to Stella Whitney-West's incredible leadership.
