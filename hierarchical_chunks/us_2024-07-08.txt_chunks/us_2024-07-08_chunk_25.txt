Mr. BARR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize The Berea Citizen, a newspaper in Kentucky's Sixth District.
The Berea Citizen was founded in 1899.
It has been a trusted news source for the people of Madison County for 125 years.
The idea for the newspaper originated with Berea College President William G. Frost and at first it served as the school newspaper.
It remained connected with Berea College until 1984, when it became a private newspaper.
It was first delivered on Chestnut Street along a dirt road.
The newspaper survived the Great Depression, two World Wars, and a global pandemic, delivering local news to the community without interruption.
The Berea Citizen staff recognizes that freedom of the press is critical in our society.
They prioritize fair and balanced coverage of local meetings and events.
The Berea Citizen reached more than 10,000 readers each week.
They are currently owned by Nolan Group Media from Manchester, Kentucky.
Keith Taylor, the publisher, began in 2020 as the pandemic was beginning.
The owner is Jay Nolan, and the Vice President is Glenn Gray.
The Berea Citizen is one of the few locally owned newspapers in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and it is printed in Kentucky at J. Frank Publishing in London, Kentucky.
In an era when many community newspapers are declining and no longer able to print news for the citizens, The Berea Citizen continues its mission to be a voice in the community.
I congratulate them on their 125-year anniversary, and I am honored to recognize them before the United States Congress.
