Mrs. McClain.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary dedication and service of Judy Adams, Director of the I Support the 1% Food Pantry.
The I Support the 1% Food Pantry, an organization celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, is committed to ensuring that no veteran in Michigan goes hungry.
Through their tireless efforts, Judy and her team have provided not just food but also hope and dignity to those who bravely served our Nation.
Founded on July 28, 2014, and opening its doors in April 2015, the I Support the 1% Food Pantry was established in response to the growing crisis of food insecurity among veterans and military reserve members.
Too many of our Nation's heroes struggle to put food on the table, often feeling ashamed or hopeless in their hardship Judy and her team understand the critical need for support and made it their mission to ensure that ``No Veteran Should Ever Go Hungry.''
The pantry partners with VA social workers, including those in the HUD-VASH Homeless program and Home-Based Primary Care program, to ensure food reaches veterans in need--even those who are homebound due to medical conditions.
Additionally, the I Support the 1% Food Pantry works directly with military reserve units, assisting service members and their families during times of financial difficulty.
Since its founding, the pantry has served over 1,000 veterans across Michigan, including WWII and Korean War veterans living on fixed incomes, combat-wounded veterans, and those struggling with PTSD and economic hardship.
For many, the pantry is the difference between going hungry and being able to provide for their families.
Thanks to Judy Adams and I Support the 1% Food Pantry, these veterans now have a place to turn for assistance and compassion.
