Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly exceptional organization, the Theta Pi Zeta Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., based in Itta Bena, Mississippi.
Since its inception, the chapter has been a steadfast beacon of service, community involvement, and the embodiment of the principles upheld by Zeta Phi Beta.
Founded on November 10, 1976, with the leadership of then State Director Bertha Blackburn and co-founders Henri E. Lowe and Maxine P. Stewart, Theta Pi Zeta began its journey in a small yet significant way at the Western Sizzlin' Steak House in Greenwood, Mississippi.
The chapter's roots are deeply intertwined with the spirit of dedication, as evidenced by the work of Henri E. Lowe and M'Elena Matthews, who signed the chapter's charter application, helping to ensure its establishment.
Throughout the years, 14 remarkable women have served as president, with the late Henri E. Lowe leading the charge during the formative years.
Currently, under the leadership of Denise Pitchford, the chapter continues its dedication to service and community outreach, earning recognition at the state and regional levels.
The chapter boasts 32 financial members and has been involved in countless community initiatives, such as hosting a State Round-Up for Zetas in Greenwood, Mississippi, and supporting local events like the March for Babies campaign.
The Itta Bena Amicae Auxiliary, established in 1986 and sponsored by Sister Shirley Burks, remains a vital part of the chapter's outreach efforts, and the chapter's youth auxiliaries--including the Archonette, Amicette, and Pearlette Clubs--engage in community service projects like adopting families for Thanksgiving and Christmas, ringing Salvation Army bells, and delivering care bags to local nursing homes.
The chapter's charter members, such as Riller Bennett, Thelma Collins, Laura Davis, Doroty Edwards, Amanda Elzy, Anna Hicks, Irene Howard, Zelma Howard, Jean Jennings, Henri E. Lowe, M'Elena Mathews, Betty Morris, Geneva Pickens, Henrine Stewart, Bobbie Wicks, Ann Wilson, and Malinda Winters laid the foundation for what has become a powerful and enduring force in the Mississippi Delta.
Many of them have left lasting legacies, including the late Henri E. Lowe, and Florence Weathersby, who served for an impressive 70 years and remained an inspiration to many.
The chapter's commitment to service continues with a full slate of community activities for 2025, including events like hosting a Sisterhood Tea for Women's History Month, visiting nursing homes, organizing water hydration drives, and supporting the March of Dimes Campaign.
