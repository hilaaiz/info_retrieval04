Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Brenda Faye Graham Johnson, who passed away on March 26th at the age of 77.
On March 31, 1947, 
Ms. Johnson was born in Christiansburg, Virginia, but was raised in nearby Salem, Virginia.
After graduating from Andrew Lewis High School, she attended Marion College in Marion, Virginia.
Ms. Johnson graduated as part of the last class from Marion College.
Following her studies at Radford University, where she earned a teaching degree, 
Ms. Johnson taught in the classroom.
She stayed close to Southwest Virginia during her life and raised a family with her loving husband, Don, by her side.
In addition to her service as an educator, 
Ms. Johnson helped contribute to the Republican Party of Virginia in various capacities.
Primarily, 
Ms. Johnson held officer roles in the Republican Party of Bristol and the Republican Party of Salem, two units who helped shape local conservative candidates for elected office.
Virginia's Ninth District Republican Committee benefitted from Ms. Johnson's loyalty and service, particularly in her role as the Committee's official secretary.
This sometimes required her throughout the year to drive away from home to assist the Committee with its meetings and business.
A woman of strong faith and appreciation for the Lord, 
Ms. Johnson was an active member of Salem's First United Methodist Church.
In addition to her husband, family remaining to cherish her memory includes her children, Jessica J. Funk (Kevin), and Lauren J. Paige, both of Richmond, Va.; grandson, Declan Funk; siblings, Connie Melton (Carter), Jennifer Brown (Bill), and Bradley Graham; and many nieces and nephews.
I always appreciated her dedication to the Republican Party and helping the various Republican committees where she was living.
Further, Brenda and her husband helped to start the Salem G.O.P.'s annual Olde Salem Days Breakfast which has grown into a major event for candidates seeking a Republican nomination in Virginia.
