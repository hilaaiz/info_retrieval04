Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life of Patsy Pettus, a cherished member of our community.
Patsy is an extraordinary individual whose life has exemplified nothing short of the beauty in living life curiously.
Patsy is a passionate member of the Richmond community.
Through her love of art and architecture, she has bettered the lives of everyone around her.
Described by many as the ``role model for aging gracefully,'' her lively character has made her a beloved figure to all who have the joy of knowing her.
Patsy's commitment to the local community leaves an indelible mark on our district and beyond.
Patsy's efforts as an advocate for art programs across the state will leave a legacy to inspire generations to come.
The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, where she volunteered as a docent decades ago, has benefited greatly from her and her beloved husband Hunter's generosity and support.
Her family's contributions to Virginia Commonwealth University's (VCU) Institute for Contemporary Arts helped transform the creative arts programs at VCU.
Ask anyone in Richmond's art scene and Patsy's name will bring a sparkle to their eyes--She has always been known as the life of the party.
