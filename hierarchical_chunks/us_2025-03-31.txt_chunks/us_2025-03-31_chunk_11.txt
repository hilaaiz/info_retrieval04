Mrs. Williams instilled within her children the importance of hard work, education, and faith.
Over the course of her life, she has been proud to see her offspring continue to make meaningful contributions to the community.
Thanks to her devoted parenting, her children have gone on to take on professions as attorneys, educators, elected officials, corporate managers, and more.
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm once said that ``service is the rent we pay for the space we occupy here on this earth.''
As we celebrate 
Mrs. Williams' 95 years of life, we can say without a doubt that 
Mrs. Rosa Mae Williams has paid her rent and paid it well.
Her dedicated life of service to her family and community is truly commendable.
I know that her children and grandchildren are very proud unconditional love.
