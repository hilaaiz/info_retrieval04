Mr. Speaker, the work of Judy Adams and the I Support the 1% Food Pantry is a testament to the power of community and service.
Their unwavering commitment to Michigan's veterans embodies the very spirit of selflessness and patriotism.
Today, we honor Judy Adams for her leadership, her compassion, and her unyielding dedication to ensuring that those who have served our Nation never have to face hunger alone.
