Ms. JAYAPAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career and legacy.
Bob is retiring after 23 years of committed service as the CEO and President of the Seattle Aquarium.
I am so grateful for his tireless efforts to make the Seattle Aquarium a leader in conservation, education, and visitor experience.
Thanks to Bob's leadership, the Seattle Aquarium is now the largest marine conservation institution in the northwestern United States.
His work has transformed the Seattle Aquarium from a local aquarium into a globally recognized conservation organization.
Bob waited to step down from his post until the completion of the $180 million Ocean Pavilion, which highlights sea life in the biodiverse Indo-Pacific Coral Triangle and educates guests on how we must work together to protect the world's oceans.
His wide array of professional experiences helped him forge the partnerships necessary to complete the Ocean Pavilion project.
Bob also led Woodland Park Zoo's $40 million renovation project that transformed the zoo into a modern leader for design and habitats.
Thanks to Bob Davidson's many accomplishments, Seattle has seen significant expansion and continued improvement of the Aquarium's buildings, the ongoing transformation of the Seattle waterfront, and the growing reputation of the Seattle Aquarium as a global leader in ocean conservation.
I am very grateful for his incredible service and confident that he will continue to be a staunch advocate for protecting our oceans and sea life.
His leadership will serve as a model for years to come.
