Last year's U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit in Washington and the Strategy for Pacific Partnership released at that summit built on prior versions of our BLUE Pacific Act first introduced by our Pacific Islands Caucus in 2019.
They represented a confirmation of our shared histories and path and a full re-engagement on all fronts with the Pacific Islands.
Our BLUE Pacific Act reintroduced today updates our prior versions to account for portions already enacted through other vehicles as well as the U.S.-Pacific Islands Summit.
It supports the tenets of the Pacific Islands Forum's 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, ensuring that our efforts are fully responsive to and synchronized with the expressed direction and needs of the Pacific Islands nations.
It specifically codifies the Strategy for Pacific Partnership and requires updates to the strategy every four years.
It also includes language encouraging the allocation of more staff to the Pacific Islands, and the facilitation of U.S. support for trade capacity building, environmental change mitigation, education, civil society engagement and security training.
These further initiatives support the significant strides we have made in recent years towards fully reengaging the Pacific Islands region across a range of common values and interests and in response to specific Pacific Islands needs.
In this moment, as the Pacific Islands recover from the health and economic impacts of the pandemic and are confronted with increased environmental, security and other challenges, this re-engagement is vital.
Our bill says to the Pacific Islands that the United States is a partner they can trust and rely upon over the long term.
For these reasons, I ask that my colleagues support our bill.
Mahalo (thank you).
