Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Delta Cardiff Volunteer Fire Company (DCVFC) on the occasion of the 25th Anniversary of the Mason Dixon Fair.
In 1998, following the Delta Cardiff Volunteer Fire Company Carnival, thanks to the leadership of Delta Cardiff Volunteer Fire Company President Doug Farrington, the community came together to transform their annual carnival into a Pennsylvania-sanctioned State Fair.
Land was purchased and building infrastructure was created to host the inaugural Mason Dixon Fair on July 12-17, 1999.
The fair's first year was held in acclaim by residents of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and this success has continued over the years.
The leadership of the fair changed following the passing of Chief Doug Farrington in 2010, and for the next twelve years Fire Company Chief Jeff Griffith continued to build upon the fair's success.
Now, Vice President Derek Macomber and his wife Becky lead the fair with assistance from numerous dedicated community volunteers.
Communities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been built stronger thanks to the volunteer contributions of those who donate their time and talents to put on State Fairs, and that is true of the Mason Dixon Fair in Delta, Pennsylvania.
As they celebrate their 25th anniversary this year, I want to congratulate and thank all the fair volunteers, community members, and organizations including the brave and selfless members of the Delta Cardiff Volunteer Fire Company who have worked to make the Mason Dixon Fair a fun and successful community event.
I wish them all continued success in the years to come.
