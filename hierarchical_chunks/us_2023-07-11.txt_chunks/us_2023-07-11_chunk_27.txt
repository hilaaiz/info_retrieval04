Mr. BUCK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the opening of The Capstone at Centerra Senior Living in Loveland, Colorado.
Capstone at Centerra is a leader in innovative housing and medical solutions for seniors in Colorado's Fourth District.
As an organization, Capstone serves its residents at every stage of the aging process, providing assisted living, memory care, and respite care designed to encourage independence and support individuals with personalized care.
Colorado is one of the fastest aging states in the Nation, and by 2040, 1 in 4 Coloradoans will be over the age of 60.
With a rapidly aging population and a shortage of assisted living facilities and memory care services there is a critical need for more facilities, like Capstone, especially in rural areas like the Eastern Plains.
Organizations who face the healthcare crisis head-on and continue to provide high-quality, personalized, and innovative care deserve to be recognized and supported.
I am proud to recognize the Capstone at Centerra for improving the quality of life for seniors in Northern Colorado.
I hope that their perseverance in advancing care will inspire other communities to provide continued, personalized housing and medical care for older adults.
