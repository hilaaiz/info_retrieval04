Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Jack Ding, a renowned member of our community who has been chosen to receive the prestigious American Dream Award for California's Fourth Congressional District.
This award honors immigrants who have excelled professionally, through entrepreneurship and innovation, in the arts and culture, or through community service.
Mr. Ding's exceptional leadership and advocacy makes him a very deserving recipient of this recognition and award.
