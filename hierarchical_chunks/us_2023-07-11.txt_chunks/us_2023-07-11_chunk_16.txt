Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Nation's community supervision professionals, who are dedicated public servants and perform many vital roles in their work with justice-involved adults and juveniles.
They identify opportunities and services to help individuals successfully contribute to society, while holding them accountable for their actions.
They remain mindful of their role in protecting public safety.
In honor of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2023, we salute all those who have chosen this important career.
In the District of Columbia, we especially thank the employees of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia (PSA) for their service.
CSOSA and PSA are models of excellence in community supervision.
Their work reflects the theme of Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2023, ``Stronger Together.''
Community supervision agencies are valuable partners of other government agencies, nonprofits, neighborhood-based groups and all who strive to make our nation safer and stronger.
We extend our gratitude to them and encourage all people to recognize their many achievements as we proclaim July 16-22, 2023, Pretrial, Probation and Parole Supervision Week 2023.
