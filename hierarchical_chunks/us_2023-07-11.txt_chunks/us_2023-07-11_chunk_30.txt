Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday of Vivian Litchard, a woman who answered the call of duty at the tender age of 18 and served our country with dignity in its darkest hours.
Though she may say ``It really wasn't a big deal, its just what we all did'', we know that without the skilled workers assembling B-24 Liberators in Willow Run, the result of the war may have been much different.
We thank her for her service, and wish her much laughter and blessings in her 101st year.
I thank Vivian.
