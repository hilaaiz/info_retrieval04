Ms. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service and accomplishments of Andres Sada, my intern who is transitioning from my office to continue his mission.
A Florida native with Panamanian origins, Andres came to my office ready to impact the American legislative system.
While in my office, Andres has pushed my agendas to great lengths--from drafting memos, to organizing information, and researching data.
In our time together, I have recognized that Andres is a force in policy.
His passion has been powerful over the semester as we have fought for the lives of underserved and disadvantaged communities.
His commitment to international affairs has led Andres to organizing events regarding Latin American Politics at the George Washington University.
Andres has successfully piloted the first GW Pride MUN conference for Out in International Affairs.
Andres has and will continue to make a difference and leave his mark on public policy as he continues to fight for a better system.
On behalf of Florida's 24th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Andres Sada for his exemplary accomplishments, dedication to public service, and trailblazing leadership.
