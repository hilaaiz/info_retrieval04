Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions to the Fannin County community by Sandy Barber.
For over 22 years, Mrs. Barber has served as the Executive Director of the Fannin County Children's Center, and she has over 31 years of experience in the nonprofit and child welfare sectors.
A native of Arlington, 
Mrs. Barber graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Texas.
Her passion for child welfare services originates from her longtime desire to help put an end to the victims of abuse.
Under her leadership, Fannin County Children's Center has expanded its community programs and outreach to assist children who have been abused and neglected.
Some of these efforts include expanding mental health services, offering emergency resources and providing clothing.
Mrs. Barber also oversaw the purchase and renovation of their current facility in Bonham, Texas.
Moreover, 
Mrs. Barber has served on the board for Texas Court Appointed Special Advocates and the Children's Advocacy Centers of Texas.
To recognize her outstanding work, she was named the Texoma Regional Citizen of the Year and Bonham Citizen of the Year.
Mrs. Barber also received the Athena Leadership Award and the Angels in Adoption Award in 2019.
I'm confident that many young people have been inspired by 
Mrs. Barber's efforts and have no doubt that they will follow her footsteps to help prevent horrific acts of child abuse.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize 
Mrs. Barber's important contributions to the children.
May God Bless her.
