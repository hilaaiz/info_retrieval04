Mr. CASE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my Boosting LongTerm U.S. Engagement in the Pacific (BLUE Pacific) Act, co-introduced with my Pacific Islands Caucus Colleagues Congresswoman Radewagen, Congressman Bera and Congressman Sherman.
This bill directs a comprehensive and sustained approach to U.S. engagement in the Pacific Islands, a critical part of the broader IndoPacific where much of the future of the world is being charted.
The lands and waters of the jurisdictions spread across Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia comprise an area larger than the land areas of China and Russia combined and represent a major portion of the vast Pacific Ocean and our Earth's surface.
The peoples of these islands have developed their own proud cultures and identity over millennia, and for centuries now have shared historic, cultural, economic and strategic ties with the United States.
Tens of thousands of U.S. and allied servicemembers died throughout the Pacific Islands in World War Two defending the common values shared between our country and the Pacific Islands.
Our presents and futures are entwined; they are being and will be determined jointly.
