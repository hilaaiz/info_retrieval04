Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleagues Congressman Jim Costa and Congressman Raul Grijalva, to pay tribute to our long-time friend and advisor Michael Fraioli, who passed away after a courageous battle with leukemia.
Mike was a devoted husband and father and is survived by his wife of 27 years, Carol Eickert, his beloved children Michelle and Matthew, and his brother Tom.
A Central Valley kid, Mike was born in Modesto, California and was a long-time resident of Chevy Chase, MD.
After working in his hometown of Modesto on the successful campaign electing Tony Coelho to the U.S. House of Representatives, Mike moved to Washington, D.C. to begin his long and successful career in politics as a strong Democrat.
Mike was the founder and owner of Fraioli & Associates, where he advised some of the highest-level Democrats in Congress and was a vocal advocate for a variety of labor organizations including IAMAW, IBEW, and AFL-CIO.
Mike made an indelible impact on both my political journey and my life.
I had the honor to work with Mike since 1996, a few months before I was elected to Congress.
I spent thousands of hours with Mike over a period of 27 years--and I enjoyed every hour.
As I reflect on Mike's life, I am reminded of his unyielding belief in the power of organizing and the necessity of empowering individuals to shape their own futures.
He was a tremendous advocate and friend.
His passing leaves a void not only in the realm of politics but in the hearts of all who had the honor of knowing him.
We would like to extend our sincerest condolences to Mike's wife Carol, and his children Michelle and Matthew.
