The hon.
Member asks about China and Russia and I have to say that I agree; it is important that countries that are impacted by this—the entire world, but perhaps China in particular—do speak up.
We would welcome China being more vocal about the situation.
As I mentioned in my comments, a Chinese vessel has been attacked, so this is of direct concern to the country.
I call on China and, of course, Russia—for what it is worth—to be more vocal on these issues.
Lastly, I just do not accept this Gaza-Houthi connection.
I remind the House that the Houthis were against Hamas until 2015, and now they arrive on the scene and pretend to support them.
They are opportunist thugs taking advantage of the situation and of people’s lives and misery—not just in Gaza but in Yemen—and they should stop and desist immediately.
