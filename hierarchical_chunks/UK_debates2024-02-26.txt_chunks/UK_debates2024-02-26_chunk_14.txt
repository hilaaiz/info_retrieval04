I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
It is, of course, very good news that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive have been restored.
Policing is devolved, so the Assembly and Executive can set their own policy.
However, if they would like any information about the policies we are pursuing in the England and Wales jurisdiction, I would be very happy to share that information and work constructively and collaboratively with all the devolved Administrations, including in Northern Ireland.
