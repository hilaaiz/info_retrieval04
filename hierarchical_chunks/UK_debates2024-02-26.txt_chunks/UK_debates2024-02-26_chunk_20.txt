I thank the Minister for that answer.
He will be aware that there has been a 335% increase in Islamophobic hate cases in the UK since  7 October , and a 589% rise in antisemitic incidents compared with 2022.
That is affecting our most marginalised and vulnerable groups.
What steps is the Minister taking to protect worshippers and faith schools and to reduce unprecedented levels of hate across these islands?
