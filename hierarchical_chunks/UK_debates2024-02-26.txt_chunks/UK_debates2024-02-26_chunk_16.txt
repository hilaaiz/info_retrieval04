I thank the Minister for that answer.
Shrewsbury has more listed buildings than any other town in England, and we benefit from beautiful architecture that attracts a huge amount of tourism from across the United Kingdom and overseas.
Our top hotel in the centre of Shrewsbury is being used to house illegal migrants.
We were given an assurance that the hotel would be taken out of that use, yet we have heard nothing further from the Minister or his Department.
When will the Lion Hotel in Shrewsbury revert back to its normal use, which is housing tourists?
