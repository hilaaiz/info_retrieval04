I thank the hon.
Member for his—as he has described it—tentative support.
I have noted that the House has been largely unified on this issue during the past four statements, following previous attacks.
He asks about the mission creep situation.
I hope he feels reassured by the concept that we have waited longer, in part because the Houthis’ capabilities have been damaged, so that there is a longer gap and we do not see this thing speeding up.
We have no intention or desire to see it increase, but we will act if there continue to be attacks on commercial and naval shipping.
