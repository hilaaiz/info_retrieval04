To this House, I want to say clearly that the Government will defend our democracy.
We are working with the police and with Parliament to ensure that disagreements are resolved in this House through debate, not outside with threats of violence.
To those who seek to threaten this House, I say this: we will not be cowed; we will not be intimidated; and we will not be silenced.
We will do whatever is necessary to protect those elected to represent us, to safeguard our freedoms and to protect our rights.
I know I speak for colleagues across the whole House when I say we will always act in the interests of our constituents and our country.
