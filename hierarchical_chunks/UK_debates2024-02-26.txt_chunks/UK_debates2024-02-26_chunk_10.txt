I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The review is under way, and it includes many different elements from communities from around the world who are now settled happily in the United Kingdom.
He will understand why I will not go into individual details.
Certain communities have been targeted, such as the Hong Kong Chinese community, which is now very welcome in the United Kingdom under a policy that this Government introduced—I am very proud of the number who have claimed asylum and taken the opportunity as British nationals overseas to settle here—and we are looking at others.
We are open to any reports of transnational repression, and we are listening.
