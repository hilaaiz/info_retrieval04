Since our last Home Office questions, the list of Government failures on immigration has continued to grow relentlessly: 30,000 asylum seekers stuck in limbo, unable to be processed due to the Prime Minister’s legislative fiasco; 250 visas awarded to a care home that does not actually exist; net migration trebled; and criminals free to fly into our country undetected on private jets.
Having just sacked the independent inspector of borders and immigration, is the Home Secretary sitting on 15 different reports by the inspector because he is checking for typos, or is it because he is utterly terrified of what those reports will tell us about this Government’s shambolic and failing immigration system?
Let me answer that point very directly: having given proper consideration to those reports, we will be responding to them.
As I said in the House last week, we will do so very soon.
The shadow Minister mentioned the Government trying to dodge scrutiny.
When it comes to the general aviation report, for example, it was our officials who asked the inspector to take it forward.
Far from dodging scrutiny, we have invited it in that area.
We will respond properly and thoroughly to that report in exactly the way that I undertook to do last week.
