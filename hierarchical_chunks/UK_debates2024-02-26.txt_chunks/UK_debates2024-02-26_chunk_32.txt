I thank the Defence Secretary for advance sight of his statement.
We accept that the weekend’s airstrikes were legal, limited, and targeted to minimise the risk of civilian casualties.
We pay tribute to the total professionalism of all forces personnel involved in the operations, which were conducted to protect shipping in the Red sea and uphold freedom of navigation for all nations.
As the Defence Secretary said, the Houthis have been attacking ships of all nations: Chinese, Bulgarian and French ships have been targeted; Danish, Greek and UK ships have been hit; and even aid vessels destined for Yemen have been in the firing line.
The UK and US Navies have been forced to shoot down drones in self-defence.
