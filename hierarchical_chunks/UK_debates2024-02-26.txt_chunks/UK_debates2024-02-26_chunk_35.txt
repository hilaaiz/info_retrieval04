Open source information suggests that the strikes are diminishing the capability of the Houthis to attack international shipping.
As that is both welcome and important, will the Secretary of State concur that that is also his assessment?
It is welcome that Aspides and Prosperity Guardian are co-ordinating, but does that also include on the interdiction of weapons being smuggled from Iran into Yemen?
My right hon.
Friend is right that we are degrading—attrited, as they say in military terms—that capability.
However, it is still the case that the Houthis are capable of launching attacks.
To what extent?
Well, the House will come to its own conclusions, but it will note that the gap between the first three rounds of attacks was relatively short, and that the gap between that and this fourth round has been longer.
Again, we will wait to see what the response is.
On interdictions: yes, we will certainly continue to try to ensure that Iran is not resupplying.
The single best message to go out from this House is that Iran should stop that activity.
It is worth noting that it has been only Britain and the US that have been doing interdictions in the past few years—and, of course, we will continue to do so.
