The Secretary of State and I will disagree on the issue of Gaza.
If we had secured a real vote last week, we would probably have seen that recorded formally in the House.
Gerald M. Feierstein, the former US diplomat, has said that “the Houthis’ effort to insert themselves into the Gaza conflict” is aimed at “strengthening their support base in the country and cementing their movement more firmly in the… ‘axis of resistance’”.
I wonder whether, like me, the Secretary of State is concerned that we are not only strengthening that axis of resistance but, with illicit Chinese and Russian support, now broadening it in the Red sea.
