Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life and distinguished service of Rolland Wade ``R.W.'' Nelson, who passed away at the age of 98 on April 8, 2025.
Mr. Nelson is part of the Greatest co-founded Kemin Industries, a Des Moines-based human and animal health and nutrition company that employs more than 3,700 people worldwide.
Mr. Johnson deserves recognition for his service to not only our district but also the billions of lives he has around the world his generosity touched.
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1927, Nelson moved to Des Moines at the age of seven.
He graduated from Dowling Catholic High School in 1944 and began studies at Drake University on a football scholarship, before being drafted into military service during World War II.
Nelson served in the United States Army Air Corps from 1945 to 1947, attaining the rank.
He was deployed to the Philippines as a crew chief for B-29 bombers, earning several service ribbons.
After his honorable discharge, Nelson returned to Drake University, earning Bachelor of Arts degrees in biology and chemistry.
In 1953, he married Mary Kelleher, and together they raised five children.
In 1961, with $10,000 in savings, they founded Kemin Industries, operating initially from their living room.
Under Nelson's leadership, Kemin expanded into a global company offering over 500 specialty ingredients across various industries, with a presence in more than 120 countries.
Nelson held four patents and received numerous accolades, including the President's ``E'' Certificate for Exports from President Nixon in 1971 and the President's ``E'' Star Award for Excellence in Export from President Carter in 1978.
He was inducted into the Iowa Business Hall of Fame in 2006.
Beyond his professional achievements 
Mr. Nelson leaves behind a beautiful family, his wife Mary; daughters Elizabeth ``Libby,'' Janet and Molly and another son, David; 13 grandchildren and seven greatgrandchildren.
