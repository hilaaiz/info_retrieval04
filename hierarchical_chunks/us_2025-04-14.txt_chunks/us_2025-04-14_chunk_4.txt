in 1941.
From here, he led efforts to rebuild Jewish life, promoting values of kindness, education, and service to others.
He sent rabbinical students across the country, including to South Dakota, to reach Jews in isolated communities.
His vision led to the Chabad-Lubavitch movement becoming the world's largest Jewish educational organization, now active in all 50 states and 109 countries.
The Rebbe believed education must include ethics and character, not just academics.
His message resonated far beyond his faith, earning him the Congressional Gold Medal and recognition through Education and Sharing Day, proclaimed annually by U.S. Presidents since 1978.
Education and Sharing Day represents an excellent opportunity for us to reflect on the Rebbe's vision and leadership.
May we carry forward the Rebbe's legacy by choosing kindness, living with purpose, and working toward a more compassionate world.
