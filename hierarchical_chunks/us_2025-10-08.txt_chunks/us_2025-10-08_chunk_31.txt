mother, father, sisters, brother, aunts, uncles and cousins were all brutally killed in the Holocaust--105 family members in total.
After the war, as a lone survivor, David fled to Prague and eventually came to America in 1950.
He learned English in only nine weeks and graduated from UCLA with a degree in industrial engineering.
David was a shining spiritual light even though he experienced such horror and despair.
He spent his life sharing his story with others with the hope that it would end the scourges of antisemitism, hate, and violence.
He became a national spokesperson on behalf of survivors, visited schools in 18 states to educate our young people, and remained active and engaged until very recently, having testified before the U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging on the subject Never Again: Addressing the Rise of Antisemitism and Supporting Older Americans.
At home, David co-founded the Holocaust Memorial in Miami Beach that has served as a cornerstone for Holocaust education for South Floridians and visitors from around the world.
This lion in our midst was a relentless and powerful advocate for the Holocaust survivor community and a true Zionist, a supporter of the state of Israel as the rightful homeland of the Jewish people.
He was an icon who used his experiences to teach us all about the perils of antisemitism, so the words ``Never Again'' have meaning.
His work on behalf of survivors was inspiring, and I was proud to call him my friend.
My heart is with David's wife Sydney, his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
May his memory be for a blessing.
