Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kayleigh Bush as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of Distinction award recipient.
In 2025, Kayleigh Bush competed and won the Miss America preliminary title.
Just four weeks after being crowned, she faced a decision that tested her faith, her courage, and her convictions.
Pageant directors presented a newly revised contract that redefined what it means to be female.
Choosing truth over a title, Kayleigh courageously declined to sign.
Following the Matthew 18 model, she privately pleaded with the organization's leaders, urging them to return to truth and biological reality.
Her appeal was met with indifference, but Kayleigh remained steadfast, accepting the loss of her title rather than compromising her faith.
Kayleigh represents a modern-day Esther: one who is willing to speak when the culture demands silence.
Her story reminds us that courage is contagious, truth is not negotiable, and that no earthly crown compares to the one given by Christ.
Her boldness has been recognized nationally.
In 2025, She Leads America is honoring Kayleigh with a Young Christian Woman of Distinction award, celebrating her as a rising leader who demonstrates unwavering faith, integrity, and moral clarity.
This recognition places her among a network of accomplished Christian women leaders who are shaping culture with courage and conviction.
Today, we honor Kayleigh Bush--not just as the Canceled Crown, but as a living testimony of 1 Timothy 4:12: ``Let no one look down on you because of your youth, but be an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.''
