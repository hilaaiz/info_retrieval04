Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 60th anniversary of the Diocese of Brownsville, a community of faith that has for decades served as a spiritual home and source of strength for the people of the Rio Grande Valley.
Since its founding in 1965, the Diocese of Brownsville has grown into one of the most vibrant Catholic dioceses in the nation.

The Diocese has long been a committed voice for justice and compassion in our region.
Its leaders and parishioners have worked tirelessly to support immigrant communities, provide disaster relief, and advocate for the dignity of all people.
This commitment reflects not only the teachings of faith, but also the values of service and solidarity that define the Rio Grande Valley As the Diocese marks its 60th anniversary, it does so with a proud legacy of compassion, inclusivity, and unwavering dedication to the people.
