Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the outstanding service of the Brownsville Police Department during the historic flooding that struck South Texas earlier this year.
In just two days, our community in South Texas was hit with nearly a year's worth of rainfall.
The city of Harlingen was hit especially hard, receiving over twenty inches of rain, which left vehicles stranded, streets flooded, and many residents without power or access to food.
In response to this natural disaster, the Brownsville Police Department answered the call for help.
Partnering with The Salvation Army, they served over 600 hot meals to families in need.
Their swift action and compassion provided critical relief to families struggling in the aftermath of the storm.
Mr. Speaker, this cross-city partnership is a powerful reminder of our region's resilience and commitment to service.
When disaster struck, the Brownsville Police Department stepped up when our community needed them the most, exemplifying the highest standards of service and solidarity.
