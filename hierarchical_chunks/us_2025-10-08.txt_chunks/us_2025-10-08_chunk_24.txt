Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Terri ``WindTalker'' Clah as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman Terri ``WindTalker'' Clah of the Dine (People of the Land) Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe was raised in the Four Corners region on her ancestral lands, immersed in the beauty, resilience, and painful history of her people.
Listening to the elders' stories from a young age--some filled with hope, others scarred by struggle--shaped her deep understanding of cultural identity, spiritual strength, and the need for healing across generations.
Leadership is woven into Terri's heritage.
Her great-uncle, Deshna Clah, served as the second Chairman of the Dine Nation, while her uncle, Peter McDonald, was both a President of the Dine Nation and is one of the last living U.S. Marine Code Talkers.
Inspired by her mother, Bessie Clah, who modeled a life of service, Terri embraced her own path of advocacy and reconciliation.
At age 26, she encountered Jesus Christ, whose message of love and restoration affirmed her Native identity and calling to bridge cultures.
Through her Moccasins Across America Prayer Walk--from California to Washington, DC, May through October 2025--Terri has ignited a national movement for prayer, justice, and healing.
Today, as a She Leads America Christian Woman of Distinction, she continues to inspire others to walk in faith and carry the love of God to the Nation.
