Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the officers and crew of the USS Pierre (LCS 38) as they prepare for the commissioning of their ship, the 19th and final Independencevariant Littoral Combat Ship of the United States Navy.
The USS Pierre is the second Navy vessel to bear the name of South Dakota's capital city.
Littoral combat ships are fast, agile, and mission-focused, built to counter 21st-century coastal threats while ensuring security and supporting joint operations across the globe.
The men and women who serve aboard the USS Pierre will carry forward this mission with dedication and distinction.
For the people of South Dakota, it is a great honor to see the name Navy.
This ship and her crew will continue a proud legacy of service that began with the first USS Pierre during World War II.
