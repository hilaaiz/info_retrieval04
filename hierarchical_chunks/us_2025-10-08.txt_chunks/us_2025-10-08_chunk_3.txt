Mr. NEWHOUSE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Dr. Steven Ashby on his retirement as Director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington.
Since 2015, Dr. Ashby's leadership at PNNL has driven scientific excellence and innovation, advancing the lab as a world leader in science, national security, and energy research and development.
Dr. Ashby believes our biggest challenges cannot be solved alone, and his tenure reflected that belief.
Having spent over a decade working to expand the lab's reach with new partnerships and opportunities, he transformed PNNL from a research lab to a world-class institution held in the highest regards throughout the scientific community.
I also commemorate Dr. Ashby for his work on modernizing PNNL and equipping the lab for the future.
Under his leadership, the campus became a hub for new and emerging technologies, including the Energy Sciences Center and the Grid Storage Launchpad, that will contribute to research and innovation for decades to come.
