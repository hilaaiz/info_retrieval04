Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Ashby for his willingness to work with myself and members of the Washington Congressional Delegation.
We built a strong relationship over the years and worked diligently to ensure PNNL had the resources needed to not only be successful but excel in their mission.
I wish Dr. Ashby the very best in his retirement and thank him for his years of service.
