Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brooke L. Rollins as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of Distinction award recipient.
Brooke L. Rollins is the 33rd U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and only the second woman in history to serve in this role.
A native of Glen Rose, Texas, she brings decades of leadership in law, policy, and public service.
Most recently, she was the Founder, President, and CEO of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI).
During President Trump's first administration, Rollins served as Director of the Domestic Policy Council, Assistant to the President for Strategic Initiatives, and Director of the Office of American Innovation--roles in which she helped develop and lead transformational domestic policy initiatives with lasting national impact.
Her career began in Texas, where after graduating with honors from Texas A&M University and becoming the school's first female student body president, she earned her Juris Doctor from the University of Texas School.
She went on to serve as Governor Rick Perry's policy director and later as CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, transforming it into a nationally recognized think tank.
Guided by her deep Christian faith, Rollins views her work in public policy as a calling to serve people, strengthen families, and uphold biblical values.
She is being honored as a 2025 She Leads America Christian Woman.
