Mr. CROW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize a truly remarkable leader and dedicated public servant, Major General Laura M. Clellan, on the occasion of her retirement as The Adjutant General of Colorado.
For over three decades, Major General Clellan has served our Nation and the State of Colorado with unwavering commitment, integrity, and distinction.
Major General Clellan's exceptional career began in 1989 when she was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant through the Army ROTC program.
Her journey has been one of exemplary leadership and selfless service, marked by numerous key assignments and deployments that have taken her across the globe in defense of our freedoms.
She has answered the call of duty in Afghanistan, Hungary, Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Honduras, leading our troops with courage and compassion.
Her command of the 193rd Military Police Battalion during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan stands as a testament to her leadership under the most demanding of circumstances.
She has consistently demonstrated a profound dedication to the well-being and readiness of our Soldiers and Airmen.
In her most recent role as the 44th Adjutant General of Colorado, Major General Clellan made history as the first woman to hold the position.
She has been a transformative leader for the Colorado National Guard.
Assuming command in 2020, she expertly guided the organization through a period of unprecedented challenges, including the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, devastating wildfires, and floods.
Her steady hand ensured the safety and security of our communities while fostering a climate of excellence and inclusivity.
As Executive Director of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, her strategic vision enhanced not only the readiness of our forces but also the support for our state's veterans.
