If the Government could persuade the Nobel peace prize committee to give the award to Donald Trump on condition that he stops siding with the aggressor against the victim, does the Minister think that American policy might revert to one of NATO deterrence, which prevented world war three for half a century after the end of world war two?
The right hon.
Gentleman, who I know well, will know that that is a matter for the Nobel committee, and not for me.
I do not recognise his characterisation.
We are working closely with the United States, Ukraine and all of our European partners to secure a just and lasting peace for Ukraine.
We are very clear about who is on the side of peace—us—and who is on the side of war: Vladimir Putin.
Members across this House who have been sanctioned by Putin and his flunkies should wear that as a badge of honour.
It indicates just how Putin and his flunkies feel about the prospect of Russian assets being seized.
Will the Minister update the House on the progress made in moving from freezing to seizing Russian assets to strengthen the hand of our brave Ukrainian allies?
I condemn the sanction against the hon.
Lady, and against other colleagues in the House.
We have been very clear that Russia must pay for the damage it is causing in Ukraine and the destruction that it has wrought on the Ukrainian people and industries.
I saw some terrible examples of that when I visited just a few weeks ago.
I have spoken about the importance of the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme and the moneys that are now available to Ukraine.
The Government continue to work closely with allies on the issue that the hon.
Lady references.
I had extensive discussions with my G7 counterparts and others about considering all possible lawful avenues for making Russia pay for the damage it is causing, and we will update the House in due course.
