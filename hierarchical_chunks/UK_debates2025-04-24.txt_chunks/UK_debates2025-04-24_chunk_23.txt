It is probably true to say that a long-held frustration of some Ministers has been turnaround and the pattern of career progression, where people move on after a few years just as they are becoming an absolute expert in their area.
Our ambition is not just to have policy expertise, but to change the way that policy is put together in the first place.
That is why the test-and-learn approach, which we discussed earlier in this session, is so important.
Frankly, the old way of having a group of experts writing a White Paper, throwing it over a wall and hoping it will work first time, just does not work in today’s age.
What we really have to avoid is a two-speed world, with massive innovation in the private sphere and a public sphere working in the same old ways.
We have to avoid that in the interests of the public.
The right hon.
Gentleman talks a good game about scrapping quangos and I support the review he announced to reduce the size of the bureaucratic state.
Why then, despite the rhetoric, are the Government at the same time creating dozens of new quangos?
This is another debate, which has gone on for many years and relates to the question of headcount—Governments can magically reduce headcount by creating a quango somewhere, but the headcount may not have changed at all.
What is informing the drive this time is the fiction that an arm’s length body can somehow absolve Ministers of responsibility.
It does not work like that in the real world.
Sometimes there is a good case for having an arm’s length body, but in the end, we know that accountability will be with Ministers, and that is what is informing how we look at these things at the moment.
