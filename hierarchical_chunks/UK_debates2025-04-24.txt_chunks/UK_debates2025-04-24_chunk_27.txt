I thank the Minister for his answer to the earlier question.
Events such as Tartan Day provide a vital opportunity for companies such as RSE in Cumbernauld to promote their products to international markets.
RSE has repeatedly told me that it wants to be a part of Brand Scotland.
Will the Minister outline how he will work with the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government to ensure that Tartan Day is an even bigger success next year to secure investment in the Scottish economy and create Scottish jobs?
