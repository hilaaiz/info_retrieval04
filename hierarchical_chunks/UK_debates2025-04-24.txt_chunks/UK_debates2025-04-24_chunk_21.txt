I hope to continue the positive cross-party approach to this question.
I particularly like the Minister’s commitment  to a clear data picture.
The Sullivan review into Government data was published in March this year, and Professor Sullivan made 59 recommendations to ensure that across Government accuracy and consistency are maintained.
I do not expect the Minister to have a full formal response to that review today.
However, can she reassure me that the Government will issue a full formal response to the review and its recommendations to provide that clear data across Government within, say, a year of the report’s publication?
I appreciate this collegiate style of discussion.
There is a huge amount to do here.
When we came into power, we set out, as I said, a review of the picture that showed just how hard it is for citizens to negotiate.
When moving home, one has to announce it to 10 different organisations using different public services, sometimes 40 different services, so we need to change.
We have not waited for the review.
We have already set out our own plans, but we will of course respond to external reviews that come forward.
What steps he is taking to reform the civil service.
Let me thank the thousands of diligent and hard-working civil servants who are dedicated to making people’s lives better.
We want to get the best for civil servants and out of civil servants, so we are reforming the structure and the focus so that it is better placed to fulfil that purpose.
That includes a number of important steps in recent weeks: robust performance management; better use of digital tools; faster recruitment; cuts to some wasteful spending; and a review of the arms-length body landscape, including the changes announced on NHS England, to return both power and responsibility to elected representatives.
