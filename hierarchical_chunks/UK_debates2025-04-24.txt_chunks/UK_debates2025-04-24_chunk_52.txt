We certainly have had those conversations, and we have them regularly.
I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point.
The Minister for the Armed Forces is here with me; we regularly discuss these issues.
I am sure all that will be considered as part of the strategic defence review.
My hon.
Friend rightly points out the efforts we are making to deny Russia any  of the nefarious means it uses to prosecute its horrendous war in Ukraine.
We have taken very specific action on some of those matters today, and we will continue to consider further measures.
