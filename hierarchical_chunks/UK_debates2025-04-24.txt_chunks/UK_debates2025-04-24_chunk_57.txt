I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman’s support on Ukraine, but again, I do not share his characterisation of the United States’ position.
We share President Trump’s desire to bring this barbaric war to an end, and we are working closely with the US and other international partners to secure a just and lasting peace.
As I have said, it is very clear to us that President Zelensky and Ukraine are demonstrating and have demonstrated a clear commitment to peace, including through their participation yesterday alongside the US and our European partners.
We know who the real obstacle to peace is: Vladimir Putin.
