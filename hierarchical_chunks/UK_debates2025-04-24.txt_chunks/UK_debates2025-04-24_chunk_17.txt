I thank the hon.
Member for his question, and I am sure he would like to join me in praising the Deputy Prime Minister and her team for their hard work on this.
A lot of the rubbish has been cleared, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all the staff in Birmingham and across Departments who have played a key role in responding quickly to and dealing tirelessly with this matter.
