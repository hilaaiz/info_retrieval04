I thank my hon.
Friend for his support, and he rightly references Ukrainian communities across the United Kingdom.
I have met the Ukrainian community in my constituency, and just this week I met Ukrainian community members to discuss a range of issues, including the horrific abduction of children, which Russia has continued to perpetrate, one of the most shocking and heinous aspects of this conflict.
I am really proud of what British communities have done across the country to support Ukrainians, and the strong ties that have been built.
It is fantastic that we have signed a 100-year partnership, so that for 100 years into the future, we have that relationship and give  that iron-clad support on every level—economically, diplomatically, militarily, and of course through crucial people-to-people links.
