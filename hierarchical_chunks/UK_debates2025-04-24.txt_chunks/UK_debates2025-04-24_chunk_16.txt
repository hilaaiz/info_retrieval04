I would like to turn to the sorry state of Labour-run Birmingham, where rats the size of dachshunds are terrifying local residents.
Indeed, in The Daily Telegraph this morning, we read that “Birmingham city council warns of a surge in rat-borne diseases…that the elderly, disabled people and babies are ‘particularly susceptible’ to”.
The Government have had emergency powers throughout this crisis, not least the Civil Contingencies Act 2004.
Will the Minister set out for the House why they have declined to use them?
