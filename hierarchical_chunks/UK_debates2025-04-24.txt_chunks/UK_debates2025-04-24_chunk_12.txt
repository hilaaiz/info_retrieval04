While I was a police and crime commissioner, I saw many of the things that have been referred to by hon.
Members as critically important for emergency resilience planning across the public sector and working with the private sector.
To ensure that that is all targeted in the right way, it is key to make sure that all the different agencies, public bodies and companies have a shared understanding of the risks that we face as a country, and receive the latest updates on those.
Can the Minister tell the House when the Government will next update the national risk register, and explain what plans Ministers have for the frequency with which those updates will be published?
