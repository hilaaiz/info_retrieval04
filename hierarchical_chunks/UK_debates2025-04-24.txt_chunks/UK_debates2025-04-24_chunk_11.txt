I thank my hon.
Friend for her important question.
The Government recognise the importance of local resilience forums and the role they play in boosting resilience in places and communities.
I hope she feels reassured that I have met all local resilience forums across England to discuss their concerns, and I have also met businesses to talk about the importance of local resilience.
We will continue to work closely with local resilience forums, including Northumbria LRF in her local area, to plan and prepare for a broad range of risks, including pandemics.
