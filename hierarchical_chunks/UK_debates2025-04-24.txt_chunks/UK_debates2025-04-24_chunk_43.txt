I thank the right hon.
Lady for her questions and for her continued support and unity on these issues.
It is crucial that we send a signal not only to our friends in Ukraine but to Putin—that this House will not be divided on these issues.
We are united in our support for Ukraine, and I can reassure her of our absolute commitment to Ukraine.
Indeed, there has been extensive ministerial contact over recent weeks.
I met Minister Sybiha in Turkey a week or so ago, and the Foreign Secretary was with him yesterday.
Contact remains at every level.
