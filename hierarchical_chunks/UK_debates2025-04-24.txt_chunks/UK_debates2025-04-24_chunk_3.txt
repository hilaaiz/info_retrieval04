I thank the Minister for his response.
I have been contacted by a constituent who is concerned for his poorly elderly father, who requires cryotherapy.
That service used to be offered at his local GP, avoiding a difficult trip to our local hospital, which would have a deleterious impact on his father’s already poor health.
Given the Government’s focus on moving more health services into the community and people’s homes as part of our public service reform agenda, does my right hon.
Friend agree that cryotherapy services should be considered as part of that welcome shift?
