In the last few weeks, Dorset has been ravaged by wildfires, especially Upton heath and Canford heath in my local area, where more than 130 acres are gone.
I was blown away by the work of the fire crews from Dorset, Wiltshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.
Will the Minister thank the fire services for their combined work, but also acknowledge that there needs to be a review of funding for emergency services to ensure that they are consistently able to protect us in the face of climate change?
I ask her for that assurance.
