The Minister will be aware of last week’s historic UK Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman being based on biological sex, which provided important legal clarity.
It is critical now that the UK and Scottish Governments work in a co-ordinated manner to ensure that the practical impacts are understood.
How does the Minister plan to ensure that this co-ordinated approach delivers for women in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, and does he agree that the ruling must be a lesson for the SNP Government to stop wasting Scottish taxpayers’ money on flawed legislation and court cases?
The ruling upholds the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex and brings welcome clarity and confidence for women and, indeed, service providers.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission, as Britain’s equality regulator, has already committed to supporting service providers with updated guidance.
On the specific point raised by my hon.
Friend, we will meet Scottish counterparts to discuss the implications of this significant judgment.
