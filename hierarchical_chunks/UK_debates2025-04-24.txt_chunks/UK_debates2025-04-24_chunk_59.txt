I welcome the UK Government’s recent commitment to strengthening their energy partnership with Ukraine, which is crucial for Europe’s energy independence.
I recently visited Urenco’s Capenhurst site, where an advanced nuclear fuels facility is being developed—a market that is currently dominated by Russia.
Could the Minister outline how the UK Government are advancing this technology and what it means for the UK’s energy partnership with Ukraine?
