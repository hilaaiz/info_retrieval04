I thank the hon.
Member for his work in this space, because I know he has done a lot of work on this issue.
We are constantly looking at the risk register and updating it, and a lot of work has been done.
Alongside that, we are carrying out a resilience review.
As he rightly pointed out, we need to work across a wide range of sectors to make sure that wider society plays a greater role in this matter, and the work that I have been doing has involved meeting businesses, voluntary organisations and vulnerable groups to make sure that the issues are reflected.
We will make sure that we share the lessons learned with the House in due course, and I have also engaged with parliamentarians on this issue.
