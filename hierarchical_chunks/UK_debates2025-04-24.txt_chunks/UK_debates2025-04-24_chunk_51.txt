I thank the Minister for his statement.
I also thank  the right hon.
Member for Witham (Priti Patel)  for her statement, because it is important that this House speaks with one voice on this really important issue.
On Tuesday, I asked a question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the changing nature of warfare.
The Minister raised the terrible image of controllers for computer game systems being used as weapons.
Has he had conversations with NATO partners and allies about the changing nature of warfare, and will that be fed into the strategic defence review?
