Friend is a great champion for the people of Dartford.
Fixing Britain’s creaking infrastructure is vital for our growth mission and plan for change.
We are reforming our planning rules to cut through blockages to delivering infrastructure and to help meet our target of 150 planning decisions by the end of this Parliament.
The Government are committed  to working with the private sector to deliver the lower Thames crossing.
As well as creating jobs, it will reduce congestion and drive economic growth by improving connectivity between Kent and Essex.
As the Minister is undoubtedly aware, part of the plan for change is kick-starting economic growth.
Prior to the recess, the Secretary of State for Transport advised me in relation to her statement about electric vehicle charging that the Cabinet Office is responsible for EU reset negotiations.
What assessment has the Cabinet Office made of the cost of the UK not being in a customs union with the EU?
