I thank my hon.
Friend for her powerful points, and I condemn the sanction against her.
She is right to raise the issue of the stolen children.
I discussed the matter a short while ago with the Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister and representatives of the different campaigns on the issue.
This is a personal priority for the Foreign Secretary and me.
It is one of the most heinous and horrific aspects of the conflict, not only for those children and their families, but because it speaks to a wider attempt by Putin to subjugate the people, identity, culture, language and future of Ukraine.
That should be clear for all to see.
One of the most powerful reminders of that is a picture that I have in my office painted by one of the children, who was thankfully  returned, but sadly there are still far too many children who have been taken by Russia.
I look forward to working with my hon.
Friend on this important issue, and I am very happy to discuss the event that she suggested.
