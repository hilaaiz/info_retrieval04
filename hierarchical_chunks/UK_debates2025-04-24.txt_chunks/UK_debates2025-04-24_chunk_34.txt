I thank the Minister for her answer.
It is a really impressive catalogue of achievement in the early months of the Government.
Can the Minister set out more specific detail for my constituents and the House on big infrastructure projects such as the lower Thames crossing?
I am delighted that the Government have now given consent to it, and Dartford residents are delighted too.
How can these big infrastructure projects not only kick-start economic growth but provide jobs, skills and opportunities for residents in Dartford and across the Thames estuary?
