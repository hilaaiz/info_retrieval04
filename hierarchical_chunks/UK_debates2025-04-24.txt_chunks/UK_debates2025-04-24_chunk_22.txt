I thank the Minister for his response and I am perfectly happy to accept the diligence of the civil service.
Regardless, every two years a third of the civil service change their Department and countless more change to unrelated policy roles within each Department.
Under the previous Government, policy expertise was completely hollowed out from the civil service.
Will the Minister set out how we intend to resolve that to bring policy expertise back into the civil service and ensure we have Government teams capable of delivering for Britain?
