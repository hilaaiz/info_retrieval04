I thank the Minister for her reply and for the excellent work she has done in putting together the procurement strategy.
It has been a passion of mine for many years that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value, which will help local firms and local growth.
That is what this statement does, and I hugely welcome it.
May I ask the Minister whether she intends to issue guidance to local authorities so that they know how best they can achieve economic value?
For example, they could proactively tell small firms what contracts are coming up or train them in how to tender, which is very difficult for them.
The Government could also encourage local authorities to break procurement into lots, so that small firms have a better chance of bidding.
Finally, local authorities could stop requiring an unreasonable number of years of accounts to be shown before small firms are permitted to bid.
