The Health Secretary has talked about three big shifts that are part of the 10-year NHS plan.
One of those shifts is from hospital to the community, which will require more services to be available locally.
We have agreed a new GP contract, which will see a large boost to general practitioner funding, alongside reforms to improve digital access.
If we are going to make this shift, it is important that services are available in the local community.
The Government’s laudable mission-led approach has seen NHS waiting lists fall for five months in a row.
Like many public services, our NHS has been plagued by over-specified guidance and unnecessary targets for many years, so will the Minister assure the House that the mission-led approach will mean a focus on core non-negotiables to deliver for the British people?
The missions set out the Government’s long-term targets, and the plan for change sets out the key targets for the next few years.
I do believe that targets can play a key role in driving behaviour, and that the focus on getting waiting lists and waiting times down set out in our plan for change can make a real difference over the coming few years.
