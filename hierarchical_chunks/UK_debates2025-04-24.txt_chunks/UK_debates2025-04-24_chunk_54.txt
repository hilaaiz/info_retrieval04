I point my hon.
Friend to the important 100-year partnership that we signed.
Engagement at every level between civil society and people in every community is crucial.
I know that there are very important twinning arrangements between cities and communities across the UK, and we look forward to strengthening those, and working with those communities.
I met Ukrainian civil society organisations in Kyiv just a few weeks ago, and I regularly meet organisations here in the UK.
If all of us across this House can create more links, that will give true strength for the future to the foundation on which that partnership is built.
