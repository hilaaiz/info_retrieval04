I thank the Minister very much for his answers to those questions.
The reform of public services is important, and I welcome the ideas he has put forward.
I know he has a deep interest in Northern Ireland.
Is it possible on his journeys to Northern Ireland—I understand that he goes regularly —for him to discuss the reform of public services with the Northern Ireland Assembly and the relevant Minister to ensure that we can have the same benefits that come from what he is putting forward today, thereby improving services and saving money at the same time?
