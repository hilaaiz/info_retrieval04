Glenn.
Russell loved his blended family and was a doting grandfather to grandchildren Russell J. Scott, III, Marissa D. Morgan and Rysen Jai Scott, along with several bonus grandchildren.
On a personal note, Russell Scott was a dear friend to my wife, Vivian, and me for many years.
He was my Brother in the Bond of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. and truly exemplified our motto of Phi Nu Pi.
During his life, he did so much for so many for so long.
Truly, we and the world are better because of him.
