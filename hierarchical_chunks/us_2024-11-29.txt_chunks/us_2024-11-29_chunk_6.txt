Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join Vivian and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, in honoring the life and legacy of Captain (Ret.)
Russell James Scott, Sr. and in extending our deepest sympathy to his family, friends, fraternity brothers and all who mourn his loss.
We pray that all will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
