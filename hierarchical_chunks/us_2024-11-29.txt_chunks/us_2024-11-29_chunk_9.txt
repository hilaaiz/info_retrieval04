Representative.
Her service to our district over the last decade has been defined by her ability to connect with constituents and resolve their issues that have earned her deep respect from both her colleagues and her community.
Over the course of her tenure, Rebecca personally handled 2,868 cases for our constituents and helped recoup $4,734,703.82 for our district.
Rebecca's fluency in Spanish and her understanding of Sonoma County's Latino population has made her an invaluable advocate, particularly for constituents navigating complex immigration issues, DACA renewals, and access to government services.
With her recent election to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, Rebecca has made history becoming the first Latina to serve on the board.
She steps into this role at a pivotal time, representing our First District, which includes a significant portion of Sonoma County's Latino community.
Rebecca's priorities include expanding access to county services, offering evening office hours at the new County Services Center, and bridging gaps in representation for residents in unincorporated areas like The Springs.
