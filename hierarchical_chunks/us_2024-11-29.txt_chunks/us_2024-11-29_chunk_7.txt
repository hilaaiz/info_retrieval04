Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my Senior District Representative, Rebecca Hermosillo, as she embarks on a new chapter of public service.
Rebecca has made history as the first Latina elected to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, and I have no doubt she will continue to serve our community with the same tenacity, compassion, and dedication that have defined her career.
Born to Mexican immigrants in the Sonoma Valley, Rebecca was raised on the Leveroni Dairy.
As the youngest of seven children, Rebecca learned early on the values of hard work and determination.
Her parents, Camilo and Maria, instilled in her a deep respect for her heritage, as well as a sense of responsibility for her community.
After becoming a mother at a young age, Rebecca was determined to complete her education.
She earned her GED in 1991, becoming the first in her family to graduate from college, achieving a bachelor's degree in public administration from Park University.
Rebecca's commitment to community service then began with her role as Executive Director of the Valley of the Moon Teen Center, where she provided a safe and supportive space for at-risk youth.
Under her leadership, the center created innovative programs like ``Outdoors to Excellence,'' ``Skills for Life,'' and ``Lovin' Oven,'' all designed to help teens develop practical skills, foster confidence, and cultivate a sense of belonging.
Her dedication to our teens of Sonoma Valley, and her hands-on approach, made a lasting difference in the lives of countless young people.
In 2013, Rebecca joined my team, beginning as a Constituent Services
