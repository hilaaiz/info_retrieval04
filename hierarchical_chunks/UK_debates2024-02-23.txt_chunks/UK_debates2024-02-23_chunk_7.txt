I thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Woking for bringing clarity to the industry as a whole.
As he has mentioned, where we had a “may” we will now have a “must”.
That is always important so that industry knows what it is doing.
Members may not know that Cornwall has more than 150 business involved in the space industry,  and 35 local and national partners.
In 2023, 1,300 people in Cornwall were employed in the space industry, which was worth about £88 million; by 2030, we expect more than 3,000 people to be employed in it, with a potential value of £1 billion.
