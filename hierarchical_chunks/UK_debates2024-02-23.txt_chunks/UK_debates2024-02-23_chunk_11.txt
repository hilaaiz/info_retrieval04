I thank my hon.
Friend for allowing me to intervene, especially given that I have just rambled on for who knows how long.
One thing I did not mention that he might be interested in is the defence sector.
Again, when I visited Goonhilly, there was a huge amount going on there.
We talk about our maritime fleet being bothered by the Russians and the Chinese on a daily basis, but our satellites and space are as well.
It is hugely important that we are at the forefront of this.
Does he agree?
