I thank the hon.
Member for Caerphilly for seizing the moment to introduce a private Member’s Bill.
This is an opportune time to build on what we have done so far, and to make it more comprehensive.

The purpose of this Bill is to tackle such behaviour.
If the behaviour looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s a SLAPP.

Sorry, that is rather clumsy English.
I am sure Hansard will correct me.
