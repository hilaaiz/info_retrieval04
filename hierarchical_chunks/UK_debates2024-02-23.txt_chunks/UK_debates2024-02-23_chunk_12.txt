My hon.
Friend is entirely correct.
Like me, she has been on the armed forces parliamentary scheme.
I was restraining myself from mentioning Culdrose when she was giving her excellent speech, but of course I have now done it.
Our defence sector is incredibly important.
Again, we are making this stuff here at BAE Systems and Airbus, and defence manufacturers in this country create jobs and opportunities.
That is hugely important, and I am absolutely delighted to support the Bill.
I love its technical merits.
My hon.
Friend the Member for Woking has played an absolute blinder in doing something quite sensible.
I will give a lived example because, quite frankly, the Empire would not have been able to build the second Death Star if it had been on the hook for the price of the first one.
My hon.
Friend has stuck the landing.
I congratulate him and look forward to supporting  the Bill.
