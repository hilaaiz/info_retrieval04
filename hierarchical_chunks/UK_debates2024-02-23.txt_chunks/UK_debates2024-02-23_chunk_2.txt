This could be quite a big day for the Welsh, with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)  introducing his Bill and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Newport West (Ruth Jones)  introducing hers later, I hope.
I also hope to move from the Front Bench to the Back Benches to introduce my own Bill later in proceedings, so that is three Welsh Bills this morning.
Of course, on the Front Bench we also have my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mark Tami)  from the Opposition Whips Office, so it really is a big morning for the Welsh.
My hon.
Friend the Member for Caerphilly and I came into the House together in 2001—it is hard to think that that is nearly 23 years ago.
I congratulate him on his first outing in all that time promoting a private Member’s Bill this morning.
I am glad he was successful in the ballot, as it is an important Bill.
For years, strategic lawsuits have enabled the wealthy and powerful to weaponise their wealth to sue critics into silence.
As hon.
Members have said, it is important that this House votes to put an end to these tactics that gag the press and intimidate people asking legitimate questions by threatening them with enormous legal costs—lawfare, as it has been referred to today.
