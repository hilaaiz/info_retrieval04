I thank those who have participated in the debate: my hon.
Friends the Members for Poplar and Limehouse (Apsana Begum) and for Hammersmith (Andy Slaughter), and the hon.
Members for Heywood and Middleton (Chris Clarkson) and for West Bromwich East (Nicola Richards).
They all spoke extremely effectively in support of the Bill, but also raised appropriate questions about how it should proceed in Committee.
I am pleased that the Bill has cross-party support, and I understand the Government are in full support of it.
I can confirm that it has the support of those on the Labour Front Bench as well.
