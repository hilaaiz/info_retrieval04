Ms. MOORE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 9580, to name a post office in North Carolina after Millie Dunn Veasey.
As has been noted, she was one of the 855 women from across our country who would serve with the historic Women Army Corps 6888, Central Postal Battalion (Six Triple Eight) during World War II.
The Six Triple Eight was the only African American Women's Army Corps Battalion unit deployed overseas during WWII.
Their efforts to resolve a monumental months long backlog of millions of pieces of mail played a critical role in maintaining morale for those fighting in the European Theater.
In England and then France, they sorted millions of pieces of mail while facing challenging social and war conditions.
They not only completed their mission but did so in record time.
Each of these women have their own individual stories but many of them are similar to 
Ms. Veasey's.
A desire to serve their country.
They didn't set out to make history but they did so anyway.
They served their country honorably and extraordinarily.
And came home with little fanfare or ceremony, which they did not mind.
And many, like 
Ms. Veasey, continued to contribute to their communities after they came home.
I am pleased that we are recognizing these women and that this story will help ensure that 
Ms. Veasey's service and dedication is remembered in her local community.
A few years ago, I was pleased to spearhead a successful effort in Congress, along with 
Senator Moran, to award the Six Triple Eight with the Congressional Gold Medal so that their service cannot only be appropriately acknowledged but remembered across our Nation.
