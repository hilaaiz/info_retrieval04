Mr. PHILLIPS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Director of Scheduling and Operations, Mae Hougo, for her work on behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
I could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
Mae was raised in Minnesota and graduated from Cretin-Derham Hall.
She ventured off to attend the College of Holy Cross where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Government.
Mae's passion for politics led her to many interesting and informative experiences that ranged from City Hall in Saint Paul, the Minnesota State Capitol, and Washington, D.C.
Her experience of both campaigns and official side work have been invaluable.
Mae has worked as a political scheduler for over five years in Minnesota.
Her unofficial title is the ``keeper of space and time.''
From busy session weeks, to packed August recesses, if things were going smoothly for my team and me, it was due to Mae's tireless work.
Her foresight and creative thinking in a pinch saved each of us from more than our fair share of mishaps.
Her colleagues will always remember Mae's organized and strategic thinking.
Mae is dependable, determined, fiercely passionate about the work, and incredibly hardworking.
Mae has grown her role immensely during her tenure in this office-- she began her time with us as District Scheduler and ended it as Director of Scheduling and Operations, overseeing the scheduling process in both Minnesota and Washington, D.C. Mae's sound judgment and critical thinking have led her to become a trusted advisor to me.
Her talent combined with her heart for the work have made her an invaluable part of this team.
The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to have her dedication and leadership, and she will be dearly missed.
I wish Mae all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for five years of faithful service to this Nation in my office.
