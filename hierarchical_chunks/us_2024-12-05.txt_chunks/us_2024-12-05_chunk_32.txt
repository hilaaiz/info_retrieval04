Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House's attention today to recognize the 70th birthday.
Gerald was born to Emma Lois and Toby Lee Morris on December 4, 1954, in Anniston, Alabama.
He is one of six children.
He graduated from Saks High School in 1972.
On February 22, 1985, Gerald married Waltina Morris.
They were blessed with five children and seven grandchildren.
Gerald was inspired by his uncle, Edgar Morris, who was a tailor.
He had his shop in downtown Anniston.
Gerald worked at a men's clothing store named Phil's Men's Store and began doing alterations for customers there.
He attended trade school and opened his own shop in downtown Anniston named Morris Alterations in 1981.
As life would have it, his son was able to open a men's clothing store right across the street from his own storefront.
Two of Gerald's daughters work alongside him daily.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Mr. Morris switched gears at the shop and began making a variety of popular masks that sold from Alabama to Connecticut.
After the pandemic, work was busier than ever as people went back to their social engagements, proms and weddings, they needed his artful craft to make their clothing perfect for them.
Gerald has been in business for almost 44 years and attributes his success to all of his hard work and loyal customers.
He has no plans of retiring.
Gerald and his store are a fixture of downtown Anniston and Gerald gives back to his community by helping local schools.
The Morris family attends New Jerusalem AFM Church.
