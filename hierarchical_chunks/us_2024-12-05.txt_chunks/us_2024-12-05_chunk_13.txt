Mr. FINSTAD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Minnesota House 
Representative Brian Pfarr.
First elected in 2020 to represent then-District 20A, 
Representative Pfarr has served the people of southern Minnesota in the State House for the past four years, most recently as the representative for District 22B.
Prior to his service in the State Legislature, 
Representative Pfarr honorably served our state as a colonel in the Minnesota Army National Guard.
Since his retirement in 2021, he has brought the same tireless work ethic to representing the people of Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Rice, and Scott counties.
The priorities of his constituents have always been at the forefront of 
Representative Pfarr's service in the State House, particularly through his continued leadership in the many House committees on which he has served throughout the years, including Ways and Means and Commerce Finance and Policy.
