In addition to her many professional talents, Sam is a genuine and thoughtful human, pottery aficionado, gluten-free bread enthusiast, and we're all better for having served alongside her.
The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to have her dedication and leadership, and she is dearly missed.
However, I'm extraordinarily happy that she will continue to do this work and serve the Nation and the people Minnesota at the Minnesota Department her for six years of faithful service to this Nation.
