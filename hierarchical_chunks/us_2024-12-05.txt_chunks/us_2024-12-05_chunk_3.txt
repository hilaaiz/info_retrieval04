Hoosiers I have the privilege of representing in Congress.
Earlier this month, some friends, family, and other members of the Milford community came together to throw a surprise celebration for Inez, which was a fitting testament to such a special, memorable, and impressive milestone.
As she reflects on more than a century of life well lived, Inez is full of gratitude to God for the many blessings he has bestowed on her.
Especially around this time of year, embracing the disposition of gratitude that Inez embodies is something that our Nation could use a lot more of.
Inez also credits her long life in part to trying to always be an optimist about everything, as well as being content and happy with what you have.
This mindset has clearly worked, and it is a refreshening antidote to the culture of despair and restlessness that we all too often witness.
As she celebrates more than a century of life lived to the fullest, I join her family, including her three children, seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren, and many other Hoosiers in wishing Inez Beiswanger a very happy 105th birthday.
