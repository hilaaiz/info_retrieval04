Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
Mr. Steve Yeakel, who is retiring as President and CEO of the Virginia Association of Community Banks (VACB) after 13 years of distinguished service to Virginia's community banking industry.
Throughout his tenure, 
Mr. Yeakel has been an unwavering advocate for Virginia's community banks, which serve as the economic backbone of our local communities.
Under his leadership, VACB has grown to represent more than 100 community banks and vendor partners, providing essential financial services to families and businesses across the great Commonwealth.
Mr. Yeakel's commitment to excellence was recognized by his peers when he received the 2021 CEO Award of Excellence by from the Virginia Society.
His leadership style, emphasizing relationship-building and collaborative problem-solving, has strengthened the voice of community banking in both Richmond and Washington.
During his stewardship, VACB successfully navigated serious challenges in the industry, from regulatory changes to technological transformation.
Mr. Yeakel has been able to achieve such impressive accomplishments particularly due to his ability to foster productive dialogue between VACB members and Congressional delegations over the years.
