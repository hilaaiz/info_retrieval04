Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing 
Mr. Yeakel's significant contributions to Virginia's banking industry and the communities it serves.
His legacy of leadership, advocacy, and service will continue to benefit Virginians for years to come.
I wish him and his family all the best in his well-deserved retirement.
