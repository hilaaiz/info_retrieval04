Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the public service of Dan McCorquodale of San Jose, California.
From 1953 to 1956, McCorquodale was a Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps.
After graduating from college, he served as a public school teacher in Chula Vista, California.
In 1964, he became the youngest person ever elected to the City Council in Chula Vista, where he served as Mayor from 1968 to 1969.
After moving to San Jose, McCorquodale spent a year walking precincts in the third district and was elected to three terms representing north and east San Jose, a portion of the City of Santa Clara, and the cities of Milpitas and Sunnyvale.
During his three terms on the Board, he distinguished himself in the issues of environmental protection, transportation, water reclamation, parks, justice, and health and human services.
In 1982, McCorquodale was elected State 
Senator of the 12th district.
Throughout his political career, he was recognized for his effective policymaking.
In 1986, he was recognized as Legislator of the Year by the California Trial Lawyers Association.
In 1987, he was awarded Humanitarian of the Year by the Humane Society.
In 1988, the California Planning and Conservation League named him Legislator of the Year and in 1991, the National Organization for Women recognized him as their Legislator of the Year.
In 1991, the California Governor's Committee for Employment of Disabled Persons named him Elected Official of the Year and in 1992, he was named Legislator of the Year by the California Park and Recreation Society.
It has been my great pleasure to work with Dan throughout the years and I honor and thank him for his years in public service and wish him the best.
