Mr. FULCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Lloyd B. Plummer a very happy 100th birthday, who will be celebrating his milestone on December 15, 2024.
In 1943, Plummer, the recipient of two Purple Hearts, joined the Army among many courageous men to serve our country.
His heroic efforts will never be forgotten.
For those who may not know Lloyd, he was one of the first brave Americans to serve as a paratrooper during World War II, as a member of the 509th Infantry Regiment.
Throughout the war, the Fighting 509 was assigned to numerous operations, many of which are now recognized as suicide missions.
Lloyd was faced with many battles, where he suffered from frostbite, trench foot, burns, and shrapnel.
At all times, he was ready to put his body on the line to serve the country he loved.
He is the true definition of a patriot, willing to sacrifice his life for our country.
In 1945, he was discharged from active duty in the Army and returned to Idaho.
Lloyd and his family have consistently embodied the traditional values we cherish in Idaho.
I thank Lloyd B. Plummer for his unwavering heroic efforts, and I wish him a very happy birthday.
