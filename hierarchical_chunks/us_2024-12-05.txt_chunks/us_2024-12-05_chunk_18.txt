Representative Garofalo has done an exemplary job representing his constituents in Dakota, Goodhue, and Rice counties for the past two decades, and I consider it a true honor to have previously served alongside him in the Minnesota State Legislature.
I am grateful for 
Representative Garofalo's years of dedicated public service to southern Minnesota, and I wish him the warmest congratulations on his retirement.
