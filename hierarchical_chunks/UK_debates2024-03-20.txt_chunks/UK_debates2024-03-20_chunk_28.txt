The Prime Minister will be aware of plans by National Grid to build a network of 50-metre-high pylons through much of rural Lincolnshire.
This is causing much consternation, particularly in rural villages.
Can my right hon.
Friend assure my residents that when Ministers finally consider the consultations that come forward from National Grid, they will give sympathetic consideration to putting some of the sections underground?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to raise the concerns of his constituents.
He will recognise the balance we need to strike by making sure that we give our country the energy security it needs but doing it in a way that is respectful of the impact on local communities.
I will make sure that Ministers take into account the concerns he raised and that all the views of local constituents are taken into account.
Given that the Prime Minister’s and his Government’s days are numbered and that they will soon be in opposition, will he use the small amount of time available to him to join 138 United Nations member states in recognising the state of Palestine?
Our position has been consistently clear.
We will recognise the state of Palestine when it makes the most beneficial sense for the overall peace process.
Of course we are committed to an ultimate two-state solution, but in the here and now what we are calling for is an immediate, sustained humanitarian pause that would allow for the safe release of hostages, including British nationals, and would allow more aid to reach Gaza.
We urge all sides to seize the opportunity, and continue negotiations to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
(Urgent Question): To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a statement on the Government’s decision to close the HMRC self-assessment helpline every year between April and September.
You have good news, Minister.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
