I thank  the right hon.
Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)  for securing the urgent   question.
Let me try to get some answers from the Government about a response to what communist China has done, and critically what we can do in the UK about Confucius Institutes.
Back in May 2022, the Open University bragged about being the first online Confucius Institute.
Until 2023, the Government were allocating at least £27 million to Mandarin-language teaching, channelled through university-based Confucius Institutes.
Will the Minister confirm that that has stopped?
There is some confusion about that.
