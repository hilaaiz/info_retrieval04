I thank my hon.
Friend and the Select Committee for their work in this area.
I know that HMRC customer service has been an area of focus   for her and others for some time, and we appreciate the input.
I recognise that she acknowledges the potential opportunities and the upside to encouraging more people to go online, but the point she makes is really important.
HMRC has taken the feedback with good grace, because it is important that we move at the speed at which the public are willing to move.
Of course, some people are not willing or able to move to purely online services.
