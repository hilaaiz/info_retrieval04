I thank my right hon.
Friend for his urgent question.
Yesterday, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed new national security legislation unanimously under article 23 of the Basic Law.
The Bill, which rushed through the legislative process, and is likely incompatible with international human rights law, will come into force on Saturday.
Since 2020, we have seen Hongkongers’ rights and freedoms deliberately eroded as a result of the Beijing-imposed national security law, and this law continues that pattern.
