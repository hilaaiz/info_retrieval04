I thank the Prime Minister for his words in welcoming Vaughan Gething to his post as First Minister of Wales.
As the first black leader of any European Government, it is a historic moment that speaks to the progress and values of modern-day Wales.
I also pay tribute to Mark Drakeford for his long, steady service in Wales.
