The right hon.
Gentleman asks me about the view of the Foreign Secretary, given his long career and understanding of China from his time as Prime Minister.
The Foreign Secretary has spoken out very clearly on the change that has taken place since he was Prime Minister.
The right hon.
Gentleman asks me whether the legislation is a breach of the Sino-British joint declaration; as I have said, we decided in 2021 that China was in ongoing breach of that.
On the issue of whether it is a breach of international law, the Bill specifically says that it will be compliant with international law.
I suspect that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.
The shadow Foreign Secretary slightly stole my script about the “golden era” of Sino-British relations trumpeted by then Prime Minister Cameron.
While the Minister says that things have changed since then, one thing has not changed: communist China was a totalitarian state then, and it is a totalitarian state now.
Is it not about time that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office learned that lesson?
My right hon.
Friend speaks with great experience on these matters from his time on the Intelligence and Security Committee.
I agree with him about the nature of China.
The question was whether China would respect the Sino-British joint declaration and recognise the uniquely brilliant features of Hong Kong as an international trading city.
It is a matter of great regret that politics have trumped economics in that respect, as perhaps it always will in the case of China.
