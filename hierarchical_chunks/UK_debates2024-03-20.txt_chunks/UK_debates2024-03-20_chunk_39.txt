I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
I reiterate that there is a very good reason why HMRC’s structure and relationship with Government is as it is, because it would be inappropriate for Ministers to interfere with individual tax affairs.
However, I would be more than happy to raise his point with HMRC and respectfully ask that it pays it due attention.
Of course, the Government set broader policy.
