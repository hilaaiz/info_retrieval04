Hong Kong’s new national security law is the latest degradation of the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong.
It is causing fear and unease not only to Hongkongers, but to UK and other foreign nationals living and working in Hong Kong, as well as international businesses and organisations operating there, and many outside Hong Kong.
Article 23’s provisions apply to Hong Kong residents and businesses anywhere in the UK.
We have seen where that can lead; there was the frankly appalling attack on a protester in Manchester in December 2022.
What steps are the UK Government taking to counter the threat of transnational repression, especially towards the 160,000 Hongkongers who have come to the UK via the British national overseas passport route?
Many will feel unsafe and unprotected, and are denied access even to their own  pensions.
I ask on their behalf, does the Minister accept that the law not only “undermines” the legally binding Sino-British joint declaration, as the Foreign Secretary put it, but represents a clear breach?
If so, will he say that to his Chinese counterparts?
