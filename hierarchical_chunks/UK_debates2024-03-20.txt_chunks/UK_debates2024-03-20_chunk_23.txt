I thank my right hon.
Friend for taking this terrible situation so seriously.
The permanent secretary at the Department for Education visited Hereford recently, so he will know that the new Conservative council is trying to mend the damage done by the previous Green and independent authority to far too many young people and their families.
As a father, does my right hon.
Friend agree that progress is still far too slow?
Will he meet me to discuss what more we can do?
