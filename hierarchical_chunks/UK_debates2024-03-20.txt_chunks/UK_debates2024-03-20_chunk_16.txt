The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 20 March.
I know the whole House will join me in congratulating Vaughan Gething on his election as Welsh Labour leader and expected election as First Minister of Wales, and also in offering Mark Drakeford our best wishes on his retirement.
The Government I lead will always work tirelessly to benefit the lives of people across the United Kingdom, and I look forward to working constructively with the new First Minister to deliver for the people of Wales.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
The people of Clacton have had a tough time with the cost of living, and I am doing everything I can to support them.
With that in mind, does my right hon.
Friend agree that cutting inflation is the very best way to do that, and that today’s statistics are very welcome?
Can he reassure my constituents that he will continue working hard to get inflation as low as possible, in order to protect their savings, help with their bills and give them the financial security they deserve?
Today’s figures show that our plan is working.
Inflation has fallen to 3.4% from its peak of over 11%, down by almost 70%—the steepest fall since the 1980s, and now at the lowest level since September 2021—and people’s pay packets are going further, with real wages growing for eight months in a row and taxes being cut by £900 for the average worker.
That is why we need to stick to the plan to deliver a brighter future for our country.
We now come to the Leader of the Opposition.
