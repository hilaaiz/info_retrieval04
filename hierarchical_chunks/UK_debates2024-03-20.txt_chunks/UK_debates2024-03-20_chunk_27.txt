Mr Speaker, you and the Prime Minister will be welcome in the Arun district of my constituency, where developers are trying to build over every vineyard, horticultural nursery and piece of agricultural land.
Will he point out that the last place to build homes is prime agricultural land, especially in an area where developers have enough permissions to meet the council’s targets for the next five years?
My hon.
Friend is right that sustainable development must be at the heart of our planning system.
That is why we are committed to meeting the housing needs of our communities by building the right homes in the right places, making sure that everyone makes best use of brownfield land, conserving our countryside.
That is also the point he makes, which is important.
I have been crystal clear: we must protect agricultural land.
Food security is incredibly important and we need our farmers to produce more Great British food.
We know the Prime Minister has received advice about the legality of the Israel-Gaza war, that he has had time to consider it, and that Governments can and do publish such advice.
Will he tell the House what steps he is taking to act on that advice in reviewing UK arms sales, in supporting the proceedings of the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court, and in exercising the UK’s vote at the UN Security Council?
We continue to call for Israel to respect international humanitarian law and for civilians to be protected.
Too many civilians have been killed and we want Israel to take greater care to limit its operations to military targets.
Those are points that both I and the Foreign Secretary have made repeatedly to Prime Minister   Netanyahu.
We have previously assessed that Israel is committed and capable of complying with international humanitarian law, and of course we always keep that under review.
