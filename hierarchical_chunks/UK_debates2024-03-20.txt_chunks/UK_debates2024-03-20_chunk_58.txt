I thank the Chair of the International Development Committee for her comments.
As she knows, we created the British national overseas route in 2020, which creates a pathway to permanent citizenship for British national overseas passport holders.
It is working extremely well.
Of course, we always keep it under review, but we have no current plans to change it.
