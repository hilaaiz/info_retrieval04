I thank my right hon.
Friend for his comments, which I will deal with as best I can.
He indicated just two or three of the defects in this appalling legislation.
He was right to identify them.
He did not ask me whether the legislation is in breach of the Sino-British joint declaration.
In fact, it is not; the Hong Kong Government are legislating for themselves.
The British Government declared in 2021 that China is in ongoing breach of the Sino-British joint declaration.
