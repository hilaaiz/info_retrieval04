Yesterday, His Majesty’s Government made it clear that the law’s overall impact will be to further damage the rights and freedoms enjoyed throughout Hong Kong.
It will enable the authorities to continue their clampdown on freedoms, including freedom of speech, assembly and the media.
It will further entrench the culture of self-censorship dominating Hong Kong’s social and political landscape.
It fails to provide certainty for international organisations, including diplomatic missions, operating there.
Broad definitions will negatively affect those who live, work and do business there.
Although Britain recognises the right of all jurisdictions to implement national security legislation, Hong Kong is also required to ensure that laws align with international standards, rights and norms as set out in UN treaties, the Sino-British joint declaration and its Basic Law.
Hong Kong is an international city.
Respect for the rule of law, its high degree of autonomy and the independence of its well-respected institutions have always been critical to its success.
The British Government have urged the Hong Kong authorities to respect rights and freedoms, uphold Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and the rule of law, and act in accordance with its international commitments and legal obligations.
Let me conclude by welcoming the contribution our growing Hong Kong diaspora make to life in the UK; they are safe to live here, and exercise the rights and freedoms that all other British residents enjoy.
We will not tolerate any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate, harass or harm individuals or communities in the UK.
This law has no effect in the UK, and we have no active extradition treaty with Hong Kong.
