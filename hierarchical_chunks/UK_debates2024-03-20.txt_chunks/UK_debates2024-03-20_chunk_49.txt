My right hon.
Friend asked about the rule of English common law and the warnings given by the Government of the United States.
The British business community is extremely experienced and well able to reach conclusions for itself, but if ever the British Government’s advice were sought, we would always give it.
He talked about targeted sanctions.
I know that he is sanctioned; I hope that he will bear that with the necessary fortitude.
It is outrageous that he and others should be sanctioned in that way.
We do not discuss our approach to sanctions on the Floor of the House, but my right hon.
Friend may rest assured that we are keeping all such matters under regular review.
