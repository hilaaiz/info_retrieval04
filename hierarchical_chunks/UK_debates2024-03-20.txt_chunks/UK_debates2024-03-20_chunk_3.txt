I thank my hon.
Friend for her tireless campaigning on behalf of Israeli victims of Hamas.
This Government are appalled by reports of sexual violence since  7 October  in Israel and Gaza.
I am working closely with Cabinet colleagues on the issue.
It is important to continue to highlight the fact that many hostages, both male and female, have still not been released, and they face the daily threat of rape, sexual assault and violence.
Across Government, we have been meeting with their families.
Just last week I met with the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, and I know that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have also done so in recent months.
