I thank the former Chair of the Defence Committee for his question.
During my business career, I was in and out of Hong Kong very regularly.
It is quite extraordinary how Hong Kong’s brilliant pre-eminence in business is being undermined by this legislation and, indeed, by much other legislation and acts by the Chinese Government.
Hong Kong was built on independent institutions, a high degree of autonomy and openness to the world.
All those things help to increase the economic activity, the living standards and the wealth of a country or a city, and it is deeply regrettable that this does not appear to be recognised by the Government of China.
