I thank the shadow Foreign Secretary for his comments.
I agree entirely with what he said about article 23.
He chides me for not saying more on the issue of sanctions.
The point I was making—I hope that he will accept that this is common to both parties when in government—is that we do not discuss our application or consideration of sanctions, or sanctions policy, on the Floor of the House, but when we feel it is necessary to act, we certainly do.
