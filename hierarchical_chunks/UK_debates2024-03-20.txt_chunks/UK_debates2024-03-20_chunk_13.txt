With permission, Mr Speaker, I will briefly pay tribute to my constituent Henry Wuga, whose funeral took place earlier today.
Henry, who came to Glasgow on the Kindertransport, was a truly remarkable man.
He and his late wife Ingrid made an enormous contribution to Scotland and the world through their work as holocaust educators.
His legacy is truly immense, and I am sure that the House will join me in sending our thoughts to Henry’s family.
May his memory be a blessing.
