I have two questions as a result.
This legislation harmonises Hong Kong’s and China’s national security systems, with devastating consequences for human rights; it also changes business and legal arrangements.
Last year, the US Government warned US businesses that they can no longer rely on the protection that the rule of English common law affords in Hong Kong.
Why have the UK Government not done the same for our businesses?
Secondly, we now know that Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office internal documents show that the Department paused targeted sanctions against Chinese officials in November 2023.
One document states: “FCDO has paused consideration of this work indefinitely”.
As one of the parliamentarians whom China has sanctioned, I must say that that is a terrible decision, and it flies in the face of the evidence.
Will the Government publish those documents, and make a statement explaining why they no longer wish to sanction Chinese officials?
