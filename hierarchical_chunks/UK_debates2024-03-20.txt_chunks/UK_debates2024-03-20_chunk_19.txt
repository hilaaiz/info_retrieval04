With his Back Benchers looking for a unity candidate to replace him, which of the now numerous born-again Thatcherites on the Labour Front Bench does the Prime Minister believe best fits the bill?
It was surprising, Mr Speaker, to hear all this talk about the 1970s from the shadow Chancellor in particular, but if you see what is happening in places like Birmingham, where taxes are going up  by 21% and services are being cut—whether that is social care, children’s services, or in some streets the lights literally being turned off—it is unsurprising why they are talking about the ’70s.
I just say that what they have done to Birmingham, the Conservatives will never let them do to Britain.
Of course there is a serious point to be made here, because the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned of the conspiracy of silence that exists between the Labour party and the Conservative party when it comes to £18 billion of looming public sector cuts.
Indeed, just last night it outlined that the fiscal rules of the Labour party and the Conservative party are, in effect, identical.
With such continuity on offer, the public are right to be anti-Westminster, aren’t they?
I am surprised to hear the hon.
Gentleman quoting the IFS, because it also described the recent SNP Budget as, in its words, “misleading”, and said that “pain is almost certainly coming”.
It is a savage tax and axe budget, because here is the reality: while NHS spending in England is going up in real terms, in Scotland it is going down; while taxes are being cut by the UK Government, the SNP Government are putting them up.
That is the contrast, and where the SNP or indeed Labour are in charge, it is working people who pay the price.
