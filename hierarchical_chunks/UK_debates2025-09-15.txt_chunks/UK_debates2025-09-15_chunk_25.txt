I thank the almost 500 constituents who responded to my summer road safety campaign.
One of the top issues raised is the use of antisocial off-road bikes.
I warmly welcome new measures in the Crime and Policing Bill to allow the police to seize these bikes without warning.
Will my hon.
Friend also look at the sale of off-road bikes to see what can be done to restrict them at source?
