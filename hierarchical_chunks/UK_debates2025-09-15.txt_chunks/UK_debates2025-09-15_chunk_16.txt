As a fellow west midlands Member of Parliament, I of course hear my hon.
Friend’s concerns, but she will understand that, as with previous years, decisions on police force funding allocations will be made via the police funding settlement, which is taking place later in the year.
I commend the Government for their commitment to neighbourhood policing, not least the proposed powers in the Crime and Policing Bill that will empower officers to stop antisocial and illegal e-scooter riding, which has been a dangerous blight across Stevenage town centre.
However, does my right hon.
Friend not agree that we should be giving police the legislation and guidance they need to keep our local neighbourhoods safe, rather than arresting individuals for posting on social media views that, while considered offensive by some, are nowhere near the bar for inciting criminal behaviour?
On the first part of my hon.
Friend’s question, he is absolutely right about strengthening neighbourhood policing to deal with the concerns he raises.
That is why we have brought forward new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill.
I agree that it is important that the line between that which is perfectly legal fair  comment, even if offensive, and that which is illegal is maintained as strongly as possible.
I have already had conversations with senior police officers on this matter, and I am pleased to see statements from, for example, the chief of the Met police.
I will be meeting them in more detail to make sure that that line is not crossed, so we can maintain confidence in our police.
