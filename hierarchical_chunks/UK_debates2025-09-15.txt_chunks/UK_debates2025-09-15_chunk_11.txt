The Rwanda agreement, which is what the right hon.
Gentleman referred to as a deterrent, was nothing of the sort.
From the day that agreement was signed to the day it was cancelled, 84,000 people crossed into this country.
That shows it was not a deterrent that was ever going to work.
I am clear that I will do whatever it takes.
I am already considering other measures that will deter people from making that crossing in the first place, and I will update the House in due course.
Immigration is still a big issue for my constituents—they email about it and it comes up when I am in the pub—but people’s frustration is turning to direct action, and Northampton is now filled with flags.
Does the Home Secretary agree that flags are a symbol of our pride in our country, and they should not be hijacked by plastic patriots and those who do not work in our country’s interest?
Let me be very clear: I understand the strength of feeling across communities in this country about the use of hotels, in particular—the right to protest is an ancient right in this country, and we will protect it—but it is important that we do not slip into rhetoric that incites violence or hatred towards other communities.
I love the St George’s flag
and I love the Union Jack.
Those flags belong to me as much as they do to anybody else, and we must never allow any of our flags to become symbols of division.
