Let me begin by welcoming the new Ministers to their places.
The last Conservative Government recruited a record number of police officers, but earlier this year we discovered that despite Labour’s promise of more police, the headcount had already fallen by 1,316 since it came to office.
Both the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner have warned that we will lose even more officers.
When will the Minister restore police numbers to the levels they were at under the last Conservative Government?
