I hope the hon.
Gentleman will take a bit of time to look at the speech I made to the Council of Europe just before the summer recess, in which I made a very similar argument to the one he is making.
For those of us who are supporters of the convention and who want to see it stand the test of time, we have to recognise that it is a treaty formed many decades ago in a different reality and we should have a conversation about whether it is still fit for purpose.
It is a conversation that others in Europe are having, and we are taking a leading role in those discussions.
We will pursue international reform and also reform of our domestic legislation.
By leaving the EU, the Tories tore up our returns agreement with the EU, and they completely failed to negotiate a new one, but this Government have now rectified that.
Does the Home Secretary agree that the Tories and Reform are in cloud cuckoo land if they think that the French would have signed a returns deal with us if we had left the European convention on human rights?
My hon.
Friend is right to point out that the fact that we are signed up to the European convention underpins other international agreements that we have with partners.
It underpins the Good Friday agreement.
It also underpins our treaty with the French on the France returns pilot.
That is why we should be responsible in taking forward a conversation on reform of the convention, and that is the approach we are taking.
I was taking that approach in my previous role, and I will carry on doing so as Home Secretary.
