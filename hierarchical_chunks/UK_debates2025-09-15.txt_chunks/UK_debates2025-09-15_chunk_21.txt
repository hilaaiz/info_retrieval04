I thank my hon.
Friend for her congratulations and her hard work in this area.
The UK Government have been clear from the outset that the Ukraine schemes are temporary and do not offer a direct route to settlement.
The Ukraine permission extension scheme reflects our strong humanitarian commitment while also—this is important—respecting Ukraine’s wish for its citizens to return, when safe, to support national recovery.
The long-term position is under active consideration, and further details will be provided at the earliest opportunity.
