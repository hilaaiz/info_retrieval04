The Prime Minister promised there would be a summer blitz on antisocial behaviour, with more funding and more community police officers promised for our constituencies, yet this summer in Cheadle village we have seen even more antisocial behaviour in the community.
Throughout the summer I was contacted by residents about crime in the area, including police officers attacked, a local school broken into and neighbours threatened for simply asking gangs not to throw rocks at their houses.
One of my constituents, Adam, told me it is the worst he has ever seen it.
Why did the summer blitz on antisocial behaviour not include Cheadle?
More than 500 town centres across England and Wales have seen the benefits of that summer initiative.
I will ask my officials questions about the hon.
Gentleman’s area in particular, but it is an important model that we have trialled this year.
We look forward to building on it as we ensure we have the local responses and neighbourhood policing to deal with local concerns, building confidence so that people can enjoy our town centres as they used to do.
