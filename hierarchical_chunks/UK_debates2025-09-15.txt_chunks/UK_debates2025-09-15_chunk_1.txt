I am grateful for being able to contribute to this debate.
It is a privilege to follow so many powerful speeches, and the speech delivered by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen)  was the most powerful I have heard in this place.
Her words rose to the moment; mine are inadequate by comparison.
I can only thank her for speaking so powerfully about an issue that affects so many of us.
