Lots of people know that under this Government, the number of people arriving illegally has hit a record high.
What many do not know is that this Labour Government are repealing the power to scientifically test the age of those arriving and are hiding the data on the number making false claims about their age.
Why are the Government doing away with powers that could prevent adult migrants from getting into classrooms with children, and why are they hiding this data from the British people?
Coming from one of the Conservative Members who, frankly, did nothing across their period in office and who are responsible for the mess I am having to clear up, I think that is a little bit rich.
This Government have been absolutely transparent.
We will carry on being so, and we will publish all the relevant data at the appropriate time.
I am very clear that nobody who tries to game our system will get away with it.
We will strengthen our rules, rather than weaken them, which is what we saw under the Conservative party.
