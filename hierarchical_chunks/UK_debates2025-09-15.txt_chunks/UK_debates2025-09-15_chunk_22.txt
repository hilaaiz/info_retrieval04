What steps her Department is taking to help tackle crime in city centres.
The United Kingdom boasts a fantastic array of cities, each of which has a unique character and appeal.
In order to thrive, our city centres must be safe.
That is why this Government are putting policing back on the beat and bringing in stronger powers to crack down on shop theft and antisocial behaviour.
I was pleased to see Newport city council announce last week £300,000 for new CCTV in our city centre, and I commend the work of trading standards, whose efforts have seized almost £2 million of illegal cigarettes and vapes.
While trading standards and the police are working really hard to tackle this issue, the time-limited nature of shop closure orders means that the shops often quickly reopen.
What more can the Government do to strengthen powers to stop this?
