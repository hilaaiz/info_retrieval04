I thank the Minister for his answer.
It is quite clear that people have had their lives saved through scientific experiments with animals, and we thank the scientists for that.
At the same time, a growing number of people have grave concerns, including my constituents and probably the Minister’s constituents as well.
Can he assure us that when it comes to doing animal experiments of any sort, the priority will always be the people who can be saved as a result of the experiments, but it will also be the care of the animals?
That is what my people want, and I think it is what everybody wants.
