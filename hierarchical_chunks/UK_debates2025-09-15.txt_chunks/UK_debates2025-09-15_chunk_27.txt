I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
It is encouraging to see the work going on in his constituency.
It is our intention to ensure that the police have the resources they need to do the jobs we need them to do, whether in hotspot policing, neighbourhood policing or tackling anti-social behaviour.
We will change legislation here in Parliament to ensure they have the powers as well as the resources they need to act locally in the interests of our constituents.
