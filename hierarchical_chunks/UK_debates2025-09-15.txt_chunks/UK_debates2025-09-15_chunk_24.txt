Sometimes crime wears a suit, as happened in Brechin in my constituency, where Mackie Motors had equity in their vehicles stolen by a French bank based in London.
Then, through mendacity or incompetence or both, the bank turned off the oxygen for that business of 50 years.
I have met with Home Office and Treasury Ministers to try to get around this.
My constituent has been to the Financial Conduct Authority, who told them to go to the police, who then told them to go back to the FCA, who then told them to go to Citizens Advice—you could not make this cluster-fankle up.
Is it not the case that in the UK today, if a small or medium-sized enterprise is in dispute with a bank, the FCA will demonstrate that it is neither use nor ornament?
I cannot comment on the specific details, as I am not aware of that case, but I am very happy to have a conversation with the hon.
Member.
Some SMEs in my constituency have had similar issues, so I am very happy to take that forward.

Antisocial behaviour causes untold distress and misery across our communities.
Under the previous Government, the response to this menace was weak and ineffective, and visible neighbourhood policing declined dramatically.
This Government are putting that right by rebuilding neighbourhood policing and introducing respect orders to tackle persistent perpetrators and stronger powers to seize dangerous and deafening off-road bikes.
