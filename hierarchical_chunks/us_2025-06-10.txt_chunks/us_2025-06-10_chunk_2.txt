Mr. ADERHOLT.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the lifelong service.
Michael Rouse, a man whose dedication to ministry, education, and the advancement of Christian values has had a profound impact not only in Alabama, but across the Nation.
Dr. Rouse's commitment to faith and education is evident in his academic achievements.
He earned his bachelor's degree from Baptist Bible College, followed by a master's degree in pastoral ministries, and a doctorate in theology from Bethany Seminary.
These accomplishments laid the foundation for his more than forty years of devoted service as the senior pastor of Mountain View Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
Through his leadership, this church has been a beacon of faith and community in our state.
Beyond his pastoral duties, Dr. Rouse has been a leader in Christian education.
In 1982, he founded Mountain View Baptist School, providing generations of students with a strong academic foundation rooted in biblical principles.
His influence in education extended further through his twenty-five years of service as both vice president and president of the Alabama Christian Education Association.
Additionally, from 2016 to 2024, he served faithfully as the president of the American Association of Christian Schools, guiding Christian educational institutions across the country with wisdom and steadfast dedication.
Dr. Rouse's contributions to our communities, our schools, and our faith institutions cannot be overstated.
His lifelong efforts have strengthened families, empowered students, and enriched the spiritual and educational fabric of Alabama and beyond.
