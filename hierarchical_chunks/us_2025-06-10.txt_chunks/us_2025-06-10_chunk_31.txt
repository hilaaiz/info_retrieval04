Mr. Quinn, reflecting on his journey from Texas to Georgia to Wisconsin before settling in the Delta, spoke candidly of Mississippi's often misunderstood legacy.
He rightly observed that Mississippi is too frequently portrayed as a scapegoat for America's racial challenges, when in truth, it is home to many individuals working tirelessly to heal those very wounds--Mission Mississippi of Leflore County among the foremost.
Grounded in faith and expansive in impact, their mission exemplifies what it means to live out the gospel in a divided world--breaking bread, building bridges, and showing that we have more in common than in conflict.
