The Corps shared that they were not just removing debris for the short-term.
Instead, they have been focused on the long-term health of the region by implementing a zerotolerance policy for over-cleaning or reckless removal of debris.
While we can all acknowledge that there are times when the Corps has missed the zero-tolerance mark, our conversation made it clear that we are both committed to working together to make sure that our streams and rivers are cleaned the right way, so they can return to being safe, healthy, and free of debris for decades to come.
