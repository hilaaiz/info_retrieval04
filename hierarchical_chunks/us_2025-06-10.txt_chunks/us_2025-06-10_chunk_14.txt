The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) continues to work diligently to clear debris from many of our waterways after Hurricane Helene.
I appreciated the opportunity to receive an update on their progress and share a few of the concerns that I've been hearing from our community, including the need for debris removal efforts to be mindful of endangered and threatened species and to avoid removing healthy vegetation from the streambanks.
USACE's methodical approach to debris removal has facilitated the clearing of over 3.4 million cubic yards of debris, giving the natural environments that have been reshaped by Helene the opportunity to heal.
