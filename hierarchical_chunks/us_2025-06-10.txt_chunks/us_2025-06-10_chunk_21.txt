There are folks who have been up in arms about an MS-13 gang member, whom some have dubbed as a ``Maryland man,'' claiming that he has been ``mistakenly'' deported to El Salvador.
Let's be clear: Deporting him was NOT a mistake.
There has been a deportation order for Abrego Garcia since 2019, when an immigration court and an appellate immigration court both ruled that he was a member of MS-13 and in our country illegally.
When MS-13 was declared a foreign terrorist organization, Abrego Garcia became no longer eligible for any form of immigration relief in our country.
This is just another example of hand-picked information errantly fueling public outrage.
Not only should journalistic institutions prioritize factual, balanced reporting over sensationalism, but we as citizens must also take responsibility for looking at the facts rather than retreating into ideological bubbles.
