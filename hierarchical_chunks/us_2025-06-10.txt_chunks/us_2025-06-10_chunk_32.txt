Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mission Mississippi of Leflore County for their vital work in uplifting their community, challenging stereotypes, and leading with grace and love.
Their efforts remind us that reconciliation is possible--one conversation, one relationship, and one act of compassion at a time.
