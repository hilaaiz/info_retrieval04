Western North Carolina, with its many lakes and rivers, must remain at the forefront of dam safety.
With the recent vulnerabilities found in the Chatuge Dam, it is critical that safety risks are addressed to protect lives and downstream communities in our mountains.
That said, the Hiwassee River is foundational to the rural, westernmost areas of our district's recreation industry and economy.
That is why I have requested that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) provide the risk analysis and data behind their decision to move forward with repairs and improvements.
The people of Western North Carolina deserve to know why repairs are needed if we are going to come to an educated opinion on the best path forward.
It's imperative that the condition of the dam, the safety of the community downstream, and the economic security of the businesses and people surrounding the dam be considered when evaluating the best approach to addressing the safety concerns.
My office will continue to work with local and federal officials to determine the best path forward, while strengthening the long-term viability of the dam so that our local economy can thrive.
TVA is early in their process of analyzing potential solutions and impacts, and anyone interested in the decisionmaking process can attend in-person or virtual public input sessions.
The dates and times for these sessions can be found on their website here.
