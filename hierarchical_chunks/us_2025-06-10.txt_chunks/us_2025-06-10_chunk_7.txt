Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, salute and honor the life of 
Mrs. Reba W. Stewart.
I ask my colleagues to join us in extending our deepest condolences to her family and all who mourn her loss during this difficult time of bereavement.
I pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead.
