Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend Mission Mississippi of Leflore County, a remarkable organization based in Greenwood, Mississippi, for its unwavering commitment to racial reconciliation, spiritual healing, and community building.
Founded as part of the broader Mission Mississippi movement, which began in Jackson in 1992, the Leflore County chapter has become a beacon of hope and unity in the Mississippi Delta.
At a time when division often dominates our national discourse, this grassroots organization brings people together across racial and denominational lines through intentional fellowship, shared meals, and mutual respect.
Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by 
Mr. Terry Williams, a local painting contractor and pastor, and 
Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister and clinical therapist.
Together, they facilitate regular gatherings-- often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with historically Black or White congregations.
These events are not mere meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse backgrounds.
Through these efforts, Mission Mississippi of Leflore County engages in what 
Mr. Williams aptly describes as ``heart work''--emphasizing their belief that the path to racial harmony begins with the courage to know one another, to listen, and to love unconditionally.
Their work underscores that true unity is not achieved solely through laws or policies, but through relationships and shared purpose.
In January of this year, the chapter hosted a luncheon at St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church, followed by a community meal in April that featured remarks from Dr. Montrell Greene, pastor of Sycamore Street Church.
These are but a few examples of their ongoing efforts to bring diverse voices to the table and create a space where differences are acknowledged and celebrated.
