You may have heard of California's electric vehicle (EV) mandate to ban the sale of gas-powered cars, which is the latest attempt to force an extreme agenda that would take away consumer choice, lead to higher prices for both new and used cars, and strain our electric grid.
Such a ban would affect consumers in every state in our country by raising costs and decreasing availability of gas vehicles.
The assertion that EVs are affordable and highly sought after is out of touch with reality: only 1 percent of registered vehicles in the U.S. are EV's.
I voted for three resolutions that passed the House to push back on such radical policies from the prior administration and repeal these disastrous mandates: House Joint Resolution 88 would repeal California's waiver allowing the state to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.
House Joint Resolution 87 would repeal California's waiver allowing the state to require the sale of zero-emission trucks.
House Joint Resolution 89 would end California's nitrogen oxide engine emission standards, which create unrealistic standards for heavy-duty on-road engines.
The U.S. has reduced emissions for decades through wise investment and innovation, not extreme government mandates.
Congress must protect consumer choice and stop California from circumventing the federal government's environmental regulations, to the detriment of consumers and the automobile market nationwide.
