Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Blackledge for his more than two decades of service in the United States Air Force.
A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy and a proud leader within the intelligence community, Lt. Col. Blackledge has represented our Nation with distinction in uniformed service across the globe.
From his early days as an intelligence officer to his most recent assignment as a Legislative Liaison to the Secretary of the Air Force, Lt. Col. Blackledge has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the security and strategic readiness of our Nation.
His operational leadership has taken him from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam to RAF Molesworth, to deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan--always delivering with precision, integrity, and focus.
Over the course of his career, Lt. Col. Blackledge served in pivotal roles at the Pentagon, U.S. Strategic Command, and in multiple joint environments.
His work has helped shape national policy and defense priorities, particularly through his most recent role advising Air Force leadership and Congress on programs vital to our military's intelligence gathering, communications, and battlefield awareness capabilities.
As he enters retirement, we also recognize the enduring support of his family.
His wife, Captain Katie Blackledge, is a fellow veteran and airman in her own right, and together they have raised two exceptional daughters, Laurel and Lane Blackledge.
Their shared sacrifice and steadfast support have been essential to Daniel's service, and our Nation owes them a debt of gratitude as well.
