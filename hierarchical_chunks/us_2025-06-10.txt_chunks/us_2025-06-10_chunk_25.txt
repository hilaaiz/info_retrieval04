In keeping with my office's motto of being ``First in Constituent Services'' and helping folks after Hurricane Helene, my office regularly brings the Carolina Cruiser across our mountains for mobile office hours.
In April alone, the Carolina Cruiser made 16 stops where members of my team heard about the issues that matter to WNC communities, answered questions about disaster recovery, and assisted with federal agencies.
During these office hours, my team heard from over 150 individuals.
As your congressman, it is my goal to remain accessible to you.
In addition to mobile office hours, I regularly host ``Chat With Chuck'' meetings to hear from constituents oneon-one about their concerns and answer their questions individually.
If you're interested in scheduling a meeting with me, please fill out the form on my website at edwards.house.gov/chatwithchuck.
If you want to stop by mobile office hours for assistance navigating a federal agency or to just provide feedback, stay updated on the office hours schedule by following the Carolina Cruiser on X and Facebook, and visiting my website at edwards.house.gov/carolinacruiser.
With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member.
