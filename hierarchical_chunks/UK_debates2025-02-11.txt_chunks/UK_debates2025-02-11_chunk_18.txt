I thank my hon.
Friend for this important question, and I commend the work of hospices such as Nottinghamshire hospice in his constituency, which I know does a wonderful job for people in his area.
The investment I referred to in my earlier answer will help hospices such as Nottinghamshire hospice to provide quality end-of-life care to patients and their families this year and next.
It can be used to improve IT systems, make it easier for GPs and hospitals to share  vital data on patients, and help to develop and improve outreach services to support people in their own homes, when needed.
