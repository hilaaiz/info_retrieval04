I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
One of the three shifts that the 10-year plan will deliver is shifting more healthcare out of hospitals and into the community.
In the context of the plan, we are having discussions about the long-term sustainability of the palliative and end-of-life care sector, including hospices.
As we develop the plan, we will be carefully considering policies in this area, with input from the public, patients, health staff and our stakeholders.
As I mentioned in response to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Edmonton and Winchmore Hill (Kate Osamor) , last week I was pleased to chair a roundtable to discuss long-term strategies for hospices to get palliative and end-of-life care, including hospices, on to a more sustainable footing after 14 years of Tory neglect and incompetence.
