Thank you for granting this UQ, Mr Speaker.
On a February night in 1992, four men—known terrorists—armed with semi-automatic weapons and a Dushka machine gun capable of firing 600 rounds a minute at a range of 1,100 yards had already attacked a Royal Ulster Constabulary police station and were planning further attacks.
These terrorists called themselves an army, they carried weapons of war, they sought to kill, and they operated entirely outside the bounds of the law.
Yet we are asked to believe that the use of lethal force against them was not justified.
I am not a lawyer, but if this is the state of the law, then the law is an ass, and it is up to Parliament to change it.
What if this had not been on the streets of Tyrone?
What if it had been on the streets of Birmingham?
What if it had been in Parliament Square?
Would we be asking why those men had not been arrested?
Would we find it acceptable that the courts subsequently sought to punish those forces that had risked their lives for ours?
The consequences of this ruling are potentially very severe: military morale weakened, military recruitment reduced, military effectiveness diminished, and more retired servicemen in their declining years dragged before the courts for trying to protect their countrymen from terrorists.
For the record, there is no Defence Minister on the Treasury Bench to hear this urgent question.
The last Government took steps to ensure that a line was drawn under court actions like the one handed down last week.
This Government have said they will repeal that Act, but seven months into their tenure, they have brought forward no plans.
When will the House see that legislation?
When we do see it, will the Secretary of State ensure that it includes provisions to protect servicemen, such as those affected by the ruling, from prosecution?
