To give a sense of quantum to the House, about £400 million-worth of UK steel exports go to the United States.
That represents, if I recollect accurately, about 10% of UK production, so the hon.
Gentleman is entirely right to recognise that this is a significant moment.
We take that very seriously, which is why we are engaging in dialogue with both the workforce and the owners of the various steel producers here in the United Kingdom.
More broadly, as my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham Hodge Hill and Solihull North (Liam Byrne)  alluded to, we want to avoid a significant escalation.
We saw retaliatory measures taken under the first Trump Administration.
It feels to me that this is an opportunity for the UK to exercise a cool head and a clear-eyed sense of where the national interest lies.
These tariffs will not be imposed until  12 March , which gives us time to undertake the dialogue that is already under way, to reach a judgment on the basis of the analysis that we have already done, and to ensure that our interlocuters in Washington and elsewhere are engaged in a constructive and mature dialogue.
