North London Hospice in my constituency has a site in Winchmore Hill that receives one third of its funding from the NHS, with the rest coming from the generosity of the public.
Many of its services, such as out-patients and wellbeing, are funded entirely by donations.
While it welcomes the announcement of the £100 million in funding, what assurances can the Government provide about long-term hospice funding, given the significant delays in accessing funding from integrated care boards this year?
Hospices are anxious to seek clarity about the allocation and distribution of this funding.
