I welcome the new Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for West Lancashire (Ashley Dalton) , to her place.
Hundreds of my constituents are on waiting lists for knee and hip operations, and while  the hon.
Member for North Herefordshire (Ellie Chowns)  says that she would like to see those waiting lists reduced, the Green party has done everything it can to oppose Labour’s plan for change—it opposed our Budget, with its record investment in the NHS, and it opposed our agreement with the independent sector to bring down the backlog.
Does the Secretary of State agree that it is time for the Opposition parties to stop wishing for a reduction in waiting lists and start backing Labour’s credible plan to make a real difference?
