My constituent Cate Maddison suffered with severe vasa praevia in childbirth.
This condition causes severe bleeding and can often result in the death of infants in childbirth and complications for the mother.
However, the risks are significantly reduced when identified during pregnancy.
Thankfully, Cate’s child survived, but she is campaigning to reduce unnecessary complications and deaths arising from the condition.
Will the Minister meet me and Cate to discuss how we can tackle this important issue?
I am incredibly sorry to hear about Cate’s experience.
We want to ensure that women receive safe, personalised and compassionate maternity care and that women with the condition are supported.
That is why we have asked the college to look at the guidance.
I will of course be happy to meet my hon.
Friend and his constituent.
There is clearly a need to consider vasa praevia as part of antenatal care.
The hon.
Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Connor Naismith)  set the scene very well and the Minister responded in a good fashion.
This issue, which the hon.
Member was right to highlight, is also an issue in Northern Ireland.
Will the Minister share what is going forward here with representatives at the Northern Ireland Assembly?
