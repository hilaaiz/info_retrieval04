The Secretary of State recently said that legislation to revoke the deeply flawed legacy Act, which does not command confidence across Northern Ireland, will be introduced when time allows.
Will he offer details on when that might be?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his observations.
The answer to his last question is: when parliamentary time allows.
As soon as I am in a position to indicate when that will be, I will tell the House.
I very much agree with what the hon.
Gentleman said about the violence inflicted by terrorists being abhorrent.
It is important that in this House we make it quite clear that there was always an alternative to violence: pursuing the path of peace.
When people finally decided that that was the course of action that they should take, we saw a transformation in the lives of people in Northern Ireland.
The tragedy is that so many people were killed and murdered before we got to the point of the Good Friday agreement.
