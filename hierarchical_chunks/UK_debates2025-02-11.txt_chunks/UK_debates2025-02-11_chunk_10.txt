I thank the Minister for his continued commitment to supporting mental health in this country.
Does he also recognise that mental health involves supporting NHS frontline staff?
I had the wonderful opportunity of spending time with the East of England ambulance service on Saturday morning.
They work incredibly long hours and work incredibly hard.
Obviously, we need to think about their mental health as well.
