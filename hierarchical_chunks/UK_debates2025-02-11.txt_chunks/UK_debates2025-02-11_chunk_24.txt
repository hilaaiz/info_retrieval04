I welcome the hon.
Lady to her position.
She may be unaware of the number of debates that I have led into women’s health and endometriosis and pelvic mesh, and there is an inequality in the health service with how women are treated.
Many women are deeply concerned by the announcements and statements about how the concentration on women’s health has been reduced.
Will the Minister speak to the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists?
Following that meeting, will she speak to the Secretary of State, who rightly says that he recognises when mistakes have been made, about reconsidering the approach to women’s health taken in the statement the other week?
