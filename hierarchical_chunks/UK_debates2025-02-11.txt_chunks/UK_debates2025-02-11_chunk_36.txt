The Minister will be aware that the contract uplift for dentists is facing a near 11-month delay.
Can he confirm that dentists will be receiving their uplift?
What will be done to make sure that they receive enough money to cover the costs of NHS dentistry?
I can reassure my hon.
Friend on that point.
We implemented the contract uplift on  29 January .
Dentists will therefore be receiving their uplifted payments in March, backdated to  1 April 2024 .
For the first time in more than a decade, we have also increased payments for practices training a foundation dentist.
In Maldon, the number of patients per GP is already 50% above the number for England, and that will only increase with the amount of proposed house building.
GPs are struggling to cope with ever increasing costs, and I have one practice still undertaking so-called collective action.
Will the Government review the whole system of GP funding before it breaks down completely?
We are in negotiations about the future contract with the General Practitioners Committee England of the British Medical Association.
Those negotiations are proceeding, and the right hon.
Gentleman is right that we need serious reform; we will be pushing reforms through on that basis.
On his point about the estate, we have a £102 million commitment on capital for the primary care estate, which I think will go some way towards reassuring him.
