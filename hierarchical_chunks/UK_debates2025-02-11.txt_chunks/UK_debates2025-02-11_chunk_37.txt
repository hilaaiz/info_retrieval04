I thank my hon.
Friend the Minister for all the support he has given the University of East Anglia to set up its dental school, but he will be aware that all those shiny new dentists coming out in a few years’ time will be going into the private sector, not the NHS, unless we can sort out the NHS dental contract.
Can he give us any kind of timeline for when we can expect to hear an announcement on that critical factor?
