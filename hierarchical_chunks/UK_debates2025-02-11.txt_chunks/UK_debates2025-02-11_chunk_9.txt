As the Minister for Care will know, 20% of the burden on the NHS is due to mental health, yet only 10% of the budget is allocated towards it.
The mental health investment standard has been a welcome maintenance under this Government.
However, the Select Committee heard from Amanda Pritchard the other day that the standard is guaranteed for only the next two years.
Does the Minister agree that the standard has had a positive effect on mental health community services, and would he commit to protecting it?
The Chair of the Committee will have seen that we have made an explicit commitment to the mental health investment standard—we are absolutely  committed to that.
In addition, we have to drive reform in the system so that it is about not just the amount of investment going in, but how we ensure that it is working properly.
I am absolutely confident that the commitment to 8,500 new specialists, the Young Futures hubs and having a mental health specialist in every school will facilitate the delivery of services in a far more effective way than is currently the case.
