I thank the hon.
Lady, along with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Stockport (Navendu Mishra) , for her continued support for Stepping Hill hospital.
I know that she is working hard on this issue.
We are backing the NHS with over £4 billion of funding for integrated care boards for capital priorities, with a dedicated £750 million estate safety fund next year to address the poorest quality hospitals.
I am pleased that the replacement of Stepping Hill’s outpatient facility is already under way, backed by £11.5 million this year.
I look forward to visiting as soon as my diary allows.
