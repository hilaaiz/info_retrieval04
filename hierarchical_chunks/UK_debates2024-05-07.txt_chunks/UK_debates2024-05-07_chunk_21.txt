I welcome the efforts made by the Foreign Secretary, the Deputy Foreign Secretary and the Minister for the Middle East,  who have been in and out of the middle east many times over the past two weeks in order to hear from our allies.
However, as we see the launch of the Rafah offensive, what reassurances have been received that aid access and, above all, aid workers will be protected?
We cannot see the entire aid industry flee from Rafah junction, as is currently being predicted.
There is speculation about Al-Mawasi as a safe zone for civilians, but there is no infrastructure in what is essentially a desert, and it was not safe on the last occasion when, as we saw, the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians was bombed—on which we have still had no answer.
Finally, have we had any proof of life for those Israeli citizens who have now been held for seven months?
For many, there has been no proof of life since at least Day 20.
What are we doing to push for that proof of life, which families so desperately need?
