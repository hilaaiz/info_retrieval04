My hon.
Friend is entirely right to make that last point.
We do seek proof of life.
The families to whom she refers are desperate for information, but that information has not been forthcoming.
We are deeply concerned about the humanitarian position in Rafah.
Any plan would have to respect international humanitarian law, and we have yet to see such a plan.
The immediate priority, as I set out in my opening remarks, must be a humanitarian pause in the fighting.
As the House well knows, such a pause would allow us, potentially, to get the hostages out, but also to get aid into Gaza.
