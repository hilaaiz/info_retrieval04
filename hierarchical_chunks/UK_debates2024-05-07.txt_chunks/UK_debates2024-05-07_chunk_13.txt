I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
Indeed, working with not just the Ministry of Justice, but the Department for Work and Pensions is key to deliver this, as is working with the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure that any financial institution  that does the right thing does not lose out or face any regulatory issues.
That is indeed something that has my support and that of the Treasury, and we will work across Government to get this right.
