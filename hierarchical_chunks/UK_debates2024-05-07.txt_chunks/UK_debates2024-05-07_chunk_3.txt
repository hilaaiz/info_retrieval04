I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point.
I note his long-held interest in the co-operative sector, and the work that he does on it.
So, what are the Government doing?
They are doing two things specifically.
First, they recently took the further step of backing the Co-operatives, Mutuals and Friendly Societies Act 2023; they also commissioned the Law Commission to review  the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014 to make sure that co-operatives can do as much as possible to benefit the wider economy.
