Turning to the figures, I encourage people to reach for the detail—to look at the actual figures.
The only thing we can go on is the claims, and the figures coming from the Treasury on claims for the last year available absolutely reflect that 73% figure.
The right hon.
Gentleman raises an important point about the ringfence; that point is under discussion, but I have made assurances that the devolved Administrations will be closely informed about, and involved in, what happens.
These are important points, and they should be treated seriously.
I do not really care for the high-profile voices that we have got attacking a Labour Government, but I do care about the family farms in my constituency.
I know that the Minister cares for those farms as well, as does the Prime Minister.
I welcome the figures we have been given.
However, those figures do need to be translated to our family farmers; they need to see what it is like on the ground.
I would welcome a meeting with NFU Cymru and the Minister to discuss what things are going to look like for farmers, especially in Gower and the rest of Wales, where there is a completely different landscape.
