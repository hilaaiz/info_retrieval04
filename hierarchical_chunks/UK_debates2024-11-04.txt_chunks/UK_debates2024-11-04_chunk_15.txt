I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place.
Schools and colleges will be compensated at a national level.
I would, however, point out to him that when I became Secretary of State in July, I was presented with the teachers’ pay review body award of 5.5% that the last Government received, put in a drawer and then ran away from and called an election.
We have backed our teachers, who are crucial to the life chances of our children.
That is why I was delighted that we were able to honour that award and recognise the vital contribution our teachers make.
That is how we will recruit 6,500 new expert teachers.
If the Opposition refuse to back our commitments on VAT, they should set out how many teachers they intend to cut.
