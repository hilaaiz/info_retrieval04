The hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  and I are indeed never seen in the same place together.
[Laughter.]
Stramongate nursery school in Kendal faces closure following an Ofsted inspection.
If it had been a regular school, it would have had help to remain open under   special measures, but as it is, the nursery has to close.
Will the Secretary of State pay attention to this particular issue to ensure that the children and parents are protected, and that childcare can continue?
I will look carefully at the case and ensure that the hon.
Gentleman has a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss it further.
Many towns and villages across my constituency have experienced rapid population growth in recent years, but education opportunities have not kept pace, so will the Minister meet me to discuss the specific investment needed to expand school places for my constituency’s growing population?
I am very happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss the matter.
