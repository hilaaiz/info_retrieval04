The Secretary of State was asked— What steps she  is taking to increase the availability of high-quality childcare.
The early years are my No. 1 priority as Education Secretary.
We will deliver a sea change in early years education to give parents better work choices and children better life chances.
We will start by repurposing empty classrooms to create or expand school-based nurseries, making childcare more accessible and affordable for hard-pressed families.
I encourage state-funded primary schools, working with their local authorities, to consider applying before the application window closes on  19 December .
With Government data showing that 70,000 more early years places need to be created by next year, and with an overhaul of outdated business rates promised, will the Secretary of State commit to removing unfair business rates from nurseries and pre-schools, which will now be mostly delivering Government-funded childcare?
It is undoubtedly a challenge to deliver the roll-out, but we are determined to do it because it is so important for parents and for children’s life chances.
We intend to reform the early years sector overall.
We will be looking very closely at this into next year; I would welcome further input from the hon.
Gentleman and his party on the way forward.
