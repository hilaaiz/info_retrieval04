I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
We have a child-centred Government, and early years is a priority for the Secretary of State.
We will focus on reforming the childcare system to ensure that it is fit for purpose for the future and of high quality for all young people.
We are taking the sector’s concerns seriously, and we want to ensure there is a sustainable system going forward.
