As a mother in the north-west, I thank the Secretary of State and welcome the Government’s £1.8 billion commitment to expanding publicly funded childcare.
As we transition towards more publicly funded childcare, can she share any plans for interim support to keep childcare affordable for working families relying on private providers?
My hon.
Friend is right.
As the roll-out continues, we will shortly reach a situation in which 80% of childcare is Government-backed.
It is therefore right that in those circumstances we look closely at whether we are getting the best-quality provision for our children.
As part of our early years strategy review, we will take account of all considerations.
We are looking at a range of factors for the sector, including workforce recruitment, quality of provision and much more besides.
I look forward to working with her  on this.
We welcome the new shadow Secretary of State.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
May I say how delighted I am to be in the role?
We will be a constructive Opposition working in the best interests of young people.
In that spirit, I ask the Secretary of State to confirm that the Government’s early years funding rates for all age groups will increase to reflect the changes in employer national insurance contributions.
Will she give us a figure for how much that will cost the Department for Education?
