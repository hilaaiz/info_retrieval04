Farmers across the United Kingdom are coping with the lingering legacy of betrayal—betrayal from the trade deals that happened under the last Government, which threw them under a bus; and betrayal from the transition from the old payment scheme to the new one, which saw many of them going bust or forced into making business decisions that they would never, ever have chosen.
That legacy of betrayal is one that hangs heavy, and it is why farmers in my constituency and elsewhere feel so utterly disappointed by this Government’s Budget last week.
Let us look first at the agricultural property relief changes.
There are 1,500 farms in Cumbria and 440 in my constituency affected by this.
Has the Minister done an investigation into the number of farmers who are living on less than the minimum wage each year in terms of income, but who have a property that will be affected by these changes, particularly given the 41% decrease in farm incomes under the Conservative Government over the last five years?
Will he also assess the impact on tenant farmers?
Some 50% of my farmers are tenants and will be affected by the disruption that this change will create.
Would it not be wise for him to implement the Rock review of tenant protections before introducing something like this?
Will he also look again at the £2.4 billion budget and increase it by £1 billion, just as the Liberal Democrats suggest?
If we do not feed ourselves, we are a failing country.
