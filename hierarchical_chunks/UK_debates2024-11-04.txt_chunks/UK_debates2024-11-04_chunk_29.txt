Hear, hear!
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
It has been a while since I have spoken!
Those at Buckton Fields school in my constituency were delighted when they had a newly constructed building, but that delight was sadly short-lived, as there were defects.
As a consequence, with interim arrangements, the school’s roll has gone up and down, and now it  has a £45,000 shortfall in its budget.
Will the Minister meet me and representatives from the school to discuss the issue?
