As the Minister for Food Security, I can assure the House that food security is national security.
The Government’s commitment to supporting farmers and rural communities is unwavering.
We have committed £5 billion in the agricultural budget over the next two years—the biggest ever budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in our country’s history.
We are also releasing £60 million to support farmers whose farms have been devastated by severe flooding, and investing £208 million to protect the nation from potential disease outbreaks that threaten our farming industry, food security and human health.
However, as we are all only too aware, the Conservatives left behind a £22 billion black hole in our nation’s finances—[Interruption.]
Yes, you did.
And this Government have had to take tough decisions on tax, welfare and spending to fix the foundations and deliver change, including a series of decisions on tax to protect the payslips of working people.
That is possible only by making changes to other taxes, such as agricultural property relief, which was previously available to all agricultural property at a rate of 100%.
Currently, small farms can find themselves facing the same levels of tax bills as much larger farms, despite having a much smaller asset.
Twenty per cent of agricultural property relief is claimed by the top 2%; 40% is claimed by the top 7%.
That is not fair, it is not sustainable, and sadly, it has been used in some cases by wealthy landowners to avoid inheritance tax.
That is why the Government have announced plans to reform agricultural property relief.
