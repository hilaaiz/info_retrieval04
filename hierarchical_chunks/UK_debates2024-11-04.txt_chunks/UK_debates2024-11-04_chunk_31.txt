The UK’s social mobility commissioner has highlighted the “geography of disadvantage” being experienced by young people in northern post-industrial communities like those in Ossett and Denby Dale.
Does the Secretary of State agree with the commissioner that decisive and bold Government action to improve educational attainment and opportunity is required for these children?
I do agree, and I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for raising the point.
I am leading the work across Government on breaking down the barriers to opportunity in order to break the unfair link between background and success.
We know that tackling child poverty is a crucial part of that process, and it is essential that we get the recommendations of the child poverty taskforce to ensure that poverty does not hold back our children’s life chances.
Helen Blythe from Stamford has campaigned courageously for improvements to allergy safety since her son Benedict died following a severe allergic reaction at school in 2021.
Will the Minister commit to meet me to discuss introducing   a mandatory requirement for all schools to have a specific allergy and anaphylaxis plan, and for every school to have adrenaline auto-injectors?
I met Helen Blythe last week, and I will happily meet the hon.
Member to take forward her concerns.
