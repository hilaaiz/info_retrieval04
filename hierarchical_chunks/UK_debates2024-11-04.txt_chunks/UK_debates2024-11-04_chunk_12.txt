I thank my hon.
Friend for raising such an important topic and highlighting the good work of the Greater Manchester violence reduction unit.
As well as the work on the RSHE curriculum, the Government will create a new young futures programme, intervening early to stop young people being drawn into crime through preventive action and learning from best practice across the country.
It is vital that we have a system that can identify and support those young people who need it most, be they victims or potential perpetrators.
