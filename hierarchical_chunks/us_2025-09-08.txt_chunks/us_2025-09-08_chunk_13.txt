ones about their health.
We can eradicate this deadly disease through continued awareness, elevating stories, and supporting innovative research for the men we hold dear in our lives.
While the fight is far from over.
it is incumbent upon us to do our part.
As the daughter of a brave survivor of prostate cancer, recognizing September as Prostate Cancer Awareness Month is a small token of appreciation for all that have taken part in this fight against this disease.
Today, I uplift my father, Joseph Crockett, and all prostate cancer survivors who are living testimonies of overcoming one of life's most challenging experiences.
I also honor all we have lost, knowing their deaths are not in vain, but instead strengthen our resolve for finding a cure.
Their tenacious spirit lives within all of us.
