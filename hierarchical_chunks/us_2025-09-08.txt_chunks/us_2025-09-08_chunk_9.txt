Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating 
Mr. Daryl Richards, Jr., for his tireless service to the people of the Mississippi Delta.
He stands as a shining example of leadership, compassion, and commitment, and he continues to make a lasting difference in the lives of our elders and their families.
