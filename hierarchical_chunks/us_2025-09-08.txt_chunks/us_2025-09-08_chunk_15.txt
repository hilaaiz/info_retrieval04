Mr. FULCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the life of Jennifer Fuhs, a beloved mother, grandmother, and fighter from Lewiston, Idaho, who is courageously facing the final stages of her battle with cancer.
Jennifer dedicated her career as a compassionate defense attorney, advocating for individuals in Lewiston who faced uncertain life circumstances.
She approached her work with empathy and conviction, always seeking fairness and justice for those in need.
Beyond her professional service, Jennifer is a devoted mother to her five children and a proud grandmother to her four grandchildren, whom she adores deeply.
She is witty, organized, hardworking, and spunky, and she carries a spirit of generosity that inspires everyone around her.
She loves to laugh, spend time with her friends and family, and she lives each day with purpose and joy.
Her strength and grace in the face of illness is a source of inspiration, not only to her loved ones but to her entire community.
She embodies the very best of the American spirit--resilience, compassion, and unwavering love for others.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jennifer Fuhs for the life she lives, the example she has set, and the legacy she continues to build.
May she be surrounded with peace, comfort, and the knowledge that her impact will endure for generations.
