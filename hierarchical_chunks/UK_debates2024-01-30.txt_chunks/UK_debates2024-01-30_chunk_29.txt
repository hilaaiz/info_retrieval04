I thank the hon.
Lady for her rather hyperbolic intervention.
We are having a debate because two public interest intervention notices have been issued.
The Government take their powers in this respect seriously, and the Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom will be given the space and time to look into all these issues in detail.
Those notices were issued because the Secretary of State takes the issues of media freedom and the ownership of important British media institutions extremely seriously.
