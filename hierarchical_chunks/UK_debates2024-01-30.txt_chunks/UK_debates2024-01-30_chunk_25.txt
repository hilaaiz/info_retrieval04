I thank my hon.
Friend for her questions.
As she is aware, a public interest intervention notice has been issued in this case, which means that I am not able to speak to a number of the points that will likely be raised.
However, powers under the Enterprise Act 2002 allow us to look into acquisitions of this nature and to examine issues of media freedom of expression.
We also have powers under the National Security Act 2023; the Cabinet Office has a role there.
That will allow the Culture Secretary to look at some of the questions that my hon.
Friend raises.
