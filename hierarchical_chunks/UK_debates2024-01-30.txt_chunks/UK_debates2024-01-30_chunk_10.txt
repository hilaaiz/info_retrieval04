I welcome the extremely important work the Government are doing in protecting vulnerable communities around the world.
Will the Minister confirm to me that the £3 billion that the Government have committed for saving nature will be used on some of the very vulnerable habitat sites and animals around the world, such as those Environmental Audit Committee saw on a recent visit to Antarctica?
Will he particularly think about whales, fur seals and of course the emperor penguin?
