I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising an issue of principle, which I perfectly understand, as something that I speak about in relation to the BBC, and how it must have editorial independence from the Government.
As a principle, I would be concerned about Government ownership of any media institution, but as he will be aware, I can speak only of principles.
