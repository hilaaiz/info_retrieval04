What assessment have the Government made of the threat to the future of the Baltic states if Putin is seen to succeed in seizing territory permanently from Ukraine?
The Baltic states are on the frontline, and we therefore take great pride in the enhanced forward presence in the Baltic states, which includes our magnificent men and women in Tapa.
That is part of our enduring physical presence to ensure that NATO has security on the ground.
The matter is sharply in focus.
As the death toll rises in Gaza, so does the misery of women and girls in the occupied territories.
I am increasingly concerned that aid is not getting to them.
The United Nations says that there is a chronic aid access problem, and that women are having caesarean sections without anaesthetic.
What is going on?
Is the aid not getting to them?
What steps is the Department taking to ensure that it does?
Tackling this is Britain’s central aim; the aim is to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, but also to ensure that there is a plan on the west bank to take forward a political initiative.
Everything that we are doing is bent on trying to get the aid that is in the region through the narrow entrances into Gaza.
We will continue to do that.
