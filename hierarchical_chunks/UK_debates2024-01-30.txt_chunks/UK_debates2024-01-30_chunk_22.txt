I thank the hon.
Member for that question on an important subject close to the heart of several people in the Chamber.
I assure her that there is ongoing engagement with, of course, President Ali  in Guyana, but also all the regional players.
I have personally had conversations with Brazil, Colombia, the Commonwealth and the United States to keep the focus on that area, and Maduro’s plans at bay.
