There will now be an investigation by not only the Competition and Markets Authority, but Ofcom, which will look into all these questions in great detail.
That will allow the Secretary of State to make a judgment on what action she takes next.
There may potentially be a longer investigation, after which she could be offered particular remedies, or could prevent a transaction.
However, at this stage, I cannot speculate on what action she is likely to take.
