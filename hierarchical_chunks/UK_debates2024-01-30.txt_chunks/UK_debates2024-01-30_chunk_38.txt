As the hon.
Gentleman will be aware, a public notice has been issued on this matter.
Ofcom will look expressly at accurate presentation of the news and free expression of opinion when it makes its reports and judgments known.
I hope that will give him some assurance about how the media considerations will be looked at, not just the competition aspects.
I fully understand the limitations on what my hon.
Friend can say.
Having covered for her until a few weeks ago as media Minister, I was given no inside information about this matter, either.
However, she will be aware that it is now over five years since the Ofcom report to the Secretary of State that said that the internet has transformed the way that news is provided and consumed, and that there will need to be a fundamental review of the media ownership regime.
Does she agree with that, and can she say whether the Government will undertake that review?
