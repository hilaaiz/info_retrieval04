I appreciate that there is a limit to what the Minister can say about the potential sale of The Daily Telegraph to owners backed by the UAE, but are there any lessons for media freedom that the Government might learn from the creation of university branch campuses in the UAE, and what that has meant for freedom of speech?
I am afraid that is not a subject about which I know a great deal.
I shall happily look into it and see whether there are any implications for our media landscape, but I cannot comment in relation to this specific acquisition.
Does the Minister agree that the fact that we are in this position shows that clarity is needed about media ownership rules?
We need a presumption against sovereign foreign states acquiring strategic UK media assets to further their influence, just as there should one be against acquisition by a foreign oligarch who might not have a commitment to the media.
We need some certainty about how and where such an intervention can be made, and not purely on competition grounds.
That point has been raised by a number of hon.
Members.
We have tools for these kinds of acquisitions, as can be seen in the public interest intervention  notices that we have imposed in this case.
I reassure Members that we are not totally naked on this question; there are tools, under the Enterprise Act, that allow us to look into it.
I am sure that once the process is over, we will be able to look back and say whether any further action or intervention is required.
As owners expect to have influence over editors and the editorial line, why do we not have a policy of ruling out all Government ownership of such organisations, which would make it much simpler?
