I thank my right hon.
Friend for his expert cover for me.
We discussed that subject in our handover, when he told me that there was no information that he could share because he was assiduous in his role and made sure that he was not involved in areas that he should not be.
He asked about future ownership questions.
He will be aware that we are debating the Media Bill after this urgent question.
We have looked at some issues in relation to media, in particular the changing media landscape and how the internet has changed it.
That has not covered all the issues that will be raised by this acquisition, but I am sure that once that the Media Bill has completed all its stages, we will be able to look afresh at the other holes in the landscape.
