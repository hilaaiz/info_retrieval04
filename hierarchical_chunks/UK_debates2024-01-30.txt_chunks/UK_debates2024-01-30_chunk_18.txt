Access to critical minerals is vital as we face a climate and energy crisis, but this Government have repeatedly disregarded Latin America and ignored its potential.
Will the Minister commit to working with countries such as Chile, Brazil, Peru and Mexico to deliver these essential supplies for a green energy transition?
Both sides of the House agree that this is an important issue, and I can assure the hon.
Lady that we are working very hard.
I have raised the importance of critical minerals on my visits to all those countries, and not least on my recent visit to Bolivia.
By any measure our world is becoming more dangerous, not less.
I very much welcome Britain’s leadership and rekindled engagement on the international  stage, not least in Ukraine and the middle east.
Does the Minister agree that our foreign policy, our economy and, indeed, our security are interdependently related?
Given the deteriorating threat picture, would he like to see an increase in our defence posture?
My right hon.
Friend, the former Chairman of the Defence Committee, is absolutely right to focus on these threats.
The Foreign Secretary recently said that all the lights on the global dashboard are flashing red.
The Government know that the first duty of the state is to defend and protect its citizens from external aggression, and my right hon.
Friend may rest assured that that will continue to be our highest priority.
Tensions are soaring across the middle east after Washington vowed to respond to the drone attack by Iran-backed militants that killed three American soldiers.
Does the Minister share my concern that we may be dragged into another regional war at the Americans’ demand?
The American Government and the British Government have made it absolutely clear that they do not wish to see this conflict escalate more widely.
Equally, the hon.
Gentleman will accept that no country can accept with equanimity the appalling deaths of those American soldiers.
