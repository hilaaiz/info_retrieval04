I welcome the update from the Secretary of State.
The United Kingdom has led the world in supporting Ukraine—militarily, economically and diplomatically.
Our key ally, the United States, has introduced legislation, put forward by Congressman French Hill, my counterpart in the British-American parliamentary group, on seizing Russian assets and using them to rebuild Ukraine.
I introduced a similar Bill in Parliament, which is due for a Second Reading on  17 May , and I have written to the Foreign Secretary about that.
Will the Home Secretary clarify whether the United Kingdom will support the measures that the United States has introduced?
It is crucial that we do everything that we can to cut off Putin’s finances and ensure that he pays for the reconstruction of Ukraine.
