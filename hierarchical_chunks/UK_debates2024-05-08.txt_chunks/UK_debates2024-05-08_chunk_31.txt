Our response is calibrated.
It is designed to send a very clear message, as well as hampering Russia’s ability to conduct espionage here in the UK.
We will look closely at Russia’s response and whether it seeks to escalate matters.
We will always ensure that we protect our ability to have lines of communication with Russia, even during these most challenging of times.
Routes for de-escalation, error avoidance and the avoidance of miscalculation are very important.
We recognise that, and I believe that Putin’s regime in Moscow recognises that.
We will seek to maintain lines of communication, even while we take these decisive actions.
With regard to the extensive sanctions, we moved quickly, in concert with our international friends and allies.
Those sanctions are having an effect.
Of course Russia seeks to evade sanctions where it can.
While sanctions enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the Treasury, it is a cross-Government piece of work.
All parts of Government—this was very much the case when I was Foreign Secretary, speaking with our international counterparts and interlocutors—try to close off opportunities for sanctions evasion.
The defending democracy taskforce is incredibly important, particularly as we head towards a general election.
We will of course adapt, and seek to work cross-party, because it is in all our interests that we defend democracy.
I will continue to ensure that both the Security Minister
and I work closely with the shadow Front Bench and other Opposition parties’
Front-Bench teams to protect something that is incredibly valuable.
