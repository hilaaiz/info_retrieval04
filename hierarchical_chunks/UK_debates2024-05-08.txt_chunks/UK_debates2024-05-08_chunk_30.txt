I thank the right hon.
Lady for her party’s commitment to the ongoing support for Ukraine’s self-defence.
She was right to read that into the record.
There is no doubt about her commitment among Government Members.
I reassure her that we do look at the wider threats emanating from Russia.
We liaise closely with our international partners.
We suspect that other countries in the coalition of support for Ukraine are being targeted by Russia.
Those countries will take discrete, domestic actions, but I draw the House’s attention to the shared commitment set out in the North Atlantic  Council statement.
I do not have the precise quote in front of me, but from memory it said that nations will take both individual and collective action.
