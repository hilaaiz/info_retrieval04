I thank the Minister for his answers to all the questions.
The scheme was initially designed to allow short-term early release by a matter of days, yet some releases are now early by some 70 days.
Does the Minister understand why victims of crime are anxious that so-called “soft crime” criminals are getting an easier time?
Victims of crime are told that perpetrators have been released early, so the victims can prepare themselves to see those perpetrators down the town or at the local supermarket, for example, which can be extremely disconcerting, even if it is not unexpected.
