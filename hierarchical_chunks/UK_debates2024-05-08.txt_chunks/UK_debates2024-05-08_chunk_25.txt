As was reported on  Friday 26 April , five individuals have been charged in connection with an investigation into alleged offences under the National Security Act 2023, as part of a counter-terrorism policing investigation.
The offences relate to what was widely reported by the media as a suspected arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business in the UK.
The Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed that the charges relate to alleged “hostile activity in the UK in order to benefit a foreign state—namely Russia.”
I pay tribute to our law enforcement agencies for their quick and professional work to ensure these charges were brought.
They are the first charges to be brought under the new National Security Act.
Measures that this Government brought forward and this House passed are already being used to keep our country safe.
