My understanding is that the vast majority of 30 mph roads are now 20 mph.
I have seen a figure suggesting that it is around 96%—[Interruption.]
Mr Speaker, it is a blanket ban on 30 mph roads and that is exactly what the Welsh Labour Government put out there.
I can give my hon.
Friend an indication of the costs, because the Welsh Government’s own impact assessment suggested that this would cause a £4.5 billion hit to the Welsh economy and, on top of that, taxpayers have had to pay £30 million for 20 mph road signs.
This is really concerning
and I note that almost half a million people—a record number—signed a petition on the Senedd’s move, because they were so concerned about the impact that the measure will have.
It cost £33 million to implement and now it is estimated that an extra £5 million is needed to unwind the changes.
What conversations is my right hon.
Friend having with the Welsh Government to ensure that we do not see such policies again?
We certainly do not want policies such as this.
There is an anti-motorist agenda with the Welsh Labour Government that includes not only 20 mph speed limits, but legislation bringing in tolls on the M4 and a ban on any major new road projects being built.
We have even had Monmouthshire Labour Council suggesting that it might want to campaign to bring back Severn bridge tolls.
The lesson is that if people support motorists and support the right to drive a car they should vote Conservative at the next general election.
On this illogical decision to pursue a 20 mph limit, does the Minister agree that there is a lesson to be learned for a Government—in Wales or elsewhere—trying to pursue something that the general public quite clearly do not want at all?
