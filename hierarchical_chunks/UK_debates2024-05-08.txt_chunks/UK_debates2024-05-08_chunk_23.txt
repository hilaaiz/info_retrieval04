Mr Speaker, I reassure you that I was due to be meeting the Member whose constituency HMP Parc is in at this moment in time, but I am here at the Dispatch Box.
The meeting has been rescheduled and there is a date in the diary.
As I promised at the last oral questions, that meeting has been arranged.
The hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  is right to highlight that point.
Our ECSL protections are significantly more stringent than those used by the Labour party when it ran its scheme for three years.
Unlike its scheme, ours allows governors to veto the release of any prisoner when they think early release will create a risk to victims.
There are a number of exemptions from the scheme and it allows for rigorous conditions to be placed on the release licence, be it tagging, exclusion zones or curfews.
Prisoners will be well aware that if they breach those conditions, which are put in place to protect victims, they will hear the clang of the prison gate and be recalled.
