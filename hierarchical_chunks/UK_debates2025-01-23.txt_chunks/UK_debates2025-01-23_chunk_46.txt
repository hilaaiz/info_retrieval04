The Minister just mentioned balancing the public finances—those are the key words—through these measures.
We have just had the debt figures for December, which are 20% higher than the OBR expected them to be just two months previously.
At what point will the Minister and the Government recognise that they have got this badly wrong and change course?
We recognise that when the Conservative party was in government, it got it badly wrong.
The country decided to change course, which is why they elected us into government to fix the public finances, put our public services back on their feet, boost investment and get the economy growing.
They say that one ought to build one’s enemy a golden bridge.
I think the compromise and pause proposed by the National Farmers Union is an elegant solution.
That golden bridge is now being signposted by Tesco, Aldi, Lidl, the Co-op, and all the major retailers the Minister claims to be engaging with.
Why does he not just pause, go back, listen, and review the policy?
As I set out in answer to a previous question, the Government are committed to delivering the reforms announced in the Budget.
They were carefully calibrated to retain generous inheritance tax exemptions, while ensuring that we balance the public finances as fairly as possible.
Bence Builders Merchants in my constituency has been providing good local produce and good local jobs since the Earl of Aberdeen was in power.
The owner, Paul Bence, fears that the combination of business property relief changes and changes to employer’s national insurance mean that there is a huge disincentive to invest further.
Does the Minister share my constituent’s concern?
