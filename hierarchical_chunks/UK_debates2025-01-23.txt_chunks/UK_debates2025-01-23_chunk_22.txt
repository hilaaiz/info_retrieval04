I thank the Minister for his answer.
Being the MP for Leeds South West and Morley is the greatest privilege I could ask for, and constituency boundaries ensure that all parts of our country are  represented in this place.
The same is not true of the other place, which is not representative of our nations and regions.
What work is being done or considered to remedy that, to ensure that all of our communities are represented in the other place?
