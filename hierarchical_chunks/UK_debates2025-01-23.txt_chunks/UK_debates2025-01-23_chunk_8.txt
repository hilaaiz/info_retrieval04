I thank the Minister for his answer.
The high streets have become almost a battlefield with shopkeepers trying to ensure that their goods are not stolen and that they are not attacked.
In Northern Ireland, we had a problem similar to what the Minister has outlined and others have described.
What helps is having CCTV in place, and a police force that is receptive and answers quickly to urgent requests for assistance.
Has the Minister had any chance to talk to the Police and Justice Minister in Northern Ireland to ensure that what has been done here can be replicated in Northern Ireland in such a way that we can all gain?
