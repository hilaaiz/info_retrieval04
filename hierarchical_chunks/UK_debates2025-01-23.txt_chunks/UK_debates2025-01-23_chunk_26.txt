I welcome the £11.8 billion allocated in the Budget for the infected blood scandal, which is  a clear commitment from this Government that they  are acting on this injustice.
However, parents and  partners of the infected, including in my constituency of Bournemouth West, are rightly apprehensive about when they will receive compensation; many are elderly or in poor health.
Given the urgency of the situation, can the Minister outline when they might receive compensation and whether he will consider including them in the initial waves?
