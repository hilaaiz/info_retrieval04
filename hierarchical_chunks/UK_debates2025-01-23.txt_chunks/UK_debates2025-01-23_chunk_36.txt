Given the news from Germany, will the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster update the House on the work the Cabinet Office is doing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak of foot and mouth?
I am grateful to the shadow Minister for his question.
Those of us of a certain age will remember the appalling consequences of the last serious outbreak of foot and mouth in the UK, more than 20 years ago.
Let me say very clearly from this Dispatch Box that we are treating this with the utmost seriousness.
I met with Cobra officials yesterday and have asked for several briefings since the outbreak in Germany, and my colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at a ministerial and official level are taking this very seriously as well.
We know the threat that such an outbreak would pose to our farming communities, and we want to work with farmers and do everything we possibly can to protect them from it.
So far, there has been no outbreak in the UK, but we will— Order.
This is a very important subject;  I totally agree.
The trouble is, in topicals, I have to get a lot of Members in.
As this subject is so important, I would always welcome a statement on Monday.
