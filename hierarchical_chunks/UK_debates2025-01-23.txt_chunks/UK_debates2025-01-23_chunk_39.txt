I thank my hon.
Friend for the work she did to support constituents during the heavy snowfall, and I thank Barnsley council and other responders for their work.
This responsibility lies with local authorities, but I know that my colleagues in the Cabinet Office, the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are keen for authorities to receive as much support as possible.
MHCLG will be in close contact with local resilience forums to see what support they need.
