I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his reply.
Could he assure me that he is speaking to interested parties in Northern Ireland?
Given that Northern Ireland is so closely connected to Ireland, which is part of the EU, farmers there are consequently very concerned that they may be affected by any spread of the disease.
Will he therefore assure me that he is undertaking that work?
