There will be a rally on Saturday, and the Minister appears to imagine that this indicates acclamation for his policy.
We heard earlier in the week from  the hon.
Member for Falkirk (Euan Stainbank)  and today from  the hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West (Chi Onwurah) —both well-known rural areas—that this is all about the landed estates and wealthy people, but I can assure the Minister that the farmers I will speak with in Castle Douglas on Saturday are tenant farmers and family farmers, and they face being put off the land after generations.
Is he really suggesting that I should tell them they have nothing to worry about?
I am not going to tell the hon.
Gentleman what he should say to his constituents, but what I can tell him about the Government’s policy is that we have reserved generous inheritance tax reliefs for people in  the situations he describes.
I encourage anyone who is concerned to seek advice, to understand exactly how the new rules might apply to them.
Sometimes I am absolutely flummoxed—we probably all are—by the Chancellor’s intent to tax working family farms, which we all know will result in the loss of small farms, the sale of the land and a reduction in food security.
Now it seems that the OBR agrees that it will not make savings.
Will the Minister commit to meeting Cabinet colleagues urgently to remove the sword of Damocles that is hanging above small family farms and hurting the agrifood sector as a whole?
I say to the Minister that there is a way forward: increase the threshold from £1 million to £5 million, and family farms will be saved.
