What steps he is taking with Cabinet colleagues to implement the Government’s plan for change.
Since we launched the plan for change last month, we have published the elective reform plan to get NHS waiting lists down and the AI opportunities plan so that the UK is a great home for AI investment and the Government make the most of this technology.
The aim of the plan for change is to increase living standards, cut NHS waiting lists, boost energy security, give children the best start in life, make our streets safer, and build the houses that the country needs for the future.
Just today, we have announced measures to stop repeated judicial review attempts from holding up major investment projects that are in the national interest.
