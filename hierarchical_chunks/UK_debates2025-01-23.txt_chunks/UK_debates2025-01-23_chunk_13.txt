I welcome my hon.
Friend’s question.
The AI opportunities action plan gives us great opportunities and shows how seriously we take this matter.
I know that organisations such as Code First Girls are doing important work providing free coding courses for women.
I thank them for that.
It is really important in pursuing this plan that we have the skilled people to do it.
I am pleased to say that much of the cyber-security work in Government is led by outstanding women.
We want more people with the right skills, so well done to Code First Girls, which we look forward to continuing to work with.
