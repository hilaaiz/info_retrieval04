The legal representatives of the complex web of stakeholders in the infected blood and affected communities remain concerned about the status of the arm’s length body, the appeals process and the role of victims in the oversight board.
I am absolutely clear that the Infected Blood Compensation Authority has the necessary authority and will work through those issues.
I urge the Minister to work with and reassure the victims’ representatives, so that the lawyers can be more constructive in supporting these people along this difficult pathway.
No doubt hon.
Members will come in with more questions, but does the Minister agree with me that we need to move forward in a constructive manner?
Yes, the right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right.
I look forward to the former Paymaster General’s reflections after his visit next week.
I was delighted yesterday to meet the user consultants— three victims; two infected, one affected—who are certainly making their voice heard at the Infected Blood Compensation Authority.
That voice of victims is hugely important, as is the constructive approach the right hon.
Gentleman has indicated.
