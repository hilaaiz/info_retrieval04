I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, but I think it was based primary on the OBR publication yesterday.
I reiterate the point I have made several times now: that OBR publication reiterated the costings and figures set out at the Budget, it reiterated the level of uncertainty associated with the measure, as published at the Budget, it provides more detail behind that, but the conclusion is the same as it was on  30 October .
