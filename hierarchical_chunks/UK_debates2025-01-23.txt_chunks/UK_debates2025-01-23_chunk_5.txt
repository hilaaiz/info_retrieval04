Vibrant town centres are so important for the health of our local economies.
Under the Conservatives, shop lifting was allowed to spiral out of control and we are still dealing with the consequences.
Not too long ago, in Hucknall, a shopworker was brutally  attacked.
When I speak to local residents and businesses across Sherwood Forest, they tell me that this kind of antisocial behaviour has meant that they do not want to go out into town at night.
Can the Minister confirm that the measures announced in the plan for change will deliver safer streets and be a boost to local economies?
I am very sorry to hear about the distressing attack on the shopworker in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
Everyone should be free to go to work without the fear of being attacked while doing their job.
I am pleased to say that, under this Government, assaulting a shopworker will be made a separate criminal offence.
My hon.
Friend is right to say that, on top of that, we need to do more to ensure that our town centres are safe.
Restoring community policing with the additional police officers and police community support officers that we plan will enable all our constituents to visit their town centres and go about their business with peace and confidence.
