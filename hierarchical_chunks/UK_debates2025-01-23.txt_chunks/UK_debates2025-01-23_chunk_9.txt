Not for the first time, the hon.
Gentleman speaks a lot of common sense.
Wherever people are in the UK, they want the freedom to go about their business—shopping, work or whatever it is—in peace.
We believe that some of those measures, such as CCTV, are important.
So too is community policing.
I am very happy to have a positive and constructive dialogue with the Administration in Northern Ireland and all the devolved Governments on these issues.
Powers in these  areas are devolved, but we share a common interest in protecting the public and ensuring that our streets and communities are safe.
