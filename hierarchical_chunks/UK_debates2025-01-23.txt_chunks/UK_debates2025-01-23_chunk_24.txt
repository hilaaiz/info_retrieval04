I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his update to the House.
I note the press release that went out yesterday, and no doubt there will be another one on  5 March , the day before the next Cabinet Office questions.
However, I want to be constructive in my approach; I, too, will be visiting the Infected Blood Compensation Authority in Newcastle, next Thursday.
