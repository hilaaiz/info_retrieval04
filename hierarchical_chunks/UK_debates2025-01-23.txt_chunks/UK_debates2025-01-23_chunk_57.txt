Oh, sorry, Mr Speaker.
I am so used to being called last.
[Laughter.]
My humblest apologies.
My motivation is clearly justice for the innocent victims; that is what I am about.
At the heart of this urgent question is Gerry Adams.
When this House put in place a pension for innocent victims of the troubles and at that time excluded perpetrators from applying, Gerry Adams and his colleagues sought to block those pensions.
Adams’ hands are dripping with innocent blood, not least from when he was the commander of the La Mon bombing, which killed and maimed my constituents.
Will the Attorney General recuse himself from all matters relating to Adams, and will this Government ensure that Adams does not get one single penny?
As I have already stated, the Law Officers’ convention does not permit me to reveal when the Attorney General has been asked for advice or when he has advised.
I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests as a member of the Bar.
It seems that Conservative Members are deliberately feigning ignorance about our constitution to make an empty political point.
The truth is that lawyers in this country represent clients without fear or favour.
We do not in this country associate the views of our clients or the clients with the views of their lawyers, and there is the concept of the cab rank rule.
Does the Solicitor General agree with me that the Law Officers’ convention and existing processes, which, as she says, have been in place for many years under successive Governments, can be left to regulate conflicts of interest, as they  always have done?
If the Conservatives genuinely had a problem with that, they would have changed it when they were in government.
I agree with my hon.
Friend, and I am grateful to him for making that point.
As I said earlier, barristers are quite simply not their clients, and I have quoted the words of the current Conservative shadow Attorney General.
