I welcome the announcement on the judicial review proposals.
The Government’s plan for change is an important endeavour, which will need not just Cabinet colleagues but civil servants to row in behind it.
Is the Minister able to tell the House how he is marshalling and co-ordinating political and official activities to deliver that, and who will hold the circle to deliver across Government, rather than just in silos?
