I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising his constituent’s concern.
I do not know the specifics of the case, but more broadly, investment decisions depend above all else on a stable economy and stable public finances.
Without the hard work that we have done since taking office to fix the public finances and bring back economic stability, investment would be hampered, and our growth ambitions would not materialise in the way that we are determined to ensure happens.
