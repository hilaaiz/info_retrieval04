Does the Solicitor General agree that what the shadow Solicitor General is asking her to do, in a not very subtle way, is to breach the Law Officers’ convention by the back door?
If the Attorney General were to reveal whether or not he is able to advise on a particular issue, that would reveal the fact that he had been asked to advise on it.
The Opposition’s intention is clear: it is to gain party advantage.
The effect is to undermine the rule of law.
I very much agree with my hon.
Friend.
I am happy to confirm that where the Attorney General has conflicts, he will recuse himself.
