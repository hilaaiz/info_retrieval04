Mrs. PELTOLA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember a very special Alaskan.
On August 25th, a devastating landslide in Ketchikan destroyed homes and took a fellow Alaskan from us.
That Alaskan was Sean Griffin.
Sean was a selfless husband, father, son, neighbor, and public servant.
Ketchikan families knew him for his positive spirit and his devotion to his friends, family, and community.
At the time of the landslide, Sean, a senior maintenance technician for the city, was clearing stormwater drains on his day off.
It's heartbreaking to see that such a model Alaskan and public servant is now gone from our Ketchikan community.
He will be so deeply missed.
Earlier this month, I witnessed the landslide damage in Ketchikan firsthand.
It was horrific.
Alaskans had their entire lives uprooted.
Our delegation will be working closely with those affected to make sure Ketchikan is safe.
But Sean was taken from us too soon.
I am sharing my deepest condolences to his friends, family and all those whose lives he touched.
May he rest in peace.
