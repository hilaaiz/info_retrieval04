Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and privileged to recognize the Friendship Hose Company No. 1 on their 150th Anniversary.
Their selfless and tireless service to the community, Commonwealth, and Nation is the standard by which we should all be judged.
I wish them Godspeed in their continued endeavors and pray for their safety and security for years to come.
