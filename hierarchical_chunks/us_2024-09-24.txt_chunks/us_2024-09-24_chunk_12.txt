Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Natalia Shevtsova, who worked in partnership with her peers to put together a Fight Back Against Fentanyl PSA.
Natalia is from St. Paul, Minnesota.
Her sister, Anastasia, loved playing the piano, singing, painting and drawing.
On April 20, 2022, Natalia lost her sister, Anastasia, to fentanyl poisoning.
She purchased what she thought was Percocet marketed by a dealer.
Those pills turned out to contain fentanyl.
Anastasia was 15 years old.
The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Natalia, produced an impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl.
In turning her grief into activism, Natalia has shown strength and courage beyond her years.
I am proud to have her as an ally in this fight against the fentanyl crisis.
I thank Natalia for sharing Anastasia's story and demonstrating a commitment to combating the opioid crisis.
