Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the historic Friendship Hose Company No. 1 on its 150th Anniversary.
The Friendship Hose Company No. 1 has provided fire protection dating back to the 1830s--with the purchase of a fire engine called ``Juno''-- originating in Newville Pennsylvania.
Formally established on January 14, 1874, the then-Newville Fire Company officially formed and elected its first officers.
Facing the continuous challenges of staffing and funding, the Friendship Hose Company No. 1 endured and prevailed when other fire companies fell short.
Over the past 150 years, the Friendship Hose Company No. 1 has operated out of three locations in our community, has had hundreds of members, and currently operates with approximately 20-25 active volunteers.
Under the current leadership of President Trent Wagner and Fire Chief David Bobb, the Company continues to serve our community through tireless service and heroic work in fire protection.
