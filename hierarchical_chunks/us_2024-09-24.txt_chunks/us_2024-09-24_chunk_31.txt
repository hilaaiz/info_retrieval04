Representative Morrison's service extended beyond her district and into key leadership positions at the state level.
Prior to running for office, she served as Executive Director of the Governor's Commission for Women under Governor George W. Bush, and she was appointed to the Texas Commission for Volunteerism and Community Service and the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission.
Her long-standing dedication to public service has earned her numerous awards, including the Boy Scouts of America South Texas Council's Distinguished Citizen Award, the Victoria Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award, and recognition as one of South Texas' Women of the Year.
These accolades are a testament to her unwavering commitment to her constituents and her deep-rooted belief in the importance of community involvement.
As 
Representative Morrison embarks on this new chapter of her life, it is my honor to recognize her remarkable career and thank her for her faithful service to Texas.
We are better off having had someone of Geanie's caliber involved in public service.
May God bless her and her family in the days and years ahead.
