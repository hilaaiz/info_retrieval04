Representative Morrison's legislative record is filled with notable achievements, but one of her most profound and life-saving contributions is her authorship of the country's first Safe Haven ``Baby Moses'' law, passed in 1999.
This legislation provides a compassionate and responsible alternative for desperate mothers who may otherwise feel they have no choice but to abandon their newborns.
Through the Safe Haven law, mothers are given the option to safely and legally surrender their babies at designated locations, such as hospitals or fire stations, without fear of prosecution.
This law has had an immeasurable impact on saving lives.
Since its passage, hundreds of newborns across Texas have been safely surrendered, and all 50 states have since implemented similar measures.
Thanks to 
Representative Morrison's initiative, countless lives have been saved and will continue to be.
