Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER.
Mr. Speaker, I was attending a funeral of a family friend this weekend, and my flight back to DC on Monday was severely delayed due to maintenance, causing me to miss the vote series.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 440; YEA on Roll Call No. 441; and YEA on Roll Call No. 442.
