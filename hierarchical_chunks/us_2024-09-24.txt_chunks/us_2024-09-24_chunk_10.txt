worked in partnership with her peers to put together a Fight Back Against Fentanyl PSA.
Natalia is from St. Paul Park, Minnesota.
She has proven her commitment to combating the opioid crisis through her advocacy and work with the Devin Norring Foundation.
The Devin Norring Foundation was established to honor Devin's legacy and raise awareness about the dangers of illicit drugs and fentanyl.
On April 4, 2020, Devin passed away from fentanyl poisoning.
He was seeking relief from blackout migraines and dental pain.
He bought what he thought was Percocet marketed by a drug dealer on Snapchat.
That pill turned out to be 100 percent fentanyl.
Devin was 19 years old.
The Devin Norring Foundation, in partnership with Natalia, produced an impactful and heartfelt PSA to fight back against fentanyl.
In turning grief into activism, Natalia has shown strength and courage beyond her years.
I am proud to have her as a constituent and an ally in this fight against the fentanyl crisis.
I thank Natalia for demonstrating a commitment to combating the opioid crisis.
