Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, I would like to recognize the mayor of Glendale, Arizona, Jerry Weiers.
Originally born in South Dakota, Mayor Weiers moved to Phoenix as a child where he went on to serve in the Arizona House of Representatives before becoming mayor of Glendale in 2012.
Outside of public service, Mayor Weiers was also a proud small-business owner and family man.
During his time in both the state legislature and as mayor of Glendale, Mayor Weiers has been a strong advocate for the military and veterans, reduced bureaucratic red tape, and created conditions for small businesses to thrive.
As mayor, he has created a thriving business-sector through public-private partnerships, increased public safety, worked toward reducing homelessness, and been a strong advocate for Luke Air Force Base and Glendale's veterans.
His successes in public service have left a lasting impact on both the Glendale community and the state of Arizona as a whole.
I thank him for his service.
