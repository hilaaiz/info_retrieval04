Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the exceptional work demonstrated by Shelly McLaren, who selflessly dedicates her life to ensuring individuals feel comfort following life-altering events across the State of Iowa and the United States.
This remarkable woman demonstrates an exceptional volunteer commitment to serve our communities.
As the team lead for the Iowa chapter of Crisis Response Canines (CRC), a national nonprofit that provides comfort visits and crisis response support following traumatic incidents, she has made an indelible mark on Iowa communities and beyond.
Her dedication to rigorous training has earned both her and her canine partner, Jacks, the highest certifications.
Embracing the credo ``Purpose Beyond Oneself,'' she is committed to selflessly caring for those experiencing life-altering traumatic events.
She consistently shows an unparalleled ability to mobilize swiftly in response to crises, coordinating with operations leaders to support those impacted by critical incidents.
During these interactions, she and Jacks bring their healing, compassionate presence to individuals enduring the most traumatic events of their lives.
Their deployments include responding to the January 4, 2024, shooting in Perry, Iowa; assisting in Minden and Greenfield, Iowa, following spring 2024 tornadoes; and most recently, aiding multiple counties in northwestern Iowa after severe storms and flooding.
When not responding to tragic events, she and Jacks are a well-known and respected team, visiting community organizations and attending special events.
Her work has inspired others to join, creating a ripple effect that strengthens the community's ability to respond to crises effectively.
The countless lives touched by her compassion and dedication serve as a testament to the lasting impact of her volunteerism.
