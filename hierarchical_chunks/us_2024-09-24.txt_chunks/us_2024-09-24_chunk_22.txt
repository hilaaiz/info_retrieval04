Mr. LOPEZ.
Mr. Speaker, Colorado native Jennifer Jaime is a testament and great example of the hardworking students Colorado has to offer.
She is a first-generation student from metro Denver, and enrolled in CU Denver in 2017, and participated in the Marc U-Star Program--a scholarship program for students interested research careers and plan in pursuing their Ph.D's in behavioral and biomedical sciences.
Through the MARC U-program Jennifer participated in a summer research program at Princeton University.
She graduated in 2019 with a BA in psychology and was admitted to the University of Michigan's competitive Neuroscience Graduate Program for her doctorate.
Jaime received her PhD in May 2024 and has chosen to return to Colorado for her post graduate work at CU Anschutz where she started her post-doctoral fellowship in August 2024.
It is my distinct privilege as the United States 
Representative of the 4th District of Colorado to congratulate Jennifer for her hard work in achieving this accomplishment and I'm so glad she chose to return home to Colorado.
Welcome home to Jennifer, and I thank her for her example and the research she is doing.
