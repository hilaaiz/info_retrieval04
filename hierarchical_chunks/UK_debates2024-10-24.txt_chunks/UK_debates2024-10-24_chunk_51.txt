I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I reiterate that the Government have inherited a terrible legacy, not only on special educational needs and disabilities, but on our public spending and the state of our public services overall.
The example he raises is good, as it highlights the importance of working  across Government to resolve issues and help the families who need support.
Whether that is done through the education system, which my Department is responsible for, or through the health service, we need to work collaboratively across Government to address the huge backlogs that far too many people face in getting the support that they need.
I can assure him that that is a priority for us.
