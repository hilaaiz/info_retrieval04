I congratulate the Government on trying to use the missions to stop the siloed working between Departments in order to achieve the change that the country needs.
On the housing mission, it is important that we link in the Treasury and the Departments for Health and Social Care, for Transport, for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Energy Security and Net Zero, to ensure that we build the 1.5 million homes that we need.
In Milton Keynes, we have seen how house building can create opportunities, but public support is lost when the necessary vital public services and infra- structure do not come alongside new houses.
How is the Cabinet Office bringing together all those Departments so that we can achieve our housing mission?
