Can the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster provide an update on the current situation for British nationals in Lebanon, including the measures being taken to ensure their safety?
Are there any plans for further evacuations, given the ongoing instability in that region?
The situation in Lebanon is serious, and there are several thousand UK nationals in Lebanon.
The Foreign Office advice for some time has been simple: leave now.
The Government have chartered several flights to help UK nationals to leave.
We are also running a “register your presence” site, to ensure we can track anyone who is in country and have the best possible communications with them.
We have made preparations for other evacuation measures, should they be necessary for the protection of our citizens in Lebanon.
