I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the importance of housing, which is central to what we are doing in government.
Each of our five national missions is ambitious and will require input and action from a number of Government Departments.
That is precisely why we are running them as missions, and not in the traditional departmental silos.
As would be expected, the Cabinet Office is key to supporting that; the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is deputy chair on all mission boards, and myself are playing active roles in facilitating that cross-Government working, supported by a specialist mission delivery unit in the Cabinet office.
