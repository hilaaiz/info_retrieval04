I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and commend the work of the Ayrshire chamber of commerce and businesses in his constituency.
The Prime Minister has set a clear direction for missions to mobilise action beyond Government, including across business, civil society and local government.
Missions require wider sectoral and societal engagement and action across the UK; they are not simply tasks for one agency or sector.
I am pleased by the progress that we are making in this area, and was delighted last week to see the launch of the civil society covenant, which marked a new beginning in the Government’s relationship with, and made clear the pivotal role of, civil society in delivering our missions.
