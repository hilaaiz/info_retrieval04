I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
She rightly identifies the need to ensure that we have the right school places for children whose needs are currently not being met in the most productive way possible.
We are open to meeting hon.
Members to discuss where in their constituencies this can best be achieved.
I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss this further.
