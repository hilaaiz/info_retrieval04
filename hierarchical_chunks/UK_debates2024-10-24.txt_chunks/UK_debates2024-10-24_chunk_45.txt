The National Audit Office report could not be clearer: children and young people and their families are being failed by a SEND system that cannot meet their needs, and local authorities are being driven to the edge of a financial precipice by a £3.4 billion funding gap.
This Government have inherited an appalling legacy.
The Government are clear that their focus is on the early identification of need and the inclusivity of mainstream schools, but the report notes that there is currently no process or funding to support early identification, and no specific funding or Ofsted measure on SEND support or inclusivity.
Can the Minister say more about how the Government will provide the resources and the levers of accountability to address the scale of the crisis?
Order.
Can Members please all look to the Chair?
You are speaking to me, not the Minister.
Look to the Chair, so I can hear, and then I can help.
Minister, you can be a good example for everybody.
