I thank the hon.
Lady for raising the issue and bringing it to the House.
She is absolutely right to draw attention to the National Audit Office report and its damning indictment of a system that has lost the confidence of families and is failing children with special educational needs and disabilities.
She rightly calls for the system to be reformed.
That is what this Government are absolutely focused on and determined to do.
