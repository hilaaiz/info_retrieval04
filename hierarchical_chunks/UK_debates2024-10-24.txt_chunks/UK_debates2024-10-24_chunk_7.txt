rose— That was a dramatic pause—apologies.
Where the public has been defrauded, will we get our money back for public services?
My hon.
Friend can see just how keen I am to act on this issue.
He is right that taxpayers are paying the price for the Conservative Government allowing waste and fraud to spiral out of control.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer recently took decisive action by appointing a new covid counter-fraud commissioner to help us recover public money and ensure that this never happens again.[Official Report,  11 November 2024 ; Vol. 756, c. 5WC.]
(Correction) I am working closely with the Public Sector Fraud Authority to push every avenue to detect fraud, from advanced artificial intelligence and analytics through to strengthening our enforcement powers.
Does the Minister agree that, when done right, public procurement can deliver positive change in our communities, especially given the poor state in which the previous Government left the public finances?
What steps will she take to ensure that social value is properly embedded in our procurement frameworks, while delivering value for taxpayers and contributing to growth in our local economies?
I agree that procurement can be a powerful tool for delivering change in our society.
Public sector procurement can help to drive our ambitions around growth, opening up opportunities for communities across the UK.
The Government are currently consulting on a new national procurement policy statement that will set out our expectations around mission delivery and social value.
