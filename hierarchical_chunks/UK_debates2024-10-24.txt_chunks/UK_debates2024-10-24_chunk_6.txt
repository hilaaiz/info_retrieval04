I thank the Minister for mentioning cronyism in her answer.
The biggest procurement scandal I have seen in my lifetime was under the last Conservative Government, when Ministers gave dodgy contracts to their mates and donors.
They took our country’s reputation for honesty and integrity and trashed it.
Residents in my constituency are not only angry but disgusted and ashamed.
Will the Minister update the House on the steps the Government are taking to ensure that there will never be a repeat of this episode?
