The Minister will be well aware that thousands of low-paid workers are being exploited on outsourced contracts in Government buildings, including cleaners, security guards and people in catering.
Will he update the House on what progress is being made to in-source these jobs?
After all, they are critical to the efficient operation of Parliament.
Whether workers are working in-sourced or outsourced, we always want them to have a good deal and a fair deal at work.
That is why the Government  brought forward this week a powerful Bill to improve employment rights for people right across the board.
We believe that when people go to work they deserve fair pay and decent conditions.
Figures from London councils show that three in 10 Londoners who were turned away from polling stations due to a lack of appropriate voter ID did not return to vote.

It is very important that the voter ID system does not prevent people who have a legitimate right to vote from exercising their democratic right, so we are keeping it under review, and we are already making a change to make it easier for veterans to get the ID necessary to vote.
