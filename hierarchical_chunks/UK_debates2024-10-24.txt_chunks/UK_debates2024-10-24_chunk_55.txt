I thank the Minister for her statement on this damning report on SEND.
Last week, the Minister and the Secretary of State visited my constituency.
We went to Mount Pleasant Primary, a shining example of inclusive mainstream SEND provision in the state sector.
Does the Minister agree with me and the teachers there that children with physical conditions and disabilities could be referred for an EHCP by their GP much earlier, so that they arrive at school with everything they need in place, ready to excel in their education?
