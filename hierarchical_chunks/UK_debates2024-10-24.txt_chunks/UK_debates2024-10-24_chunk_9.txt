Supporting SMEs through procurement is a huge priority for the Government.
It is one of the things that we are consulting on as part of the new national procurement policy statement that I talked about.
We are looking across our work in government to ensure that SMEs are part of the procurement process.
This is a subject on which we will come back to the House.
What recent discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Defence on pay awards for employees of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.
The Royal Fleet Auxiliary staff do excellent work on behalf of the Royal Navy and for our national security, and I pay tribute to them for that work.
I have been in contact with the Secretary of State for Defence on this issue.
I am hopeful that a resolution can be found on the pay matters currently under discussion between Nautilus, the RMT and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and that the current dispute can be resolved.
