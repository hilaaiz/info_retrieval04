The Minister for the Cabinet Office was asked— What steps he is taking with Cabinet colleagues to increase the Government’s ability to respond to companies in distress.
The Government take very seriously our role to ensure the resilience of Government suppliers.
The Cabinet Office takes an active role in monitoring the Government’s strategic suppliers and putting in place contingency plans where there is risk of distress.
More broadly, the Cabinet Office works alongside other Departments, from the Department for Business and Trade and the Insolvency Service to the Treasury.
We are supported by UK Government Investments, which is the Government’s centre of excellence in corporate finance, with experience of corporate finance, restructuring and insolvency in the private sector.
Any taxpayer support must be used wisely, balancing the need to ensure value for money and support jobs and the economy.

What steps he is taking to reform public procurement.
What steps he is taking to reform public procurement.
We will end the waste, inefficiency and cronyism that set in under the previous Government.
Under this Government, procurement will deliver value for money, better public services and our national missions.
As a first step, we are bringing forward a new national procurement policy statement under the Procurement Act 2023, which will deliver a mission-led procurement regime.
It will drive value for money, economic growth and social value.
We have also taken steps to cut down on wasteful consultancy spending, and have worked to set up a new covid counter-fraud commissioner.
As set out in our plan to make work pay, we will also take further reforms set out in our manifesto.
