Cambridgeshire county council is failing to meet the conditions of the dedicated school grants safety valve agreement, with only 5% of EHCPs being granted within the 20-week timeframe; the average in England is 49%.
Families in my constituency face huge challenges in ensuring that their children’s education is not disrupted or negatively impacted.
How do the Government plan to address these unacceptable delays?
The hon.
Member is right to identify those challenges.
In its analysis, published today, the National Audit Office said that the current system was not working and not serving the needs of children and their families in the way that it should.
We are moving at pace to review the system in a wholesale way, and the changes that I have outlined will support that.
In addition, we will legislate to ensure that local authorities can plan properly for places and admissions in their areas.
We want every state school, regardless of how they were established, to co-operate in ensuring that places are there for the children who need them.
I have outlined a whole range of changes that will seek to address the problem that he mentioned.
I am in no doubt that the Labour Government have a terrible inheritance on SEND provision, but children in my constituency of Easington who rely on services provided by the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust face unreasonably long waiting times.
Incredibly, they have to wait up to five years for assessments for autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other related conditions.
What steps is the Minister taking to reduce those unacceptably long waiting lists, and support both children and their families during these lengthy waits for assessments?
