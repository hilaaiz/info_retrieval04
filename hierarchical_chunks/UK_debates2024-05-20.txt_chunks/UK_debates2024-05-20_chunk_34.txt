I thank the Minister for advance sight of his statement.
The conflict has now gone on for 226 days.
That is 226 days of destruction; 226 days of Israeli hostages still in chains; 226 days that have led to 35,000 Palestinian deaths; and 226 days where the risk of further regional escalation worsens every day.
We will keep repeating our call until it happens: there must be an immediate ceasefire, as this House supported through Labour’s motion and as demanded by the United Nations Security Council resolution.
Diplomatic pressure must now go into overdrive to bring the fighting to an end.
