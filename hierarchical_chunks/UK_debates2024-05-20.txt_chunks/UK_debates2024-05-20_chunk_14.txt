Nothing is unconditional.
The point I have made this morning is that we are supporting our ally overcome a devastating terrorist attack.
We do that because it is the honourable thing to do.
Simultaneously, we make the point to our ally that the protection of civilian lives must be at the top of the operational agenda.
Furthermore, we use our military capability to ensure that humanitarian aid can flow into Gaza as quickly as possible.
In the light of the damning International Criminal Court statement today, how concerned is the Minister about the potential impact on the UK’s military relationship with Israel?
It has no bearing.
We will make our judgments about the legality of our actions on our own terms, and we are confident in that legality.
Whether he has made an assessment of the adequacy of military resources allocated by the UK to Operation Shader to help deter Iranian attacks.
Our armed forces, through Operation Shader, which is focused really on the Daesh threat in Iraq, continue to support the development of the Iraqi Government in terms of their security.
We commend and thank the men and women involved in Operation Shader throughout the region.
We do that in the knowledge that Iran is indeed a threat that is undermining regional stability.
