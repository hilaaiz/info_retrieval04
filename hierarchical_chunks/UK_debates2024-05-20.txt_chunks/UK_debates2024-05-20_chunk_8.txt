What recent assessment his Department has made of trends in the level of harassment and bullying cases in the armed forces.
Mr Speaker, I will by all means answer the question.
In 2023, 262 service complaints relating to bullying, harassment and discrimination were ruled admissible, compared with 227 in 2022.
I am pleased to say that changes to the service complaints system in June 2022 have been encouraging people to come forward with their complaints.
The “My Complaint” app, which launched in October, will make the system easier and more accessible.
The defence anti-bullying hotline is a great step forward in ensuring that members of the armed forces have the support that they need, any time of day or night.
Can the Minister tell me what training advisers have had, not only on how to help our armed forces, but on ensuring that everything is completely anonymised, so that people can go forward with their life and get the support and help that they need?
Obviously a hotline is no good if the individuals at the other end of it are not trained.
I can give my hon.
Friend the assurance he seeks.
The most important thing is to ensure that people have confidence that if they come forward with complaints, they will be listened to and taken seriously.
