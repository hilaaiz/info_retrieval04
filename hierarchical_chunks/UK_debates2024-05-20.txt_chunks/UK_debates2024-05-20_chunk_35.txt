Labour has been opposed to an Israeli offensive in Rafah for months.

When we last met on this subject, I asked the Deputy Foreign Secretary to confirm whether he or the Foreign Secretary had received from Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office officials any assessment or policy advice—not legal advice—that the threshold had already been met.
He dodged the question, and did not answer.
I repeat that question to him today.
The whole House will be interested in his response.
