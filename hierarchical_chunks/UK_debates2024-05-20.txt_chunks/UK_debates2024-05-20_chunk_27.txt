In Brixham the anger is palpable, the frustration is apparent and the sheer inconvenience that has been put on residents by South West Water is absolutely abhorrent.
I have spent the past week and weekend delivering leaflets that South West Water should have been delivering —it has failed to update residents on the situation before them.
I have spoken with residents and businesses about compensation and the reputational damage suffered by Brixham, one of this country’s finest coastal communities.
Last week, South West Water was accused of making people ill, not by an organisation, but by Tanya Matthews in a Facebook post.
That post received 1,200 responses in which people identified common symptoms, yet South West Water did nothing.
For 24 hours, people were still able to drink the water and South West Water continued to say that there was no problem.
The reason 46 people are ill—and that is most certainly an underestimation—is the time period in which they were able to go on drinking the water.
Of course, it is welcome news that the Alstom reservoir has been cleared and independent monitoring and verification has been undertaken by the UK Health Security Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate, but it is still wholly unacceptable that the 8,000 residents in the Hillhead reservoir area are still dependent on bottled water and cannot trust their water systems.
In the 21st century, that is a totally unacceptable position for us to be in.
South West Water and its management carry the responsibility for it.
