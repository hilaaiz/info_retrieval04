The global combat air programme will be a terrific boost to our defence and aerospace industries.
To maximise success, we must keep the Typhoon production lines going until it comes on board, so what are Ministers doing to ensure that we maintain exports?
The Chair of the Select Committee asks an excellent question, and I assure him that there is an effort across Government to promote key defence exports, not least the Typhoon.
A key factor in our new integrated procurement model is the need to drive exportability.
That will not only ensure industrial resilience, but give us protection against overly exquisite requirements from the domestic side, which can result in delayed procurement.
It is a good question, and we are focused on delivering greater defence exports.
Somerset is home to several organisations in the defence sector, such as Thales and Leonardo.
However, companies in defence are concerned about the shortage in science, technology, engineering and maths skills in the UK; 48% of defence employers report a shortage of workers with engineering skills.
What steps is the Minister taking, alongside Cabinet colleagues, to remedy those shortages and ensure that the UK defence sector remains competitive?
The hon.
Lady asks a good question.
There was a previous question about defence capacity; a key part of that is not just industrial capacity and buildings, but people.
She is absolutely right.
I visited Yeovilton in Somerset, where I met apprentices who are involved in the programme for our helicopters.
We saw a demo of artificial intelligence that is helping us to improve the availability of our helicopters.
Work is happening across defence and across Government, but we want to do more to ensure that we have the necessary apprentices and key skills in our defence sector.
