I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
A local manufacturer and a number of residents in my constituency have raised concerns that products, such as cosmetics or first aid kits, sold on e-commerce sites like Temu not only undercut local producers but may fail to meet high UK quality and safety standards.
What is the Department doing to ensure that products sold by online retailers continue to meet high-quality UK trading standards?
