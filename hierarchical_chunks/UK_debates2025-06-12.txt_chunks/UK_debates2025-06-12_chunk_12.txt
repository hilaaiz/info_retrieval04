As my hon.
Friend  the Member for Gordon and Buchan (Harriet Cross)  made clear earlier, the ONS statistics are very clear: 109,000 fewer on payroll in May alone and 276,000 fewer since the autumn Budget.
As UKHospitality points out, the NICs changes were “felt most intensely by foundational sectors like hospitality,” which “necessitates an urgent review”.
My question to the Minister is simple: where will his red line sit?
How many more jobs have to come off payroll before the Department for Business and Trade will stand up to the Treasury on this?
Another 100,000?
A million?
Where is the line?
Again, it is interesting that those on the Conservative Front Bench do not seem to be in agreement with their own leader any more about the national insurance hikes.
I will just point out some statistics to the hon.
Member: the International Monetary Fund has predicted that growth will increase this year and the Lloyds business barometer found that business confidence was up.
We are putting money back into people’s pockets and investing in this country.
We are doing things that the Conservatives failed to do for 14 years and that is why they are out of power.
What steps his Department is taking to encourage small businesses to export.
Just last month, we relaunched the Board of Trade to focus on the targeted support and help that small businesses need to take up opportunities from the UK’s free trade agreements.
The recent trade deals with India, the United States and the European Union aim to reduce red tape, improve customs processes, slash tariffs and open new markets for small exporters up and down the UK.
Small businesses—like Rezon in my constituency, which makes groundbreaking brain protection sports headwear—are working hard to grow and export, but it is often hard to know where to get the right advice.
What practical support are the Government giving to small businesses to help them export and take full advantage of those trade deals?
