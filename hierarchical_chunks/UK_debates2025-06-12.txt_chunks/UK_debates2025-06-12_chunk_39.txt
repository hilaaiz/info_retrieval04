I welcome the new banking hub in Penistone, which I visited this week.
However, other parts of my constituency remain a banking desert.
The Stocksbridge and Deepcar Townswomen’s Guild raised the urgent need for a hub in Stocksbridge and we desperately need one in Chapeltown too.
Otherwise, my constituents have to trek all the way to the centre of Sheffield to have cash access and to receive in-person advice from their bank.
Will the Leader of the House advise me on how I can secure those essential grassroots financial services for those areas in my constituency?
