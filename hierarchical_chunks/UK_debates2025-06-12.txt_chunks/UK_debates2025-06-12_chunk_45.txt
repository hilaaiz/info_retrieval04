I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the issue of homeschooling.
She is right to say that many families provide high-quality and important education for their children where it is not available to them in the mainstream.
I am sure that she will agree that we must tackle absenteeism in school, which is particularly rife since covid, and that we need to get more children back into mainstream education.
Although children are home- schooled for good reason, some are not safe at home, and we must take steps to deal with that.
