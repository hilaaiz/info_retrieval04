I thank my hon.
Friend for her question; she is absolutely right to raise it.
UK product safety law is clear: all products must be safe before they are placed on the market.
As she sets out, goods sold via online marketplaces are becoming a significant problem.
That is why we introduced the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill, which will allow the introduction of clear obligations for e-commerce businesses, in order to ensure consumer safety and a level playing field.
We intend to consult on product safety requirements for online marketplaces very shortly after Royal Assent.
