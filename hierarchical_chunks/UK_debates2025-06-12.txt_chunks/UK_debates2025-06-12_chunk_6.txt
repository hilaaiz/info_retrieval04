I thank the Minister for his response.
I have seen at first hand his commitment to supporting Britain’s entrepreneurial spirit, but I worry that on the Isle of Wight unreliable cross-Solent transport is holding back entrepreneurs.
Local businesses do not lack ambition; they lack a dependable link to their supply chains.
Some are even considering leaving the island.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss a long-term solution to cross-Solent travel that supports, rather than punishes, island businesses?
