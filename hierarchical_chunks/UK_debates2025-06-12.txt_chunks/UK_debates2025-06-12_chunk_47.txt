I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that with me again.
I have looked at these issues closely since he and others raised them with me last week.
As he will be aware, with the Diego Garcia agreement and the global ocean treaty, ratification depends on this Government implementing many of the commitments that are made in that treaty.
That is why the CRAG process, as well as legislation, is required in both cases.
There will be a Bill brought forward on the Diego Garcia agreement, and therefore this House will have ample opportunity to debate its merits and vote on it.
