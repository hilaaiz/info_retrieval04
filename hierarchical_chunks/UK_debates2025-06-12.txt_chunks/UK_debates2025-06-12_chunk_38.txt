She raises an important issue about adequate police funding.
All our constituents want to see more police on the streets and crime in their communities coming down.
This Government are committed to more visible police on the streets and to increasing neighbourhood police numbers by 13,000.
Yesterday’s spending review announced an above-inflation increase in police funding of 2.3%, which we believe is an adequate settlement for the police.
The hon.
Lady is right, however, that we need to bring forward reforms to make sure that we have better distribution of funding and that we can have efficiency savings on police procurement and other issues.
We will, as is our commitment, bring forward legislation in that regard in due course.
