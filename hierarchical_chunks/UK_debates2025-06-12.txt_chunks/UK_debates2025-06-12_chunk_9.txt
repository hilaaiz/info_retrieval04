I welcome my hon.
Friend’s commitment to championing entrepreneurs in his constituency.
He may know that we already have some 41 growth hubs across England, including the Coventry and Warwickshire growth hub, which provides a bespoke service for first-time entrepreneurs, tailored advice and support to start-ups and those wanting to scale up a business.
We are determined to do more to help entrepreneurs and will set out our plans in our SME strategy, which is due to be published relatively shortly.
