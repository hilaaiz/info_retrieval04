I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and for the opportunity to attend a wide-ranging roundtable with local businesses in her constituency, at the end of last year.
Our new workshop, “Introduction to Export”, is in collaboration with the North East combined authority, and is aimed specifically at helping local small businesses that are thinking about exporting to new markets for the first time.
A range of other support is available on the Government website, and that will be significantly improved as a result of the coming business growth service.
