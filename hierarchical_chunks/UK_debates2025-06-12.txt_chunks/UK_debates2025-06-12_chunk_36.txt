May I echo the thoughts and sympathies that have been sent to all those involved in the Air India crash that is being reported?
I know that many British citizens will be affected, and our thoughts are with them.
I recently joined Essex police on a ride-along in my Chelmsford constituency to witness at first hand its vital work in our local communities to keep us all safe.
Worryingly, Essex police has regularly raised with me that the national funding formula, known as the police allocation formula, is outdated and unfair.
The funding that Essex police receives falls far short of the proportion of policing carried out by the force in a national context.
Yesterday’s spending review did nothing to change that or to remove concerns about police funding overall.
Indeed, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council said that in real terms, the increase in funding “will cover little more than annual inflationary pay increases for officers and staff.”
He added that “the amount falls far short of what is required to…maintain our existing workforce.”
If we want to keep crime off our streets and retain the experienced officers who do such vital work to keep us safe, surely we must give them the funding to match.
Yesterday’s spending review did not do that.
Will the Leader of the House therefore raise those issues with both the Treasury and the Home Office?
