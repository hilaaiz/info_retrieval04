I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the business for next week and for announcing the estimates days.
Estimates day applications can be obtained from the Table Office or the Committee’s website.
We welcome applications.
They will close tomorrow at the rise of the House, and we will be considering applications for debates at our meeting on Tuesday at 4.15 pm.
Anyone applying should expect to turn up and present their case.
We intend to allocate three debates each day, with a preference given to those who were unsuccessful in the supplementary estimates days.
