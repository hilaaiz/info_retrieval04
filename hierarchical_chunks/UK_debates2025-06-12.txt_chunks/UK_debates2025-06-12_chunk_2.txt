The gov.uk website, which has not been updated since  8 May , states that the Prime Minister negotiated the 25% steel tariff down to zero, but that is not right, is it?
Steel faces a tariff of 25% today and runs the risk of a 50% tariff being imposed next month.
Will the Minister take this opportunity to commit to updating the website, updating this House and updating steelworkers on the state of the negotiations?
I am very happy to consider the issues that the hon.
Lady raises in relation to the website, but I can assure her that, whether it is the Minister for Industry or the Secretary of State for Business and Trade, the Government are in constant dialogue with the British steel industry.
We will introduce a steel strategy, unlike her predecessors, and we have put serious money behind it.
Thanks to the economic prosperity deal with the United States, the UK was the only country to be made exempt from the 50% tariffs on steel and aluminium that other countries around the world now face.
