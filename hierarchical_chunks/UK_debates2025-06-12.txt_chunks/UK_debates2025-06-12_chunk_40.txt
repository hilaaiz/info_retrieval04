Access to banking and financial services remains a huge issue for many MPs across the House.
I am pleased to hear that my hon.
Friend has a new banking hub in Penistone, but I recognise that Chapeltown needs that service too.
We are rolling out 350 banking hubs.
Over 100 of those are already open.
There was a well-subscribed debate on this issue in the House last week, but I will ensure that the relevant Minister gives her an update on the banking hubs in her constituency.
