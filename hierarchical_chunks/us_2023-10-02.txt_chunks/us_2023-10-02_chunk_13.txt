Mr. COLE.
Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor.
507, H.R. 4368, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2024, in order for the appropriations process to move forward.
However, I do have some concerns about certain provisions and cuts in the underlying bill.
Watershed programs, rural energy and broadband grants, and water and wastewater projects are just a few programs that are of vital importance to my district and need adequate funding.
As the appropriations process continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the needs of rural America are met.
