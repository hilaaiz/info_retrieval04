Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud member of the Ho-Chunk Nation.
I believe a big part of my role as a Native woman in Congress is to simply educate my colleagues about our federal governments' relationship and responsibilities to tribes.
That includes the hard histories between the federal government and our Tribal communities--things that can be difficult to face.
It would be difficult to find a Native person that has not had the Indian boarding school era impact their families or community.
It is estimated that by 1926, nearly 83 percent of Native children were enrolled in one of at least 367 currently known Indian boarding schools across 30 states.
Thousands of our children were torn or coerced from families and communities by the federal government or religious entities to be ``assimilated'' into American society.
Students at Indian boarding schools were forced to change their entire sense of being with new names, hair, language, and culture.
