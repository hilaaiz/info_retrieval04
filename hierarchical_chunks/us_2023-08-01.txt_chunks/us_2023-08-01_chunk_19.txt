Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Southern Company and all of the co-owners on their historic accomplishment of Unit 3 at Plant Vogtle officially coming online this week.
Plant Vogtle, located in Georgia's 12th District, is now home to the first newly-constructed nuclear unit in the United States in more than 30 years, with Unit 4 shortly to follow.
Announced earlier this week, Unit 3 is fully operational and will provide 24/7 baseload power to 500,000 Georgia homes and businesses for decades to come.
A project of this magnitude does not come to fruition easily, but the persistent efforts and dedication since 2012 have culminated in what can only be defined as a major win for all Georgians and America as a whole.
Seeing the results of the meaningful collaboration and hard work that made this possible is truly a blessing.
I am beyond proud that Georgia-12 is leading the way in America's nuclear energy expansion; congratulations to Southern Company, Oglethorpe Power Company, MEAG Power, and all involved for this historic accomplishment.
