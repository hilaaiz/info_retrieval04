Mr. VASQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the memory of Anthony Ferguson, a dedicated public servant who was killed in the line of duty while serving as a police officer in my district.
Officer Ferguson spent eleven years serving his community as a member patrol division, he trained countless other officers to protect and serve.
On July 16, 2023, Officer Ferguson was senselessly killed in action while protecting his fellow New Mexicans.
Officer Ferguson is remembered by his family, friends, and fellow officers as loyal and courageous in the performance of his duties.
His sacrifice in the line of duty serves as a solemn reminder of the bravery and commitment of our law enforcement officers.
His loss is felt across the state, and my deepest condolences go out to all who knew and loved him.
We owe a debt of gratitude to our law enforcement officers that can never be fully repaid.
We must strive to honor Officer Ferguson's memory by continuing to support and appreciate those who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe.
On behalf of the great people of New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, I thank Officer Ferguson for his service, and his ultimate sacrifice for the community.
We must not let his bravery be forgotten.
