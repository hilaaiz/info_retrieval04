water, trade, environmental work, healthcare, and agriculture.
Not only did 
Mrs. Earl have an incredible grasp of these complex and challenging issues, but she dedicated an enormous amount of time to building relationships with relevant stakeholders in the Central Valley--even traveling to the district multiple times to meet with farmers, energy producers, hospital leaders, and more.
She was also critical in leading my legislative team's work on the House Appropriations Committee, ensuring the Central Valley had a seat at the table when it came to funding the federal government.
One of her most significant accomplishments during her time in my office was her leadership on the Working to Advance Tangible and Effective Reforms (WATER) for California Act.
This sweeping water legislation was made possible because of the months of effort on behalf of 
Mrs. Earl, and I am incredibly grateful for her work on this issue which is so critical for Central Valley communities and our local economy.
After nearly a decade spent in both Oklahoma and Washington D.C., 
Mrs. Earl would depart my office in March of this year and return to her beloved home state of Texas with her husband, Andrew.
While her welcoming personality, signature quick wit, and leadership in our office are all greatly missed, I am incredibly excited for 
Mrs. Earl as she begins this exciting new chapter of her life.
Knowing Amanda, her character, work ethic, and compassion for others, I have no doubt there are many great things ahead for her.
