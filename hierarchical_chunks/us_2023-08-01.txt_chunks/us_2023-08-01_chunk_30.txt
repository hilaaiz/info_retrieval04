Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a faithful servant, trusted counselor, and cherished community leader, Deacon Benjamin ``Ben'' Swinton.
Deacon Swinton, a lifelong friend and supporter, transitioned from this life on July 26, 2023, in Sumter, South Carolina.
His compassion and kindness will be sorely missed.
