Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I want to celebrate the outstanding achievements of the Detroit City Chess Club and congratulate its members as they celebrate 20 years.
Under the incredible leadership and vision of 
Mr. Kevin Fite, Detroit City Chess Club's founder, students from across Detroit Public Schools have been recognized regionally and nationally for their skills.
Inspired by the popularity and success of the teams he coached at Detroit's Duffield Elementary and Middle Schools; Coach Fite founded the Detroit City Chess Club in 2003.
He leveraged a partnership with the Detroit Institute of Arts to provide a permanent home for students to play outside of regular school hours.
Since then, Detroit City Chess Club has strived to engage young people in the game of chess.
The club has grown from only a handful of members at its inception to reaching thousands of students and adults alike.
The Detroit City Chess Club has played all over the world, winning 15 National titles, 16 regional championships, 28 state championships, and hosting 4 individual No. 1 players in the U.S.
The 12th Congressional District is proud to recognize the Detroit City Chess Club, its members, and volunteers for their outstanding contributions to our community as we wish them well on 20 years of gamesmanship, education, and camaraderie.
