Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the centennial anniversary of the Selbyville Volunteer Fire Company.
Just over 100 years ago, a group of young men saw a need in their community, decided to act, and established this company.
Now, a century later, it has grown into what it is today--a critical part of the Selbyville community with a legacy of exceptional service.
In addition to this occasion being a chance for fellowship and comradery between those in uniform, it is also an opportunity for the rest of us, whom the members of the Company serve, to pause and express our gratitude for their selfless and dangerous work.
To these firefighters: we in Delaware know the risk each of them takes when they put on their uniforms and go to work each day.
And to take on these risks is as remarkable as it is inspiring.
Our state would not enjoy the same peace of mind without people like them answering the call and volunteering their time to protect our communities.
In Delaware, we are incredibly proud to have so many wonderful volunteer firefighters
