Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 70th anniversary of the end of hostilities in the Korean War.
From the freezing temperatures of the Chosin Reservoir to the race to the Yalu River, over 1.8 million men and women from our Armed Forces fought with distinction and bravery.
Unfortunately, the Korean War still lingers today as the armistice was never intended to be a permanent peace treaty.
The armistice established the Demilitarized Zone on the 38th parallel and currently divides the free Nation of South Korea and the communist regime in North Korea.
Since the end of hostilities, South Korea has forged a historic and beautiful relationship with the United States and is 1 of our closest allies in Asia.
Today, South Korea remains prosperous, democratic, and unwavering in the face of communist aggression.
Each year, we are reminded that the costs of freedom come with a heavy price, and we are grateful for all service members who demonstrated integrity and courage in the struggle for self-determination.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capital to recognize our Nation's veterans in their valiant efforts to defeat the threat of communism.
We must continue to stay vigilant and strive to maintain order and stability in the region.
I will continue to advocate for efforts that will unify the Korean people once again.
Our Veterans' sacrifices to uphold freedom and liberty in the Korean Peninsula will never be forgotten.
