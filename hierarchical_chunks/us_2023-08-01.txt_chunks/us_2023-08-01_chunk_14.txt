Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Trooper Jeffrey Dunlap, a devoted public servant, for his heroic actions on the evening of Monday, July 3.
For more than 13 years, Trooper Dunlap has served in the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, risking his life every day to protect and serve the people.
On the evening of July 3rd, Trooper Dunlap stopped his vehicle to assist a stranded motorist on I-26 West.
In a horrific turn of events, the motorist pulled out a gun and shot Trooper Dunlap in the chest.
Thankfully, the round was stopped by Trooper Dunlap's bulletproof vest, and he was able to swifty return fire.
In the face of imminent danger, Trooper Dunlap neutralized the threat, saving his own life and protecting the lives of innocent bystanders.
Following the shooting, Trooper Dunlap was taken to a local hospital and has since been discharged.
The true essence of heroism is the willingness to sacrifice one's own personal safety for the protection of others.
Trooper Dunlap has and will continue to show up to work every day willing to place himself in danger for the greater good.
I thank Trooper Dunlap, for exemplifying what it means to protect and serve.
