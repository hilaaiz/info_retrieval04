Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Winamac Coil Spring, Inc. on 75 years of doing business in Indiana's Second Congressional District.
For more than 7 decades, Winamac Coil Spring has been a leading manufacturer of compression, extension single and double torsion springs, and wireforms.
I am proud to represent the ``RV Capital of the World'' in Congress.
The work Winamac Coil Spring has done for 3-quarters of a century has played a meaningful role in allowing our District to have and maintain that distinction.
The professional, quality work Winamac Coil Spring does is not limited to the recreational vehicle industry, however.
From agriculture to appliances, construction to industrial, Winamac Coil Spring serves a wide variety of industries and markets, with an ironclad commitment to customer satisfaction always at the forefront.
Additionally, Winamac Coil Spring's example as a successful familyowned business is an inspiration to those looking to start their own companies, as well as a source of pride for many Hoosiers.
Congratulations again on reaching this impressive milestone.
I thank them for their many contributions to Pulaski County and communities through the Second District.
I wish them continued success and many more years in business and anniversaries to celebrate going forward.
