Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor an outstanding individual in my district, Bremerton City Councilmember, Michael Goodnow.
This year marks a significant milestone as he helps organize the 27th Kitsap Pride Festival, his 25th year assisting, a momentous occasion that celebrates diversity, inclusion, and equality in our community.
Councilmember Goodnow has been an unwavering champion for the rights and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community in Bremerton and beyond.
Through his tireless efforts and dedication, he has fostered a spirit of unity and acceptance, creating a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
Beyond his role in organizing the Kitsap Pride Festival, Councilmember Goodnow has been a strong advocate for social justice issues throughout his tenure in public service.
His commitment to equality extends far beyond this event, as he actively works to promote equal rights, combat discrimination, and improve the lives of marginalized communities.
Some of the roles he's had in the community include the Executive Director of the Roxy Theatre, Director of the Kitsap County AIDS Foundation, Project Coordinator at the Pride Foundation of Seattle, and Coordinator at the Kitsap Health District, working on HIV prevention in the late 1990s.
Michael is also Bremerton's first openly gay elected City Councilman and first openly gay City Council President.
