Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Ray-Fre Senior Citizens Club in Raymond, New Hampshire, for the 50th anniversary of their location on Main Street and the 55th anniversary of the club's founding.
Ray-Fre was established in 1968 when the Raymond and Fremont senior centers chose to combine.
By 1973, they had a permanent location, elected officers, and by-laws.
Ray-Fre offers a variety of games, activities, and volunteer opportunities open to those 55+ including line dancing, cribbage, Meals-on-Wheels, and knitting.
Their continuous community-building, festivities, and engagement opportunities help our seniors age gracefully and with dignity, connecting them with friends and family in a lively atmosphere.
Aside from games and festivities, Ray-Fre offers our seniors the opportunity to maintain a healthy lifestyle, learn about new technology, and participate in local community service.
Each week, members may take part in walking groups or video exercises, participate in computer classes to remain fluent in technology and learn new skills, or volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels.
Additionally, the knitting group meets Mondays to make hats for cancer survivors, infants, and the homeless and provided over 1,900 articles in 2021.
Ray-Fre's impact extends far beyond their seniors and strives to make a difference in the community.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I commend Ray-Fre for their devotion to community-building, service, and engagement.
Their 55 years as a club complements their immeasurable positive impact on the community.
I greatly appreciate the work they do for our seniors and the opportunities provided to them.
