Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate the congregation of the Monongahela Church of the Nazarene in Monongahela, Pennsylvania for 100 years of service to God and the surrounding community.
The Monongahela Church of the Nazarene was originally organized with 24 members on July 25, 1923, the small group of members sought God's will for their lives.
The congregation held tent meetings until the physical church was built and established nearly a decade later.
Rev. Frank Strickler from the California Church of the Nazarene, aided by David Mitchell, became the Church's first Pastor.
Throughout the years, the church was blessed with the spiritual leadership of nine Pastors.
In 2000, Reverend Raymond DiCamillo became the current Pastor of the church.
Under his leadership, the Monongahela Church of the Nazarene remains committed to reaching the lost, helping those in need, and loving those they meet.
With the Holy Spirit guiding them, they look forward to building on this storied history for the next 100 years.
