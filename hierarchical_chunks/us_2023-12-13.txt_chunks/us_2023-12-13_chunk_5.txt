Mr. BOYLE.
Mr. Speaker, when most people imagine American democracy, they picture the House, Senate, or the President and the work that we do as lawmakers to enact critical legislation to carry out the Nation's business.
Or maybe they imagine themselves and their friends and neighbors in the voting booth, casting ballots that will determine the make-up of government at the state, local, and federal levels.
To me, however, American democracy also takes another form: the ongoing dialogue between citizens and public servants like us they elect to represent them.
In these conversations we learn our constituents' hopes and dreams for the future, learn to make their priorities our priorities, and live up to our founders' ideal that the people should be allowed--and encouraged--to petition their government.
That is true civic engagement; and that idea is at the heart of BoricuActivatEd, a stellar, Philadelphia-based volunteer-run organization that is now celebrating its 6th year.
The organization was created during the tragedies of Hurricanes Maria and Irma which struck Puerto Rico in 2017, killing an estimated 3,000 people and leading to the longest power blackout in U.S. history.
The group was created to mobilize people across the country to advocate for needed disaster aid and was immediately successful in marshaling the combined voice of the Puerto Rican Diaspora.
They made their power felt and demonstrated that civic engagement works.
Through their civic engagement workshops, BoricuActivatEd has provided over 4,000 individuals with the tools they need to make their voices heard.
Thanks to BoricuActivatEd's tireless efforts, countless more high school students, former juvenile offenders, and community members from across the country will have the opportunity and ability to advocate for the issues important to them.
And their elected officials are listening.
Indeed, I can personally attest, having participated in their workshops, how effective and valuable these sessions can be.
As it enters its seventh year, BoricuActivatEd continues to grow its programs, developing new curricula for high school students--including the Esperanza Academy in my district--and expanding their programs into new cities, to empower the next generation.
By training people of all ages and securing the participation of elected officials at all levels of government, BoricuActivatEd embodies civic engagement and community empowerment at its finest.
I am proud to congratulate BoricuActivatEd on their 6th anniversary and wish them every success as they embark on new accomplishments in the years ahead.
