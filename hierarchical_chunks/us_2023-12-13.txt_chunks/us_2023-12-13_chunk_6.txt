Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank 
Mrs. Betsy Jane Flenner for 16 years of dedicated service to our country.
As a Lead Congressional Correspondent and Security Manager in the U.S. Navy Office of Legislative Affairs, Betsy has helped answer thousands of questions from the American people.
In the office, she is known for her willingness to take on any question and find an answer, no matter how easy or how complex.
Betsy is admired and respected by her colleagues--her work ethic and heart for service have made her an asset to her team and to the many Virginians who have benefitted from her help.
She has built longlasting relationships with staff in the halls of Congress, an example her job description.
Throughout the last eight Congresses, Betsy has been a standout team member.
Her commitment to providing excellent service has earned her the Superior Civilian Service Award--one of the highest honorary awards under the Department of the Navy Civilian Awards program.
Her enthusiasm for providing our Veterans and servicemembers with the answers they need will be missed.
