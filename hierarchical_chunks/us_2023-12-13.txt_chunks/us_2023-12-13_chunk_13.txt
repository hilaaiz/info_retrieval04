Mrs. Cromwell has been an invaluable asset to our government, our men and women in uniform, and the American people.
Although many will be sad to see her departure, she deserves a long and happy retirement.
As she starts this next chapter, I wish her, her husband Stewart, her two sons, and the rest of their family and friends well.
I am certain that all my fellow Members of the House will join me in thanking Mrs. Michelle Cromwell for her commitment and contributions to our Nation.
