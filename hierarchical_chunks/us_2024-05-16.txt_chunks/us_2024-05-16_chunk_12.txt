Ms. Conklin began her educational career as a teacher with the Novato Unified School District.
Throughout her twenty-year tenure with the District, 
Ms. Conklin demonstrated a genuine commitment to fostering an environment of community and respect in her classrooms.
She ultimately became the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources for the District, where she spearheaded efforts to ensure all students, regardless of their background, can reach their full potential.
In 2015, her passion for education led her to serve as the Oakley Union Elementary School District Superintendent.
During her tenure, her collaboration with the Contra Costa County community and her critical leadership helped ensure the continued success of the Oakley Union School District.
Upon her departure from the Oakley Union School District, 
Ms. Conklin began working at the Travis Unified School District as the Human Resources Administrator and in 2017, she began serving as Superintendent.
Her critical efforts to advocate for the students, teachers, and families of Solano County and Travis Air Force Base were indispensable to our community.
As Superintendent, 
Ms. Conklin played a pivotal role in supporting Travis Air Force Base and helping nine schools in the District earn the designation of ``Purple Star Schools,'' schools that are committed to and equipped to meet the unique needs of military-affiliated students and their families.
While her leadership as Superintendent will surely be missed, Ms. Conklin's decades of service to the students of Northern California and Travis Unified School District have left an indelible legacy.
I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to 
Ms. Conklin and wish her the best in her future endeavors.
