Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the service of one of my constituents, Lt. Matthew Hare, of the Inverness Fire Department.
For the past three years, the Inverness Fire Department has been going through a rebuilding phase.
Lt. Hare has been a vital part of this process and has been the go-to guy for any project that needs to be completed.
He is constantly working to improve his skills and further his education.
His excellent work ethic has allowed him to become one of the department leaders and he is a role model to his peers.
Lt. Hare operates in a manner that brings great credit to himself, his family, the City, and the citizens he serves.
These are just a few examples of the hard work, dedication, eagerness to help, and servant leadership that Lt. Hare exhibits every day when he goes to work.
He is a shining example of what it means to be an Inverness First Responder.
His work ethic should be a benchmark for which other first responders should strive to attain.
It is evident that Lt. Hare has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and is qualified to be recognized as a First Responder of the Year for Florida's 12th Congressional District.
