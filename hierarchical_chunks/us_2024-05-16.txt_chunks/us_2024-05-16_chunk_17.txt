Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hands of the Carpenter from Golden, Colorado on receiving the 2024 Golden Rotary Club's Ethics in Business Award.
For over two decades, Hands of the Carpenter has provided crucial support to single mothers through free and low-cost automobile repairs and maintenance.
Hands of the Carpenter has grown significantly since its inception, going from assisting a handful of women each year to helping over 600 last year alone.
For many single mothers, a reliable vehicle can make a world of difference.
Hands of the Carpenter helps bring stability to often uncertain circumstances.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize the Hands of the Carpenter organization for all they do for our community.
