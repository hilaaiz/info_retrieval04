Ms. HOYLE.
Mr. Speaker, yesterday I mistakenly voted Yea on Roll Call No. 202, passage of H. Res. 1210, the Resolution ``Condemning the Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officers face as a result.''
I intended to vote Nay, as I've consistently done on similar politically-charged, non-binding resolutions that play politics instead error.
