Mrs. Kraus's journey is one of remarkable achievements and selflessness.
She graduated second in her class from Western Kentucky University.
She subsequently moved to Japan in 1952 to care for American soldiers injured in the Korean War.
She later married William Kraus in France in 1956.
A Dallas resident from 1959 until 2024, 
Mrs. Kraus was a giant in our community.
She raised her four children here, along with her community service as a member of the Dallas County Medical Alliance, Medical Center Board, and President of the Parent's Club at the St. Mark's School.
She was also a member.
Thomas Aquinas Parish in Dallas, Texas.
My heart goes out to all who knew and loved Ann, especially her sister, Margie Joy, her children, Greg, Peter, Sharon, and Stephen, her six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
May her memory be a source of comfort and strength.
