Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy lost recently, 
Mr. E. Zell Steever, V. A fierce advocate for climate resilience and sustainability policy, Zell spent his career in ecology and biology, serving as Director of Water and Related Resources at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, along with other roles in water resources protection and management at agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
His decade-spanning support for environmental conservation and dedication to robust civic participation has been instrumental in the great strides our State has taken to realize a sustainable, climate-resilient future.
Zell began life with his family in Noank, Connecticut, where he settled after graduating from the University.
He attended graduate school at Connecticut College, studying the local coastal salt march ecosystem and building a repository of evidence of the importance of healthy wetlands to fisheries, one of southeastern Connecticut's mainstay professions.
In his free time, Zell was frequently seen sailing up and down the Long Island Sound, designing and renovating homes, and building Aleutian kayaks.
Zell's impact has reached far beyond the limits of Eastern Connecticut, as he held multiple national level positions.
He advised President Nixon as a staff member of the President's Council on Environmental Equality.
