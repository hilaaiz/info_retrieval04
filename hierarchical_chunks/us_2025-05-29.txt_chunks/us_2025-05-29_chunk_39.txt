Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Major General John Harris, on his retirement from the Ohio National Guard.
On behalf of the citizens of Ohio, I wish General Harris all the best as he assumes his new position as Director of the Ohio Department for his forty-four years of service to Ohio and our Nation.
