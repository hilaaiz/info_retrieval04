Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize First Lady Elizabeth Mobley.
Olive Missionary Baptist Church.
A woman whose spiritual influence can be seen and heard throughout Western New York through children of all ages and parishioners beyond the walls of church on Sunday.
First Lady Mobley studied at SUNY Fredonia, earning a Master's Degree in Speech Pathology.
From there, she began her career in the Buffalo Public School system, identifying the proper communication skills of students by working with educators and families to ensure students' success.
First Lady Mobley is committed to prioritizing the needs of her students and parishioners, serving as the leader of the Senior and Youth Ministry at Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, while remaining an active participant in the choir and Women's Ministry.
Bound by love and strengthened by prayer, she credits the work that she does to the unwavering support of her family, Pastor Keith
