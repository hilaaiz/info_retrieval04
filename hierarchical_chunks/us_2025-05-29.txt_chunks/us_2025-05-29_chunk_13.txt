ultimately confessed, stating he carried out the attack ``for Gaza'' and ``for Palestine.''
Sarah was a peace-seeking public servant who dedicated her career to fostering dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians.
Yaron was a warm, idealistic young man preparing for a life in diplomacy.
The two had planned to become engaged on an upcoming trip to Israel.
Their futures were full of promise.
Their loss is immeasurable.
This attack is not an isolated act; it reflects a broader trend of increasing antisemitism at home and abroad.
According to the AntiDefamation League, antisemitic incidents have risen by 140 percent in the months following the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.
Antisemitism has no place in this country.
May the memories of Sarah and Yaron be a blessing.
Let us honor them not only with remembrance, but with resolve to confront hatred wherever it appears.
