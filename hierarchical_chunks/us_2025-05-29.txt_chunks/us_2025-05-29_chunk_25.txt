Mobley, and their four blessed children: Tyson, Talia, Tevin, and Troy.
Today, as we recognize the incredible service of First Lady Elizabeth Mobley, let us not only acknowledge her dedicated career as a Speech Pathologist and her steadfast commitment to children in need, but her dedication to ministry at Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church, providing a safe space for all to be heard.
First Lady Mobley service is a blessing, and we look forward to many more years of her inspired leadership.
