Mrs. MILLER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dorothy Draper & Company on 100 years of business.
Founded in 1925, it is the oldest continually operating interior design firm in America.
Its founder and namesake, Dorothy Draper, was a trailblazer, starting her company at a time when most women did not seek employment.
Her vision, love of color, chintz, and tendency towards the dramatic solidified her iconic style dubbed ``the Draper Touch''.
Her protege, Carleton Varney, championed her work throughout his career, and the company flourished under his leadership, the creative genius and driving force who led the firm for 60 years.
Mr. Varney went on to decorate the West Virginia Governor's mansion in the 1980s, further solidifying ``the Draper Touch'' into the state's culture and history.
The Dorothy Draper Company's work is especially important to my home state of West Virginia, where their most famous design is showcased, The Greenbrier Resort, affectionately called ``America's Resort.''
Located in White Sulphur Springs, the Greenbrier's legacy took a unique turn when it was converted into a military hospital to meet the demands brought about during WWII.
It was then returned to a hotel and transformed into the unique and bold getaway we recognize today.
The Greenbrier has hosted presidents, royalty, celebrities, and countless West Virginians and Americans since 1778.
Dorothy's use of color and pattern was so distinctly `her' that her legacy lives on in her company and through those that she inspired.
I am so delighted and proud to recognize co-owner Sebastian Varney and Design Director Rudy Saunders, and their company.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on a century of success and wish them many more to come.
