Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act to reauthorize and improve important aviation programs in order to move the measure forward to the Senate.
While there was much good in the bill, I opposed provisions in the underlying bill calling for continued use of leaded aviation fuel.
I was pleased to work with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on securing improvements to this language in the manager's amendment, which we believe will protect my constituents from exposure to leaded fuel used by small aircraft.
The Senate should further improve these provisions on continued use of leaded avgas before the bill comes back to the House for negotiations.
