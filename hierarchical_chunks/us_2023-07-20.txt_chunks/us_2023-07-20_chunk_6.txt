Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Frances Metcalf, who will be celebrating the milestone of her 99th birthday tomorrow.
It is a distinct honor to pay tribute to Frances, who like many other women made substantial contributions to the war effort during World War II.
IN 1943, Frances worked tirelessly to earn a job at one of the General Motors plants in East Cleveland, Ohio.
There, she assisted in manufacturing air duct assemblies for over 75 Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircrafts which were crucial to U.S. military operations for over 20 years.
She worked there until she was old enough to serve in women's branch of the United States Naval Reserve.
In 1944, the recruitment age for all female volunteers was 20 years old.
That same year, Frances turned 20--and shortly thereafter, she enlisted to serve as a naval nurse in Brooklyn, New York.
Many `Rosie the Riveters' followed the same route in service to the homefront, and ultimately, were integral to U.S. victory.
