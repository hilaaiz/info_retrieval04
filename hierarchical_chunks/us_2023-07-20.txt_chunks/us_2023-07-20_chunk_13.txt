Mrs. Huguenin's enduring spirit will live on in her husband, son, 2 granddaughters, stepson, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew.
I would like to extend my deepest sympathies to 
Mrs. Huguenin's loved ones.
I know that they, along with the people of Contra Costa County, join me in celebrating her life and legacy.
