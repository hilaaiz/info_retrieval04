Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy.
His leadership and commitment to public service was inspirational, and he will be missed by all who knew him.
I also extend my deepest condolences to his wife of 44 years, Judy, and his children, Connor and Megan, and their families.
