Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 918, Republicans' baseless attempt to distract from the ongoing criminal proceedings against former President Donald Trump.
After a year of frivolous investigations produced no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, Republicans brought to the floor a resolution directing committees to pursue a sham impeachment inquiry.
This resolution is clearly an attempt to minimize and distract from former President Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, during the same week that his criminal trial proceedings reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
While House Republicans have spent the year wasting time and taxpayer dollars, Democrats have delivered the votes to prevent a government shutdown--not once, but twice.
This body has a duty to keep the government functioning and open for the American people, yet Republicans time and time again have shown no interest in meeting that obligation.
As we approach the halfway point of the 118th Congress, it is clear the majority would rather spend their time distracting the American people with their extreme MAGA messaging instead of doing the serious work of legislating.
It is past time for House Republicans to start addressing the serious and urgent needs of all our constituents.
