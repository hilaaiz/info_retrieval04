Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of many great principals in Jackson, Mississippi, Dr. Jamiette D. Carter.
Jamiette D. Carter, M.A., Ph.D, '09, was named Principal of Obama Magnet Elementary School for the 2023-2024 year.
Dr. Carter has been with Jackson Public Schools (JPS) for over 12 years and has significant experience assisting teachers and administrators with guiding students toward meeting individual learning goals.
Previously, she served as the director of program implementation for the JPS Office.
In this role, she worked directly with district superintendents, principals, and other stakeholders to facilitate school improvement initiatives and federal compliance.
Her career began in the classroom at Lester Elementary, where she taught 4th and 5th grade ELA while also serving as team lead, supporting the mission and vision of the school.
She then honed her leadership skills as a curriculum coordinator with the Office of Elementary Education
