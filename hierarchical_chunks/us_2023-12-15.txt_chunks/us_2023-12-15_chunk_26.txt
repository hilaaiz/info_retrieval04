Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the student athletes of Sandhills Community College's (SCC) Court and Beach Volleyball Teams on being recognized as Academic All-Americans by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).
SCC has a proud history of both academic and athletic excellence and is a regional leader on both fronts.
I was proud to see so many SCC student athletes carry on this great tradition and be named to the 2022-2023 Academic Teams of the Year.
In particular, I would like to recognize the SCC Court and Beach Volleyball teams and the following members of these teams on their achievement of this honor.
Student athletes, Emma Brown, Lannah Huneycutt, Keke Lawrence, Alyssa Maragelis, Anna Ty Ivey, Jalasia Ray, Mackenzie Swett, Rachel Burley, Olivia Barlowe and Britta Martin.
Their great success in the classroom is proof that each of them truly embody what it means to be a student athlete.
I think I speak for everyone in our community when I say they have made Pinehurst and the whole Moore County proud.
