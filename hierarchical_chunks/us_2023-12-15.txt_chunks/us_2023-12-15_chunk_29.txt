Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to congratulate the St. Louis Metro Area Chapter Coalition of Black Trade Unionists on their 50th anniversary.
For 50 years, CBTU has been the voice of Black workers within the trade union movement in St. Louis.
By pushing organized labor to create more equitable conditions and meet the needs and aspirations of Black and low-income workers, CBTU has truly been a voice for the people.
The Coalition of Black Trade Unionists played an integral role in defeating right-to-work in Missouri, and they never stopped fighting and coordinating workers across our region and state to vote and remain civically engaged.
Through education and outreach, CBTU has been on the frontlines fighting for our workers, teachers, and most marginalized communities, and ensuring that our democracy is protected.
St. Louis and I are forever grateful for CBTU's unwavering solidarity.
CBTU is continuously leading with compassion for our entire St. Louis community in the struggle for racial equity, justice, and freedom.
Congratulations on 50 years of service.
