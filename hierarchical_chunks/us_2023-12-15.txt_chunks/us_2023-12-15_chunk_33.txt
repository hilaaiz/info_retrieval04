Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to wish a happy 103rd birthday to Willie James Thomas Sr.
On behalf of Missouri's First District, we are thankful for everything he is and everything he has done to provide for his family, neighbors, coworkers, and friends.
One hundred and three is a remarkable milestone and worthy of great celebration.
Mr. Thomas has seen and lived through segments of history that most of us can only rely on through books and education, and from being in close community with elders like him.
His trials, triumphs, and everything in between are a beautiful testament to a remarkable and full life.
Throughout his life, 
Mr. Thomas has had many blessings.
He is the beloved father of three, a grandfather of 10, a great-grandfather of 21, and great-great-great-grandfather of six.
As a World War II Army Veteran serving in England, France, and Germany, we thank him for his dedication to his family and service to our country I am so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate his life because it is an inspiration to so many of us in St. Louis.
I wish 
Mr. Thomas peace and continued joy tending to the best yard in University City throughout his 103rd year.
Happy birthday and bountiful blessings to 
Mr. Willie James Thomas Sr.
