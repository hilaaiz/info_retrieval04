Mr. DELUZIO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and legacy.
County Executive Fitzgerald is finishing up his third and final term in the county's top elected position--one he has held since 2012.
Born and raised in the City of Pittsburgh, Rich Fitzgerald graduated from Carnegie Mellon University.
He and his wife, Cathy, have eight children.
``Fitz,'' as he is fondly called, is well-known for his work ethic and his ability to bring people and organizations together to tackle the biggest issues facing our region.
He first was elected to the County Council in 1999 and served on the Council--including as Council President from 2004 through 2011--until his successful election as County Executive.
Under his leadership, Allegheny County has seen strong and solid job growth, a diverse and growing economy, and an excellent quality of life.
The 2020 Census is a testament to County Executive Fitzgerald's leadership: for the first time in sixty years, the county's population grew over a decade.
He also led the region through the dark days of the COVID-19 pandemic with consistency and reassurance, striving to protect public health and keep the economy strong.
While we only crossed paths in elected office a short period of time, I greatly appreciated his guidance, experience, and collaboration.
Fitz is a public servant through and through.
Though he closes this chapter as Allegheny County Executive, the impact of his work for the Common Good will remain.
On behalf of the good people of Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District, I thank Fitz for his years of service.
