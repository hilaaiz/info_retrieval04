Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and selfless leader, 
Mr. Curtis Lacey.
Curtis has shown dedication to the citizens.
Curtis Lacey, tree and brush foreman for the Warren County Road Department, is commended for his lifesaving actions on October 30, 2023.
On that afternoon, Lacey approached the scene of a wreck that left Linda Blissett, 76, trapped in her vehicle.
He acted quickly, administering lifesaving care until the authorities arrived.
The Warren County Board of Supervisors issued a proclamation commending Lacey for his heroic efforts.
