Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Glen Stephens for his dedicated service to the Kern County community and to congratulate him on his well-earned retirement from the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District.
Mr. Glen Stephens' career in air quality control and passion for public health began more than thirty years ago when he became an Air Quality Engineer for the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District.
In 1992, he joined the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and two years later, returned to work for Eastern Kern County.
In 2012, 
Mr. Stephens was appointed to serve as Air Pollution Control Officer by the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District Board.
During his tenure as Air Pollution Control Officer, 
Mr. Stephens has worked to expand the Tehachapi field office to solve staff members and the District's Board of Directors, deployed additional air monitors throughout Kern County to improve air quality, and advocated for cost-of-living wage increases for his staff.
