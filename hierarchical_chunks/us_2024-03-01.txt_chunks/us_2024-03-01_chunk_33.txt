When they return to the United States, Peace Corps Volunteers bring their new vision home.
After immersing themselves in the culture of their host communities, Volunteers continue to enrich our communities with the friendships they built during their time abroad.
They bring not only their memories but new skills in languages, cross-cultural understanding and subject matter expertise.
Many Volunteers continue to serve our country through other forms of public service.
