Ms. STEVENS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the wisdom of an inspiring figure, Dr. Eddie Connor, as we conclude 2024 Black History Month.
Dr. Connor delivered remarks in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in January, and his words inspire me as we continue the important work to create a more equitable society.
It is an honor to learn from so many influential leaders about this important history.
From the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage in Alabama to local leaders in Michigan's 11th District, I am moved by the stories and insight that has been shared with me.
Dr. Connor is one of those figures that I am proud to highlight.
He is a 16-time bestselling author, international speaker, survivor of stage four cancer, and founder of the mentoring program Boys 2 Books.
