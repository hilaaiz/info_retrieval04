I am proud of the generations of compassionate and courageous Volunteers who have committed themselves to two or more years of service in a land previously unknown to them.
Among their ranks are many of my constituents from Maryland's beautiful Eighth Congressional District.
This year, my district has sent more Peace Corps Volunteers to serve abroad than any other congressional district in the country.
It is my surpassing honor to represent the many individuals who are choosing to live, serve and learn in over 20 countries as Volunteers.
