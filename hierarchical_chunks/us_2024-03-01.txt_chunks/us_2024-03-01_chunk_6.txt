Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, as this year's Black History Month ends, I rise today to honor two District of Columbia residents who have made tremendous contributions to civil rights, Walter Fauntroy and Robin Williams.
Walter Fauntroy served as a key organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965.
Walter was also a noted lobbyist for civil rights, where he played a pivotal role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.
Walter's efforts during this critical period were key to ushering in a new era Walter was also the second Delegate to the House of Representatives from the District of Columbia, a position he held for almost 20 years.
During his tenure in Congress, Walter was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a champion for D.C. home rule.
