Mr. Stephens has also used his expertise to help numerous solar projects navigate the rulemaking and permitting processes.
Throughout his career, 
Mr. Stephens has been steadfast in his commitment to promoting clean air for all residents of the community.
He has used his decades of experience to support rural communities and work with local stakeholders to address complex air quality issues and find common sense solutions.
He has also strived to engage community members on the importance of air quality and preserving the character of rural communities across the Valley.
His dedication to his colleagues, his work, and his community is a true testament to his character.
I know that his service to our Central Valley community will have a lasting impact for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking 
Mr. Glen Stephens for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy and well-deserved retirement.
