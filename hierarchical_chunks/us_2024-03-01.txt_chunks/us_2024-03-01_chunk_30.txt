Mr. RASKIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate 63 years of the United States Peace Corps' work in promoting world peace and friendship among nations.
President John F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps as the United States' first global volunteer initiative on March 1, 1961.
Since then, the Peace Corps has sent more than 241,000 Volunteers to serve communities in 143 countries.
These committed Americans have formed enduring bonds of friendship across cultures and championed the best of our country's values abroad.
