middle school sorely in need of smart and caring educators.
Mr. Ostertag stayed late coaching basketball and track and was a regular feature in the kids' TikToks.
In his first year, test scores skyrocketed, with 90% of his students far surpassing the school's average.
Will thought the point of life was to help people.
From campaigning with the Montana Democratic Party to working on Capitol Hill, he pursued a better future.
Most recently, Will worked as an Investment Strategy Analyst with the Department.
Coworkers say Will's ability to create meaningful relationships with all kinds of people helped send more than $10 billion toward clean energy initiatives.
On Halloween night 2021, Will met a girl at a party.
He texted a friend that she was ``perfect.''
Will had always been exceptionally bright, so he knew that this girl was way out of his league.
He would have been delighted to know that Zehra was talking to friends too, saying Will was the funniest person she had ever met.
At 25, Will had found what some people go their whole lives without--he had fallen in love and was overjoyed to be loved just as deeply in return.
Will would have wanted us to thank Andy Samberg, the other members of The Lonely Island, and the cast and crew of ``Hot Rod,'' for creating the building blocks for his sense of humor and, possibly, his entire personality.
Will routinely made friends and family cry from laughter.
When he laughed, which was often and easily, he threw his entire head back.
He was an enthusiastic and surprisingly coordinated dancer.
He checked in on the people he cared about, celebrated others' accomplishments, and always remembered birthdays.
His biggest dream was to be a dad--he would have been an amazing one.
Because Will chose to be an organ donor, he will save lives.
The people who know him, know this is fitting.
Will's family would like to thank the bystanders who tried to save Will's life and all of those who cared for him at MedStar Washington Hospital.
Will is survived by his partner, Zehra Khan; his parents, Stephanie Clemans (Mark French) and Jack Ostertag (Lisa Atwell Tong); his brother, Thomas Ostertag (Kelly Ostertag); stepsisters, Elizabeth and Savanna Tong; his grandmother, Nancy Sandman Ostertag; and many loving aunts, uncles, and cousins.
He was preceded in death by his grandparents, Judy Clemans, Joseph Clemans, and Jerome `Jerry' William Ostertag.
Will will be remembered most for the way he made people feel--light and fun, seen and supported, optimistic, engaged, and cared for.
Will spent most of his days thinking seriously and meaningfully about how to make this world a betterplace.
Unfortunately--incomprehensibly--that task now falls to those who loved him.
We'll try to do our best.
We will be celebrating Will's life on Saturday, November 23.
