Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague Congressman Mike Thompson to honor Terry Lindley in celebration of his retirement after thirty years of service on the Sonoma County Junior College District Board.
We commend his outstanding service to the students and faculty of the Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC).
Raised on a family ranch in Humboldt County, 
Mr. Lindley developed an appreciation for farming at an early age.
While attending Ferndale High School, 
Mr. Lindley met Steve Olson, his then agriculture teacher who went on to become a lifelong friend and mentor.
His counsel and guidance steered 
Mr. Lindley to embark on a distinguished career focusing on community leadership and agriculture.
After graduating high school in 1976, 
Mr. Lindley began studying agribusiness at SRJC.
After earning his degree, 
Mr. Lindley was hired as a loan officer and appraiser at American AgCredit.
Over the course of forty years with the company, 
Mr. Lindley's knowledge of agribusiness helped him achieve increasingly prominent roles, including senior vice president and chief marketing officer.
Mr. Lindley's aptitude for hard work, deep understanding of agriculture and business acumen made him a remarkable pioneer in the agribusiness industry.
Through his leadership, American AgCredit established the first marketing department in all of the Farm Credit System.
In addition to his professional accomplishments,
