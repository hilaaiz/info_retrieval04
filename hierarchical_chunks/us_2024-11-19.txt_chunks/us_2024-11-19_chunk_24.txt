Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, every day, we lose an average of 17 veterans to suicide.
This statistic is not just a number; it represents real lives, families, and communities torn apart by tragedy.
Behind each of these 17 daily losses is a story of service, sacrifice, and struggle.
These are our neighbors, friends, and family members who have worn the uniform with pride and honor.
They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, whose absence leaves an irreplaceable void in countless lives.
The ripple effect of each suicide extends far beyond the individual, impacting spouses, children, parents, friends, and fellow veterans.
It creates a cycle of grief and trauma that can persist for generations.
As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to address this heartbreaking reality with the urgency and dedication it demands.
Answering the call of duty to our veterans, I was proud to work with Senate Veterans Affair Committee Chairman Jon Tester to put forward H.R. 4157, Not Just a Number Act, legislation included in this Veterans omnibus package as Section 149 that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand its scope when studying veteran suicide data.
Instead of focusing solely on VA health care utilization, this bill mandates a more holistic approach, considering factors such as education, job training, housing, and other relevant socioeconomic factors.
By broadening our perspective, we aim to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complex, interconnected factors that contribute to veteran suicide.
This approach will paint a more accurate picture of the multifaceted challenges our veterans face, enabling us to develop more effective support systems and interventions.
While the Not Just a Number Act is a crucial step forward, we must recognize that addressing veteran suicide is an ongoing commitment.
This bill lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding, but our work will not end with its passage.
We must be prepared to adapt our strategies based on the insights gained and continuously improve our support systems.
This is merely the beginning of a longterm mission to safeguard the lives and well-being of our veterans.
We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that can never truly be repaid.
It is our responsibility to ensure that they feel our unwavering support and appreciation every single day.
Let us honor our troops not just in words, but in our actions, by standing alongside them and their families.
Together, let us ensure that they feel the depth of our appreciation and support at every step of their journey.
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical legislation.
By passing the Not Just a Number Act as Section 149 of the Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits Improvement Act, we demonstrate our commitment to those who have served our nation and do everything in our power to prevent veteran suicide.
If you or a veteran you know is in crisis, please call the Veterans Crisis Line at 988 and Press 1, or text 838255.
Help is available 24/7, and you don't have to be enrolled in VA benefits or health care to connect with caring, qualified responders.
