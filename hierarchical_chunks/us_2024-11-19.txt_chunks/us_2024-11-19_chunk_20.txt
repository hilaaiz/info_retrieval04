Mr. Massey served on the city council from 1978 to 1984 and as Mayor of the City of Brownwood from 1984 to May 2010, while practicing law as a partner for Massey & West.
As the longest-serving Mayor, 
Mr. Massey was instrumental in countless public infrastructure and quality-of-life projects.
Among these are the renovations of the Depot Civic and Cultural Center, the construction of the Martin & Francis Lehnis Railroad Museum, the relocation of City Hall to Center Ave., the construction of the Joint Law Enforcement Center, the relocation of the Senior Citizens Center, the construction of the Bert V. Massey II Sports Complex and the Camp Bowie Family Aquatic Center.
Along with his years of service to his community, Mayor Massey was a devoted husband, father, and grandfather.
He was known for his wealth of knowledge, engaging stories about his beloved community and his warm smile.
Mayor Massey's dedication to the Brownwood area and love for his family will be deeply missed by all.
I am proud to honor Mayor Massey's many incredible contributions to the City of Brownwood, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family and all who had the privilege of knowing him.
