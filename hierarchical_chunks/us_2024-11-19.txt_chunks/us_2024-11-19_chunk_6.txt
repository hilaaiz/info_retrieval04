Mr. Speaker, we honor Chief Darren Pytel today for his service, his commitment to our Davis community, and the integrity with which he led the Davis Police Department.
His career and leadership have left an indelible mark on our community, and his contributions will continue to benefit our city of Davis for years to come.
It is truly fitting and proper that we recognize Chief Pytel's legacy here today.
