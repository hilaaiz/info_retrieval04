Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Police Chief Darren Pytel, upon his retirement after 41 years of service to our Davis community.
Chief Pytel's career exemplifies commitment to community, service, and excellence, and his legacy in Davis will continue to inspire future generations Chief Pytel grew up in Davis, choosing to remain in his hometown, where he would ultimately dedicate his life's work to enhancing public safety and community trust.
Chief Pytel earned his bachelor's degree in criminal justice at Sacramento State University, and later a Juris Doctorate at Lincoln Law School.
Chief Pytel began his career as a police cadet in 1983 and advanced through nearly every rank within the Davis Police Department.
He served as a bike enforcement officer, police officer, sergeant/watch commander, lieutenant, and Assistant Police Chief before being named Police Chief in 2015.
His leadership has guided the department through some of its most challenging moments, including the tragic loss of Police Officer Natalie Corona, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the spring 2023 homicides.
Throughout his tenure, Chief Pytel led the Davis Police Department with a focus on progressive policing, building trust, and fostering partnerships with the community.
In recognition of Chief Pytel's innovative approach to policing, he received the Multi-Cultural Community Council Administration of Justice Award for establishing the Alternative Conflict Resolution process, which allows for peaceful conflict mediation and community-based resolution.
Chief Pytel has also served as an educator, teaching aspiring public safety professionals in Sacramento City College's Administration of Justice Department since 2007.
After his retirement from the police department, Chief Pytel will continue his teaching role at the college while residing in Fair Oaks with his wife, Melissa.
Together, they look forward to spending more time with their four children and five grandchildren.
