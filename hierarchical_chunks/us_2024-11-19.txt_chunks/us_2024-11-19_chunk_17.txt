Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this past September, I had the honor of commemorating the historic 100th Anniversary of the Oceanville Volunteer Fire Company, a milestone that marks decades of exceptional service to our community.
Oceanville Fire is the oldest fire department in Galloway Township, established in 1924 by local community members.
These visionary individuals, primarily farmers and shell-fishermen, recognized the urgent need for fire protection and rescue services.
Their selfless dedication set the foundation for the department we know today.
The department, now consisting of 39 men and women, continues to serve the township with unwavering commitment.
Their dedication as extraordinarily well-trained firefighters echoes the spirit of the founding members many years ago, providing a sense of security to the township.
Through the years, Oceanville Fire has proven to be a vital part of the community and has played a crucial role in making its residents feel safe.
I am deeply grateful to the Oceanville Volunteer Fire Company for their century of great service and may they continue to protect and serve for many more.
God bless Oceanville Fire Department, and God bless our United States.
