Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of David John Meyer, Chicago Fire Department Captain.
In 1996, David joined the Chicago Fire Department and committed nearly three decades of his life to serving the city.
Before David rose through the ranks and became Captain of Truck 29, he was a Lieutenant on Truck 35, where he was not only known for his fearless leadership style, but also for his strong commitment to the Chicago Fire Department, the community he served, and his fellow firefighters.
Chicago's firefighters put their lives on the line for us every single day and David spent his entire career protecting our property, communities, people, and city.
He was described as a hero by his colleagues.
I can only echo their sentiments and say that Chicago has lost one of our finest public servants.
He leaves an unforgettable mark on the city.
The passion David brought to his work protecting our city was also displayed in several other aspects of his life--whether it was through entertaining his family and friends, the jokes that kept his friends and family laughing, or riding his Harley around the country.
David also displayed his dedication as an avid carpenter and the proprietor of Meyer Builders, a family business.
His remarkable carpentry was even featured on HGTV's Windy City Rehab.
David was a proud Chicagoan who loved cheering for hometown sports, including the Cubs, Bears, and Blackhawks.
Most importantly, he was a family man.
He met his wife of 30 years, Kristen, at Lane Tech College Prep High School at the age of 16.
He is survived by his wife, three daughters, a son, and his parents.
The city of Chicago and the Chicago Fire Department have lost a true hero that will be dearly missed.
His legacy will be remembered by his family, friends, loved ones, colleagues, and the many lives he touched.
I am forever grateful to David for the work that he did to protect our city and could not be prouder to have him as my constituent.
