Mr. GOODEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible accomplishment of the Trinity Valley Community College Men's Basketball Team, who, under the leadership of Coach Greg Heiar, secured their first-ever national championship in 2025.
In his first season as head coach, Coach Heiar led the Cardinals to a 69-61 victory over Connors State in the NJCAA D1 Men's Basketball National Championship in Hutchinson, Kansas.
This victory concluded a dominant 34-3 season, marking the best in the program's history.
The Cardinals showed remarkable resilience, determination, and unity throughout the season.
They embraced the tough, defense-first mentality instilled by their coach, and each player's commitment to the team's success played a critical role in bringing home this historic title.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Coach Heiar, his coaching staff, and the entire men's basketball team.
Their hard work, dedication, and pride in their community have made this championship a lasting symbol of excellence for the Trinity Valley community.
