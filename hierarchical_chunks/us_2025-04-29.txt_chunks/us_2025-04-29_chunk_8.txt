Ms. VELAZQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jessica Arocho, an exceptional individual who has devoted her life to serving the North Brooklyn community.
As the Director of Community Affairs at NYC Health + Hospitals/Woodhull, Jessica exemplifies the spirit of service that defines our community leaders.
Jessica is a true product of Williamsburg, following in the footsteps of her strong Puerto Rican mother, Dona Carmen Gines, and other influential community leaders.
Her lifelong commitment to service began in her childhood, when she frequently accompanied her mother to Woodhull Hospital, their trusted medical home.
It is also where her youngest daughter was born, and where Jessica began her career in the Youth Outreach program.
Since taking on the role as Director of Community Affairs in January 2020, Jessica has been instrumental in enhancing the hospital's outreach and building partnerships with local organizations.
She advocates for good health and promotes positive energy within the community, ensuring that residents have access to essential health resources.
Her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly noteworthy; she ensured that hospital staff received essential supplies, including meals and personal protective equipment.
Additionally, she organized successful initiatives that provided thousands of coats, toys, backpacks, and school supplies to families in need.
Jessica's dedication extends beyond her professional responsibilities.
She has served on the Community Advisory Board (CAB) for 16 years, including five years as Chair, and held the position of Vice Chair of the NYC Health + Hospitals Council of CABs.
She has also been an integral part of Woodhull's leadership team, advocating for the hospital's funding and operational needs.
Her commitment to the community has been recognized, as she was named to Crain's ``2021 Notable Hispanic Leaders and Executives'' list, highlighting her role as a strong advocate for NYC Health + Hospitals/ Woodhull.
Her relentless efforts and steadfast dedication to the Williamsburg and Bushwick communities serve as an inspiration for future generations of leaders.
