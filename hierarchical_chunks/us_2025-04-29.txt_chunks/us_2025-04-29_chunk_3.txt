Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania for their 50th anniversary.
Originally created by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the Railroad Museum opened its doors 50 years ago in April 1975.
The first structure in North America specifically built as a railroad museum, the Railroad Museum has since added building restorations, an education center, a museum store, and many new exhibits.
The museum is affiliated with the Smithsonian and the Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission, and has received generous community support from an aptly named nonprofit, the Friends of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.
