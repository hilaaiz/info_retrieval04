Today, the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania's world-class collection includes over 100 historic locomotives and railroad cars, a vast library with half a million photographs and documents, a working restoration shop, and 20,000 smaller items relating to Pennsylvania railroads.
As the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania celebrates their golden anniversary year, I would like to thank the museum for the educational opportunities they provide and for their work in keeping not just our community's history, but Pennsylvania's history, alive.
