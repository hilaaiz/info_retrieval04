Mr. CRAWFORD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Black River Technical College on its 50th Anniversary as a two-year degree conferring institution serving the First Congressional District of Arkansas.
Since its founding, Black River Technical College has played a major role in the professional development of the citizens of Northeast Arkansas and Southeast Missouri by offering a wide range of programs, such as associate degrees, technical certificates, certificates of proficiency, and adult and continuing education courses.
Located on two campuses in Pocahontas and Paragould, Arkansas, with an enrollment of approximately 2,500 students, Black River Technical College has a vision to ``lead [the] community in learning and economic development.''
BRTC's staff and faculty members are engaged in our community and have truly made a difference in the lives of thousands of people in my part of the country.
The First District is better because Congratulations to Black River Technical College.
I wish them many more years as a successful, integral member of the Northeast Arkansas community.
