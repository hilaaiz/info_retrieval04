Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Fran Duvall, who joined my office when I first came to Congress.
Fran had worked for my predecessor Sidney R. Yates, who recommended that I hire Fran because Fran was kind, sweet, patient, competent and diligent in setting up our operations.
She set an early example for my young staff on how to be an effective staffer on Capitol Hill.
She was integral in my seamless transition to the House of Representatives and I, like my staff, relied on her guidance.
But more importantly, she was progressive, welcoming, and inclusive before that was fashionable.
Fran represented the very best of this lnstitution.
I send my deepest condolences to her family and gratitude for sharing her with Team Schakowsky and the House.
I include in the Record the following obituary, published in the December 5th Washington Post, describing her life of achievement.
