Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a loyal South Carolina State University alumnus, inspirational leader, and legendary football coach on his retirement.
Coach Oliver ``Buddy'' Pough will retire as head coach of the South Carolina State Bulldogs football team at the end of the 2023 season after 22 years.
Coach Pough first joined the South Carolina State Football Team as an undergraduate student in the 1970s.
As an offensive lineman, Pough helped lead his team to a league crown and back-to-back postseason appearances.
After graduation, Pough's passion for the sport led him to seek a career in coaching.
Over three decades, Pough coached at numerous South Carolina high schools and the University of South Carolina before returning to South Carolina State University as the school's 14th head coach in 2002.
Under Coach Pough's leadership, the team found almost immediate success.
In 2004, the team tied for the Mid-Easter Athletic Conference (MEAC) championship.
This was followed by back-to-back outright MEAC titles and FCS playoff appearances during the 2008 and 2009 seasons.
Later, Coach Pough led the team to four additional shared MEAC titles and two additional FCS playoff appearances.
After almost two decades as head coach, Pough secured his first Celebration Bowl Championship in 2021 and his fifth HBCU National Crown.
Coach Pough is ranked among the top HBCU and MEAC coaches of all time.
He has won three MEAC Coach of the Year Awards, two National Coach of the Year awards, and two national HBCU titles.
In 2019, Coach Pough became the winningest head football coach in South Carolina State University history.
During his retirement, Coach Pough hopes to spend more time with his wife of 47 years, Josie, his sons, and his grandchildren.
