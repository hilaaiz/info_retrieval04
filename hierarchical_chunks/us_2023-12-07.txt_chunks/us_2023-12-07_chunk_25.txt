Mr. LARSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Chief Master Sergeant Chloe Rainey-Fluellen, United States Air Force, and her work as the Department of Defense (DoD) legislative fellow detailed to my office for 2023.
In 2022, Chief Master Sergeant Rainey-Fluellen was selected to represent the Air Force as a DoD legislative fellow.
The DoD legislative fellowship program provides superior servicemembers with valuable legislative experience and an understanding of how congressional actions affect DoD's budget, roles and missions, force structure, military projects, and quality of life.
Over the past year, Chief Master Sergeant Rainey-Fluellen has been essential to my office and the defense portfolio.
She has crafted and coordinated National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) amendments in line with my priorities and the needs of Northwest Washington communities.
