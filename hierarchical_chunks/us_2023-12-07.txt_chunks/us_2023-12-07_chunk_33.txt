Mr. NEAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable veteran, an esteemed member of our community in western Massachusetts, and a national hero.
Born and raised in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Harry L. Chandler is one of the few remaining members of the Greatest Generation.
Now 102 years old, Harry will be returning to Pearl Harbor to commemorate the day that will live in infamy.
Harry's military service began when he chose to enlist in the United States Navy in 1939, right before completing his high school education.
Enlisting as a hospital corpsman, his service in the Navy during World War II showcases his courage and commitment to our country, bravely facing the perils of war.
His experiences during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, are etched in our nation's history.
Harry's actions that day, rescuing fellow sailors amidst chaos and witnessing the tragic fate of the USS Arizona and USS Utah, are a stark reminder This week, as Harry returns to Pearl Harbor, he is not just revisiting a site of historical significance; he is returning as a living testament to the bravery of those who served alongside him.
Accompanied by his granddaughter, Kelli Fahey, and her husband, Ron Mahaffee, Harry will partake in numerous commemorative ceremonies, including the profound honor of saluting a battleship during the USS Arizona memorial service.
