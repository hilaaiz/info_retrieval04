Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in celebrating Coach Pough's remarkable career.
He is well-regarded by his peers in South Carolina and across the Nation and has transformed the lives of countless student-athletes on and off the field.
Coach Pough will remain a pillar of the SC State community and continue to make our beloved alma mater shine every day.
