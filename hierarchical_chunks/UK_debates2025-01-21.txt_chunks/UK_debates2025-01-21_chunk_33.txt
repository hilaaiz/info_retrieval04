I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue, which clearly is important to him and his constituents.
I confirmed to the House today that the Minister for Trade in the Department for Business and Trade is working with the trustees of the BCSSS to consider options.
I will meet the Minister to look at those options and provide further updates to the House in due course.
