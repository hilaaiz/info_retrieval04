I have significant former mining areas in the Douglas valley and Upper Nithsdale in my constituency.
Constituents there are concerned about the British Coal scheme, because many people in that scheme actually worked underground before being promoted into other jobs.
To ensure fairness in the implementation of this Government policy, will the Minister make sure that the timescale on which they are compensated is the same as that for those in the other scheme?
