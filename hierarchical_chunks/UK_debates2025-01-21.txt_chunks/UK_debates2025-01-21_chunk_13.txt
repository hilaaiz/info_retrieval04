The bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis builds innovative electric buses, employing 800 people in Scarborough.
The Chancellor has spoken about the need for public procurement to take better account of employment and environmental standards.
As bus services are brought back into the control of mayors and local authorities, will the Government use public procurement to back British companies such as Alexander Dennis to boost economic growth?
My hon.
Friend is a good advocate for businesses, including Alexander Dennis in Scarborough.
The Government will soon publish a new national procurement policy statement, which will set out our priorities for public procurement in support of our mission to grow the economy.
In addition to the answer I gave my hon.
Friend  the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (David Williams) , we recognise the importance of buses in growing our economy by getting people to work, but also the opportunities to use public procurement to buy more buses made in this country, supporting good jobs here in Britain.
