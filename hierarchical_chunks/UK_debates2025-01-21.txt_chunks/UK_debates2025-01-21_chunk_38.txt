Will the Chancellor advise businesses in my constituency that are having to make staff unemployed and stop expansion plans in order to pay for her increases in employer national insurance contributions?
We have been clear since the Budget that the decision to raise employer national insurance contributions was one of the toughest we have taken as a Government, and we recognise that it has consequences for businesses.
However, we think all businesses will benefit in future from the economic stability that this decision will bring; it will drive investment and growth across the country.
Will my right hon.
Friend join me in congratulating Intasite, a technology business in Stockton that is celebrating its 10th anniversary with 40% growth?
Does she agree that our industrial strategy will help businesses to invest and grow in Teesside?
I join my hon.
Friend in congratulating Intasite on its 10th anniversary as a business, and on the rapid growth it is enjoying.
The announcement we were able to make last year on the carbon capture and storage work in Teesside will be a big driver of jobs and growth there, and I look forward to working with him and local businesses in Stockton to make that a reality.
Does the Chancellor of the Exchequer propose funding the reported £9 billion bill to the Mauritians for the continued use of Diego Garcia through higher taxes, more borrowing or spending cuts?
We are in discussions with the new Administration in the United States around the future of Diego Garcia.
We will set out details in the spending review, as the right hon.
Gentleman would expect.
It is estimated that 148,000 people had their lives cut short between 2010 and 2020 as a result of austerity measures; on top of that, poor health led to more than £13 billion in lost productivity under the previous Government.
What are my right hon.
Friend’s estimates of the different choices, and the impact that they will have on the health of the nation and economic growth?
