Confidence on Britain’s high streets is sliding faster than the Chancellor will be down the ski slopes of Davos later today.
With retail sales down—rather than up, as expected in the run-up to Christmas—and with the British Retail Consortium saying that two thirds of stores will raise prices to cover her national insurance increases, when will the Minister accept that the Chancellor’s economic strategy of raising taxes and increasing regulations is not working?
I am glad to know that the shadow Minister’s morning was well spent cooking up that line about the Davos ski slopes.
What he will know, and what sectors across the economy will know, is that having a stable economy is a prerequisite for the investment we need to get the economy growing.
That is why we had to take difficult decisions at the autumn Budget, including those to increase the rate of employer national insurance contributions.
Alongside that increase, however, we more than doubled the employment allowance and set out our plans to have permanently lower tax rates for high street RHL properties from April 2026.
