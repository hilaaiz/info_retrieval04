I thank the right hon.
Member for his question, and I think “fairness” is the right word.
That is why we worked in opposition to try to persuade the last Government to act on the mineworkers’ pension scheme, but we failed because the last Government did not think this was an urgent issue for them to consider.
The Labour Government have implemented this change at our first Budget, and that is fairness in  action.
We will continue to work with trustees of the BCSSS, and we will come back with further options in due course.
