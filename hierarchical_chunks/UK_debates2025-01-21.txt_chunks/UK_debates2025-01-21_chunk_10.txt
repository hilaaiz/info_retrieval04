I thank my hon.
Friend for the work that she has put into this proposal and for her commitment to delivering growth in her constituency of Stoke.
On a recent visit, I had the opportunity to meet JCB in the region and see its important work, particularly on the use of hydrogen.
I encourage my hon.
Friend to meet the Minister for Services, Small Businesses and Exports—I am happy to set up that meeting—whose portfolio includes local growth.
The Government are committed to driving growth in the midlands, which is why I confirmed funding for the west midlands investment zone at the autumn Budget and also confirmed an extension of the UK shared prosperity fund.
