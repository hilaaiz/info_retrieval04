I am grateful for the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
His work on the persecution of Christians across the world reads across to some of those challenges in making sure we have cohesive communities across the UK.
Of course, policing in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter, so it is not for a Minister in the UK Parliament, but I assure him that we give the best insight to make sure that public institutions are interacting in the best way possible.
I often feel for junior officers who, early in their service, are having to deal with what are often quite complicated issues in live time.
We want to make sure they get the best information so that they are able to do so.
Before we come to the Home Secretary’s statement, I want to say that I appreciate that it has been most frustrating for the House that we have not been able to discuss the issues relating to this case because of ongoing prosecutions.
Although the case is still technically sub judice until sentencing on Thursday, given that the accused has pleaded guilty to all charges and that there is strong public interest in the House being able to discuss these matters, I am granting a waiver so that Members may discuss it freely.
I am confident that the House’s sub judice resolution has been followed correctly, and I am grateful to Members for their patience in not discussing this case substantially before now.
I am going to ensure that the House’s sub judice resolution is reviewed to ensure it is fit for purpose.
