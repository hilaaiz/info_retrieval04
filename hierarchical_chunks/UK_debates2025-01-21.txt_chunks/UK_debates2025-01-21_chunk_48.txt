I thank the Minister for his answers to all the questions.
In Northern Ireland, of course, we face extremism from the left and right, but at the same time we have managed to have community engagement, and I believe lessons can be learned.
It is essential that our police forces have the wherewithal to deal with threats through an appropriate mechanism.
The designation of community threats and extremism is truly essential.
Will the Minister outline whether the process of designation can be streamlined to ensure that the police have all the powers they need to work within communities to root out and deal with paramilitaries and extremists, with safeguards for human rights?
