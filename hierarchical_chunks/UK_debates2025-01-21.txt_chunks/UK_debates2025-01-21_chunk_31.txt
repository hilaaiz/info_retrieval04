I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I know that the cost of living has a deep impact on all our constituents, including in Coatbridge and Bellshill.
Like my hon.
Friend, I was pleased to see the reduction in inflation last week.
The Bank of England’s independence is sacrosanct to carry on those efforts.
In addition, we increased the minimum wage in the Budget, we have reformed universal credit to reduce deductions and we have extended the household support fund, all to help ensure that working families have more money in their pockets.
