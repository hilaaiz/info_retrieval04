I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that question on an issue that I know is deeply important to him, his constituents and his family, and on which he has worked for many years.
The Government are actively considering proposals from the scheme’s trustees, and we will set out the next steps in due course.
My hon.
Friend the Minister for Industry in the Department for Business and Trade will be working on the detail, and I will be meeting her shortly to consider the options.
