First, let us remember the three young, innocent victims of this savage and senseless attack: Bebe King was just six years old, Elsie Dot Stancombe was seven and Alice da Silva Aguiar was nine years old.
Their lives were cruelly cut short as they attended a Taylor Swift dance class.
It should have been a time of joy, part of a precious and innocent childhood to be cherished and remembered, and yet the darkest of shadows fell over Southport that day as those girls were robbed of their young lives.
Let us not forget that eight more children and two adults were seriously injured on that day as well.
Many of us in the House are parents or grandparents, and many people listening today will be too.
We can only begin to imagine the pain and grief the parents and family of Bebe, Elsie and Alice must now be feeling.
We should recognise and thank the first responders who arrived at the scene.
