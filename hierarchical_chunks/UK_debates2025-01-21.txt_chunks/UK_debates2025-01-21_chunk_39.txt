I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I know she studies closely the work of Professor Michael Marmot on life expectancy and the impact of health inequalities on our country.
At the Budget, we increased the minimum wage.
In addition, we extended the household support fund and reduced the amount that could be taken in deductions from universal credit, all to try to put more money in the pockets of ordinary working people, to reduce some of those inequalities and tackle the cost of living crisis.
