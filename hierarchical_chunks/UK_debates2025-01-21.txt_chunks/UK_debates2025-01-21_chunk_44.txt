At a time when we are seeing such an increase in religious hate crime, including Islamophobia and antisemitism, we all have a duty in this House to be careful about the language we use.
I hope that the Government will look at their language, because it is vital for community cohesion that we are careful and do not unintentionally inflame tensions.
There are some really critical issues to consider, not just in this country but around the world.
The Minister said that he is looking at the definition of extremism, and at changing measures put in place by the previous Government.
Will he outline whether the Government will consult on any new definition?
If we are honest and look back, there was a lack of consultation by the previous Government.
I am grateful for the Chair of the Select Committee’s question.
Language is important, and it is reasonable and right that our constituents expect us to be robust with those who choose to challenge and undermine democracy and the basic principles that guide our society, but also that we do not use our very privileged platform to give succour to hateful ideas and prejudices.
Indeed, one thing that we know about the changing nature of terror is that individuals are taking cues from organisations that stop short of the threshold for inflaming terrorist-type behaviours.
They are using that as encouragement, so we all have a responsibility to be measured in our response.
With regard to the engagement with the Home Office, we want to make sure that anything that comes out of the cross-Government sprint and into the strategy can be bought into and owned by communities across the country, so there will be engagement.
