I thank my hon.
Friend for her question on a topic that I know she has great expertise in.
She will know that it is important that spending across Departments, whether on military, humanitarian or economic support, is aligned with our ODA spending.
The multi-year spending review is under way, and we will confirm budgets in June for the years ahead.
As I have confirmed, we will come back to the House every year to review and confirm the fiscal tests as they relate to 0.7% of GNI on ODA.
