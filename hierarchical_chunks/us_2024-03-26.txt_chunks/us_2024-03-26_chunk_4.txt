Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend and an esteemed leader in Contra Costa County, John Coleman, as he retires from the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) Board of Directors after 33 years of dedicated service and is honored as the Lafayette Citizen of the Year.
Throughout his career, John has been instrumental in shaping vital water policy in our state, forging increased collaboration between a variety of California water agencies, working to protect the East Bay's water supply, and guiding the agency through multiple state-wide droughts.
John was first elected to EBMUD's board in 1990 representing the communities of Alamo, Lafayette, Walnut Creek, Danville, Pleasant Hill, and San Ramon.
John played a key role in the founding of the Freeport Regional Water Authority (FRWA), an agency tasked with guiding the financing, ownership, construction, and operations of the Freeport Regional Water Project.
John is also the longest-serving board member in EBMUD's history.
Prior to his work with EBMUD, John served as President of the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) and the California Association of Sanitation Agencies (CASA).
He also was President of the Lafayette Chamber Board and spearheaded the creation of the annual Lafayette Reservoir Run for Education.
John has been a strong supporter of youth in our community, having served as Scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 243 in Lafayette for more than 20 years and later going on to serve as an Eagle Advisor.
We are grateful for John's continued dedication to our community and wish him luck at his new post in the Calaveras County Water District.
Please join me in honoring and congratulating John Coleman as he retires after more than three decades of devoted service with EBMUD.
