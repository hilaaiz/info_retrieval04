Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
I promise that I will not ask for multiple answers— Order.
Can Members please observe the proceedings?
It is important.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I promise that I will only ask for one answer this time.
Without a price stability mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel, which will be crucial in bringing down our carbon footprint, the UK risks falling behind the SAF mandate by 2030.
A homegrown sustainable aviation fuel industry could contribute £2 billion a year to this economy.
In order for that to happen— Order.
Make a guess at that, Minister.
I am not going through another five minutes.
All right.
I think I know what the hon.
Lady was driving at on that question.
We said in response to the new report that we would continue to talk to the industry and, if required, consult on a mechanism—an industry-funded mechanism.
That work is under way, but we continue to have the ambition to get those SAF plants developed in this country and I am glad that she supports that work.
What can the Government do about the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the police chasing drivers who have correctly sent in their forms after they have disposed of a vehicle and who then get notices of intended prosecution for a vehicle that they no longer own when they have done the right thing?
It seems to turn on its head the principle of innocence.
