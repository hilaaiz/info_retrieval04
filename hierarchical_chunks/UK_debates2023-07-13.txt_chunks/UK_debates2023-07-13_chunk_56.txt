I thank my right hon.
Friend for all his commitment, and indeed for his personal visits to Ukraine to see at first hand what is happening and how best we can tailor our support.
He is right about the mines that have been left by the Russian armies—it is a considerable effort to have them cleared.
I want to reassure him that we are in close communication with the Ukrainian military about exactly what capabilities and equipment it needs to clear minefields and support its armed forces as they make progress.
We will continue to have that conversation and work with allies to get it all the kit it needs.
