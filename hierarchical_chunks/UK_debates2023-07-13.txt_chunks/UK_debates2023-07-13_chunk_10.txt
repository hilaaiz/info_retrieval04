I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I was in the west midlands just a couple of weeks ago visiting the RAC just off the M42.
The scheme between junctions 3 and 4 to replace the barrier will provide increased safety to drivers, which remains our top priority.
Once completed, the new barrier will require significantly less maintenance and repair after incidents, which will further reduce disruption for her constituents.
To minimise disruption, National Highways has endeavoured to keep all lanes open to traffic and is utilising the longer daytime hours and good weather to complete the works as quickly as possible for her constituents.
