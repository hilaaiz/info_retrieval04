I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
In the interests of time, I might point him in the direction of the Secretary-General’s press conference from the day before yesterday, which explained—in more detail than I have time for now—the process and how this has been done previously.
As he pointed out, accession to NATO has never been a question of timing; it has always been a question of conditions and circumstances.
My hon.
Friend will be familiar with the fact that there is an ongoing conflict.
There are also requirements on all NATO members when it comes to areas such as modernisation, governance and interoperability, which Ukraine is now firmly on the path towards fulfilling, not least because of the help and support that we have provided over the past year.
