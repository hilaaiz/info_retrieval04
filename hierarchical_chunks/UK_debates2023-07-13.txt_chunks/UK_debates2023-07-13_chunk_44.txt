I thank the hon.
Member for all his work in this regard, and he is absolutely right.
With regard to Bradford, the Transport Committee’s report made a recommendation that better station options should be considered under the integrated rail plan.
That work with Bradford will now commence to try to find a better station option and to improve transport links for the city.
With regard to Leeds, the station capacity can be looked at and potentially unlocked, and the HS2 route options all the way up from Sheffield to Leeds will also be part of that study.
