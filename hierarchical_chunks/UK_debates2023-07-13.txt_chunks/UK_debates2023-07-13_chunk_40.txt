I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
When a person disposing of their vehicle notifies the DVLA that they no longer have the vehicle, they are removed from the record and the DVLA writes to them.
If the customer continues to receive correspondence relating to motor vehicle offences, they should contact the DVLA as soon as possible confirming that they are no longer the keeper of the vehicle in question.
If he has any constituents with any particular issues, I would be delighted to take them up and look at them as soon  as possible.
