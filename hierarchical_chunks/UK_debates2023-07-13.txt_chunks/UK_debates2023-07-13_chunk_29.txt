I thank the Secretary of State for that waffle.
I actually asked him about the basic planning assumptions for this project, because the ongoing case for HS2 would have had to be based on estimates of future passenger numbers, particularly for business travel and inter-city commuting.
Following the pandemic, we all know there has been a major change because of video conferencing and working from home.
What are his Department’s latest projections of inter-city passenger numbers, and how do they affect the viability of the HS2 project, quite apart from the escalating construction costs?
Will he publish those figures?
