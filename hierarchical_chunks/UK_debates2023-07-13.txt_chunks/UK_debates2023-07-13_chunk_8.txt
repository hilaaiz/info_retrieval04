I thank my hon.
Friend—I enjoy all the work that I do with him.
I take the point that he makes with regard to Stephen, but I passionately believe that the best help that anyone can give in a rail station is through personal interaction.
That is difficult when somebody is behind a glass screen, because they are not able to exit that point and go and help.
It was striking that the recent report on accessibility by the Office of Rail and Road showed that demand for passenger assist  at stations had increased by 68%.
On that basis, and because fewer people are now purchasing tickets from the ticket office—only one in 10—it surely makes sense to put the staff out on the platforms where they can be accessed, and where they can help and reassure people and give them more assistance.
