I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I think he welcomes what we have decided to do with the 6.5% pay increase, which leaves a typical teacher with £44,300.
We are reprioritising within the Department for Education’s existing budget to deliver the additional funding to schools, but we are protecting core schools funding and frontline services.
We have put in additional sums of money through the spending review and subsequent fiscal events: £330 million in 2023-24 and £550 million in 2024-25.
The numbers add up, and he will recognise that.
