Can I go back to the astonishingly feeble answer from the Minister of State, the right hon.
Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman), about Heathrow, which is a major international hub, a major export centre, the biggest single site employer, with, I am pleased to say, a well-organised union workforce, and vital for west London?
How can the Government not have a view or a policy on this vital national infrastructure, or is it just another case of they haven’t got a clue?
I know that the right hon.
Gentleman likes to hear from me, so I will answer this question.
He can then think of a way of insulting whatever I say in response.
The point that my right hon.
Friend was making is that any proposal for a third runway at Heathrow will be a private sector proposal from that airport and, as last time, we would expect it to be funded by the airport.
He knows that, if it brings forward such a proposal, the Government would have to take a quasi-judicial planning decision, which is why it is important that I do not take a pre-judged position so I can take that quasi-judicial decision appropriately.
At the moment, however, we have not seen such a proposal from Heathrow.
If it has one in due course, we will respond accordingly.
Despite billions being invested in buses across the country and £31.7 million going specifically into Stoke-on-Trent, First Bus continues to cut routes, harming 21-year-old carers such as Charlie Preston in Chell who may now have to quit her job.
This Government have done their bit—is it not time that First Bus does its bit?
