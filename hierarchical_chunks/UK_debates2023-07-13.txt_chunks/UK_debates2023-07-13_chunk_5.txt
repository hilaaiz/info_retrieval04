Will my hon.
Friend confirm when my constituents will be able to access the tap-in and tap-out service from the stations in my constituency at Laindon, Basildon, East Tilbury, Pitsea and Stanford-le-Hope?
Yes, I can.
I thank my hon.
Friend for the work he has done in ensuring that part of the roll-out of the 53 includes four of his stations.
I can confirm that we are on track to get those delivered by the end of the year.
Across the rail network, that will take us to more than 400 stations with pay-as-you-go.
