I thank my hon.
Friend—and I thank his constituent—for the work he performs at Berkhamsted and Tring stations.
These stations, along with another 51 stations, will be getting pay-as-you-go by the end of the year.
We know that 90% of transactions are completed outside ticket offices, and this shift tends to increase for stations that operate pay-as-you-go.
He asked about ensuring that staff at ticket barriers are easily identifiable.
I believe that is the case, and we will certainly make sure, as these reforms are rolled out by train operators, that it continues to be the case.
The proposals from train operators are aimed at redeploying ticket office staff to parts of the station where all passengers will access them and see them.
