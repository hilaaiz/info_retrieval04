I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement, and congratulate him on contributing to what I think history will prove to have been one of the most significant summits in NATO’s history.
Will he clarify what he understands is the intention with regard to Ukraine’s membership of NATO?
What would be the purpose of delaying Ukraine’s membership beyond the end of hostilities in Ukraine and the victory for the Ukrainians?
Without the article 5 security guarantee, rebuilding Ukraine will be much more difficult, because investors will not have confidence unless we are providing that security guarantee.
