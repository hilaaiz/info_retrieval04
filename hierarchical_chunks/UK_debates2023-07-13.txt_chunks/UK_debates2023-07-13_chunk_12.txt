I thank my right hon.
Friend for his excellent and continued work in this area, alongside his colleagues in Chelmsford, Southend and elsewhere in Essex.
I am particularly pleased to see that he has already managed to persuade Essex County Council to move ahead with a lane rental scheme, and his regulatory reform suggestions are being considered by the Department.
I hope to be able to update the House later in the year, because the progress that he has suggested is directly feeding into the Government’s general policy.
