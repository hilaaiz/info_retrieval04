Does the Minister have an estimate for the cost of decarbonising our transport system, especially when we factor in the improvements to the national grid for the extra electricity supply?
Will he also look again at reversing the deeply unpopular policy of banning internal combustion engine vehicles from being sold after 2030?
The hon.
Gentleman will be aware that a very wide range of information about potential costs and budgets is already in the public domain from the Department across a very wide range of modes.
On electric vehicles, we have just consulted on regulations on the zero-emission vehicle mandate, and £6 billion of new private investment is being scheduled on the basis of those projections.
That will transform our charging infrastructure, and we should all welcome it.
