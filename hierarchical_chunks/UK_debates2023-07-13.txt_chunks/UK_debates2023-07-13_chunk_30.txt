I think the right hon.
Gentleman fundamentally misunderstands.
First, HS2 is a railway for the coming decades, not for the next few years.
What happened during the pandemic should not affect the case for HS2.
Also, he assumes that business travellers are the only people who will use HS2.
It is true that business and commuter traffic is down following the pandemic, but we have seen leisure services rebound very strongly, with passenger numbers higher than they were pre-pandemic.
When I was in Japan recently, I saw that high-speed trains are not only used by business users; they are used by everyone who uses the railway.
HS2 will free up enormous capacity for the right hon.
Gentleman’s constituents on the west coast main line, and it will get more freight off the roads and on to our rail network.
He should welcome all those things.
What steps he is taking to improve rail services.
Earlier this year, I set out my vision to modernise the railway industry as part of my Bradshaw address.
This includes ambitions for a customer-focused, commercially led rail industry and the creation of Great British Railways as its new guiding mind.
We continue to invest record sums in improving infrastructure and, just last week, I was pleased to officially open the latest phase of the south-west rail resilience programme at Dawlish, part of a £165 million investment to date, which I know the hon.
Gentleman is about to welcome.
