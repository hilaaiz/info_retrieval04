I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and it was a delight to visit some of his constituents not that long ago in Sandy to discuss this and Biggleswade roundabout on a route I use regularly.
We will continue to keep all these schemes for the long-term improvement of our strategic road network under review.
They are very important, particularly when it comes to road safety, and I look forward to having further discussions with him in future.
