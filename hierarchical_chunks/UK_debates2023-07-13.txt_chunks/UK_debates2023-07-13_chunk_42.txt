I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I was delighted to visit Stoke with him and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Jack Brereton)  to see what is going on.
I urge the council to use that flexibility to work with First Bus to deliver a solution for all his constituents.
We have put that flexibility in there
and I hope that it uses it to protect his constituents.
