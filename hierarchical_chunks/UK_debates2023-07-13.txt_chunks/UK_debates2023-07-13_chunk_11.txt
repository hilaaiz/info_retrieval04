I thank the Minister for personally endorsing my “Can the cones” campaign and my associated Roadworks (Regulation) Bill, which has its Second Reading in November.
One great frustration of modern life is spending ages crawling through a set of traffic lights at a contraflow to finally drive past a large hole in the road, immaculately coned off with no one doing any work on it.
The Bill is designed to make it much more difficult for that to happen.
Does the Minister have any good news at all that might help all of us in our constituencies to can the cones?
