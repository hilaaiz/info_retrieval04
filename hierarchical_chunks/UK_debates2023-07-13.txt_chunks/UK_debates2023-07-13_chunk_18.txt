I thank the hon.
Lady for her multiple questions.
The Government have committed to look into municipal buses by the end of the Parliament.
On devolution, we are happy to work with local authorities right across England and Wales on devolution settlements and what more can be done.
I was delighted to visit Lothian Buses to see its fantastic red, white and gold livery right across the streets of Edinburgh and the wider region.
I saw the excellent work it is doing on the ground, not just on local bus service provision but being a responsive service to the local community she represents.
