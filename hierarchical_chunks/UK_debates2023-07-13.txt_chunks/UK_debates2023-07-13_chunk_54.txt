I welcome the Prime Minister’s statement.
I returned from Ukraine in the last few days, where I was quite close to the frontline working with a charity.
The one thing that I must tell the Prime Minister is that the people of Ukraine are enormously grateful for the leadership that he and the UK have shown within NATO.
They never stop telling us how much they welcome the UK’s leadership in this matter.
