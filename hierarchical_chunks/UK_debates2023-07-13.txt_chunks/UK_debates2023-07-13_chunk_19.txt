Low-emission bus rollout in Cambridgeshire is going good guns but, sadly, all in Cambridge.
At the same time, the 36 bus, which connects the village of Thorney with Eye and Peterborough, will be axed by Stagecoach at the end of the month.
So many people rely on that service in Thorney to go to doctor’s appointments, see family and friends and go shopping.
Shockingly, the combined authority Mayor has known about the axing since May and has done nothing—squat.
Can the Minister think of a better way to spend the millions given to the Mayor for bus rollout and to save the 36 bus for all those people who rely on it?
We will all miss the bus at this rate.
Come on.
My hon.
Friend is a massive champion for his constituents across Peterborough.
The 36 bus is clearly a vital local link.
I encourage him to have those conversations with the combined authority Mayor.
We have made the bus service improvement plan flexible to protect services.
I will make representations to that end on his behalf.
Hopefully, he and the Mayor can come to an arrangement to ensure that all the funding we have put into that combined authority area really benefits the people of Peterborough.
