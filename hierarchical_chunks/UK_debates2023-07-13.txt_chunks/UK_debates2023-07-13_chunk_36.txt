Member’s first point, the work on airspace modernisation is under way, as he knows.
On his second point, this Government are leading the progress on sustainable aviation fuels worldwide.
We published the new report, which set out some clear plans, and we published our response to it.
We are taking that forward and we are at the leading edge of this work globally, setting the agenda, as I hope he would welcome.
