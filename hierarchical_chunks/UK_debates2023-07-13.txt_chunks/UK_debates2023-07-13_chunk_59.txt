The right hon.
Gentleman talks about defence spending, and it is clear that not only have we met the 2% target, but we were one of the first to do so, and we have done so for over a decade.
It is good that others are now catching up, and our leadership on this issue is unquestionable.
How that money is spent is ultimately a question for our military chiefs, to ensure that we have the optimal mix of capabilities to protect ourselves against the threats we face.
I will not  pre-empt the defence Command Paper, other than to say that, when it comes to our armed forces, what is important is not just the quantum in terms of the Army, but how lethal they are, how deployable and how agile.
That has been a particular focus of attention from the Chief of the General Staff, and it is a plan that we are putting in place.
I would maybe draw slightly different lessons from the right hon.
Gentleman’s on the conflict that Ukraine is currently experiencing.
The capabilities that we have brought to bear have been in a range of areas, all of which have received extra investment.
Again, those will be questions for the defence Command Paper, which he will not have to wait very long to see.
