Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of Lois Ruth Cason Wooten, who sadly passed away at the age of 95.
Lois studied English and Library Science at the University of Georgia.
She took her passion and expertise to work as the Head Librarian at Northside High School in Atlanta, Georgia.
After her time in Atlanta, Lois and her husband Frank moved to Savannah, Georgia where they selflessly served the city in a myriad of ways.
Lois was greatly involved in the Savannah Symphony, Savannah College of Art and Design, and Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church.
