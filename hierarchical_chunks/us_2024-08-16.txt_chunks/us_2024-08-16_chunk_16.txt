Mr. and 
Mrs. Wooten are survived by their beloved daughter, Anna, and their wonderful grandchildren.
Lois will always be remembered for her service in the Atlanta and Savannah communities and will be greatly missed by her family and friends.
I offer my sincerest condolences to the entire Wooten family.
My thoughts and prayers are with the family and Lois' friends today.
