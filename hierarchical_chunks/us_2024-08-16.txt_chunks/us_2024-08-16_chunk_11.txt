Ms. Ybarra's actions not only upheld the sanctity of the judicial system but also reinforced the critical role that individuals play in maintaining public trust and confidence.
Today, it is my honor to recognize Estella Ybarra.
She embodies the best of El Paso: bravery, persistence, empathy, and a commitment to justice.
Her actions exemplify the highest ideals of public service.
