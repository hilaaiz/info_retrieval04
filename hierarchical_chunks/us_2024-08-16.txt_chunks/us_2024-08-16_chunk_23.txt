Morristown, which opened in the 1930s but eventually fell into disrepair.
In 1994, the Theater reopened as a performing arts center, sparking a 30-year journey leading to the MPAC we know today.
None of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of countless staff members, volunteers and philanthropists.
MPAC has grown to offer over 200 performances a year to close to 200,000 patrons.
Their events and educational programs not only enrich the community with vibrant music and culture, but have an $18 million impact on the local economy.
MPAC is truly a cultural cornerstone and key economic driver for Northern New Jersey.
MPAC's programs strive to ensure the arts are an integral part of everyone's life by making music, culture, and dance accessible to all.
Their educational programs have grown exponentially to touch over 40,000 children and their families each year of all ages and abilities.
Opening the world for these students while introducing the creative spark and mental health benefits of the arts.
I am especially thankful for MPAC's groundbreaking Miracle Project which brings the communication, social and confidence building skills learned through performance arts education to children and young adults with autism and other special needs.
Whether it is through large scale entertainment events, civic conversations, free community engagement initiatives, or their extensive educational programming, it is clear that MPAC provides a critical forum to immerse ourselves in the arts and open our minds to new cultural experiences.
In this 30th anniversary year, I am grateful for all they have done to support New Jersey artists, our community and our local economy.
I am excited to see their continued impact on the performing arts across New Jersey.
