Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Marine Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region, upon celebrating its 175th anniversary.
Since its inception, the Marine Exchange has been at the forefront of technological advancement in its industry, implementing groundbreaking improvements to make the maritime industry safer for all.
Originally founded in 1849, the Marine Exchange facilitated safe and efficient maritime trade during the California Gold Rush.
Over the decades, the Marine Exchange evolved into a critical driver of innovation in the Bay Area, helping expand and develop the Bay Area's maritime industry.
From installing the first electric telegraph on the West Coast to serving as the research and development site for the first vessel traffic service in the country, the Marine Exchange has played an essential role in supporting the America's maritime infrastructure and promoting navigational and environmental safety.
The Marine Exchange's remarkable milestone of 175 years of service demonstrates the organization's sincere commitment to supporting our country's maritime industry and the countless Americans whose livelihoods depend on it.
This commitment has led to tremendous economic impact in the Bay Area and beyond, strengthened environmental protections, and improved organization and communication throughout the region.
On behalf of the constituents of California's Eighth Congressional District, I would like to honor the Marine Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region upon its 175th anniversary and extend my sincere gratitude for its generations of service to the United States maritime industry.
