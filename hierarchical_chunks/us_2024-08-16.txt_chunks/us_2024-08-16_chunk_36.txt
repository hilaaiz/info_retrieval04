Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pennsylvania State 
Representative Donna Oberlander's advocacy for the 63rd District and to congratulate her on her retirement.
For the past 16 years, Rep. Oberlander has served Clarion and Armstrong Counties, advanced economic opportunities and preserved traditional values.
Throughout her time in public service, Donna has made a lasting impact on our commonwealth.
Her legislation, Act 130 of 2022, permitted pilot driverless testing programs, which have created thousands of jobs and contributed billions in investments.
Her advocacy for Act 7 of 2020 has created safer outcomes for medically fragile newborns by regulating milk banks.
Outside of her numerous legislative accomplishments, Rep. Oberlander is a dependable leader.
In the Pennsylvania State House, Donna has served as Chairwoman for the House Tourism and Economic and Recreational Development Committee, Republican Whip, Republican Policy Chairman, and Caucus Secretary.
Rep. Oberlander's impressive leadership speaks volumes.
She was the first Republican woman to serve as both Republican Whip and Policy Chairman.
Donna Oberlander is an impressive woman; I am fortunate to call her my friend.
I thank her for her service to the people of Pennsylvania and wish her well in retirement.
