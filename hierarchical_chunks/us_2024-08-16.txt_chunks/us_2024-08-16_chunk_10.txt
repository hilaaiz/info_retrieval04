Ms. Ybarra was a juror in a 1990 high-profile case.
When the jury convened to deliberate, she believed in Jaile's innocence but ultimately felt intimidated by the aggressive pushes for a guilty verdict by her white, male peers.
It was her first time serving in a jury and without a full understanding of the legal system, she felt pressured into a guilty vote, though her conscience told her otherwise.
For almost 30 years, her conscious reminded her of the man whose innocence she believed in.
She decided to take action and with great humility, courage, and empathy.
She called the El Paso Police Department, who connected her with the District Attorney's office that had won 
Mr. Jaile's conviction 27 years earlier.
The office agreed to reexamine the case.
The reexamination resulted in an Earth-shattering revelation: the District Attorney's office had DNA evidence from the FBI that exonerated 
Mr. Jaile, but hid the test results.
A judge overseeing the re-opened case called the El Paso Police and prosecutor's office's actions ``unacceptable'' and ``grossly negligent if not more.''
Estella Ybarra, serving in a capacity that demanded both diligence and empathy, demonstrated remarkable courage and an unwavering commitment to justice.
The cascade of events that followed her phone call culminated in Carlos Jaile being released from prison after 27 years of wrongful imprisonment.
Her role in this case, as detailed in a recent Texas Monthly article, showcases her dedication to ensuring fairness and integrity within the judicial process.
