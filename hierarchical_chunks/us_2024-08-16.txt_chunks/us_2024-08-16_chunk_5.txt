Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the city of Fairway, Kansas.
Founded in 1949, the city of Fairway is known as the City of Trees, and like mighty trees that grow from tiny seeds, so has Fairway.
Fairway may be diminutive in size--slightly more than 4,000 people live within one square mile of land, but the city boasts a strong and tightknit community where all are welcome.
This sense of community has sprung up in part through Fairway's beautiful surroundings: the city was initially named for the elegant golf fairways that framed it, and now it is known for the towering trees that line many of its streets.
It's no wonder that Fairway has fostered a strong local business community and has been home to many notable Kansans over the last several decades.
I want to congratulate the city of Fairway on its 75th anniversary, and I look forward to what the next 75 years will bring.
