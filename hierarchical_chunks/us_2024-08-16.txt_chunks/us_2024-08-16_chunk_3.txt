Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I offer these remarks in honor of People Incorporated of Virginia, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year.
People Incorporated has been a leading advocate for the care of rural Virginians, particularly in Southwest Virginia, since the organization's inception.
People Incorporated got its start in August 1964 in Washington County, providing education, day care and recreation for local residents.
At the time, the group was referred to as the Hayter's Gap Community Club before it was changed to the Progressive Community Club.
Expansion of the agency ensued, with services extending to the Bristol area starting in 1974, when it became known as People Incorporated.
The services provided by People Incorporated today help many communities in the Commonwealth, including the people of Buchanan, Dickenson, Russell and Washington Counties, as well as the City of Bristol.
These services include community development projects, family and financial service counseling and employment training, among others.
A resolution from the Virginia House of Delegates commends People Incorporated, noting that the group has grown to such prominence that it ``is regarded as one of the most innovative and successful community action agencies'' in the country.
Given the struggles and challenges that rural Virginians face, the work of groups like People Incorporated makes a difference and improves the living conditions of many.
I look forward to the continued success of People Incorporated, and thank their leadership, their staff and all affiliates for their tireless commitment to the betterment of our region.
