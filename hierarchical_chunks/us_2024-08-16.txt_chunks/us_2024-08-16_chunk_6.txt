Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Kiwanis Club of Brunswick for 100 years of service to Brunswick and its surrounding communities.
Since 1924, the Kiwanis Club of Brunswick has been supporting youth literacy and development.
The club has served countless children and communities across the world, cultivating leadership and initiating impactful projects that have positively affected a multitude of communities.
Kiwanis was also instrumental in starting the Frank Callen Boys and Girls club and continues to support that organization.
The Kiwanis Club brings a spirit of commitment and service to our community, and it is important that we continue to support its engagement and philanthropy.
The Kiwanis Club is making Georgia's First Congressional District a better place to live, work, and learn.
Congratulations to the Kiwanis Club and its volunteers on 100 years of service to Georgians, and people worldwide.
