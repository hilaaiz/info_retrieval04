Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleagues, Representatives Mark DeSaulnier and Eric Swalwell, to honor the retirement of a champion of women's issues, a leader in diversity, and an advocate for high quality and accessible education--Chancellor Carol Christ.
Chancellor Christ began her career in academia at Douglass College, where she studied English Literature and graduated with high honors.
Recognizing the value of the liberal arts and sciences, Chancellor Christ earned a Ph.D. from Yale University before immediately joining the English Department at the distinguished University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley).
Chancellor Christ served as a professor at UC Berkeley for over three decades.
Her titles included chair of the English Department, dean of Division of Humanities, and provost for the College of Letters and Science.
Beyond helping form the minds of the future, Chancellor Christ was key in helping the University achieve its academic and strategic goals.
This made her an ideal choice when in 2017, Chancellor Christ began her term as the 11th chancellor of UC Berkeley.
During her term she oversaw academia and education at the highest level.
Through thoughtful debate and discussion, strategic financial decisions, the consideration of student and community voices on key issues, and encouragement of a positive environment for education; Chancellor Christ helped cement UC Berkeley as one of the premier learning institutes in the world.
We honor Chancellor Christ and congratulate her on a well-earned retirement.
We thank her for her decades of service to educational justice and the careful facilitation of curious young minds and wish her well as she has more time to spend with her children and grandchildren as her legacy continues to grow and impact future generations of students and leaders.
