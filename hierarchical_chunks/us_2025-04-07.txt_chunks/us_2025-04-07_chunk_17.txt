Mr. LaMALFA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service, and memory of Officer Osmar Rodarte, a dedicated law enforcement officer, a U.S. Army veteran, and a loving husband and father.
Officer Rodarte made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty while serving with the Marysville Police Department, tragically taken from us at just 27 years old.
Osmar Rodarte was a proud graduate of Rio Linda High School, Class of 2016.
He answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the United States Army before returning home to continue that service in law enforcement.
As an officer with the Marysville Police Department, he was known for his dedication, professionalism, and commitment to keeping people safe.
On the day he was taken from us, Officer Rodarte was participating in a multi-agency operation targeting transnational drug trafficking organizations, work that is critical in keeping our streets safe from the influence of dangerous criminals.
His sacrifice is a reminder of the risks our law enforcement officers take every day to protect the people they serve.
Officer Rodarte was more than a public servant.
He was a father, a husband, a brother, and a friend.
His fellow officers described him as a true hero, and those who knew him best spoke of his unwavering dedication to his family and loved ones.
In the aftermath of this tragic loss, the people of Marysville, Rio Linda, and the entire North State have come together in mourning, offering prayers and support to his family.
Osmar leaves behind a wife and child who now face an unimaginable loss.
No words can fully ease their grief, but we must ensure that Officer Rodarte's sacrifice isn't forgotten.
His service, both in uniform and in his everyday life, is a testament to his character and his deep sense of duty.
We honor Officer Rodarte's bravery, his service, and his legacy.
Our prayers are with his family, his fellow officers, and all who knew him.
May he rest in eternal peace.
God bless him.
