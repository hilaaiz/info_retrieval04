Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Thomas Owen.
Thomas is a senior at Jesuit College Preparatory School in Dallas.
With his graduation quickly approaching, instead of making the celebration about him, he is organizing a graduation party to benefit Make-A-Wish North Texas.
Thomas serves on the Make-A-Wish Youth Leadership Council, and has brought together a team of students from local North Texas high schools to help support this cause.
He is inspiring others to take action and give back to their communities.
I thank Thomas for inspiring his fellow North Texans through his selflessness and leadership.
Through the use of his entrepreneurial skills, he is making a difference in our community.
