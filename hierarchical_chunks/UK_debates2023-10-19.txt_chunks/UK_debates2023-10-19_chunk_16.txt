The Minister has visited Shrewsbury a number of times at my invitation, and has heard at first hand from the River Severn Partnership, which is trying to find a holistic solution to the problems of managing Britain’s longest river rather than just creating flood barriers which push the problem downstream.
When can give us more information and an update on the resources being afforded to the partnership to support landowners and others who can be part of that solution?
