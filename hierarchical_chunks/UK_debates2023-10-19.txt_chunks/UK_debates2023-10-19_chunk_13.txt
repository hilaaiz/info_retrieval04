Scarborough’s South bay is included in the 7% of bathing water without a blue flag.
North Yorkshire Council recently convened a taskforce of local politicians, the Environment Agency, Yorkshire Water and others, including academics from Durham University, to look at the problem.
It became clear that it is not as simple as many people think.
Discharges come from further north around the bay, and pathogens were picked up not only from human effluent but from sea birds, dogs and ruminants.
Will the Minister take a personal interest in that work, because lessons learned in Scarborough may well apply around the country?
My right hon.
Friend highlights that the issue is not as simple as people think.
That is why our plan for water takes a holistic approach to tackling all sources of water pollution.
It is also why we launched our £34 million slurry fund to help farmers reduce the pollution that they may inadvertently put into watercourses.
I have never heard such codswallop in all my time in the House.
I was born by the Thames and I love the rivers, and I have to say to the Minister that I have seen no Government in history who have put more sewage into our streams, rivers and oceans than hers since the privatisation of water.
I had a meeting about the Thames tideway tunnel yesterday.
That amazing project has already increased wildlife so extraordinarily at the end by the Lee tunnel that there are kingfishers, otters and all kinds of other creatures there.
When the tunnel is finished, it will be the biggest single means of cleaning up the Thames that has ever been put in place.
It is this Government, through a special tool of private-public funding, who are enabling that.
