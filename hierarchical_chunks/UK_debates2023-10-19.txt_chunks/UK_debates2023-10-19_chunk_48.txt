At its conference this weekend, an SNP MP said he was “sick and tired” of Scottish Conservatives speaking in Parliament about the A9.
The Leader of the House will know that that is a crucial road between Perth and Inverness and up to Wick which the SNP promised would be fully dualled.
That is not happening.
Can we have a debate in this House to discuss that crucial infrastructure project?
Perhaps  the hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)  will attend and stand up for his constituents, rather than sit down and support the SNP Government’s failure to dual that road and the A96 through my constituency.
