I thank the Attorney General for her response and understanding of our requests.
Unfortunately, one thing that is not mentioned much about Ukraine is that when east Donbas was invaded and Crimea was taken over, many Baptist pastors went missing.
They were abducted, kidnapped and killed, and nobody has been held accountable.
Will the Attorney General intervene in that situation and help to give accountability to those families who have lost loved ones?
