I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this important matter.
He will know that I will not be able to comment on particular schemes, but I will make sure that the Secretary of State for Transport has heard about that scheme.
It is important that local voices are listened to when such matters are put in place.
I question the relationship between the works order that the Secretary of State has signed and the fee, but I will certainly look into this matter for the hon.
Gentleman.
If he would like to give me some further information, I will be happy to write on his behalf.
