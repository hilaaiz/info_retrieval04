I thank the right hon.
Lady for raising this matter and for all her work through the all-party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminated blood, which she has chaired for many years.
It is not lost on anyone that those individuals have waited far too long for redress in this appalling situation.
I know that the Paymaster General feels that way, too, and I will ensure that he has heard her request for him to update the House.
