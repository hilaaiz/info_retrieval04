I thank the hon.
Gentleman for a helpful advert for future potential business for his Committee.
We have had conversations about this matter before, and I am keen to ensure that the Committee is re-established quickly so that it can get on with its important work.
He raises an important point, with which I agree, that it is important that things have a proper masterplan, so I will write to make sure that the Secretaries of State for Transport and for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities have heard what he has said today.
The hon.
Gentleman will know that in cases where people are unable to return because they cannot afford to get out of a situation, there are schemes in place, run by the Foreign Office, under which people may be loaned finance.
Many insurance products will not cover terrorist events, so I will make sure that the relevant Department has heard his concerns on that front.
