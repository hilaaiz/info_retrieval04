Could we please have a statement from the Paymaster General in the light of Sir Brian Langstaff moving his final report on the infected blood inquiry to next March, due to the number of individuals and organisations that will be criticised in it, and in the light of the fact that the Government have rightly given £600,000 in compensation to the victims of the Horizon scandal without waiting for the final report?
It would be very timely to have a report because we know that the Government were working to the November deadline.
We keep being told that work is “at pace”, so it should be ready for next month in any event.
