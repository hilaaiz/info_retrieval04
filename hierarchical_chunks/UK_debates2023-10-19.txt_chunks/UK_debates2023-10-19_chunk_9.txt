My hon.
Friend has great credibility in this field, given his professional experience as a vet.
I understand that many owners of XL Bully dogs are passionate about their animals—their pets.
That is why we are working at pace, but taking our time to get right the definitions and the transition period that we anticipate.
It is important that all dog owners work to make sure that their dogs behave and have appropriate training.
That is why we established a taskforce that includes dog welfare charities.
We expect it to respond to us by the end of the year, and we will potentially take forward some of its recommendations.
As someone who has had a pet dog all my life and still does, I am conscious that some of those who own American XL Bully dogs think that their dogs are integral and safe, but many in the general public see them as a danger and have fear.
Is the Secretary of State’s intention, as this process goes forward in Westminster, to engage with the Northern Ireland Assembly and the police, in particular, to ensure that the law and the recommendations that come out of this place can be shared with them?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to recognise owners’ concerns where they believe that they have very good dogs.
That is to some extent accommodated already in the legislation that has evolved since 1991.
On working  with other nations, the law—the primary legislation—will apply in both England and Wales by default, but we are working with the Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Administration on potential moves to make this a UK-wide approach.
