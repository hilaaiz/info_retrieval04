I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point and for affording us the opportunity to thank his constituent, who appears to be providing a much-needed community service that his local authority is not.
We want people who want to step up, take responsibility and help their communities to be able to do so.
He is right to call out ridiculous behaviour that prevents that from happening.
I am sure there are other examples and, if he were to have a debate, we could expose some of them.
