I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
I happened to see what I would describe as a spittle-flecked monologue, criticising members of the general public in Scotland for daring to voice their disappointment at the quality of the A9 and other road infrastructure.
My advice to  the hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)  is that if he does not want the public to continually complain about things, he might dual those roads, as that project has been long overdue.
The public should have decent roads for the taxes they pay.
