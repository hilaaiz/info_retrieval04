Prosecution rates for violence against women and girls remain low, and that simply is not good enough.
Next month, we will mark White Ribbon Day, when men show their commitment to ending violence against women and girls.
What discussions has the Attorney General had with colleagues across Government about White Ribbon Day, and what more can be done to increase prosecution rates and eradicate violence against women and girls once and for all?
A great deal of work is going on across Government to tackle violence against women and girls, and I am pleased to tell the hon.
Lady that a great deal of really good work is happening in her area in Wales.
When I visited the Cardiff office earlier this summer we had some very productive discussions about the implementation of the new CPS charging model.
I encourage her to meet Jenny Hopkins, who is the chief Crown prosecutor for her specific area, to hear more about how that hard work has brought some really positive results.
