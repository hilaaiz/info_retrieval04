I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work she is doing to support her constituent, and to ensure that those affected and infected by that appalling scandal get justice swiftly.
If she secured a debate on this issue, it would be most welcome and well attended by many across the House.
I have said this before, but we should recognise that even though we are talking about a small number of individuals as a percentage of the population, this issue is relevant to everyone in this country.
What happened to those individuals could have happened to anyone in this country, and how we respond to that is important.
That is why I am pleased that this Government have set up the inquiry, why I set up a compensation study to run concurrently with the inquiry, and why we must ensure that we press forward with getting those people some recompense for all they have suffered.
