Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Constitution Week.
I also rise to recognize the work and dedication that the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Children of the American Revolution pour into preserving and promoting the history of our Nation.
It is a privilege to commemorate the 236th anniversary of the drafting and adoption of the Constitution of the United States of America.
Constitution Week serves as a reminder of the enduring importance of our Constitution and the freedoms it guarantees.
The Daughters of the American Revolution and the Children of the American Revolution play an invaluable role in educating future generations about the principles enshrined by our founding fathers.
Through educational initiatives, historical preservation efforts, and community outreach, the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Children of the American Revolution actively engage in preserving our nation's story.
Their programs--from providing scholarships to holding essay contests to facilitating history projects--encourage young Americans to take pride in their country and serve as a reminder to Americans of their civic duty to protect and defend the Constitution.
I thank the Daughters of the American Revolution Fredericksburg Chapter and the Surgeon Lawrence Brooks Society of the Children of the American Revolution for their dedication and service to our communities on behalf of this noble cause.
