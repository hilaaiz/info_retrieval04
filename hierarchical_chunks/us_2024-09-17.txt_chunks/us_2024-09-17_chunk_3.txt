Mr. GOMEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the Ascot Hills Challenge 5K Run/Walk for their 10 years of organizing a 3.1-mile trail course in Northeast Los Angeles.
Founded by Troy Carbajal, Marleen Fonseca, and David Sifuentes, residents of El Sereno in California's 34th Congressional District, the Ascot Hills Challenge 5K Run/Walk has donated event proceeds to support the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) fire academy magnet school program as well as the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) student police cadet program at Woodrow Wilson High School since 2014.
Both the LAFD fire academy magnet school program and the LAPD student police cadet program offer a rigorous and disciplined curriculum developed for young men and women expressing an interest in a public service career.
Additionally, a portion of the proceeds also goes to assist with the efforts to protect, beautify, and maintain Ascot Hills Park for its continual community use.
This annual event not only connects residents with valuable resources and organizations in the community, but also serves to encourage youth to exercise and participate in public service.
With limited green space in Northeast Los Angeles, we are grateful to have leaders like Troy, Marleen, and David who ensure that Angelenos get to experience the green spaces in Los Angeles through events like the Ascot Hills Challenge 5K Run/Walk.
