Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month and in honoring the leaders and members of the Hispanic community who have worked to improve the quality of life for all Americans for generations to come.
Our Nation's success is reliant upon the rich heritage and cultural diversity of its people.
