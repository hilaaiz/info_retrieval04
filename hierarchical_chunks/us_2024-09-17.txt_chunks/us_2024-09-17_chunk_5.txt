Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Miles Krajewski on his remarkable 2024 Paralympic performance.
Miles and his teammate, Jayci Simon, made Paralympic history for the United States by becoming the first Americans to medal in Paralympic Badminton.
Miles and Jayci earned the silver medal for Mixed Doubles in Paris.
Hailing from Yankton, South Dakota, Miles represented our state with dedication and skill, serving as an inspiration to many.
Miles graduated from Yankton High School earlier this year and will attend the University of South Dakota this fall as a business student.
As an alumnus, I'm confident the University of South Dakota will be a great place for Miles to continue excelling as a student and athlete.
At 19 years old, Miles has achieved significant success.
Prior to competing at the 2024 Paralympics, he represented Team USA in Santiago in 2023.
There, Miles won two gold medals in SH6 Badminton events where he secured first place in Singles by defeating the defending champion, and with Jayci Simon they won gold in Mixed Doubles after prevailing in four matches.
Miles later earned bronze in Men's Doubles and Mixed Doubles in an impressive run at the 2024 Badminton World Federation Para-Badminton World Championships.
I am proud to recognize and congratulate Miles for his hard work, dedication to the sport, and performance throughout his career.
I wish him continued success in his future endeavors.
I thank Miles for representing South Dakota well.
