Mr. MRVAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise to celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month and its 2024 theme, Pioneers of Change Shaping the Future Together.
From September 15, 2024, through October 15, 2024, in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, the people of the United States will reflect on the outstanding contributions Hispanic Americans have made for the future success of our great Nation.
Hispanic Heritage Month begins each year on September 15 and recognizes the anniversaries of the independence of five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
Mexico and Chile observe their independence days on September 16 and September 18, respectively.
This month, we take the time to commend the many inspiring Hispanic leaders that work to create programs and opportunities that are crucial for the progress of the Hispanic community in Northwest Indiana and beyond.
I am proud and honored to highlight recent efforts made in the region to strengthen educational opportunities for the Hispanic community.
In 2020, Indiana University Northwest in Gary, Indiana, was designated as a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the United States Department of Education.
Purdue University Northwest in Hammond, Indiana, received the same designation in 2024.
The Hispanic-Serving Institution designation provides universities with resources for the implementation of programs, facilities, and services to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic Americans.
I believe that this remarkable program not only empowers the Hispanic community throughout Northwest Indiana but is truly vital for the prosperity of our country.
