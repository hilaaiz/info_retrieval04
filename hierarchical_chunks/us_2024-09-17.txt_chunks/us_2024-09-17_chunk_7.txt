Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great enthusiasm that I rise to recognize Cooper City Commissioner L. Jeffrey Green.
Jeffrey Green began his career with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in January 1988 and recently celebrated his 36th year with the Bureau.
Mr. Green currently serves as the Community Relations Coordinator for the Miami Division and is responsible for expanding the FBI's presence in local communities through civic and community engagement.
In addition to his FBI career, 
Mr. Green is also an elected Commissioner for Cooper City.
In this capacity, Commissioner Green is one of five elected officials responsible for governing local municipal affairs.
This includes providing oversight of the City's $60+ milliondollar budget, its public safety operations, and all aspects of running a local government.
Commissioner Green will be ending his term serving the City this November.
As a devoted public servant for more than 14 years, Commissioner Green helped transform Cooper City into ``Someplace Special'' to work, live, and raise a family.
Commissioner Green leads with his heart and has been a calming voice on the City Commission throughout his tenure.
On behalf of the people of Florida's 25th District, we are grateful for his leadership and wish him well.
We appreciate his invaluable work for the residents of Cooper City.
