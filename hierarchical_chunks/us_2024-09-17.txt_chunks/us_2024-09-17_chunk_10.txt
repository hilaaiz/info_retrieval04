Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and accomplishments of Larry Lavelle Christian--a hero in our Tarrant County community and beyond.
Larry Lavelle Christian grew up in Jones, Louisiana.
As an adult, Mr. Christian ultimately moved to North Texas.
As a professional truck driver, he drove through the entire county.
``Country boy,'' as he was known in his childhood, was a steadfast figure of reliability in the trucking community, always trying to be helpful and uplift his fellow truckers.
Following the death of his wife, 
Mr. Christian leaned on his faith and felt called to retire.
Upon his retirement and in one of the darkest moments of his life, Larry wanted to help others.
Each week,
