Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize September 2024 as Sepsis Awareness Month.
We honor individuals who have been affected by sepsis and pledge unwavering support and recognition of the diagnosis to patients and families.
Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency triggered by the body's extreme response to an infection.
It occurs when an existing infection spurs a chain reaction throughout the body and rapidly leads to tissue damage, organ failure, and death without treatment.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 1.7 million American adults are diagnosed with sepsis and 350,000 adults die or are discharged to hospice as a result of it every year.
Accordingly, 1 in 3 people who die in a hospital had sepsis during that hospitalization and for every hour treatment is delayed, the risk of death increases by 4 percent to 9 percent.
This life-threatening medical emergency is the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals.
To raise awareness around this devastating diagnosis, we must educate people, share survivor stories, and support innovation and research.
According to the Sepsis Alliance, an estimated 37 percent of U.S. adults have never heard of sepsis, reinforcing the need to arm communities with the resources to recognize and respond to it.
Our commitment to accelerating education of the diagnosis must remain a priority to save lives and limbs from sepsis.
