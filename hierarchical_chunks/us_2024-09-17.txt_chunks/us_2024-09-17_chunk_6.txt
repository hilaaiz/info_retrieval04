Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Taryn Kloth on her remarkable 2024 Olympic performance, finishing ninth overall in the Women's Beach Volleyball Olympic competition.
Taryn, a Sioux Falls native, proudly represented Team USA with her teammate Kristen Nuss.
It was exciting to see a South Dakotan represent Team USA in the Paris Olympics.
Our state proudly cheered on Taryn throughout the matches.
Taryn attended O'Gorman Catholic High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota where she began her impressive volleyball career.
After helping start the first indoor volleyball team in South Dakota, Taryn earned the Gatorade South Dakota Player of the Year award in 2014, a national championship for her club team, a back-to-back state championship, and landed a top-20 high school ranking in the country.
After high school, she went to Creighton University as their highest ranked recruit in school history.
Taryn led the team to four consecutive Big East titles and four NCAA tournament appearances, including a school-best Elite 8 appearance in 2016.
Taryn graduated early from Creighton and then attended Louisiana State University where she helped them to a No. 1 ranking in the 2020 season.
Taryn and Kristen completed the 2021 season going a historic 36-0, earning multiple accolades, including the prestigious American Volleyball Coaches Association Pair of the Year award.
The two created a partnership ``TKN'' and became the No. 1 ranked Association of Volleyball Professionals Beach Volleyball Team and No. 2 ranked team worldwide.
I am proud to recognize and congratulate Taryn and Kristen for their hard work, dedication to the sport, and performance throughout their careers.
I wish them continued success in their future endeavors.
I thank Taryn for representing South Dakota well.
