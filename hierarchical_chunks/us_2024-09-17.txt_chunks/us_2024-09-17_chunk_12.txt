Mr. Christian's dedication to the fight against food insecurity illustrates his character and commitment to our community.
Mr. Christian's leadership and dedication has made a true difference in the state.
He has been recognized by the Midwest Food Bank Texas, a nonprofit focused on combating hunger.
In collaboration, they launched a major effort to obtain and distribute food to those in need.
Their combined work led to $673,000 worth of food being provided to families, children, and seniors throughout Texas.
