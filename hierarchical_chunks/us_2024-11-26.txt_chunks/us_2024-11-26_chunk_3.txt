Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished career of Patrick Smith, a dedicated flight paramedic and Registered Nurse who has dedicated 40 years to the field of emergency medical services (EMS).
Pat's contributions have left a profound impact on both the individuals he has served and the EMS profession here in northeast Indiana.
Throughout his career, Patrick was a trailblazer in the early education of appropriate airway management technique.
Drawing on his years of experience as a Respiratory Therapist, he emphasized the importance of proper ventilatory and oxygenation steps long before they became widely recognized and implemented as they are today.
Pat dedicated 32 years to the Bippus Fire Department.
During this time, he served as a Primary Instructor, teaching First Responder and EMT classes across Huntington County.
He also worked as a street paramedic and shift supervisor with Huntington County EMS, where his leadership and skill led to his appointment as Director.
Pat's career then took him to Lutheran, where he excelled as a Critical Care Paramedic before transitioning into the Flight Program a few years later.
After becoming a Registered Nurse (RN), he has continued to maintain his Paramedic, RN, and Respiratory Therapist licenses.
Among Pat's many accolades, he holds the record of completing over 1,270 flights with Lutheran Air.
Beyond these professional achievements, Pat has been a mentor to consecutive generations of healthcare workers.
His deep knowledge, wealth of experience, and positive demeanor have aided countless others through the challenges and demands associated with emergency care.
Pat's peers, students, and the thousands of patients he has served hold him in the highest esteem, and his absence will be felt.
Healthcare professionals like Patrick are vital to our community.
I want to express my gratitude for his decades of service to our region and wish him continued success in this next great chapter of life.
