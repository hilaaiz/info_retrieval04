Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Robert William ``Bill'' Tracy, a fourth-generation farmer from Buttonwillow, California.
Bill passed away on November 7, 2024, at the age of 82.
His loss is felt deeply not only by his family and friends but also by the agricultural community he served.
Born on October 16, 1942, Bill grew up on his family's ranch, attending the two-room Wildwood Grammar School and later Wasco High School, where he graduated in 1960.
He pursued higher education at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo before dedicating his life to farming and public service.
In the 1960s, Bill was activated in the U.S. Army Reserves, serving his country and fostering a lifelong interest in American military history.
His passion extended to the study of the U.S. Civil War and both World Wars, and he built an impressive collection of military artifacts.
Bill's love of history complemented his deep respect for service and dedication, qualities he carried throughout his life.
Bill returned to the family ranch, where his tireless work ethic and advocacy for the agricultuial community soon earned him great respect.
In recognition of this expertise and leadership in agriculture, he was appointed Undersecretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture in 1987.
In this role, he championed the needs of California farmers, earning the admiration of colleagues who remember him as a kind and loyal leader who put passion into everything he did.
Beyond his professional achievements, Bill was a devoted husband to Susie, a loving father to their four children--Mark, Todd, Rob, and Stephanie--and a caring grandfather to eight grandchildren.
His family will fondly remember his playful, friendly nature, and his unyielding dedication to his work.
Bill and Susie shared a love of travel, visiting all seven continents and creating special traditions, such as taking each grandchild on an ocean cruise for their 10th birthday.
At home, Bill was a fixture in Buttonwillow, known for his cowboy hat and boots, his daily breakfasts at Willow Ranch, and his quiet pride in watching Susie line dance during their frequent dinners out.
Bill's passing leaves a void in the Buttonwillow community.
Tributes from friends and colleagues reflect his commitment to agriculture, his enduring friendships, and the warm and inspiring impression he left on those who knew him.
Mr Speaker, today, we celebrate the life of Robert William ``Bill'' Tracy, a man whose legacy will continue to inspire generations of Californians.
Amanda and I offer our deepest sympathies to the Tracy family, who proudly carry on Bill's legacy.
I know the Central Valley will continue to honor his lasting contributions to our community.
