Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Robert William ``Bill'' Tracy.
Born on October 16, 1942, to Tilton and Kathryn Tracy.
Bill lived a full and vibrant life, deeply rooted in the land and community that shaped him.
Raised on the family ranch, Bill graduated from Wasco High School in 1960 and pursued higher education at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where his passion for agriculture began to take shape.
In 1968, he was activated into the United States Army Reserve, later returning to the family ranch, where he continued his work as a fourth-generation farmer.
Tracy Ranch, a multi-generational farming and cattle operation established in 1862, was a central part of Bill's life, and he dedicated much of his career to strengthening the agricultural community.
Bill was an active and respected member of the farming industry, serving on numerous boards and participating in leadership programs such as the California Ag Leadership Program and the National Cotton Council ``Cotton Leadership Program'' sponsored by DuPont.
These experiences helped shape his expertise in agriculture policy.
In 1987, Bill was appointed Undersecretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture under Governor George Deukmejian.
Known for his trademark cowboy boots and hat, Bill worked tirelessly as an advocate for California's farming community.
His tenure in state government gave him a unique perspective on policy, and he became a trusted voice in agricultural circles.
Outside of his career, Bill was a passionate historian with a special interest in the Civil War and both World Wars.
He formed lifelong friendships with fellow history enthusiasts Jack Bell and John Gibson, who became a cherished part of his journey.
Bill's personal life was equally fulfilling.
He and his wife, Susie, shared 50 years of marriage.
Together, they explored all seven continents, often accompanied by friends Dale and Carol, and most recently by John and Donna.
As a grandfather, Bill found immense joy in his grandchildren's lives.
He could always be found at their sports games, dance recitals, and piano performances, providing support and encouragement at every turn.
His love for his grandchildren was evident, and he shared countless memories with them.
Bill is survived by his wife, Susie; children, Mark Tracy (Allison), Todd Tracy (Annette), Rob Tracy (Kathy), and Stephanie O'Callaghan (Kevin); and eight grandchildren: Haylee, Kathryn, Grace, Trent, Maggie, Izzy, Clarisse, and Lilly.
He is also survived by his brothers, John Tracy (Donna) and David Tracy (Jerry), as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and extended family.
Mr Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of Robert William ``Bill'' Tracy.
Bill lived with purpose and passion, leaving a legacy that will continue to inspire his family, community, and the agricultural world for generations to come.
