Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Jennifer Lynn Norton, a proud U.S. Air Force veteran and longtime champion for survivors of human trafficking.
For over 34 years, Jennifer Lynn Norton has dedicated her life to serving others through military and civilian service.
As a member of the U.S. Air Force for the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing, she was an invaluable asset during Operation Desert Storm, leading to innovation and positive change whilst providing logistics support to her team.
Joining her active-duty experiences with her passion in counseling, Jennifer rose to become the first female veteran to serve as an executive assistant for The American Legion National Headquarters.
With community engagement at the heart of her vision of service, she stays active in her community through work with the Indy Hope Center and the Veterans Day Council.
The commitment she has continuously demonstrated to her fellow veterans, Hoosiers, and Americans has left in its wake a legacy of hard work and compassion that continuously inspires her community.
Her efforts across the years have rendered her various accolades, such as the Airman Quarter Honors and the Outstanding Leadership Award.
It is an honor to be able to recognize Jennifer for her exemplary work once more today with the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero Award.
Having started with its namesake, Sheila Corcoran, this award was fashioned to uplift exemplary Hoosier Veteran women whose service to their community and Nation is unparalleled, women who are inspirational and guided by a deep love for their fellow Americans.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jennifer Lynn Norton's legacy, accomplishments, and continued endeavors with the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero Award for the month of November 2024.
