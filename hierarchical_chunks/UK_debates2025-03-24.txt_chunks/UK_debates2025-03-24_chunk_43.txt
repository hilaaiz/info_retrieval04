I thank the Secretary of State for her statement and for advance sight of it.
I join her in extending my gratitude to the firefighters  who responded so swiftly to the incident.
I extend my sympathies to everybody affected by the disruption and place on record my thanks to all those at Heathrow who worked diligently to ensure that the airport came back on line over the weekend.
