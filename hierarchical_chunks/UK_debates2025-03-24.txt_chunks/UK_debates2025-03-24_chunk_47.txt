There has been talk this weekend about the single point of failure.
In this case, that is about not just a particular electricity substation but what happens when our busiest airport closes.
All our airports—critical national infrastructure—have an impact when they are at risk.
I am told that the next airports national policy statement, like the last one, will cover only Heathrow.
Is it not time that we had a national airports strategy to include what happens when any one of our airports is taken out of action?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend, the Chair of the Transport Committee, for her remarks.
The airports national policy statement is a site-specific document, but I will reflect on her suggestion of a wider airports strategy; I am sure that we will discuss it further when I am in front of her Committee in a couple of weeks’ time.
