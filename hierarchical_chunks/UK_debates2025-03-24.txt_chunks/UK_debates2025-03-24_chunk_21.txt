Friend to my answer to the last question.
The violence against women and girls taskforce is taking best practice from the rest of Government and ensuring that it is replicated in defence, but it is actually going one step further and putting a structure in place.
As I always say, I was very young when I joined the Marines, and I was caught up in this hierarchical situation.
Where do you go to make a complaint?
You don’t actually have anywhere to go to make a complaint.
The taskforce will provide a safe space, so that if people want to pop out of the chain of command to highlight a concern, it can be elevated quickly and dealt with rapidly.
