The Secretary of State mentioned consumer rights.
Not only were Heathrow customers delayed and disrupted, but they were ripped off, with huge hikes for alternative flights, car hire and hotels.
Is it not time that the Government brought forward robust anti-price-gouging legislation?
In fairness to the Secretary of State and Labour Front Benchers, I also asked the previous Government, who did absolutely zero on this issue as well.
[Laughter.]
It is true, and I think we saw the result of that in many other ways.
On behalf of the British consumer and international consumers, many of whom have been ripped off through no fault of their own as a result of this incident, is it not time that for new legislation?
Should we not also carry out a wider review of the monopoly held by the operators of hotels at Heathrow and the lack of competition among airlines coming into Heathrow?
I can categorically say that it would not be right for anyone or any business to capitalise on this disruption.
Whether airlines or hotels, I would expect organisations to be doing everything they can to support travellers who have been disrupted by this incident.
