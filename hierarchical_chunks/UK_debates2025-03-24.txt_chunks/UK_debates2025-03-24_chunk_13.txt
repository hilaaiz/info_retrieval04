The Minister will be well aware that 99% of internet traffic is carried on undersea cables.
Clearly the Russians and other enemies would seek to disrupt that, so will the Minister look at utilising autonomous minesweepers that could be deployed to protect our undersea cables?
In particular, will he commit to looking at introducing them in the Black sea, if there is a truce between Russia and Ukraine, so that those cables are protected as well?
That is part of the NATO infrastructure.
The hon.
Gentleman is right that subsea fibre-optic cables carry about 99% of our data—many people believe it is satellites, but it is cables.
As a country we are investing in new technologies and I expect that, as we get further towards the time when the defence review is published, he will see the ambition we have as a Government to invest more in autonomous systems, not only to support undersea cable protection, but to deal with the threat of Russian submarines and other capability, and other threats to our nations.
We will ensure that we invest in our defence capabilities and in supporting those people who serve as well.
