I welcome the creation of the violence against women and girls taskforce, which is an important step towards enabling complaints to be heard and addressed outside the chain  of command, and I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Glastonbury and Somerton (Sarah Dyke)  for raising this important issue.
Like the taskforce, the Government have committed to a new veterans strategy focusing specifically on the experience of women who have left the service.
Will the Minister outline the timescale for the development and implementation of that strategy, given how vital it is that women come and serve in the armed forces, and that they feel safe and secure in doing so?
