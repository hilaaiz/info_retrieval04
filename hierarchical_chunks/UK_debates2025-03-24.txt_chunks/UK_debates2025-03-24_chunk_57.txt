The Secretary of State mentioned that many families were evacuated from their properties.
Safety is clearly of paramount importance, but only a few days ago NatPower UK informed me that it wanted to build an enormous electrical substation in my constituency.
Once NESO has reported on this matter, will the Secretary of State please help to organise a meeting with the relevant Energy Minister so that we can discuss its findings and link them with any proposal for a new substation in my constituency?
A tenuous link.
The relevant Energy Minister—my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks) , who is sitting next to me—was nodding, which suggests to me that he would be happy to have such a meeting.
