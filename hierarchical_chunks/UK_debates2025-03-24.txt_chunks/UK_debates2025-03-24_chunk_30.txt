I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The 77th Brigade does a superb job of tackling disinformation, especially by malign actors.
We need to expand our provision and range of capabilities, which is precisely why we have created a new direct entry cyber-pathway to recruit people directly into our cyber-forces to support our national resilience in both defensive and offensive operations.
The hon.
Gentleman will understand that I cannot talk about ongoing operations, but I can say that we are investing more in this area to keep ourselves and our allies safe.
