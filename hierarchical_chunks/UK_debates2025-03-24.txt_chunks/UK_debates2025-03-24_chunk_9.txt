I thank all the people, most of whom are probably volunteers, who are supporting veterans in the hon.
Member’s constituency.
Two days ago I visited another tri-service veterans hub that is delivering, I think, exactly the same types of services.
We often find that while there is a great deal support out there, it is difficult for veterans to navigate the process of finding the right place, and we are working on plans to help them with that.
