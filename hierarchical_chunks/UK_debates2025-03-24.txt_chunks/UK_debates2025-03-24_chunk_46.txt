I thank the Transport Secretary for her statement.
I also thank the fire services and the airport and airline staff who did so much over the weekend to address and support the situation and ensure that it did not get any worse.
We will have a Committee session next week with the chief exec of Heathrow airport and others.
We also look forward to asking the Secretary of State more questions when she comes to us after the Easter recess, by which time I hope that she and I will be better genned up on electrical engineering.
