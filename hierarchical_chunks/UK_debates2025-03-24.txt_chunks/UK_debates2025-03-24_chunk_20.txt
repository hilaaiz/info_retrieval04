I thank the Minister, and I welcome the measures announced last week.
My constituents in Monmouthshire and people across Wales would be interested to hear more from the Minister about the new violence against women and girls taskforce, and the regional and national champions.
How will they ensure that everyone who serves in the armed forces can do so in safety?
