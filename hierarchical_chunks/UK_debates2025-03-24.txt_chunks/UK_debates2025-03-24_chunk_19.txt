There are two principal elements.
The tri-service complaints system sits outside the chain of command, and when certain issues hit a threshold, they will be taken away from the single services, so the system will be completely independent.
The second is the violence against women and girls taskforce that we have created, which will work directly to me.
It will be a small team at my level, but it will have tentacles right down into the single services.
It will provide a safe space for women to go to if they want to raise an issue or a complaint, which can then be transferred into the complaints system or, indeed, in parallel all the way up to me so that I can take action directly.
