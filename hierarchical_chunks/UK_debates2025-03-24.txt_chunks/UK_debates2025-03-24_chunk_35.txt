I thank the Minister for his answer.
Clearly we have a particularly good relationship with the countries that make up the joint expeditionary force.
The Minister and I have completed the armed forces parliamentary scheme and were both plunged into the snowdrifts in Norway at Bardufoss.
Some of the kit that the Norwegians had was particularly impressive, as I am sure the Minister would agree.
Could I press him on what work we can do with the countries in the joint expeditionary force on procurement, design and perhaps development of equipment?
