I thank the Minister for her response.
Last week, the Defence Committee met the Chief of the General Staff, who highlighted the challenges of supporting our troops in Estonia.
I highlighted the Rail Baltica project, which received significant funding from the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility and NATO, and which  links my constituency, via High Speed 1, right through to the Baltics using British steel.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss supporting the expansion of HS1 capacity, as it is the type of opportunity that would support growth within our defence industrial capacity, improve our deterrence and increase our commitment to our European allies, while bringing high quality jobs to east London?
