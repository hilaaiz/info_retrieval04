We support the Government’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with our European partners, but they need to go further and faster to ensure that the UK does not get left behind.
Has the Defence Secretary spoken with his counterparts in the EU about the value of the new stand-alone UK-EU defence pact, which will enable the UK to better influence decisions around new finance programmes, such as a rearmament bank to support defence investment across Europe?
Yes.
Last week I met with High Representative Kallas and spoke with Commissioner Kubilius, and that was exactly the subject of our conversations.
What discussions he has had with his European counterparts on the joint expeditionary force.
The UK is fully committed to the joint expeditionary force.
I discussed the JEF on my visits to Denmark, Latvia, Finland, Lithuania and the Netherlands last month.
I meet regularly with the JEF partners’ defence attachés, including last week.
