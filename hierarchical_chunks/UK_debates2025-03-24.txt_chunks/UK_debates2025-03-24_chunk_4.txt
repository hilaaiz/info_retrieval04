I thank my right hon.
Friend for that response.
The men and women of our armed forces perform the ultimate public service.
They and their families make considerable sacrifices to keep all of us in the UK safe and secure.
Does he agree that the least we owe our servicemen and women is decent housing that they can proudly call home?
