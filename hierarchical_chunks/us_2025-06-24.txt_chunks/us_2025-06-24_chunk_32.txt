Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Memphis' Interstate Bar-B-Que co-founder Barbara Neely who passed on June 16 at the age of 86.
Mrs. Neely started the barbecue restaurant empire in 1979 with her husband, Jim, and was its public face, greeting customers from the front counter while her husband worked the pits in the kitchen.
For 45 years, she would arrive at the restaurant at 5 a.m. every morning.
The restaurant they founded became a Memphis institution and a tourist attraction, especially after Jim's nephew, Patrick, starred in the Food Network reality cooking show ``Down Home with the Neelys,'' which ran from 2008 to 2014.
Born Barbara Jean Frison, Barbara went to Manassas High School then relocated to New Orleans, where she met Jim, an Air Force veteran who left Memphis after high school.
The first Interstate was founded the year they were married on Christmas Day, 1979, in Las Vegas.
There are now Neely's restaurants at the original South Third Street location, on Winchester Road in Memphis, on Stateline Road in Southaven, Mississippi and a Memphis-style barbecue restaurant, Jay Bee's, in Gardena, California.
Mrs. Neely put Memphis moist pit barbecue and chopped pork sandwiches on the map.
I extend my condolences to her husband, Jim, her extended family, and her many devoted customers.
Hers was a life well-lived.
