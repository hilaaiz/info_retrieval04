Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable dedication and 25 years of pastoral service of Pastor Alton Bridges of Park Manor M.B. Church, located at 8328 S. Green St., Chicago, Illinois.
Born in Chicago on July 23, 1964, Pastor Bridges is a true native of our great city.
He received his foundational education at Chicago Vocational School before earning a Bachelor of Arts in Electrical Engineering from DeVry Institute.
Pastor Bridges has been an integral part of the church community his entire life, ultimately answering a call to ministry.
Before his pastoral journey, he held a supervisory position at a company then known as Eleck Tech.
For a quarter of a century, Pastor Bridges has faithfully served his congregation and the wider community.
His commitment extends far beyond the walls of his church.
Annually, he provides crucial food services to the greater Auburn-Gresham, South Shore, and Ashburn Wright communities.
He actively partners with local grammar schools, assisting families in need by garnering donations to provide them with clothing, funding, and food.
In 2020, Pastor Bridges initiated a ``Garden of Church,'' offering fresh vegetation to anyone in need--a testament to his innovative approach to community support.
He actively collaborates with neighborhood stakeholders and is a vital part of the ``1st Ladies of Initiatives.''
His generosity also reaches beyond Chicago, as he consistently donates to national relief efforts, exemplified by his fundraising for families impacted by the California fires.
Furthermore, he makes annual donations to support college-bound students, investing in the next generation.
Pastor Bridges is a devoted family man, supported by his wife, Phyllis Bridges, and their children, Symone, Markeeta, and Phillip.
Pastor Alton Bridges's unwavering commitment to his faith, his congregation, and the well-being of the Chicago community is truly commendable.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his 25 years of profound pastoral service and his enduring impact on the lives of countless individuals.
