Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman, 
Ms. Louella Avent, as she celebrates her 85th birthday.
Though her official birthday was May 13, 1940, we joyously mark this milestone with a celebration on Saturday, June 7, at the Rose Room.
Born in Oxford, Mississippi, 
Ms. Avent was raised by dedicated farmers.
For the past 65 years, Chicago has been her cherished second home.
A lifelong learner, she graduated high school and continued her education at Loop College, now Harold Washington College.
Her commitment to education continues even now as she embraces ``senior life.''
