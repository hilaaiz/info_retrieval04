Ms. Avent has been a lifelong supporter of Operation PUSH, officially becoming a member in March 2025.
Her commitment to civil rights and community empowerment is unwavering.
Among her major milestones, she fondly recalls meeting the late Mayor Richard Daley, and the esteemed Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. and 
Mrs. Jacqueline Jackson.
Her journey through 85 years has been marked by both illnesses and losses, yet through it all, ``the joy of the Lord has been her strength.''
She is incredibly proud of her dutiful son, Caesar, an MBA graduate, who she credits as a true blessing in her life.
