Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to speak on the tragic and untimely passing of Seaman Angelina Petra Resendiz.
I wish to honor her for her invaluable service to our great country.
Seaman Resendiz displayed the highest levels of duty and courage in the line of duty.
Her service is representative of the many brave men and women who volunteer to serve their country.
This exemplary young woman enlisted in August 2023 as a culinary specialist in the United States Navy.
During this time, she performed her duties admirably and to the best of her abilities.
Unfortunately, Seaman Resendiz was unable to finish her service to our country due to her tragic passing.
Nobody should ever be targeted or harmed by their peers or superiors.
We owe an enormous debt to our brave service members, and the least we, as Members of Congress, can do is ensure that they are protected regardless of gender, ethnicity, or where they are stationed.
