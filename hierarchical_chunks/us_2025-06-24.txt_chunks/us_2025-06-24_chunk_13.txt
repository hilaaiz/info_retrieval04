best meet the needs of children.
His work has impacted the lives of countless souls and he has been an invaluable resource to communities across this country and throughout the globe.
His work has changed the way we as psychiatrists, as communities, as policy and decision makers, and as a society, view and address child trauma.
It is a remarkable legacy that leaves an indelible mark.
Today, as he marks the end of his career at the Yale Child Study Center, I extend my deepest thanks and heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Steven Marans for his many years of friendship and support as well as my very best wishes in whatever pursuits he takes on.
I have no doubt that he will continue to make a difference.
