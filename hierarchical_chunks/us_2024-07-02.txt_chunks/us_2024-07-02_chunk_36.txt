Mark your calendars for Tuesday, July 16 to join my next in-person town hall in Yancey County.
The town hall will take place from 6:00-7:30 p.m. at the Yancey County Courthouse, 110 Town Sq., Burnsville, NC.
I'm looking forward to sharing an update about the latest legislative opportunities and challenges in Congress and answering questions about the issues that matter to you.
With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member.
