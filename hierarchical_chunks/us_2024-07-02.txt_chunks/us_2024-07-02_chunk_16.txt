Mrs. NAPOLITANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the long career of public service provided to the people of the San Gabriel Valley and Southern California by Anthony (Tony) Zampiello of the San Gabriel Valley Water Association and the Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster.
Water policy and management is one of the most controversial, complicated, and costly issues in California.
In my region there are hundreds of different water supply agencies, water treatment works, water distributors, and water users.
One of the things that the varied water interests in the San Gabriel Valley agree on is the deep gratitude we have for the invaluable expertise of Tony Zampiello over the past 35 years.
Tony has been at the forefront of managing water agencies and advising policy makers on historic water rights, urban water usage, infrastructure, federal programs, and groundwater management.
As the primary groundwater manager in the San Gabriel Valley, Tony has effectively administered basin levels and usage through cycles of drought and heavy storm seasons.
The San Gabriel Basin would not have withstood the severe droughts of the past decade and come back at heightened levels the way it did if it were not for Tony's leadership.
Tony has testified in Congress and provided policy advice that has been at the forefront of the water debates and legislation signed into law.
He was the impetus for multiple provisions in Water Resources Development Acts that have led to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers improving groundwater recharge and dam operations in Southern California.
He advocated for improved stormwater capture that led to a new Clean Water Act program for stormwater in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
He has championed water recycling that has spurred Congress to provide millions of dollars in additional Bureau of Reclamation funding to reuse wastewater and release it into spreading grounds and improve our aquifers.
