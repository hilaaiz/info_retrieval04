Every year since 1996, Congress has failed to pass our annual spending bills on time, and yet once August rolls around, Congress goes home, despite work still left to be done in DC.
We cannot continue putting funding our federal government on the backburner.
The Constitution gives the power of the purse in Congress, yet we cannot seem to get our single most important job done in a timely manner.
I'm introducing the Do Our Job Act because if our work is not done, we should not go home.
The American people cannot afford Congress not funding our government on time.
The way Congress runs is broken, and this bill is one of the ways that I'm waking to fix how Washington works.
