Mr. William Lorick, a beloved member of our Amelia Island family.
Born in 1947, William grew up in Augusta, Georgia before attending Newberry College in South Carolina.
After graduating, William embarked on a long and extremely successful real estate career.
In 1973, William moved to Amelia Island, Florida where he lived for the rest of his life.
William was a pillar of the Amelia Island community, but his service to the island went far beyond that.
He was key to the growth of the Lutheran Prince of Peace Church, he was a founding member of the Barnabas Center, and he was one of the first volunteers for the South End Auxiliary Fire Fighters.
William also spent years as a mentor in the Big Brothers program.
He might even be remembered most for his 1929 Ford Model A, which was certainly the coolest car in town.
