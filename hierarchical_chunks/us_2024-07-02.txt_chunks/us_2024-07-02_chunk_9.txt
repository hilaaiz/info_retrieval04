the Federation and ultimately the U.S. Congress as established by the Constitution in 1787.
To commemorate the 250th anniversary of the First Continental Congress, in July 2024 the Carpenters' Company of Philadelphia, the nonprofit organization founded in 1724 that owns and operates Carpenters' Hall, will convene the Young People's Continental Congress (YPCC).
From July 15-19, a diverse group of high school students and their teachers from the 13 original colonies will gather in Philadelphia to explore our Nation's founding.
A second convening in July 2025 will engage students and teachers from all 56 states and jurisdictions.
YPCC is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to engage young people in history and civics as well as launch Philadelphia's celebration of the Semiquincentennial of American independence in 2026.
YPCC has been named a National Partner Program of America250 and has been endorsed by America250PA and Philadelphia250.
YPCC delegates will discuss America's founding principles and how those principles have been expressed over our history.
They will also experience Philadelphia's world-class historic attractions to enhance their understanding of the democratic process and how our country began.
The program will provide young people across the country with the opportunity to share their voices and perspectives.
YPCC will harness the power of convening for a new generation of civic leaders, who often are more connected with their peers via technology and social media than they are in physical time and space.
As generations of leaders have learned, there is nothing like being ``in the room where it happened.''
