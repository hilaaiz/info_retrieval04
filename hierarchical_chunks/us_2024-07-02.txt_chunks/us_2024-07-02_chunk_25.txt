Dear Friend: The United States is facing unprecedented threats from those who want to do us harm, so the House is prioritizing policies that strengthen our nation's security and borders.
The House recently passed H.R. 8070, the Servicemembers Quality of Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for FY25, which is focused on improving our servicemembers' lives while restoring our military's focus on warfighting.
I'm excited to share that this bill also included three of my amendments.
The fist requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to complete a survey of the 15 counties in North Carolina's 11th District as potential locations for future defense facilities.
Western North Carolina's topography is much like that of many of our adversaries, including China's, and would be advantageous for military training.
Another of my amendments requires the DOD to submit an annual report to the General Services Administration about office space occupancy data so that taxpayer dollars are not being thrown away on unused office space by the federal government.
The third amendment would revoke the security clearances of retired or active members of the armed forces or Defense Department civilian employees who support or participate in demonstrations in support of a designated foreign terrorist organization.
It should be a no-brainer that someone who supports a terrorist organization should not have access to classified security information.
This year's NDAA took an important step in getting our military away from wokeness and back to its mission of protecting and defending America, and I was glad to support it.
