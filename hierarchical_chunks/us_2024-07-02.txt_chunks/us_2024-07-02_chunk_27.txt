Protecting the long-term success of our nation and Americans require defending our border.
Since President Biden has taken office, there have been more than 9.6 million illegal immigrant encounters nationwide, with more than 7.9 million of them just at our southern border.
Over the past three years, the left's failed border policies have made every community in America a border community, and the president's latest executive order does nothing to actually address the crisis at out southern border.
Recent news of Americans murdered by illegal immigrants makes it clear that we must secure our borders to keep our citizens safe.
We cannot protect Americans if we don't secure our border.
That's why I helped pass the strongest border security bill in history, H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, which would put an end to this administration's border crisis that is putting Americans' lives at risk.
