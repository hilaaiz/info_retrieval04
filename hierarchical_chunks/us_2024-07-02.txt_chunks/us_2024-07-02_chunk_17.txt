Mr. Speaker, we are happy that Tony is moving on to a much-deserved retirement, but we will greatly miss the reservoir of knowledge that he has provided to water managers and policy makers.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Tony Zampiello on his retirement, and thanking him for his long career of public service to the people of Southern California.
