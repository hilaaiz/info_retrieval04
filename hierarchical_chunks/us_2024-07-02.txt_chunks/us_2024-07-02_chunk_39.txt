Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and service of Stanislau ``Stan'' Wojcik, a proud veteran from Michigan's 9th Congressional District, who passed away on June 9, 2024.
Stan's service and courage as a World War II Navy machinist aboard the USS Sarasota (APA-204) left a long-lasting impact on his fellow soldiers and our country.
Born on August 13, 1925, Stan Wojcik exemplified the values of duty, honor, and sacrifice from a young age.
His service in the South Pacific during World War II, and particularly in his role aboard the USS Sarasota, stands as a testament to his sense of service.
During his service, Stan participated in critical operations throughout the war.
Stan aided in disaster relief after the explosion of the USS Mt. Hood, the Battle of Luzon, the Battle of Manila, the Battle of Okinawa, and the invasion.
His contributions during these campaigns underscored his unwavering commitment to defending our Nation during one of the most defining eras of our history.
Throughout his service, Stan Wojcik was awarded numerous honors recognizing his bravery and dedication, including the Combat Action Ribbon, China Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Navy Occupation Service Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Pin, Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation, and the Philippine Liberation Ribbon.
