The Department of the Army is funding a $32 million project in Asheville for the construction of a U.S. Army Reserve center, vehicle maintenance facility and organizational storage building in the Asheville vicinity, to be completed by June 2026.
I'm pleased that the Department of the Army has agreed with the approach taken by my House-passed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) amendment, which requires the Department of Defense to complete a survey of the 15 counties in North Carolina's 11th District as potential locations for future defense facilities and report to Congress on its findings.
