Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor and celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Michigan Municipal League, an organization dedicated to making communities better through innovation, connection, and service.
Since its founding in 1899, the League has played a crucial role in enhancing municipal governance and fostering community development across Michigan.
Originally known as the League of Michigan Municipalities, the League found a permanent home in Ann Arbor in 1928 and established an additional office in Lansing in 1957.
Initially focused on promoting home rule for cities and villages, it has evolved to address a wide range of municipal concerns, from legislative advocacy to comprehensive service offerings.
Today, the League represents over 500 full-service cities, villages, and townships.
It has worked tirelessly to educate and inspire public servants to build trust and create a sense of belonging among residents and local leaders to build opportunity and address social and economic needs.
The League's motto is ``Cooperation solves any problem,'' a principle the organization has demonstrated for over a century by bringing together officials to learn from one another.
Through its advocacy efforts and commitment to cooperation and mutual support, the League has highlighted the transformative power of public service in local governments.
Throughout its history, the Michigan Municipal League has been instrumental in numerous significant initiatives.
The League played a vital role in the construction of the Mackinac Bridge in the 1950s, a landmark project that connected Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas.
Its advocacy was pivotal in the expansion of the Dial-A-Ride Transportation system in 1975, which greatly benefited seniors and individuals with disabilities.
Additionally, the League championed the Complete Streets Act in Michigan, which was signed in 2010 and promotes mobility and safety for all users, including pedestrians, public transportation users, older individuals, and children.
In 2009, the League, alongside the Detroit Regional Chamber and Transportation Riders United, formed a coalition to embrace public transit as a powerful economic development tool and resource for residents.
This initiative underscored the League's belief in collaborative efforts and the power of community-focused policies that has been a tenet of its mission since its earliest days.
This 125th anniversary is a perfect time to recognize the Michigan Municipal League for its dedication to improving local governance and fostering vibrant, equitable communities.
It is with great respect that I honor the League's 125 years of service and its ongoing contributions to Michigan's cities, villages, and townships.
May the Michigan Municipal League continue to inspire and lead for many more years to come.
