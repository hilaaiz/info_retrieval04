I thank my hon.
Friend for his continued support for this growing and important sector.
Alongside the work of the nuclear skills taskforce, we are currently in phase B of our advanced modular reactor research, development and demonstration programme.
We aim to demonstrate that technology by the 2030s to decarbonise industry and we welcome his support in that work.
