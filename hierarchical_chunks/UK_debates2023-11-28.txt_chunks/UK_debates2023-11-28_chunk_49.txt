I thank the Minister very much for his determination and leadership, which we all endorse.
Ukraine has reported territorial advances of 3 km to 8 km in the Donetsk region, which have been hard fought—the cost has been in lives and injuries—but the determination of Ukrainians to retake their land from Russia is as strong as ever.
What can the Minister do to allocate more high-grade military equipment to strike Russia hard in its backyard?
