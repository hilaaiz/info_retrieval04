I thank my hon.
Friend for that answer.
Farmers in my constituency and the neighbouring Ludlow constituency are among the most productive in the United Kingdom and, speaking as one of the Prime Minister’s trade envoys, we are very proud of their contribution to British exports.
At the moment, they are rather adversely affected by rising energy costs.
What additional assistance will the Government give to the agricultural sector to help this very important industry survive?
