The world sorely needs leadership at COP28, but the verdict of our most globally respected climate expert, Lord Stern,  earlier this month was damning.
He said that the Government’s backsliding on climate action is a “deeply damaging mistake”—damaging for the UK, the world and the future of us all.
Will the Secretary of State take this opportunity to place on record her response to Lord Stern?

Gentleman should understand that we have the most ambitious climate target of any of our international peers.
If he looks at the delivery today, he will see that we overshot on carbon budgets 1 and 2, and we are on track to overshoot on carbon budget 3.
In fact, the UN gap report showed just last week that between 2015 and 2030 the UK is expected to reduce emissions at the fastest rate of any of the G20 countries.
