The Minister will be aware that the ban on the involuntary installation of prepayment meters will be lifted soon.
That will mean families with children over two years old and pensioners under 75 who are still vulnerable will potentially face the higher cost of prepayment meters.
There is the possibility, of course, that when they run out of tokens they will be cut off.
Is that right?
First of all, we have been mindful of ensuring that there is no higher cost to prepayment meters.
We are mindful of the fact that prepayment meters have a place in certain households, because we are very sure that we must not increase debt.
However, one reason why we scrutinised the process so carefully is to ensure that it does not impact negatively on vulnerable customers.
