The Minister seems to be comparing figures I have not seen.
If it is a record year, why have we seen such a dramatic drop in planning applications for onshore wind farms and in the number of onshore wind farms delivered?
From a peak of 64 applications in 2011, it went right down to zero in 2019 and now to 10 in 2022, the latest figures the House of Commons Library could provide.
That does not seem like a record year to me.
Is it not time the Government stopped shilly-shallying on onshore wind and backed the builders, not the blockers?
The hon.
Lady is renowned in the House for her arithmetic skills, but in this case they seem to have failed her.
The 1.7 GW is a tremendous success.
I share her enthusiasm for onshore wind where communities support it.
In September, the Government announced changes to planning policy for onshore wind in England to help make it easier and quicker for local planning authorities to consider and, where appropriate, approve onshore wind projects where there is local support.
In the Kettering constituency there are 30 large wind turbines.
Together with solar panels, they generate enough renewable electricity to power all 45,000 homes in the constituency.
Is this not yet another case of where Kettering leads, others follow?
My hon.
Friend has championed, does champion and, I am sure, will continue for many years to champion the good people of Kettering, and the fact that they are providing such leadership on net zero and the delivery of renewables after our parlous inheritance from the Labour party.
Let us make sure that we never go back to a system in which renewables are not brought on to our grid in the way they are today.
