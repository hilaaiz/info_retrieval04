I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
As he knows from when we met to discuss this in June, the Electricity System Operator is responsible for planning the design and location of grid reinforcement, while transmission owners develop individual projects.
I understand that Bradwell had been assessed but was not deemed appropriate for this project.
However, I cannot comment on specific projects, in order to avoid prejudicing planning decisions.
I would be very happy to meet my hon.
Friend again to discuss this in further detail.
