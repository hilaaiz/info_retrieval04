I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I share his enthusiasm for making sure that we continue the development of good, well-paid jobs, and the development of the skills required to help people access those jobs, and that we do not have exploitation onshore or offshore during that development.
It is a huge opportunity for the United Kingdom and for Scotland.
Working together, I am sure we can develop it.
