Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village as it celebrates 55 years of exceptional work in preserving the agricultural history and rural heritage of the Buffalo Niagara region.
The Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village is a testament to the commitment of our community to honor and interpret the stories that have shaped our past and continue to inform our future.
The mission of the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village transcends further than preservation, as it strives to create an educational institution that fosters a deep appreciation for our local history.
Visitors quickly realize that it is more than a museum--the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village is a vibrant hub for learning, discovery, and inspiration.
The Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village connects the rich tapestry of our region's contributions to the broader narrative of American history and ignites curiosity while inspiring the next generation of leaders, artists, and custodians of our heritage.
It offers hands-on experiences that connect visitors with the agricultural roots of our community, making history tangible and relevant.
Today, as we celebrate 55 years of the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village, we also look forward with hope and ambition.
The museum's efforts help to enhance the Western New York region by continuously expanding their reach, and creating even more meaningful connections throughout the community we cherish.
Please join me in thanking the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village's organizers for their years of service to the public.
