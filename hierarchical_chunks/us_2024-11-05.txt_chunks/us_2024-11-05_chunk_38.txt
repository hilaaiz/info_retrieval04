Mr. CROW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the recent opening of Goodwill of Colorado's Excel Center in Aurora, Colorado.
The Excel Center is dedicated to advancing educational opportunities for adults in our state and aims to empower adult learners to achieve the foundational credential of a high school diploma.
As Colorado's first in-person, no-cost, adult learning high school, the Excel Center will provide a pathway for residents aged 22 years and older to earn a diploma--setting them up for higher earning potential and improved job security.
Equipping students with the tools and support they need to overcome obstacles to academic progress is one of the main priorities of the Excel Center.
By working to break down these obstacles, including childcare and transportation, Goodwill of Colorado will help students pursue their educational goals.
Colorado, like much of the Nation, faces a critical workforce shortage, particularly in high-demand industries requiring skilled workers.
Adult learners at the Excel Center will be connected with the education resources, certificates, and workforce development they need to enter the workforce and contribute to in-demand fields.
My district, our state, and our Nation are better when we invest in our workforce, create opportunities for growth, and empower our communities.
I congratulate Goodwill of Colorado on the opening of the Excel Center and thank them for their service to our community.
