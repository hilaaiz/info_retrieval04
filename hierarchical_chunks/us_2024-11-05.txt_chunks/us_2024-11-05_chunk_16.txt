States Navy honored GySgt.
Basilone's service through the commissioning of the USS Basilone (DD-824) and the USS John Basilone (DDG-122), which will be commissioned on November 9, 2024.
His hometown of Raritan, New Jersey began hosting the annual Basilone Parade in 1981, which continues to be the only annual parade in the United States that honors a war hero.
In 2005, the United States Postal Service included GySgt.
Basilone as one of the four distinguished Marines commemorated on the 37-cent stamp issued on November 10, 2005.
In 2010, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks adapted his story as a storyline in the HBO miniseries titled The Pacific.
Most recently, on March 23, 2016, Congress approved renaming the Raritan Post Office to the Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone Post Office, cementing his memory in brick and mortar within his hometown.
GySgt.
Basilone has roads, bridges, and highways named after him in several states, and every enlisted Marine is taught about GySgt.
Basilone's courageous actions during their time in boot camp.
It brings me tremendous honor to commemorate the Birthday of this American hero and native son.
I would also like to recognize the Basilone Memorial Foundation for their tireless work honoring GySgt.
Basilone and supporting our active military, veterans, and others in need.
I am truly honored to represent a district home to such a hero and an organization that continuously works to support our Military.
