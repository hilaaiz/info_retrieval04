Dear Commenter: In 2022, a new Congressional caucus was created to raise awareness among federal lawmakers about the therapeutic potential of psychedelic and entactogenic drugs to treat several mental health conditions that were refractory to contemporary evidence-based therapies.
The Congressional Psychedelics Advancing Therapies (PATH) Caucus aimed to accelerate and support clinical research in the use of these novel substances, specifically psilocybin and 3,4methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).
To better inform Congressional members, the bipartisan PATH Caucus is seeking input on how to implement programs and policies that address the range of complex issues with potential novel therapies that may use a psychedelic or entactogenic drug in medically supervised and interpersonally supportive settings.
To gain a more complete understanding of the issues associated with use of these substances, the PATH Caucus believes that taking an inclusive, intentional, and reasoned approach to gathering input from the public may engender valuable insights that can more accurately and comprehensively characterize how different modalities incorporate the use of these substances while also ensuring responsible, accountable, safe, and ethical use.
We seek information from the general public, those who have received psychedelic-assisted therapies as an intervention, interested stakeholders, and those individuals and entities working within the bio-psycho-social-spiritual behavioral health ecosystem (e.g., palliative care, addiction services), which stresses a holistic system of care comprised of clinical providers, counseling, and peer support (Courtney et al., 2023; D'Souza, 2007; Urutia et al., 2023).
It will be essential to receive input from people and organizations with specialized experience in implementing therapies where psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances are administered, such as in clinical research protocols (e.g., depression, palliative care, substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), or experience in training others for such therapies.
As a part of the PATH Caucus information gathering effort, we acknowledge the significant anthropological role of certain psychedelic substances such as ayahuasca, peyote, and Psilocybe mushrooms.
Some indigenous peoples of the Americas have extensive traditions dating back hundreds to thousands of years, where they incorporated these substances into spiritual ceremonial or ritual healing practices.
The PATH Caucus believes that respectful, inclusive, cultural knowledge sharing from these communities may provide substantial insights, further informing our overall understanding, and we welcome their input.
