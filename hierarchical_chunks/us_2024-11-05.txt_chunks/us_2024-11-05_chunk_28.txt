Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record an updated open letter from myself and Congressman Correa.
the founders of the PATH Caucus, to ensure stakeholders have a voice in crafting the rules and regulations surrounding psychedelic assisted treatments.
This is an updated version of the letter from my previous submission to the Record on August 9, 2024.
It serves to extend our requested deadline for responses to February 28, 2025.
