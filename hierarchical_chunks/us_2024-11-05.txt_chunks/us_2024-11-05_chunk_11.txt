Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program.
Since 1984, the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program has been providing free programs to children throughout Buffalo, New York.
The mission of the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program is to provide underserved children, at no charge, equal opportunities to engage in the highest quality programs and to offer character-building activities through academics, sports, and the arts.
From tap/creative dance to chess club, the Willie Hutch Jones program provides a diverse foundation for all interests.
Willie Hutch Jones obtained his Physical Education degree from Vanderbilt University, along with his master's degree in Sports Administration from Wayne State University.
These degrees partnered with his experience in the NBA, helped 
Mr. Jones grow the clinic for the youth.
With the exponential growth of this program, the organization has been able to offer a year-round program, incorporate dozens of clinics, and remain free of charge.
The Willie Hutch Jones program has strived to improve the emotional, social, and physical health of underserved youth by providing opportunities, exposure, and experiences for developing the next generation of community leaders.
For 40 years, this organization has set out to impact the youth of Buffalo of all racial and socio-economic backgrounds, and has succeeded in doing so.
The Willie Hutch Jones program has connected with countless organizations in the community, to turn the original dream into a reality.
Today, we thank the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program, for its selfless service to our community.
Please join me in congratulating the Willie Hutch Jones Educational and Sports Program for an exceptional 40 years of service.
