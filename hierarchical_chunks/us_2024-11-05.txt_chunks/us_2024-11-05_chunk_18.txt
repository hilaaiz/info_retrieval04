Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the service of Special Agent James ``Pat'' McMonigle (Special Agent McMonigle), who retired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in June.
Special Agent McMonigle felt the call to serve our country after the tragic loss of a colleague in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
Following those events, Special Agent McMonigle devoted his career to the safety and security of the American people.
During his time with the FBI, Special Agent McMonigle served in multiple capacities at home and abroad, including several tours overseas in Mogadishu, Somalia and Kabul, Afghanistan.
While most of his career was with the FBI, Special Agent McMonigle also served as a field collections officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency within the Department.
With degrees from Santa Clara University, Georgetown University, and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, Special Agent McMonigle is well versed in the affairs he was asked to handle.
He is exactly who I would want during a crisis or hostage negotiation, deployed abroad as a legal attache, supervising human intelligence operations, and working on international and domestic counterterrorism.
In addition to volunteering his time speaking with students about his career and encouraging them to find what drives them.
Special Agent McMonigle also served to better the lives of his fellow agents through his service on the National Executive Board of the FBI Agents Association.
While Special Agent McMonigle certainly hasn't actually retired, I hope, with this transition, he's able to spend more time relaxing, completing his wood etchings, and enjoying more of life's milestones with his wife Catherine and their four children, Jack, Patrick, Maria, and Connor.
