Clinical data continue to be collected regarding the safety profiles and potential benefits from therapies that use psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances across a variety of diagnoses such as major depressive disorder (MDD), treatment resistant depression (TRD), demoralization, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and substance use disorders, in conjunction with appropriate supervision and support from qualified mental health professionals (Belouin et al., 2022; Carhart-Harris et al., 2021; Davis et al., 2021; Griffiths et al., 2016; Jerome et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2021; Ross et al., 2016; Siegel et al., 2021; Xi et al., 2023).
Additionally, FDA has granted requests for Breakthrough Therapy designation to specific development programs involving MDMA for the treatment of PTSD (Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, 2017), psilocybin for TRD (COMPASS Pathways, 2018; Goodwin, G.M.. et al. 2022) and MDD (Khan, 2019; Raison et al., 2023), CYB003 for MDD (Cybin, 2024), and MM120 (lysergide d-tartrate) for GAD (MindMed, 2024).
The Breakthrough Therapy designation process facilitates and expedites the development and review medical needs.
This designation is available for drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s) (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2022).
It should be noted that a Breakthrough Therapy designation does not mean that the FDA has made a safety or efficacy determination for a drug, and the Breakthrough Therapy designation is not a substitute for marketing approval.
Currently, FDA has not approved any drug containing MDMA, psilocybin, psilocybin analogs, or LSD or other psychedelics or entactogens as being safe and effective for any therapeutic indication(s).
