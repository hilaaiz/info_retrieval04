Mr. ROBERT GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a Long Beach institution, 555 East, on its 40th anniversary this month.
In 1983, when my hometown of Long Beach faced challenges--boarded-up bui]dings and a struggling economy--Sam King saw potential in our city and more specifically our downtown.
On the eve of Thanksgiving that year, he signed a lease for 555 E. Ocean Boulevard, a decision that would change our dining landscape forever.
Just months later, as the 1984 Olympics approached, 555 East opened its doors, introducing the prime steakhouse concept to Southern California.
For four decades, 555 East has been more than just a restaurant; it has been a gathering place for family celebrations, business meetings, and everything in between.
It has truly earned its iconic status within our community.
I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing 555 East for its milestone anniversary.
