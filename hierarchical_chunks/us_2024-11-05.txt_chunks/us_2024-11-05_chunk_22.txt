Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with Congressman Mike Thompson to recognize and honor Tom Bartee on the occasion of his retirement after an illustrious career of public service, leadership, and commitment to the Vallejo community and beyond.
With over two decades of residency in Vallejo, Tom's dedication to his community has made a profound and lasting impact.
Throughout his career, 
Mr. Bartee served in numerous significant roles in the Solano County community.
As District Director for Senator Bill Dodd, Assembly Member Mariko Yamada, and Assembly Member Michael Allen, 
Mr. Bartee worked tirelessly to represent Solano County Districts 4 and 7, coordinating members' engagement with their constituents and advocating for legislative priorities across a sixcounty region.
He managed district offices, engaged with community stakeholders from the business and education sectors, and implemented media strategies to keep constituents informed of legislative initiatives.
Mr. Bartee's leadership and coordination between district and Capitol offices were pivotal in serving the needs of over 470,000 constituents, representing a legacy of responsive, engaged, and effective public service.
