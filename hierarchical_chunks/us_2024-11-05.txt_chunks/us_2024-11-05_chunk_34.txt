Use of these substances is not without risk.
A psychedelic (e.g, psilocybin) or entactogenic (e.g., MDMA) drug can temporarily alter a person's mood, thoughts, and perceptions, and lead to heightened suggestibility, anxiety/panic, and/or paranoia, among other outcomes.
For psychedelics, a participant can experience vast changes in their perceptions of reality, including time and space.
Moreover, an individual can become extremely sensitive to internal and external stimuli and altered in their cognitive functioning and visuoperceptual skills.
Knowing these realities, any therapy that uses psilocybin or MDMA, for example, should involve thorough participant screening, education, and preparation, supportive settings, and close supervision by credentialed and qualified medical and mental health professionals to maximize safety and promote potential therapeutic outcomes (Davis et al., 2021; Johnson et al., 2008; Nichols, 2016; Phelps, 2017).
Furthermore, acknowledging that it has been suggested that some therapies could potentially lead to blurring of ethical boundaries between participants and provider(s) in some cases, as well as the potential for enhanced suggestibility, there might be increased risk for serious intimate ethical boundary violations by session facilitators/monitors, including emotional, physical, and sexual abuse (Anderson, B., Danforth, A., Grob, C., 2020; Goldhill, 2020; Pilecki et al., 2021), though psychedelics and entactogens are by no means unique in this regard.
Some populations might have a higher risk for adverse reactions from psychedelic or entactogenic drugs, such as people with a known history of serious cardiac conditions or serious mental conditions such as borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder (Bender and Hellerstein, 2022; Bradberry et al., 2022; Leonard et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2012; Malcolm and Thomas, 2021).
Given the broad array of potential challenges with therapies that may use psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin) or entactogens (e.g., MDMA), compounded by an absence of consensus about how best to address these challenges, a proactive collaborative approach may be most effective, where a partnership of subject matter expertise can consolidate efforts and collectively work to address relevant issues (Belouin et al., 2022; Belouin and Henningfield, 2018; Xi et al., 2023).
