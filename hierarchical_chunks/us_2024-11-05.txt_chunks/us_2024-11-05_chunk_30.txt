In medications derived from psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances are ultimately approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA, it is important for States to understand the risk mitigations frameworks FDA has established and develop ways to make sure they are supported.
Aspects of real-world risk reduction and mitigation frameworks may include, but are not limited to, providing comprehensive transparent public education, implementing substance misuse prevention programs, minimizing the potential for adverse reactions, and developing implementable risk mitigation, safety, and ethical monitoring strategies.
Moreover, it will be vital to consider how Congress can best support states in developing and adopting scalable infrastructures and sustainable service delivery systems that ensure proper accountability and monitoring, as well as facilitate access and equity in utilization, with a particular focus on communities that may be at risk for experiencing inequities in care resulting in disparate health outcomes (e.g., veterans, the uninsured, those who are experiencing homelessness, people with lower incomes, and individuals living with mental illness and/or co-occurring substance use disorders; Ortiz et al., 2022).
In addition, when federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans Affairs make these products available, we need to be sure there is sufficient infrastructure to ensure patient safety.
All of these components, when collectively addressed, may contribute to more responsible, accountable, safe, and ethical use of psychedelic and entactogenic derived substances in medically supervised and interpersonally supportive settings.
The PATH Caucus seeks input that can inform Congress so any potential future appropriations will support states collectively addressing the relevant issues and support necessary federal initiatives such as research, implementation and FDA regulation.
Congress believes that by listening and learning from the broader ecosystem, staying abreast of potential innovative evidence-based therapies that may treat individuals with behavioral health disorders refractory to current treatment modalities, and simultaneously undertaking proactive measures for developing real-world risk reduction and mitigation frameworks, will help protect public health and safety.
