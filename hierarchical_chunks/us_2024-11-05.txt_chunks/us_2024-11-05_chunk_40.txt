Representative for Illinois 8th Congressional District, I am proud of my strong relationship with Metra and will continue working with them on improving services, as well as securing funding for projects of critical importance to my constituents.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Illinois and elsewhere, ridership across every mode of public transportation decreased significantly.
The rise of remote and hybrid work meant fewer people commuting each day, leaving transit systems with ridership approximately 40 percent below pre-COVID levels.
This decreased ridership had a direct impact on farebox revenue, a major source of funding for transit operations.
In the Chicago region, beginning in late 2025 and early 2026, transit operators like Metra will face a $730 million annual budget gap.
I remain committed to addressing the transit fiscal cliff--an issue that will not only impact Illinois transit systems but also the majority of transit systems operating across the Nation.
I would also like to extend my congratulations to Metra's CEO and Executive Director, Jim Derwinski, on being named as Chair of the Surface Transportation Board's Passenger Rail Advisory Committee.
Finally, I would like to recognize the tireless work of Metra's employees, from the ticket agents to the train conductors.
Their work is essential to fulfilling the critical transportation needs of our communities.
I thank Metra for 40 years of service.
I look forward to their continued success, and many more years of growth.
