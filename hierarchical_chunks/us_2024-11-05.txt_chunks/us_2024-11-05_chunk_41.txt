Mr. ROBERT GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an extraordinary institution in my district, Musical Theatre West, a premier musical theater company celebrating 72 years in business and 27 years since they moved to my hometown.
What began in 1952 as the Whittier Civic Light Opera has blossomed into one of Southern California's most respected theatrical production companies.
From humble beginnings performing in a high school auditorium, they have grown to produce a full season of shows at the Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center, showcasing both classic staples and contemporary favorites.
Their commitment to artistic excellence has not only enriched our cultural landscape but has also nurtured countless homegrown talents who have gone on to shine on Broadway and beyond.
Musical Theatre West's commitment to accessibility has introduced audiences of all ages and classes to beloved productions, reaching demographics who may have not been otherwise exposed to the art of musical theater.
But most importantly their dedication to education reaches over 17,000 children yearly through outreach programs, sharing the magic of musical theater with the next generation.
Let us celebrate Musical Theatre West for its remarkable journey, its lasting impact on our community, and for showcasing the power of the performing arts to inspire and uplift.
