Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to recognize Chief Ross C. Buzzuro of the Ocean City Police Department as he retires after 40 years of outstanding public service.
Chief Buzzuro led the Ocean City Police Department for over 11 years with purpose and dedication.
As Chief, he oversaw nearly 100 full-time officers, around 20 civilian employees and additional seasonal and part-time employees.
Throughout his nearly 40 years of law enforcement career, Chief Buzzuro served as a police cadet in Baltimore City in 1985 and eventually achieved the ranks of lieutenant, deputy major, major and finally being named lieutenant colonel in 2007.
Chief Buzzuro is a graduate of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Academy and the University of Maryland's Fire & Rescue Institute.
He obtained his bachelor's and master's degrees in management from John Hopkins University.
I would like to thank Chief Buzzuro for his decades of service to the people of Maryland and for his work and dedication to the citizens and visitors.
As he enters his well-deserved retirement and steps down from his position, I wish Chief Buzzuro a happy, healthy and exciting retirement spent around family and friends.
