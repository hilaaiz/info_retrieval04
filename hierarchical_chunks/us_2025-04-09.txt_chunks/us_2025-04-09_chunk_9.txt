Mr. DIAZ-BALART.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding public servant, a venerated leader in South Florida, and a dear friend of mine, Mayor Esteban ``Steve'' Bovo, Jr.
For years, Mayor Bovo has dedicated himself unreservedly to this shared mission of serving with honor the people.
He consistently maintained the highest standards of leadership and a clear vision for Hialeah: to bring our community to new heights.
As the son of Cuban exiles whose family was forced into exile in search of freedom and opportunity, he understands firsthand the importance of democracy and freedom.
His father, the heroic Esteban Bovo Caras, served courageously as a pilot of the 2506 Brigade,
