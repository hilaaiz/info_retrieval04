Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my fellow Hoosier, John Michael Green, for his contributions to literature, entertainment, and education, and in recognition of his latest book, Everything is Tuberculosis, which debuted on March 18, 2025.
As a globally-recognized New York Times bestselling author, John's works include Looking for Alaska, The Fault in Our Stars, Paper Towns, and Turtles All the Way Down, as well as contributing to vlogs, podcasts, articles, live-action shows, motion pictures, and more.
Through their Indianapolis-based Crash Course YouTube channel, John and his brother Hank have reached millions of people worldwide with over 65 accessible and engaging educational video series.
John has long used his platform to foster philanthropy and advocacy, including as an advocate for Indianapolis, earning him the title ``Indy's best hype man.''
Since 2019, John's focus has turned to global health and the fight to eradicate tuberculosis.
Recognizing the artificial barriers to tuberculosis treatment in developing nations, John's advocacy has lowered the cost of lifesaving drugs and testing equipment and directed millions of dollars to underfunded tuberculosis health programs.
Recognized as a ``TB Elimination Champion'' by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John continues to highlight the tuberculosis crisis through his newest release, Everything is Tuberculosis.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring John Green for his meaningful contributions to literature, education, and global health.
His work continues to inspire, educate, and make a lasting difference in Indianapolis, across the Nation, and around the world.
