Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Mr. Nate Lampman for his decades of dedication to this school district.
I sincerely thank Nate for his many years of service to his community, and join with his family, friends, and colleagues in extending my best wishes to him in his well-deserved retirement.
