they deserved and was able to help with any inquiries that came his way.
David is not only a diligent public servant, but a man of outstanding character.
For instance, when congressional liaison tragically passed in 2023, it was David who compassionately stepped in to coordinate communications to congressional staff and provide details regarding funeral arrangements.
In all, David McCormack represents the very best of America's public servants--dedicated, thoughtful, and unwavering in his commitment in service to others.
On behalf of a grateful district, I want to congratulate David on a well deserved and restful retirement.
