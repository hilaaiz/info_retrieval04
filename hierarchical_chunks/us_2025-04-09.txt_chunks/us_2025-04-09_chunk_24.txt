Senator Dan Sullivan.
Through these roles, Jake proved his expertise in energy and environmental policy.
As Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, I was pleased to have him as a member develop and implement the committee's legislative agenda.
Recently, Jake accepted a role in President Trump's administration to serve under Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum, as Deputy Solicitor for Energy and Mineral Resources.
I know Jake will be a valuable asset to Secretary Burgum, President Trump, and the American people, the same way he was for me and the members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
I thank him, congratulate him on his new role, and wish him the best in his future.
