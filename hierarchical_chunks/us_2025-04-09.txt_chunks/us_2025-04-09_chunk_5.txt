Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the Jamestown High School Band and Chorus, we honor a century of musical excellence and dedication that has profoundly enriched both the school and broader community.
Established in 1924 by siblings Arthur and Ebba Goranson, these ensembles have become pillars of artistic achievement.
Under Arthur's leadership, the band gained national recognition, performing in prestigious events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Tournament.
Ebba's pioneering efforts led the formation of the A Cappella Choir, renowned for its annual Vespers services and international performances, earning the moniker ``Choir of the Cathedrals.''
Over the decades, these programs have fostered generations of talented musicians, instilling values of discipline, collaboration and cultural appreciation.
As we celebrate this milestone, we commend and express deep gratitude to the past, present and future directors, instructors and students whose passion and dedication continue to inspire the Jamestown community and uphold this remarkable legacy for generations to come.
