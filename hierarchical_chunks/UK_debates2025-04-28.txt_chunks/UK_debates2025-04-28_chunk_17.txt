I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and congratulate him on being on his feet after running the London marathon.
We are absolutely committed to improving attendance rates of all children, but particularly those with SEND, and to addressing challenges in the school setting to ensure that children have the support to achieve and thrive.
I would be happy to engage with him on any good practice in this area that can support us in our endeavours.
