I thank the Minister for coming forward to respond to the urgent question.
Let me put on record my deepest sympathies for the victims of this terrible incident and their families.
Members on both sides of the House have talked about the victims of crossbow attacks, and I find the whole issue very shocking, especially as someone who regularly visits Westcliff-on-Sea.
Is there any more that we can do as a Government to support victims of these terrible attacks and their families?
