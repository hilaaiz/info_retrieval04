The Minister will know that the University of Sussex, one of my local universities, has recently been fined over £500,000—a record amount—following  a three-and-half-year investigation by the Office for Students into freedom of speech.
I know that the OfS is independent, but does the Minister share my concern that it reached this conclusion without ever speaking to the university or its current staff and students?
Does she recognise the very wide implications of this ruling, and will she meet me and the University to discuss this?
My hon.
Friend will understand the limitations on what I can say in answer to his question because this was a decision by the Office for Students, which carries out independent regulatory functions.
I would be happy to arrange for him to meet the relevant Minister, but only once legal matters have concluded.
Can the Secretary of State confirm that the new freedom of speech provisions will ensure that, if any member of a university’s staff gives the same definition of a woman as the Prime Minister did in his most recent iteration of it, they will not be no-platformed or driven out of their job?
In setting out the Government’s position in the statement on Tuesday I was very clear that we accepted the Supreme Court judgment, and that is the right basis on which things ought to be taken forward.
Through the commencement regulations, we have given tougher powers to the regulator.
We have also reformed the regulator since July, with a much sharper focus on financial sustainability—something that I know is important to Members across the House.
