The right hon.
Gentleman brings real expertise to this issue, and I know that he also cares deeply about ensuring that we get the system right for children with SEND.
Our allocations were made on the basis of the funding formulas that were already in place.
We intend to look carefully at all these matters as part of our wider reform of the SEND system, but, as the right hon.
Gentleman will appreciate, they are complex, and it is important for any change to be made in a way that is responsible and focused on better outcomes for children.
