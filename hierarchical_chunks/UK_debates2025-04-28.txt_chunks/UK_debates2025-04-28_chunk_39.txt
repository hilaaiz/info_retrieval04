I thank the Minister for her answers.
Our thoughts are with the victims and, indeed, with the police officers and the emergency services workers, who responded in such a positive way.
Like others, I believe that such incidents highlight the fact that police officers, and particularly police community support officers, need to be on the ground so that they can deal with the use of crossbows, put in place measures to ensure public safety, and send the message that the police are close by.
That needs to be the case not just in Headingley, but across all of this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
