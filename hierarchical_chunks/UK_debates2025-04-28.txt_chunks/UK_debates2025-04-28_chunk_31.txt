I thank my hon.
Friend for those comments.
He is absolutely right to pay tribute to the community, the members of the public who came forward when the attack was happening and the emergency services, who, as ever, run towards danger when many others run in the opposite direction.
It is absolutely right that we pay tribute in the way that he has done.
I hope that my response to his urgent question offered  him some reassurance about the Government’s approach towards crossbows and what more we want to do.
As I said, we will shortly publish our response to the consultation that took place last year.
The investigation is under way; I know that it will be thorough and comprehensive, and that all the issues he raised will be looked at.
