I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point.
Our youth guarantee will provide tailored support to young people, helping them to access high-quality education, training and employment.
We want young people to be earning and learning, and we are wasting no time about that.
Youth foundation apprenticeships provide more opportunities for young people, and we want to ensure that we expand access to university for disadvantaged students and that all learning is on an equal footing.
