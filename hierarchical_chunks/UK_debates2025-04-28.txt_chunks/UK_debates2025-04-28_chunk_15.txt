Not only has the Education Secretary introduced a Bill to this place that will destroy standards in English schools, but now she has broken her promises on national insurance contributions compensation and is leaving schools in an impossible funding situation.
Every MP has heard from headteachers who are stressed beyond belief at how to manage their funding.
Can the Secretary of State guarantee that worried headteachers up and down the country will not have to make teachers redundant because of her broken promises: yes or no?
The right hon.
Lady has a firmer grip on anonymous briefings in the papers than on the details of the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill.
She is more focused on petty political games in Westminster than on improving the lives of children and families up and down the country.
The Bill will get qualified teachers in front of classrooms.
It will teach a cutting-edge curriculum.
It will drive down the costs of sending children to school.
It will provide breakfast clubs for children who need them.
It will stop vulnerable children falling through the cracks.
It is a single most important piece of child protection legislation in a generation.
The Conservatives voted against it.
They can snipe from the sidelines; we will get on with delivering change.
Let us have another marathon runner to ask the next question.
What steps she is taking to help increase the number of teachers trained in the provision of SEND education.
Improving the quality of teaching is the best way to drive up standards in schools, which is why the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill will get expert teachers in front of the classroom, driving high and rising standards.
We are improving teacher training so that teachers are equipped to properly support pupils with SEND to achieve and thrive, but we know there is more to do.
We are paving the way for far-reaching reforms through our plan for change.
