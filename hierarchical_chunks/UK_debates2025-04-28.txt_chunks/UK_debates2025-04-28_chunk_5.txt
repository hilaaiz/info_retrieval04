Having told this House in answer to an urgent question from  the hon.
Member for Twickenham (Munira Wilson)  that the adoption and special guardianship support fund would continue, Ministers somehow did not manage to mention that the funding per child would be cut by 40%.
They then slipped that out during recess.
Meanwhile, Ministers will spend £90 million on advertising.
Can they at least agree to publish the impact assessment on cutting what is available from this fund?
As I said, this Government are committed to breaking down barriers to opportunity.
We will take no lectures from the Conservatives.
They have absolutely no plan for education, other than to reintroduce private school VAT reductions.
[Interruption.]
What?
When will the Government publish the impact assessment?
We will respond in due course to those issues.
What recent assessment her Department has made of the adequacy of local authority funding for SEND.
What steps she is taking to ensure sustainable funding for SEND provision in schools.
This Labour Government inherited a lose, lose, lose SEND system, in the words of the Tories’ last Education Secretary, but we have invested an additional £1 billion in high needs budgets and £740 million to pave the way for pupils with SEND to achieve and thrive in mainstream schools.
Just last week in Derbyshire, I met families with experience of the SEND system who had been badly failed by the Tory county council.
This Labour Government know that the SEND system needs far-reaching reform to deliver better life chances for all our children.
