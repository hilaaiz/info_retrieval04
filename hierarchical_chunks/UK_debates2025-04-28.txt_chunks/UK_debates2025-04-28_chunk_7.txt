I thank the Secretary of State for her answer to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bridlington and The Wolds (Charlie Dewhirst) , but each child with special educational needs in the East Riding receives £968, whereas in Camden the figure is £3,564.
I am sure she agrees that a child in Camden does not have four times the need of a child in the East Riding.
Will she undertake to ensure, as part of the review, that in principle we will have fairer funding for children throughout the country with educational needs related to, for instance, dyslexia or autism at the end of that process, as opposed to where we sit now?
