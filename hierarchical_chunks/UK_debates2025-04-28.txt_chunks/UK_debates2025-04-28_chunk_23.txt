I thank the hon.
Member for her level of concern.
Higher education providers are autonomous and responsible for managing their own budgets.
If they were at any risk, we would work with the Office for Students to ensure that students were protected.
The Government reserve the right to intervene to protect the interests of students.
The strategic priorities grant is also available to support teachers and students in higher education in more expensive subjects.
