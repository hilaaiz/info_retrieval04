I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing Joan to see me today.
She is an incredibly brave and impressive person, and we heard directly from her what the loss of Dave meant to her, her family and her 22 grandchildren.
In the few words that my hon.
Friend used, he made the case effectively for further changes to the law around crossbows.
