In Derby, like in so many communities across the country, we face a lack of available SEND school placements with appropriately trained teachers.
In ’23-24 alone, Derby city council spent £18 million on placements outside the city.
It is wrong that pupils and their families are not getting the support that they need in their communities.
Will the Minister outline what steps the Government are taking to increase the availability of SEND school places in Derby, in the east midlands and across the UK?
