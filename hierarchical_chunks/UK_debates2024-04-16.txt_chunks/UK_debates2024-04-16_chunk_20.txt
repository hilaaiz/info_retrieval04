If grid decarbon-isation by 2030 really did cost the billions of pounds that the Secretary of State claims, she might care to explain why her own policy is to achieve 95% of full decarbonisation by the very same date.
She knows that independent analysis actually says that Labour’s plan would reduce families’ energy bills by £300 a year, so will she ’fess up?
Will she admit that the true price of her failure will be paid for by hard-pressed families in their energy bills?
I would completely reject that, based on the many conversations that I have had with industry and experts.
The plans that we have set out have been assessed by the Climate Change Committee as being realistic.
The plans that the Labour party has set out have been criticised by pretty much every single part of the energy system.
Rather than playing politics with this issue, the hon.
Gentleman should consider the reality of the taxes, the raised bills and the problems with the economy that Labour’s plans would force on Britain.
Last year, the Government promised that they would publish their decarbonisation plan by the end of 2023, but they have failed to do so.
Is that because the Secretary of State is too embarrassed to admit the truth?
She is way off track, even for delivering clean power by 2035, because she has bungled the offshore wind auction, is failing on energy efficiency and refuses to end the onshore wind ban.
Is it not the case that she wants to attack Labour’s plan because she cannot defend her own?
