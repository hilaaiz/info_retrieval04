I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for his work.
The Committee as a whole has looked at this issue and really probed for solutions.
On the GBR point, it is also providing the body of pre-legislative scrutiny of rail reform, and I thank my hon.
Friend and his Committee for their work in that endeavour.
He is absolutely right that a more holistic approach to the railway, in which track and train are integrated, will help us to make further decisions into the future and give more certainty with regard to orders.
None the less, I have set out the orders that have been taken over the preceding years.
The order book is healthy and we will look to get the tenders out this year and next for the train operators that I have mentioned.
