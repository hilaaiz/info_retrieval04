I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and his recommended reading.
I was aware of the CPRE’s rooftop campaign, and I am keen to understand the findings of its latest report.
As set out in the British energy security strategy and the energy security plan, we are aiming for 70 GW of solar capacity by 2035.
That would be more than quadruple our current installed capacity.
We need to maximise the deployment of both types of solar to achieve that ambition.
