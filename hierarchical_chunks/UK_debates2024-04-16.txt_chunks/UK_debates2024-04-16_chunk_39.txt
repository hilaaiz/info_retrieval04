I am pleased that the Secretary of State and the Minister are taking charge of negotiations with Alstom, Hitachi and others.
I appreciate that as commercially sensitive discussions are ongoing, the Minister is constrained in what he can say, but they need to be resolved soon.
The wider issue is the peaks and troughs not just in rolling stock procurement, but in railway industry investment more generally.
How does the Minister believe Great British Railways and wider rail reform will help to smooth out the peaks and troughs in the longer term?
