I thank the Secretary of State for her response.
There is always a competition.
As I represent Strangford, the fishing sector is very important to me.
It is important that we have floating offshore wind projects, but also to ensure that fishing can be sustainable.
In these discussions, can she confirm that the interests of the fishing industry and representation from the fishing industry are given appropriate weight, taking into consideration the need for sustainable fishing to continue?
Without fishing my people will lose jobs.
