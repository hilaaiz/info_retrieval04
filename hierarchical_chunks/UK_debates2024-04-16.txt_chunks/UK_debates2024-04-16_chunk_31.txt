We learned last year that no fewer than 200 Department for Energy Security and Net Zero jobs were going to transfer from London to Aberdeen.
That was championed by no less than the Secretary of State for Scotland,  the right hon.
Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Jack)  and the Minister responsible for nuclear and renewables,  the hon.
Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie) .
It now transpires that only 35 jobs will transfer to Aberdeen.
For context, that is 0.37% of the DESNZ workforce.
Is the Secretary of State content for that derisory transfer of jobs from her Department to Aberdeen?
Presumably she will not be, so what is she going to do about it to give the north-east of Scotland a better deal?
