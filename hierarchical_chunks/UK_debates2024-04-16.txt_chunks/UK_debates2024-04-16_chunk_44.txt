I thank the right hon.
Member for the points she has raised.
The discussions have been cross-party: the leader of Derby council has worked very closely with the Department to try to broker a solution.
I will take away her point about meetings; I do not have that information to hand, but I will ensure she gets the meeting she has asked for.
