I thank the hon.
Member for her kind words.
I enjoyed working with her on many occasions in my former roles.
The Government have continued to work with the public and business to unlock additional investment.
For example, through the connections action plan, we expect an additional 40 GW of accelerated collection dates to be released, which will particularly help in the area of solar.
We are also looking at the £85 billion of investment we have unlocked since the autumn statement through the transmission acceleration action plan.
Those are all vital components to hit our ambitious targets.
