I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this issue.
We are very proud—I am particularly proud—that we have announced Aberdeen as our second headquarters.
Hosting our second headquarters underlines the importance of the north-east of Scotland in our net zero transition.
Unlike the Scottish National party, we champion the north-east of Scotland.
They are anti-exploration, anti-new licences and anti-oil and gas.
The headquarters already has more than 100 staff, and our ambition is for more than 135 by March 2027.
I have been doing some research, though: it turns out that the Scottish Government—his party’s Government—have a grand total of zero jobs in his own constituency of Angus.
