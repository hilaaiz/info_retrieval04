I thank my hon.
Friend; he is a champion of the railway, and it was an absolute delight to visit him at Huddersfield station and talk about some  of those projects.
Of course, his point is completely relevant to the matter before us.
The trans-Pennine route upgrade, for which there will be more Government investment than there was for the entirety of Crossrail, allows us to put an order in for TransPennine Express trains, so there will be more trains manufactured as well as better stations, longer platforms and more resilience.

I thank that team, which is doing a brilliant job, which The Sunday Times has highlighted.
Rather than chuntering, it would be nice if the Opposition thanked those who deliver railway projects to time and on budget.
