I thank the hon.

While we scale up our clean energy success, including in renewables, which have gone from 7% to 40%, there is still a need for oil and gas.
A failure to issue a new licence would make no difference to the consumption of oil and gas, but it would increase imports, which typically have higher emissions, and also damage our economy.
