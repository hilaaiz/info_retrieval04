I am sure the Secretary of State will agree that much of Britain’s energy needs could be met, and generated, offshore.
Alongside floating wind power, we also have the opportunity to take advantage of tidal and marine power.
Does she recognise that Britain has the second largest tidal range in the world after Canada, yet we use so little of it?
To put that right, will she agree to meet me, other colleagues in this House and the northern tidal power gateway to look at how we can gain green, renewable, secure British energy from Morecambe bay?
