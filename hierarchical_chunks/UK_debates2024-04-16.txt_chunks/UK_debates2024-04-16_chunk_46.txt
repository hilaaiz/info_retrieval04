I thank the Rail Minister for the huge levels of rail investment going into my constituency.
As he knows, alongside my hon.
Friends the Members for Dewsbury (Mark Eastwood) and for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates), we secured £48 million of levelling-up cash for upgrades on the Penistone line, with stations at Honley and Brockholes in my constituency.
I thank the Rail Minister for visiting Huddersfield railway station last year, and I am pleased to report that a major upgrade, which is part of the £11 billion trans-Pennine route upgrade, is under way at that station.
Once that is complete, there will be major upgrades to Slaithwaite and Marsden stations, including disabled access.
Rail investment is being delivered to my wonderful part of West Yorkshire.
