I thank the hon.
Gentleman.
We are passionate supporters of the fishing industry.
We continue to have conversations with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure that we share our marine bed in an equitable way, not only getting the most out of it for our clean energy needs but protecting the fishing industry.
