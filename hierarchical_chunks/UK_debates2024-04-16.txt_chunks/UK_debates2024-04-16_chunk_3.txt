I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a doughty campaigner for floating offshore wind.
I am unable to comment on any specific concerns about a particular planning decision, but I am sure the relevant Minister will be happy to meet her to discuss how the Government can provide better guidance on compensation.
People whose land is acquired compulsorily should not be left worse off financially, and compensation should be offered in line with the statutory compensation code.
