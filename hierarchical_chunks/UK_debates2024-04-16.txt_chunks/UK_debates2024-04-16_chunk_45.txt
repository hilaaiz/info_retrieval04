The point I was making was that the comments from the Labour Front Bench do not help matters at all.
This is a sensitive, commercially and legally challenging situation that we are trying to find a way through.
We cannot find contracts just for one train manufacturer: we have four, and it has to be an open process, otherwise the matter ends up in court.
Despite that, we are doing everything we can to find the right orders for those train manufacturers.
As well as the letter I have written to all of the manufacturers, specifying the tender pipeline that is to come, the Secretary of State has written to all the entities that finance train operators, making the point that they should bring forward matters that they can see.
That will help with refurbishment, as well as new rolling stock.
