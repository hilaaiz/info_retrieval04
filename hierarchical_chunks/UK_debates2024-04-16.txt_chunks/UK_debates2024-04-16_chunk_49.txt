The Minister says this is a complex issue, but is it not rather simple?
These companies will not be around to enjoy the sort of exporting opportunities he talks about if they do not sustain.
On his answer to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) ,  can he just apply his mind to what he said about the invitations to tender?
If it is going to take that long to issue those tenders, these companies will not be around.
It is not about them not competing; it is about their being able to compete and to be here.
Can he not recognise that it is the constant chopping and changing in procurement that has landed the rail industry in this terrible situation?
