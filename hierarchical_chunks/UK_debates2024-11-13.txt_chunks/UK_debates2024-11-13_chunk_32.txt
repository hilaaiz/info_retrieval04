I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Following two years of negotiation under three Prime Ministers, on  3 October  the Government secured a deal that will protect the secure operation of the UK-US base on Diego Garcia well into the next century.
The Government inherited a situation where that future was under threat.
International courts were reaching judgments on the basis that Mauritius had sovereignty over the Chagos archipelago.
International organisations were also taking steps not to undermine Mauritian sovereignty claims.
That was not sustainable.
