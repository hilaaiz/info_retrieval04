I welcome the Prime Minister’s leadership on an international scale to smash the criminal gangs that smuggle people across the border.
This Labour Government have returned more than 9,000 people with no right to be in the UK, which is 20% more than the Conservatives did.
Will the Prime Minister confirm that he will continue this trend, and smash the gangs that profit from people’s misery?
