I was in South Lochaber at the weekend, speaking to pensioners who still cannot understand why the Prime Minister chose to take away their winter fuel payment.
One of them remembered from just two years ago the then Leader of the Opposition stating: “Looking ahead to winter is frightening.
I’ve met pensioners who have no idea how they’ll heat their homes.”
She asked me to ask the Prime Minister, whatever happened to that guy?
As the hon.
Member knows from previous answers, we have taken tough decisions in this Budget to deal with the situation that we faced.
Because of that, we have stabilised the economy, which means that we can commit to the triple lock, and because of the triple lock, pensioners will be better off.
I will take no lectures from his party about running the economy; the SNP’s record in Scotland is terrible.
