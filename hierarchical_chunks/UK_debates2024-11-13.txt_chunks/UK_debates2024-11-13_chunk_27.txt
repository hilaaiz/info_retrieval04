I welcome the establishment of a flood resilience taskforce, because in my constituency of Broxtowe, unprecedented flooding has affected many of my constituents.
There is rising concern and significant financial insecurity for many; they face distress, trauma and fear in their own home.
What other measures is the Prime Minister taking to improve flood resilience?
What support will be available to my constituents in Broxtowe?
