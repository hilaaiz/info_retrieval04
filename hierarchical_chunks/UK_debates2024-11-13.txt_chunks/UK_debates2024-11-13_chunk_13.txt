I welcome the right hon.
Lady to her place.
I look forward to working with her on areas where we can agree and where we can take such concerns forward on a cross-party basis, wherever possible.
I believe that she, like me, is passionate about tackling violence against women and girls.
As she sets out, I believe that everyone in our country should have the chance to achieve all that they are capable of achieving.
Our mission across Government is to ensure that where people are from does not determine what they can go on to achieve.
