The Prime Minister has nothing to offer but platitudes.
The fact is that the Government do not know what they are doing.
Their ideological Budget was designed to milk the private sector and hope that nobody would notice.
Now, his Cabinet Ministers are all queuing up for public sector bail-outs for his tax mess.
If he is going to bail out the public sector, perhaps he can tell us this: does he think it appropriate to approve—as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has done—a four-day week for councils?
That is not flexible working but part-time work for full-time pay.
Questions based on what we are actually doing are usually better than made-up fantasy questions.
What did the Tories deliver in 14 years?
Low growth, a stagnant economy, a disastrous mini-Budget and a £22 billion black hole.
And now, the Leader of the Opposition wants to give me advice on running the economy.
I do not want to be rude, but no, thank you very much.
Towns like Southport need investment and support after 14 years of decline under the Conservative party.
Will  the Prime Minister confirm that his Budget will provide that much-needed investment for towns like mine, and that, unlike under the previous Government, my local authority and the public services that my town relies on will finally be properly supported?
May I begin by paying tribute to my hon.
Friend and his Southport constituents They have shown extraordinary courage and resilience as they try to rebuild from the devastating tragedy and loss of earlier this year.
We will ensure that the people of Southport are supported now and in the years to come.
The Budget is designed to fix the crucial services that his constituents rely on, including through £1.3 billion of new funding for local government, and investment in safer streets and in the future of our NHS.
That is the direction in which we are taking the country.
