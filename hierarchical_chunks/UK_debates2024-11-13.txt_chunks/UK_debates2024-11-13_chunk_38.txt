I thank the hon.
Gentleman, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats, for his questions.
I know that the future of the islands is hugely important to the Chagossian community.
I have engaged with the Chagossian community over many, many years and since I have been in government.
We have always been clear about the importance of respecting their interests.
I have to say, though, that the negotiations were between the UK and Mauritius, as sovereign states, with our priority being to secure the full operation of the base on Diego Garcia.
However, it is crucial that we recognise the importance of Chagossian interests within this process and we have done that.
