Many Chagossians from all over the country gathered at a rally yesterday, where they expressed their concerns about the UK-Mauritius agreement.
We reiterate our concerns here today.
The exclusion of the voice of the Chagossians  is wrong.
It cannot be right, and surely no Member of this House could think it acceptable that the Chagossians are denied the opportunity for self-determination.
Will the Minister update the House to confirm the timescales by which Parliament will have oversight of the final treaty?
Will he look again at injecting the voice of Chagossians into the process, even at this late stage?
May I also raise the case of the Tamils stranded on Diego Garcia?
We welcome recent news reports that they will be airlifted to the UK, but will the Minister update the House on whether that will take place and whether they will be permitted a permanent right to resettlement in the UK?
