The Prime Minister can plant as many questions as he likes with his Back Benchers, but at the end of the day I am the one he has to face at the Dispatch Box.
I welcome him back from his trip to Azerbaijan, where he has unilaterally made commitments that will make life more expensive for everyone back home.
Speaking of making life—[Interruption.]
Order.
Somebody is suggesting reading; I think you will notice that the Prime Minister also reads, so please get your act together.
I can pre-prepare my questions, but the Prime Minister needs to answer from his mind.
He has made life more expensive with his unilateral  commitments but, speaking of making life more expensive, will the Prime Minister confirm that he will keep the cap on council tax?
The right hon.
Lady talks of the trip to COP.
I am very proud of the fact that we are restoring leadership on climate to the UK, because that will be measured in lower bills, energy independence and the jobs of the future.
She may have missed this, but on Monday I was very pleased to announce a huge order into jobs in Hull for blades for offshore wind.
If she is opposed to that sort of action, she should go to Hull and say so.
On the question of councils, she knows what the arrangements are.
I think the House will have heard that the Prime Minister could neither confirm nor deny whether the cap on council tax was being raised, so I will ask him this: how much extra does he expect local authorities will have to raise to cover the social care funding gap created by the Chancellor’s Budget and increases in employers’ NI?
He told  the hon.
Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine)  just now that he was covering social care.
How much extra does he expect local authorities to raise?
This knockabout is all very well, but not actually listening to what I said three minutes ago is a bit of a fundamental failure of the Leader of the Opposition.
I just said £600 million, and I repeat it: £600 million.
