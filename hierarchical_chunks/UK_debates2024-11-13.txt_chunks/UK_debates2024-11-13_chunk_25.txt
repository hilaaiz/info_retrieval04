I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important issue.
Whatever the hatred, there has been a rise in the past 12 or so months, and the whole House will join me in saying that we must meet any rise in hatred in whatever form it is, including Islamophobia.
We are working with others to take that forward, and I am happy to meet him further on that.
