I am honoured to take on the role of shadow Minister for Equalities and I pay tribute to my predecessor, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North West Essex (Mrs Badenoch) , who will be at this Dispatch Box shortly.
The equalities brief underpins values that I cherish: fairness, freedom, meritocracy and equality under the law.
I believe people should be judged by the content of their character, not the colour of their skin or any other identity characteristic.
Does the Secretary of State agree that equality is not about group identities or placing one section of society on a platform above another, but about individual freedom and responsibility?
