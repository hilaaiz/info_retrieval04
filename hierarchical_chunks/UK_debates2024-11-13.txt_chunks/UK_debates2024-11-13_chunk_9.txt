The Minister will be aware that the gender pay gap persists.
Does she agree that more could be done to support survivors in the workplace, such as by having domestic abuse policies in every workplace, and by considering paid leave and flexible working, so that survivors can get the life-changing support they need and can stay in work?
I agree with the hon.
Lady.
Before I came to this place, I ran a refuge for women and children affected by domestic violence.
During that time, I saw some good examples of employers supporting women who were going through a very difficult time in their lives.
There is more that we can ask of employers, and there is more that we, as a Government, are committed to achieving, especially through the gender pay gap action plans we will be taking forward, and through halving violence against women and girls.
