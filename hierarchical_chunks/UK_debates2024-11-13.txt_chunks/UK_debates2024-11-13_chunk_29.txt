I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue.
We are committed to the protection and restoration of unique chalk streams.
She is right that the destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed, and we have announced immediate action to end this disgraceful behaviour: new powers and tougher penalties, including fines; banning bonuses; and bringing criminal charges against those who persistently break the law.
We have also launched a water commission.
