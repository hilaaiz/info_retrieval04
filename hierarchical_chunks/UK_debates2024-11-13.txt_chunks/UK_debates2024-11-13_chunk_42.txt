The Prime Minister engaged with the former Prime Minister of Mauritius and with the US Administration on these matters.
We have engaged with a wide range of partners in these discussions.
The right hon.
Gentleman is very familiar with them, as the former Foreign Secretary who was part of that process.
I hope that my hon.
Friend the Minister will agree with me that, as we discuss the very important issues raised by  the hon.
Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage) , we must acknowledge that all right hon.
and hon.
Members are doing what is in the best interests of our country; that right hon.
and hon.
Members on the Opposition Benches do not have a monopoly on national security and defence; and, indeed, that it is this Government who are reforming and improving our international reputation around the world—our decision on the Chagos islands, which will protect the base and deal with the other issues my hon.
Friend has mentioned, is an important part of that.
Absolutely.
The importance of national security to this Government is at the heart of the missions set out by the Prime Minister, which have been put into practice by the Foreign Secretary, the Defence Secretary and me, along with others across the Government.
We would never take decisions that compromised the national security of this country, or indeed that of our allies, and that is why I am confident that this decision is the right one.
Let us remember that this process was begun under the last Administration, because they recognised the challenge and recognised that something needed to be done about it.
