Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, due to my attendance at the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government's hearing and the delay in recessing the hearing for votes, I missed the first 2 votes on Thursday, July 20, 2023.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call
No. 361 and NAY on Roll Call
No. 362.
