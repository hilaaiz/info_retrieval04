In 2019, she united with Baker Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church under the pastoral leadership of Reverend Walter McDonald.
There, 
Mrs. Baker was a Class Leader, member of the Church School, Prayer, and Daily Devotion ministries, while also participating in the monthly food give-away and in the Lay Organization.
My thoughts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved Mrs. Baker, particularly her extensive, loving family.
May her memory last forever.
