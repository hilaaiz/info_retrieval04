Maintaining Safe and Secure Airspace During Major Sports Events.
While the Administration supports the goal of providing accessibility to and public use of the national airspace, it is concerned that provisions proposed in the bill could introduce unnecessary risks to those attending major sporting events if the effectiveness of safety and security buffers currently provided by temporary flight restrictions were to be decreased.
To the extent that the proposed provisions are intended to accommodate airshows, the Administration urges the Congress to consider alternative methods to deconflict airshows and major sports events rather than potentially put aviation operations in close proximity to events attended by millions of Americans each year.
