Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and legacy of Ruth Alvia Munchus Baker, a pillar of our Fort Worth community.
Ruth Alvia Munchus Baker was born June 16, 1931, in Fort Worth and completed her education at historic I.M. Terrell High School.
In 1948, she began a devoted marriage and partnership with Herbert Baker and later became the proud mother of five daughters.
