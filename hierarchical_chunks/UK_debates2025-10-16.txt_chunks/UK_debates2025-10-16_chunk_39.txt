Yesterday, we saw finger pointing and “gotcha” moments from both the Government and the Opposition Benches during Prime Minister’s questions, but the release of the witness statements last night provides further questions for both sides, including what pressure was being applied to  the right hon.
Member for Tonbridge (Tom Tugendhat)  and  the hon.
Member for Rutland and Stamford (Alicia Kearns)  from within their own party to dampen down their criticisms of China.
This whole thing makes an absolutely mockery of what is a serious collapse of a case and a threat to our national security—a threat that is not going away but will only increase.
Did the CPS tell the Government in advance that the case was at risk of collapsing?
Did it ask the Government to be more explicit in their wording, and if so, why were the Government not more explicit?
Will the Minister commit today to a statutory independent inquiry, which would provide radical transparency and ensure that the right lessons are learned so that this does not happen again?
I can promise that I will try to avoid all “gotcha” moments and finger pointing.
On the question of when the CPS informed the Government, my understanding, and the Prime Minister made this clear yesterday, is that the Prime Minister was informed very shortly before the case collapsed—a matter of days before.
That is on the record—it was in the House, if you need to refer to that, from the Prime Minister.
In terms of future inquiries, I should have said to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)  that this is an issue Select Committees will want to look at as well.
There is a normal process for that, but I am unable to go beyond that today.
