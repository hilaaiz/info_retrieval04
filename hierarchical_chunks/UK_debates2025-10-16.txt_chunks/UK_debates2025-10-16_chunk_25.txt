I thank the hon.
Member for his warm words.
However, it takes some brass neck to represent a political party in this Chamber that in recent memory crashed the economy and left working people across the country paying the price.
The demand for charities soared as a direct result of the Conservatives’ policies, while the ability of charities to stand up and speak up for the people they represented was attacked and undermined at every turn by his Government.
I can confirm that we will not be following Conservative policies.
We will be proudly flying the flag for Labour policies, which put people and communities back at the heart of our country again.
