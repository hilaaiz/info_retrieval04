On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
I will not; I am going to raise a different argument, if I may.
Given that the Government’s position is that the bureaucrats run the Government and are in charge of everything, may we dissolve this House and save the taxpayer the money, because clearly this is not a democracy any more?
I am sure the right hon.
Member would not want to give up his seat quite so quickly.
On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
You have taken a close interest in this issue, Mr Speaker—the fact that it goes to the heart of this Parliament on the protection of Members of Parliament and the secrets that we sometimes hold.
I am sure that you will share my concern that someone on their very first outing has been sent out on this issue and that the Prime Minister used yesterday’s Prime Minister’s questions and has not faced proper scrutiny in this House in a statement.
May I gently ask whether you would seek to have him make a statement to the House?
It is not even a point of order, and you know that—we are keeping the debate going.
I do congratulate the Minister and feel sorry that this is his first outing, but I have to say, if you take the pay check, you also take the pain that goes with it.
