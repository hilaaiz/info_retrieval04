I thank the Minister for her answers.
Her enthusiasm is infectious, and we wish her well and thank her for all she does.
The local Youth Justice Agency team in my constituency makes important rehabilitative interventions for young people.
Has the Minister had an opportunity to discuss what is happening here with the Department of Justice back home, to ensure that the benefits here come back to us in Northern Ireland as well?
