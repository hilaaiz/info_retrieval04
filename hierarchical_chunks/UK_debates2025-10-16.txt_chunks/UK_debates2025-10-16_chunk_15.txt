This has been an incredible year for women’s sport, with both the Lionesses and the Red Roses inspiring a generation with their fantastic performances and historic successes on the pitch.
The previous Conservative Government worked in partnership alongside the national lottery, Sport England and various national bodies to help to support these incredible athletes with investment in grassroots facilities, including the £30 million Lionesses fund, which directly increased opportunities for women’s and girls’ sports.
Beyond the sentiments that the Secretary of State has already expressed today, will she confirm whether her Government will support a new Lionesses and Red Roses fund specifically for women’s sports?
Will she also confirm that fairness and safety will remain the key pillars of guidance for female sports?
It was a real pleasure, with the Prime Minister, to meet the Lionesses before they went off and then on to victory in the Euros.
We have been working closely with rugby football and other areas of women’s  sport to advance this issue.
The £400 million investment that I referenced in answer to my hon.
Friend  the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Noah Law)  will double the number of places across the board, which will mean a significant increase in the number of women and girls able to access sports.
My hon.
Friend the Minister for Sport was pleased to launch the women’s sport taskforce, which will really grip this issue.
I am happy to work cross-party on that; it is something that the whole House should be able to get behind and support.
