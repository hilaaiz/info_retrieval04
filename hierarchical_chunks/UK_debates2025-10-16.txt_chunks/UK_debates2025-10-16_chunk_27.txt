I thank my hon.
Friend for championing grassroots boxing.
Our Government believe that too many sports, whether that is boxing or rugby league, have been overlooked by Government for far too long, and we are determined to bring them back into focus.
My hon.
Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Stephanie Peacock) has been working with the all-party group on boxing, and would be delighted to meet my hon.
Friend.
May I also say how thrilled I was that Natasha Jonas received an honour this year?
Boxing brings joy to millions of people, and it ought to be celebrated.
