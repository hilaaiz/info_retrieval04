I thank the hon.
Member, as always, for raising an issue that has been raised with both me and the Minister for Sport.
We are working with UK Sport to try to resolve it.
Of course we will be cheering our athletes on in Tokyo—I am really looking forward to that—but we know that those opportunities are not available to all.
I would be happy to meet the hon.
Member to discuss this further.
