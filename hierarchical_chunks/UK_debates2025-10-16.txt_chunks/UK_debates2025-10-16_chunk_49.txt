I welcome the Minister to his place on his first outing— I have to say, I think the Prime Minister owes him a  favour.
The Minister will understand the need for absolutely clarity, and I know he says that, but given the serious threat that he has said China poses to us, can he be absolutely clear on two issues: first, that there was no ministerial involvement whatsoever in pulling this case, and, secondly, that the Government provided all evidence that they were asked for?
I am afraid that just saying “It is my understanding” is not good enough.
We need some assurances.
