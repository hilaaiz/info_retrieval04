I thank my hon.
Friend for being an outstanding champion for sport in his community.
I would encourage Penrice school and others who have similar challenges to approach the Football Foundation, through which we fund floodlights and other small-scale investments.
Previous funding allocations have been far too prescriptive.
We believe communities know best what they need and through the Football Foundation, we are determined to deliver it.
