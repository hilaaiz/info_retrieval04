It seems to me that the issue is this: given that all the deputy NSA’s witness statements refer to China as a threat, I cannot understand why the CPS took the nuclear option of collapsing the case rather than leaving  it to a jury.
Twenty years as a criminal barrister has given me absolute faith that the jury would have spent no time on how many angels can dance on the top of a pin, but would simply have looked at whether or not China was an enemy.
They would have found it very easy to decide that that is exactly what it was and then moved on to whether or not these men had been spying on behalf of China.
It does seem to me that the decision should have been left to a jury.
Does my hon.
Friend have any idea why on earth the CPS dropped the case?
As I say, this was a decision taken by the CPS independently, with no interference or involvement from the Government.
Members may or may not sympathise with that decision.
It was a CPS decision.
That is why it is important that the evidence is in the public domain now and that everyone can judge from that how things proceeded.
I will just make one final point.
Obviously, the CPS decision was not based purely on the evidence put forward by the DNSA.
It was based on much wider evidence collected over a much longer period, so the decision on whether to proceed was taken by the CPS on a much broader evidential basis.
