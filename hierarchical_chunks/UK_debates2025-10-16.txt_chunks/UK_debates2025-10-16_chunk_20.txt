I thank the Secretary of State for her comments.
Despite previous reassurances from Reach plc, owner of the Mirror, Daily Record, Express and many regional papers, it has announced redundancies that put 600 journalists’ jobs under threat.
Many Members on both sides of the House are concerned about the continued erosion of our media landscape, and particularly the loss of experienced and professional journalists,  which risks driving people towards fake news and misinformation on social media.
Will the Minister meet the National Union of Journalists and concerned MPs from the all-party group to discuss this pressing issue?
