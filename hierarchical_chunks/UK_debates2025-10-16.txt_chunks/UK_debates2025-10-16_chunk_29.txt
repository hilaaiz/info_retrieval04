The Prime Minister’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief launched the Government’s new strategy on  8 July  this year, and the Church welcomes that continuing commitment.
Obviously it is too early to assess the effectiveness of the strategy, but the Church remains concerned about the global and local trends.
The levels across countries are currently either high or very high, and Government restrictions on freedom of religion or belief are at their highest level since 2007.
Anglicans in Newcastle-under-Lyme will very much welcome the appointment of the new Archbishop of Canterbury and will be praying for her—as the first woman in the role, she has made history.
The United Kingdom has long worked to promote pluralist values across the globe, so I welcome the employment of my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Northumberland (David Smith) , but there is more to do.
Will the Second Church Estates Commissioner update the House on what conversations she and her colleagues have had with the Government on their efforts to emphasise the importance of supporting freedom of religion in their conversations with countries with which we are pursuing trade deals?
The Church is in regular dialogue with the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and welcomes the Government’s continued commitment to implementing the findings of the Truro review.
As part of its continuing conversations, the Church raises the importance of supporting freedom of  religion with other countries, including those countries that the Government are pursuing trade deals with.
I am sure my hon.
Friend will recognise that I do not comment on Government policy as such.
