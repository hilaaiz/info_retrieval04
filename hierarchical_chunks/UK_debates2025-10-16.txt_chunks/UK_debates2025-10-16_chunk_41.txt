I am pleased that the Government published the witnessed statements last night, but clearly there are a lot of questions yet to be asked in terms of how this came about and what evidence there was that may not have been shared, or perhaps was not asked for.
The Joint Committee met this morning to discuss the situation.
We will hold a formal inquiry into the issue.
Just to remind Members, the Committee comprises the Chairs of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee, so we are well covered.
We will be holding the inquiry as soon as we possibly can.
Will the Minister give his commitment that we will have access to Ministers, civil servants and whoever we wish to come before us?
As I say, parliamentary scrutiny and transparency is something that, despite the allegation, we are trying to provide with statements and by publishing evidence.
I am sure, going forward, that that is something that will carry on.
I will come back to my hon.
Friend on the precise mechanism for how we will do that, but I am sure people will be made available to his Committee.
