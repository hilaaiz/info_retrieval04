I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that important question.
We are broadening access to legal aid.
The means test review, when fully implemented, will put an additional £25 million into legal aid and bring an additional £2 million into the scope of legal aid.
We are rolling out the housing loss prevention advice service—that is another £10 million going in.
There will be up to £141 million going into legal aid.
We are also rolling out the review of civil legal aid, which will report later this year.
We will be issuing a Green Paper in July to look at what we need to do to have a sustainable, resilient and well-resourced system, because we want high-quality lawyers doing civil legal aid.
That is vital for the kind of country we want to be.
