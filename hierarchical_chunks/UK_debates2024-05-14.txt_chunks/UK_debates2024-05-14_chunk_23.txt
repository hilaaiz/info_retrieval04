I thank my hon.
Friend for that sensible question.
I agree that community payback offers offenders an opportunity to make visible reparations to their local communities, with millions of hours being delivered each year.
As an example, this March, for the great British spring clean, offenders spent thousands of hours clearing litter across the country.
We are trialling a new way to deliver community payback through the rapid deployment pilot, which was launched last year.
Community payback teams are working in partnership with local authorities to see incidents cleaned up within 48 hours’ notice, and we are now expanding that to all 12 probation regions.
