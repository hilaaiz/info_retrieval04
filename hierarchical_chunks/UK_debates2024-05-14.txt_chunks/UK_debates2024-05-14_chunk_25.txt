I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, which is extremely relevant.
As she can imagine, there have been extensive discussions between the Department and the judiciary about this.
The senior presiding judge has approved the test sites for the pilot that I have just discussed.
Support of the type that we are providing in the pilot has not been provided before, so the pilot itself will inform an essential part of the judgment we make on whether and how we can carry on.
