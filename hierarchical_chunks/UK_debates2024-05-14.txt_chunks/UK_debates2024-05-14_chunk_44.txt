This case, together with the case a few months ago about the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation)  Act 2023, have a common theme: the applicability of article 2 of the Windsor framework and the direct application of EU law.
What are the Government going to do about that?
Will they seek to expedite the appeal directly to the Supreme Court?
It seems to me this is a fundamental issue that need resolving.
Further, will they seek further clarification, either from the Joint Committee on the Northern Ireland protocol or by other means, to clarify the situation and protect non-devolved matters from being dealt with in this way?
I am always grateful to my right hon.
and learned Friend for his contribution.
He speaks with real authority, given his professional background, his role in this House, and his former position as a distinguished Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor.
He will recognise that the court will make its final order in two weeks, when an appeal can be brought.
He made a number of observations, on which Ministers will reflect when taking decisions, but as I have said, and as the Prime Minister has made very clear, it is our intention to appeal this judgment.
We think that it is right and proper to take all steps necessary to defend our position.
