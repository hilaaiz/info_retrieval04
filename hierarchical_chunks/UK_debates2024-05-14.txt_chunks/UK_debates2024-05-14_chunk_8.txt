I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I was not aware of that, but I knew that an amendment had been suggested that was not within the scope of the Bill.
My hon.
Friend’s suggestion is a sensible one; we already publish the number of foreign national offenders in prison, but I understand the force of her question, and I am happy to meet her to discuss it further.
