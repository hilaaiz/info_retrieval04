The wheels of justice certainly turn slowly under this Government, and hundreds of thousands of people across the country are paying the price in the Crown courts, the civil courts, the family courts and tribunals.
At the end  of 2023, the employment tribunal backlog stood at more than 460,000 cases.
Those are cases affecting workers who have been bullied, workers who have been denied pay and workers who have been unfairly dismissed.
Does the Minister think that workers, like the Government, should just give up on the justice system, roll over and accept what employers do to them, or is there a new magic formula to sort this out?
The one thing the hon.
Gentleman did not of course mention was the impact of the pandemic on the criminal justice system, and indeed on the employment tribunal system.
[Hon.
Members: “Oh, come on!”
] Opposition Front Benchers do not like hearing it, but they cannot deny the impact of shutting down the system, in effect, for two years.
We have massively increased the resources available and we are working through the backlog, but that will take time.
