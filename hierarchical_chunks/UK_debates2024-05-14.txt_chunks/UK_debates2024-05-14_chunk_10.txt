The Minister may be aware that I used to be the victims Minister, and when I was in that role, I tried to stand up for victims whose loved ones had been killed by road traffic incidents.
It is fundamentally unfair that if someone is charged with death by careless driving, as compared with death by dangerous driving, the case is not appealable by the victim for leniency.
Is that something we are still looking at, as was the case when I was in the Ministry?
I share my right hon.
Friend’s profound concern about death caused by either dangerous or careless driving.
As he knows, it was the Conservative Government who created a criminal offence of death by careless driving.
I will just make two points.
First, on  28 June 2022 , the maximum penalty for the offence of death by dangerous driving was increased to life—previously, it was 14 years.
Secondly, we have just agreed to extend the unduly lenient sentence scheme so that the complainant will have 28 days to put in their appeal to the Attorney General and the Solicitor General, who will have a further 14 days to contact the court.
We hope that that will encourage more applications, and of course, we keep the category of offences under careful review.
