More than 60 lawyers, campaigners, politicians and academics have written a letter in support of the anti-violence against women and girls campaigner and barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman, who is facing disciplinary action after challenging a judge for taking a “boys’ club attitude” in a ruling on a domestic abuse case.
Does the Minister agree that the racial, gender and class-based bias of the justice system must be addressed and that it is right to speak up against injustice?
Will she join me in paying tribute to those who are campaigning for a legal sector that genuinely represents, empowers, and is accountable to the wider public?
I count myself as one of the people who campaigns on violence against women, and there are many other right hon.
and hon.
Members across this House who do the same thing.
The hon.
Lady will understand, I hope, why I will not get involved in a disciplinary matter concerning a particular barrister.
I know what it is said has been said, and it will be for the relevant standards committee to decide whether or not the barrister is at fault.
