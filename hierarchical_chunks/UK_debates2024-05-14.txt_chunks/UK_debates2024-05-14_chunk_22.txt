The Government boast, as they have done just now, about their investment in new body scanners to detect drugs on everyone entering a prison each day, yet a damning report in The Times found that the body scanners at HMP Bedford were not even staffed.
What is the point in spending £100 million on scanners if they are not even used?
Before turning to the substance of the hon.
Lady’s question, may I take this opportunity to wish her a happy birthday?
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
] It is important to remember that this investment is across the estate.
I was in HMP Wandsworth yesterday seeing the work being done there.
In the context of Bedford, the body scanners were used at appropriate times in an appropriate manner.
If he will make a comparative assessment of the effectiveness of short custodial sentences and sentences served in the community.
Ministry of Justice reoffending statistics show that those serving a sentence of six months or less have a 59% reoffending rate.
For offenders punished with suspended sentences or community orders, the reoffending rate is 24%.
The Department’s 2019 analysis of a matched cohort of over 30,000 offenders showed lower reoffending rates for those serving sentences in the community when compared with immediate custody of less than 12 months, avoiding tens of thousands of potential crimes.
I agree with the Bishop of Gloucester that community payback schemes are often far more appropriate than short-term custodial sentences, particularly for women prisoners.
If my hon.
Friend agrees with that, does he also agree that we could expand the range of community payback activity to include, for example, helping at good local charities such as the Nelson Trust and the Family Haven, and, especially during this summer season of litter picking across the country, keeping Britain tidy?
