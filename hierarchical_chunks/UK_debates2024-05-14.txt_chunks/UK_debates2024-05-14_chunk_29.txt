I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising private family law, because all too often people raise the issue of crime, but family matters too.
I am really delighted that we have managed to secure funding from the Treasury to roll out early legal advice in private family law.
Alongside the Pathfinder pilot scheme, it is designed to make the process of dealing with private family disputes more seamless and less painful, and ultimately ensure that children are put first.
