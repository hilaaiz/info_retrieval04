The point about legal advice is very important: people should get legal advice so that they can make their points.
That is why we are investing heavily: when the Illegal Migration Act 2023 comes into force there will be a 15% uplift; we have invested £1.5 million to reaccredit senior caseworkers; and we are also paying for travel time.
We recognise that; the legislation is necessarily robust and we are also ensuring people get the legal advice they need.
