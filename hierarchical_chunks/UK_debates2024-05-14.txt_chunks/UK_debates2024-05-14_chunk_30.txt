People in Carshalton and Wallington, particularly women, are being targeted in so-called “crash for cash” insurance scams.
Could my right hon.
and learned Friend outline what support is available to victims of this sort of crime?
If someone is the victim of a “crash for cash” scam, they are likely to be the victim of an offence under the Fraud Act 2006 or, potentially, under the Road Traffic Act 1988.
We have quadrupled the funding for victims of crime, who are entitled under the victims code to be kept updated about the crime, to be notified about compensation and to be offered special measures   if the case gets to court.
Regardless of whether someone is the victim of “crash for cash”, theft or any other crime, the state should be there to provide the support they need.
