Mr. Speaker, Bishop Leslie Patterson, Jr. and Co-Pastor Dr. Francene Patterson exemplify what it means to lead with faith and purpose.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on this milestone anniversary and commending their outstanding service to their congregation and the broader community.
