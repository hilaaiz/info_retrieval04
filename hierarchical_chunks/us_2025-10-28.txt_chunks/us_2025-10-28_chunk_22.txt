Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Margaret Hopson Brown, a beloved member of our community whose warmth and kindness touched the lives of many.
Born on December 19, 1954, to David and Mary Hopson, Margaret lived a life rich with love, adventure, and purpose.
Margaret passed away on September 8, 2025, leaving behind a legacy of love and laughter.
A Celebration of Life service was held on Saturday, September 13, 2025, at Valley Queen M.B. Church, officiated by Rev. Lesta Anderson and Rev. Dexter Davis, with interment at Booker Cemetery.
Margaret was a lifelong member of Shady Grove M.B. Church, where she served faithfully, embodying the spirit of a true servant of the Lord.
Her life was a testament to her faith, as she accepted Christ at an early age and lived out her beliefs through acts of kindness and service.
Known for her ability to turn everyday moments into celebrations, Margaret's presence was a gift to all who knew her.
Whether she was spinning wild stories, sharing a perfect joke, or ensuring no one left her table hungry, Margaret's warmth drew people in and made strangers feel like lifelong friends.
Margaret was preceded in death by her parents; her husband Royal Brown, Jr.; and five siblings.
She leaves behind a loving family, including her four sisters, Dorothy, Frances, Brenda, and Pinky; her brother, Andrew Lee; and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts, and special friends, including the Class of 1970 and the Golden Hearts Social club.
Though Margaret's time with us has ended, her story lives on in every lesson taught, every memory shared, and every heart she touched.
Her legacy is proof that some people never truly leave us.
