Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions.
Col. Brenda Strength as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year for her exceptional leadership, operational excellence, and dedicated service to both the United States Air Force and the Northern California community.
Lt. Col. Strength leads a team of 372 military and civilian personnel in managing the Air Mobility Command's largest logistics portfolio, valued at over $983 million.
Under her leadership, her unit executed over 58,000 passenger movements and transported more than 5 million pounds of cargo, while simultaneously planning and executing 12 high-priority Presidential support missions, mobilizing 123 personnel across 22 locations in less than 24 hours.
She played a pivotal role in finalizing a 15-year modernization effort involving the transfer of 3,000 legacy weapons systems across three wings.
Through innovative joint training with the U.S. Marine Corps, she established three crossservice exercises and embedded 25 Air Force reservists into five critical logistics functions, enhancing operational readiness and joint interoperability.
Her logistical acumen led to major advancements: a 30 percent reduction in overdue parts in the ``Due In From Maintenance'' program, a 15 percent increase in Specialized Fueling qualifications, and the resolution of a vital Base Exchange agreement benefiting over 135,000 members of the Travis AFB community.
Further demonstrating her strategic foresight, Lt. Col. Strength oversaw a zero-cost warehouse floor plan redesign that consolidated 124 locations for 11,000 line items, resolved 132 asset discrepancies, and bolstered the Air Force's largest mobility account.
Her innovation directly enabled a 26 percent increase in qualified aircrew by resolving a 9-month gap in hot refuel kit certification.
Beyond her military service.
Lt. Col. Strength has strengthened community bonds by encouraging squadron engagement in local volunteerism, including youth mentorship, highway cleanups, STEM and robotics initiatives, and support for local athletics and the arts.
Her commitment to community partnerships highlights the Air Force's enduring connection to the people it serves.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Lt. Col. Brenda Strength for her invaluable contributions to our community.
