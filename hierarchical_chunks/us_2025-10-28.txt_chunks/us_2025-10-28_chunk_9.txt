Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Latyna Young, recognized as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Dr. Young is a lifelong educator, community leader, and advocate whose 45-year career in education has left an enduring mark on Vallejo and Solano County.
Elected to the Vallejo City Unified School District Board of Trustees in 2020, where she represents Area 4, Dr. Young's leadership reflects her deep commitment to equity, empowerment, and excellence in education.
A proud graduate of Vallejo schools herself, she began her career in the same district as a teacher before serving as coordinator, vice principal, principal, and director of student support services.
Though retired from full-time service, she continues to champion educational opportunity and student success as a trustee and mentor to the next generation of educators.
Beyond her service to the school district, Dr. Young is President of Fighting Back Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending poverty and strengthening families in Vallejo and across Solano County.
She is also an active member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. (Kappa Beta Omega Chapter), the California Association of African American Superintendents and Administrators (CAAASA), and the Solano-Napa Chapter of Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA).
Dr. Young's academic achievements are as impressive as her professional record--holding two master's degrees, in early childhood and special education from Sonoma State University and in counseling from the University of La Verne, along with a doctorate in educational leadership in urban schools.
Her lifetime of service embodies perseverance, compassion, and faith in the transformative power of education.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, I am proud to honor Dr. Latyna Young for her remarkable leadership, her dedication to the Vallejo community, and her lifelong commitment to public service.
