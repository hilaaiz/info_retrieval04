Mr. BEGICH.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to honor a trailblazer in Alaska's sports history, Scott Gomez for his induction into the United States Hockey Hall.
As the first Alaskan to receive this extraordinary distinction, 
Mr. Gomez has not only broken barriers in the world of professional hockey but has also served as a role model for generations of young Alaskans.
Born in Anchorage and a graduate of East Anchorage High School, Mr. Gomez rose swiftly through the ranks of professional hockey.
He made an immediate impact in his rookie season with the New Jersey Devils, by winning the NHL's Calder Memorial Trophy.
His career would go on to include two Stanley Cup championships, over 1,000 games in the NHL, and international representation with Team USA at the Winter Olympics.
Beyond his accolades on the ice, 
Mr. Gomez's legacy is defined by his commitment to community.
During the 2012 NHL lockout, while many of his peers played overseas, he returned home to Alaska to play in front of local fans.
He has continued to mentor youth and invest in the sport through coaching roles, including his current position with the USHL's Surrey Eagles.
