Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend Bishop Leslie Patterson, Jr. and Co-Pastor Dr. Francene Patterson on the occasion of their 30th Pastoral Anniversary at First Baptist Church.
Under their leadership and guidance, First Baptist Church has grown into a flourishing ministry rooted in service, fellowship, and community.
Together, they have transformed lives, strengthened families, and built a legacy grounded in compassion, responsibility, and faith.
Bishop and Co-Pastor Patterson have shown exceptional dedication to the Northern Virginia community through their ministry's outreach and impact.
They have nurtured over one hundred children through the church's childcare center, provided food assistance to more than 5,000 families through the Manna from Heaven Food Pantry, and hosted a COVID19 vaccine clinic during a time of great need.
Their partnerships with small and minority-owned businesses, schools, nonprofits, and civic organizations have created lasting connections that continue to uplift lives across the region.
