Mr. Gomez also founded the Scott Gomez Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting youth hockey and increasing opportunities for underserved communities.
Through scholarships, clinics, and community work, the foundation reflects his deep commitment to giving back and uplifting the next generation of players.
Scott Gomez embodies the values of perseverance, excellence, and service that make Alaska proud.
His journey from local rinks to national recognition reflects the very best of our state's spirit of optimism, hard work, and generosity.
I offer my congratulations on this well-deserved honor and thank him for the inspiration he continues to provide both on and off the ice.
