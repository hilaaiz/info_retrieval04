Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lucinda Bazile, recognized as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
As Chief Executive Officer of Cancer Support Community San Francisco Bay Area, Lucinda has dedicated her life to advancing health equity, expanding access to care, and empowering those affected by cancer and chronic illness.
With over three decades of experience in community health and nonprofit leadership, she has built a legacy defined by compassion, integrity, and impact.

Deeply motivated by personal experience, Lucinda transformed loss into purpose, becoming a tireless advocate for early diagnosis, patient education, and culturally competent care.
A proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., she mentors young women, broadens pathways into healthcare careers, and continues to champion diversity and inclusion in medicine.
Her advocacy extends beyond professional settings as she remains an active volunteer supporting seniors and families throughout the Bay Area.
Through her unwavering commitment to health justice and community empowerment, Lucinda Bazile exemplifies what it means to lead with purpose and compassion.
