I thank my hon.
Friend for his work on the all-party parliamentary group on arbitrary detention and hostage affairs, championing the plight of British nationals facing the most difficult circumstances  overseas?
We routinely raise these cases with international counterparts, as he would expect, and we are deeply committed to getting them home and united with their loved ones.
As part of our work to strengthen support for British nationals overseas, we are working at pace to get the envoy role set up, and I will make sure that he is kept updated about that.
