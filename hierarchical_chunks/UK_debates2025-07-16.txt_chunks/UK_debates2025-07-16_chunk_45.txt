I echo the words of my hon.
Friends the Members for Stratford and Bow (Uma Kumaran) and for Sheffield Central (Abtisam Mohamed) about the terrible and desperate suffering of women and children.
I thank the Minister for her update, in which she highlighted the outcome of the London Sudan conference and the urgent need for access for aid.
When I speak to my constituents from the Sudanese diaspora community, they talk about their desperate sadness in the conversations they have with their friends and family who are still in the region.
Will the Minister update the House on the consular arrangements for the friends and family of my constituents?
My hon.
Friend is a doughty campaigner on behalf of her constituents in Westminster and the City.
I encourage her and her staff to use the MP hotline, because that is the best way of getting through in order to get consular advice and to reassure our communities in the diaspora of Sudan.
