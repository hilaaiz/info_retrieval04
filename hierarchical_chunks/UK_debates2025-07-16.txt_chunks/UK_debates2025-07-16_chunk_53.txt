I thank the Minister for her answers to all the questions and her strong words on our commitment.
I believe those words will encourage us all, and hopefully thereby encourage our constituents.
Sudan ranks fifth on the Open Doors world watch list for Christian persecution, with more than 100 churches and Christian buildings forcibly seized in the conflict, with the latest church destroyed just last week.
Christians are afraid to practise their faith, and the recent murder of 300 people in North Kordofan has underlined the valid reason that they live in fear.
How can the Government assist?
More importantly, will the Government intervene and help the people of this region, who are being exterminated just because they are Christians?
