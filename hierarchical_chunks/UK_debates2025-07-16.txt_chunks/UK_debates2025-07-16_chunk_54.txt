I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his relentless work in this House on freedom of religion or belief.
Of course, the region used to be so much more diverse, but the space for religious freedom has really  narrowed.
He is quite right to challenge that.
With his permission, I will share his thoughts with our freedom of religion or belief champion, my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Northumberland (David Smith) , so that we can work together on this issue and shine a spotlight on the lack of freedom for Christian communities in particular, but also for other minority communities in the Darfur region.
