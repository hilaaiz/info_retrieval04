My hon.
Friend is right to say that the reports coming out of Darfur are horrifying.
Some of the violence has shown the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crimes against humanity.
The Foreign Secretary heard this at first hand from survivors when he was in Adre in January.
Irrespective of any determinations in the International Criminal Court, we know that we will strongly and always support its active investigation into the situation in Darfur, including allegations of crimes committed since April 2023, and that is why the UK has provided technical support in this regard.
