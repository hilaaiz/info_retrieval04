I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this really important issue.
I am obviously incredibly sorry to hear about the tragic case that he mentions.
As he will know, the availability of this drug is regulated across the NHS by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which makes decisions on which treatments provide the best care for patients while maintaining value for money for the taxpayer.
I will make sure that he gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to see what more can be done to get this treatment to patients who need it.
