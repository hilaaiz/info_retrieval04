Yesterday, the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility warned the Government that higher and higher levels of taxes are bad for growth.
Does the Prime Minister agree?
Mr Speaker, I will tell you what is bad for growth: 14 years of a Tory Government.
That meant stagnant growth for 14 years, leaving a £22 billion black hole.
In the first quarter of this year we have achieved: the highest growth in the G7, which we promised before the election; investment of £120 billion in this country, which is a record in the first year of any Government; and three trade deals, all of which will boost growth.
