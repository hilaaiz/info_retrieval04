I thank my hon.
Friend for his extensive work in civil society on these sorts of issues.
The current position is for us to engage extensively through diplomatic means to encourage all parties to come to the table.
We are very aware of the complexity of this particular conflict and the fact that it is not just two sides within the region, but a lot of other players.
We are uniquely positioned with our role on the United Nations Security Council and with our other partners; for instance, we do a lot with the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
We are using our diplomatic efforts double time at the moment, but I do hear what my hon.
Friend says.
