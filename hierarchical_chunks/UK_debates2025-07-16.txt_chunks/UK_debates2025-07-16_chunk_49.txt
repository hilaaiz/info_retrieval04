I thank the hon.
Gentleman for all the work he did before coming to Parliament and his important support for so many countries; I have been in debates with him on Myanmar and others.
It is important that we lay on the record that £120 million is a lot of money, and that we have to follow that money.
As I explained before, de-banking sometimes occurs in certain contexts, which is why we need to have those relationships on the ground with the sorts of aid organisations that my hon.
Friend the Member for Stratford and Bow spoke about, covering the situation as it is today and how to maintain those relationships.
My personal view is that it is not always just about the impact of the budget; sometimes it is about the diplomatic work that goes on around the funding so that we can maximise that money.
