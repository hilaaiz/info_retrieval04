In  Stockport, approximately 20% of families live in social housing.
After Stockport Liberal Democrat and Conservative councillors blocked the Greater Manchester spatial framework proposal in 2020, the need for social housing is even more critical.
Far too many families are living in insecure, overcrowded accommodation and waiting years for a suitable family home.
I welcome Labour’s record-breaking £39 billion investment in social and affordable housing, and I want to ensure that communities such as mine in Stockport are prioritised.
Can the Prime Minister confirm that these homes will be built and will be affordable?
Will he look again at suspending the right to buy?
We are delivering the biggest boost to social and affordable housing in a generation, and we are proud to do so.
Our £39 billion investment will deliver around 300,000 social and affordable homes, with at least 60% of homes delivered for social rent.
While we do not intend to remove the right to buy, which helps social tenants to get on the property ladder, we are reforming the scheme to protect social housing stock and encourage councils to deliver more new homes.
A much better understanding of the particular needs of autistic and neurodiverse children is vital to expanding capacity in mainstream education for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.
As the Prime Minister looks at the SEND Bill over the summer, can I urge him to introduce mandatory training for all teachers and staff on autism and neurodiversity?
