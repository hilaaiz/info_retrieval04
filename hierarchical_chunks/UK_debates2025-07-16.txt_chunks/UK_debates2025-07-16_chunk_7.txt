I thank the Chair of the Welsh Affairs Committee for her question.
Monday was a really significant day for Welsh steelmaking.
I was at the groundbreaking ceremony to begin construction of the electric arc furnace, which will be one of the largest in the world, securing 5,000 jobs and the future of steelmaking in Port Talbot for years to come.
It has been made possible by £1.25 billion of investment, including £500 million from this Government, as well as our £80 million to support workers and the wider steel community, and will benefit not just Port Talbot but downstream sites.
This has been a really challenging time for steelworkers across Wales, but I think this week marks a real turning point, securing a bright future for years to come.
