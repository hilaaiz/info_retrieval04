May I take this opportunity to thank  the right hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir Andrew Mitchell)  for keeping the plight of the Sudanese at the forefront of our thoughts.
We often hear the adage, “out of sight, out of mind”, and, unfortunately, the conflict in Sudan does not engage the mainstream media in the way that it should.
We know about the recent harrowing events in North Kordofan, where 300 civilians, including children and pregnant women, were massacred.
We know that, historically, there have been international peacekeeping troops on the ground.
Will the Minister explore that opportunity with the relevant nations?
Does she believe that that is something that can be considered?
Just last month, we joined the UN-EU consultative group on Sudan for the first time, alongside our partners from the US, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the African Union and the League of Arab States.
That was at the top of the agenda.
Our role at the moment is very much focused on being the penholder at the UN, but all channels are open and we are listening to all views.
The important thing is that we try to get round the table again and maintain the momentum that we had for that brief moment at the London conference.
With 150,000 men, women and children dead, 13 million people displaced, attacks on humanitarian workers, and reports of ethnic cleansing and genocide, Sudan is undoubtedly the worst humanitarian crisis in the world today, yet almost nobody knows about it.
We have had no marches on the streets, comparatively little media attention, and very few statements and urgent questions in the House.
Will the Minister set out what more the Government can do to raise awareness of the desperate need to address this conflict?
