I thank my hon.
Friend for his important question.
Since the outbreak of the conflict in 2023, the UK has frozen the assets of nine commercial entities linked to the parties involved in the conflict.
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the UK has also sanctioned two generals of Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces for their crimes against civilians in November 2024.
He is also right to emphasise the use of drones in this particular conflict and how difficult it is for civilians to know how to shield themselves against them.
This new method of war is very much at the top of our agenda when we speak with like-minded people.
