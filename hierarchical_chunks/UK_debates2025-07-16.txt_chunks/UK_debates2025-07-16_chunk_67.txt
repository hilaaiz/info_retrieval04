The reforms encompass the Government’s financial services growth and competitiveness strategy, which is our 10-year plan for financial services.
This plan will make the UK the global centre of choice for financial services investment by 2035, with all parts of the country benefiting from its success, building on our thriving regional financial services clusters around the country.
The financial services sector is one of this country’s largest and most productive sectors.
It is worth 9% of total economic output and provides 1.2 million jobs across the UK’s nations and regions.
Our strategy will unleash the potential of the sector to catalyse growth, enterprise and opportunity in the rest of the economy.
That will mean that working people will get better returns on their savings, that home ownership will be unlocked for tens of thousands more people, and that more businesses will get access to the capital that they need to grow.
