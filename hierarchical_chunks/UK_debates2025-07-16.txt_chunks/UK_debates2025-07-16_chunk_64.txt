I thank the Minister for her answers today, and  the right hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir Andrew Mitchell)  for bringing this urgent question to the House.
The events in Sudan are undoubtedly an ongoing stain on the conscience of the global community.
I am deeply concerned about increasing the accountability of those who are complicit or guilty of war crimes or crimes against humanity.
Following the question of my hon.
Friend  the Member for High Peak (Jon Pearce) , can the Minister assure me and my constituents that she will leave no stone unturned in making sure that people face justice for the things that they have either enabled or taken part in?
