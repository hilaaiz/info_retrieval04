I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that contribution, because parents and children have been failed far too often.
We are committing an additional £1 billion to SEND, but there must be meaningful reform alongside it, and new teachers must have the appropriate training.
We are committed to reviewing that and to working with parents and teachers, and we will take away his suggestion.
I invite him and others across the House to work with us on this important reform, because I think this issue has been raised with me more than any other at Prime Minister’s questions.
It is clearly a broken system; it needs reform.
If we can work together across the House to get it right, I think that is the least we owe to parents and children across the country.
