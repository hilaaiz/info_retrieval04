I thank my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Sir Andrew Mitchell)  for securing this urgent question on the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
I welcome the leadership steps that the UK Government are taking, but will the Minister tell the House what conversations are being had with both the African Union and the United Nations about the possibility of surging peacekeepers into Sudan to protect civilians?
