The Prime Minister is not planning to do anything this summer to fix the economy.
The shadow of the last Budget is hanging over the entire country.
Just yesterday, only the Conservatives supported the two-child benefit cap, because only the Conservatives believe in living within our means—not Labour, not the Liberal Democrats, not Reform.
But it is the end of term, so why don’t we go through the Prime Minister’s end-of-term scorecard?
The economy is contracting, inflation is the highest in the G7, unemployment is up every month under this Government, spending is out of control, borrowing costs are more expensive than in Greece—and this is just the first year.
The Labour party should be ashamed of what it is  doing to the country.

Labour Members can shake their heads as much as they like, but the fact is that this summer they will have to go to their constituents and explain why the Government have been making such a mess over the past 12 months.
And is it not the case, given that this is just their first year, that the worse is yet to come?
We are happily going to go to our constituents.
We will tell them that we promised 2 million extra NHS appointments and have delivered 4 million extra appointments.
I have to upgrade that—it is now 4.5 million extra appointments, so we will tell our constituents that.
Then we will tell them about the free school meals we are rolling out, the free breakfast clubs, the free childcare, and school uniform costs.
We will tell them about that.
When we have done that, we will move on to affordable houses and tell them about the £39 billion we are investing.
When we are finished with that, we will tell them about the rail and road upgrades across the country, the £120 billion investment and, of course, the three trade deals—and we are only just getting started.
