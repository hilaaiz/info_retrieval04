I thank my hon.
Friend her for her important work in pulling together groups—in particular aid workers whose focus is on medical relief—and for her role on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
I am sure she shares with me the worry about the news of a cholera outbreak in the region.
I thank her for her important work in that regard.
She also impresses on the House the importance of the UK’s support to women and girls.
