The unfolding scenario in Sudan almost defies description.
The Minister has quite rightly spoken about the importance of accessibility.
Does she agree that, for accessibility to work in terms of aid, resources and assistance, there needs to be a comprehensive international approach in order even to offer the prospect of hope and delivery within the next few months?
The hon.
Member is absolutely right to talk about the importance not just of our bilateral meetings, but of working at that multilateral level.
At the same time, we need to provide support in that important area of gathering facts as we go along, because the fog of war can prevent that.
Let me give one example.
The UK provided £989,000 to the Sudan Witness project started by the Centre of Information Resilience, which investigates attacks against civilians and works with Sudanese civil society organisations as well as the United Nations fact-finding mission to support evidence gathering and accountability, so that, one day, justice will be served.
