May I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s words about the shocking Afghan data breach under the previous Government, which was kept secret for three years?
He will have our support if he decides to pursue a public inquiry.
I know that the Prime Minister will agree that the shocking rise of antisemitism that we have seen since Hamas’s  7 October  terror attacks has no place in our society.
British Jews should not have to live in fear of hatred, racism and abuse on our streets or online.
A new report from the Board of Deputies’ commission on antisemitism, chaired by Lord Mann and Dame Penny Mordaunt, has set out 10 recommendations to tackle this appalling scourge.
Will the Prime Minister study this report, and will his Government respond to it in full?
Yes, we will.
We must fight antisemitism wherever we find it, as we must fight all hate offences, crimes and incidents wherever we find them.
