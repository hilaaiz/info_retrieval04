I thank my hon.
Friend for his spotlight on this issue.
The UK condemns the growing body of evidence of serious atrocities being committed against civilians in Sudan: the escalation of violence;  the killing of civilians; the sexual assault of women; and the restriction of humanitarian access.
That is why the Foreign Secretary visited the Sudan-Chad border to raise awareness of the conflict in Sudan and its impact on neighbouring countries.
He spoke directly to Sudanese refugees, including to survivors, who shared harrowing stories of sexual violence and torture.
The Minister for Africa, for whom this is probably the highest priority area, hosted an event with his Dutch and Swiss counterparts to discuss the alarming rates of conflict-related sexual violence in Sudan and the inadequacy of current responses, and we will redouble our efforts following this urgent question to ensure that we follow that up.
