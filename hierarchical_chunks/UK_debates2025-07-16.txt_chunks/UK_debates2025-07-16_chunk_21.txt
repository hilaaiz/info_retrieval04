The Prime Minister says that he is not going to write the Budget, but his Chancellor is on the front of the Daily Mirror talking about what she is going to do on taxes, so why can he not do the same in the Chamber?
I asked him about pension contributions.
The truth is that he does not want to talk about pension contributions.
It is all right for the Prime Minister, because he has his own special law to stop his personal pension from being taxed.
But let us be honest: this is really about choices.
My party knows that there is an alternative to tax rises: cutting spending—something that the Government are too scared, or perhaps too weak, to do.
We offered to work with him to reform welfare and make meaningful savings, but his refusal sent a signal and now the cost of borrowing is rising.
The Budget is in November, which is months away and the markets may not wait.
What will the Prime Minister be doing over the summer to get a grip on the cost of borrowing?
The Conservatives left the most incredible mess in the economy, and now they think that they can lecture others.
Just last week their chairman said that they had done the necessary apologising for the 14 years of failure.
I did not hear an apology for the lowest living standards in living history.
I did not hear an apology for the £22 billion black hole.
I did not hear an apology for the Liz Truss mini-Budget.
Maybe the right hon.
Lady would like to stand up and make that apology now.
