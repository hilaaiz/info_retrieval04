The Secretary of State was asked— What discussions she has had with the Welsh Government on the future of nuclear power in Wales.
The UK Labour Government have announced the largest nuclear building programme in a generation, investing £14.2 billion in Sizewell C and selecting Rolls-Royce SMR to build the UK’s first small modular reactors.
The memorandum of understanding between the Welsh Government and Sizewell C Consortium could bring £900 million-worth of jobs into the Welsh nuclear supply chain.
The Government also recognise Wylfa as one of the UK’s top sites for future nuclear development.
