The Prime Minister will never know exactly how much it meant to victims of the troubles in Northern Ireland, from right across society, when he came, looked them in their eyes and promised them that no murderer would be immune from prosecution.
Can he tell us when he last spoke to the Taoiseach about the shared approach to this issue, and will he recommit today to those victims, to ensure that no murderer will be seen to be above the law?
This is a really important issue, and can I begin by saying that I have a profound respect and debt to our veterans who served?
This is a complicated issue and we have to get it right.
Veterans are at risk because of the false promises of the last Government.
Let us be clear: the last Government made a false promise of immunity that does not exist.
It was unlawful, it was struck down, and it was undeliverable.
Their failed legacy Act leaves veterans exposed with no settled process.
We will create a secure, transparent system that protects veterans from unjustified persecution and gives victims, families and survivors the confidence they need in the process.
