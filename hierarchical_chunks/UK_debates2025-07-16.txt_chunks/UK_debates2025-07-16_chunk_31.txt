I com-mend the Prime Minister on his work to tackle the arbitrary detention of British citizens abroad and warmly welcome the creation of a special envoy.
He will know of the anguish of the families of Jimmy Lai, Ryan Cornelius, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, Jagtar Singh Johal and others.
Can the Prime Minister tell us when he anticipates the appointment of the envoy will happen?
Will they have real powers, like their counterparts in Canada and the United States, to help bring our people home?
