The Secretary of State was asked— What plans she has to reform the provision of sixth-form education.
This Government are focused on enhancing and spreading opportunity and growing our economy.
We will ensure that a high quality range of post-16 qualifications is available to sixth forms, through the independent curriculum and assessment review—which is well under way—and through the continued roll-out of T-levels.
In Spelthorne we have six secondary schools, only two of which provide A-levels; the rest are middle schools taking pupils only up to GCSE level.
There have been plans in the past to increase sixth-form provision in Spelthorne, but they have been in abeyance for two years.
Will the Minister please agree to meet me, so that we can work out what is causing this blockage and unlock the opportunity to which she has just referred?
Obviously many things needed attention because of the last Government, and many things were not accomplished, but I am sure that my noble Friend Baroness Smith of Malvern will be willing to meet the hon.
Member to discuss his concerns.
In my constituency there is no A-level provision.
Some students have told me that they have to travel for hours just to study, and others consider this a barrier to continuing at school at all.
Will my hon.
Friend work with me to bring A-levels back to Knowsley?
