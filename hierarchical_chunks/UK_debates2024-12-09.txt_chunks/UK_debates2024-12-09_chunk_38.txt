It is good to see the Government’s recommitment to the importance of local plans.
In July this year, Milton Keynes city council went through the important process of developing a local plan.
During the election campaign, the former Prime Minister,  the right hon.
Member for Richmond and Northallerton (Rishi Sunak) , visited my home town and described the development of a local plan as “reckless”.
Will the Minister reassure us that this Government do not believe that local plans are reckless, but consider them necessary for the sustainable delivery of the homes that the country needs?
