I thank my hon.
Friend for that question, and I absolutely agree with him.
We have a local-plan-led planning system, in which fewer than a third of areas have an up-to-date local plan, and that is unsustainable.
We are absolutely determined to drive towards universal local plan coverage.
The measures on which we are consulting—and I emphasise that this is a working paper; we are seeking views, and hon.
Members are more than welcome to submit theirs as we refine our proposals—will reinforce and support the plan-led system by ensuring that officer and member time is focused on the applications where that is most needed.
Communities can have confidence that once they have an up-to-date local plan, it can be decided what to build, and where, in accordance with the wishes of local communities and the wider national planning policy framework.
