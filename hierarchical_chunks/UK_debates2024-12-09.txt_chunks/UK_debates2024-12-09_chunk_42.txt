My hon.
Friend is absolutely right that there are good examples of training across the country.
Hon.
Members seemed to indicate earlier that they thought that mandatory training for councillors was in place.
It is not in place.
We know there are good examples out there, but provision is inconsistent, and we think that we need to take forward mandatory training to ensure that all councillors have the necessary knowledge to make the best decisions on individual applications.
On my hon.
Friend’s point about trading of land, she is absolutely right.
There is far too much speculative development in this country.
We have a dysfunctional land market.
Again, I come back to the importance of up-to-date local plans.
It is through up-to-date local plans that communities have the ability to shape development in their area in the best possible way in accordance with their wishes.
On build-out more generally, we are considering what options might be available to us to ensure that the build-out of consented sites goes forward, alongside our new homes accelerator, which was announced a few months back.
Until September this year, I was a proud elected member of Stockport council.
I made decisions on planning, because in Stockport we decide at ward level what is appropriate for each ward.
If I understand the Government’s suggestions correctly, the power to decide for ourselves has been taken away from Stockport council.
Could the Minister confirm my understanding?
I am afraid to say that the hon.
Lady’s understanding is not correct.
I encourage her to read the working paper.
It is a working paper, and we are seeking initial views on a national scheme of delegation.
There are three options in the working paper.
I look forward to her submitting her views in full, and I will happily consider them.
