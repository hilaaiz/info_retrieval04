As the Housing and Planning Minister will be aware, both Dacorum borough council and Three Rivers district council in my constituency are Lib Dem-controlled; Three Rivers has been for over 20 years.
Both councils do not have an up-to-date local plan.
Can the Minister advise the House about what would happen if the Government imposed a local plan on an authority?
Would those decisions be delegated to officers?
If so, the process would have no democratic mandate at all.
We have not outlined any proposals in the working paper that relate to call-ins or the takeover of local plans from the centre.
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right, though, that Ministers already have powers to take over a local plan in extremis; they have not been used before.
We are more than willing to use all the powers at our disposal to ensure that we have up-to-date local plan coverage.
If there are local authorities out there—I say this very candidly and openly to the House—that resist the changes that we are trying to make and take no steps towards putting an up-to-date local plan in place, we will consider using all the powers at our disposal.
It is through local plans that we will drive sustainable housing supply in the years to come.
