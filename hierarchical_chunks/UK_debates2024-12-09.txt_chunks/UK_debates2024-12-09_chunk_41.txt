I welcome the mandatory training.
As a former chair of a planning committee, I know that training was part of the process that we implemented, so it is good to see that it will be delivered across the board.
We approved some developments multiple times on the same site, such as a maternity block in my constituency, which was then flipped and sold on to another developer.
Could the Minister please tell us what steps are being taken to account for land banking or flipping sites via developers?
