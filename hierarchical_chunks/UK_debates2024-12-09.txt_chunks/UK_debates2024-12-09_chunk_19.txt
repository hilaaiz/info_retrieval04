Friend for really pushing me on this issue, and for explaining the situation so well.
I acknowledge to him and the sector the uncertainty and difficulties in this area.

I fully appreciate that colleges need time to plan their provision, and that students need time to plan what courses they will take.
We are working as quickly as possible to conclude the review, and we will publish the outcomes before the end of the year.
