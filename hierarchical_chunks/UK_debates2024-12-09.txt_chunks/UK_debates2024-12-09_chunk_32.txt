I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that set of questions, and I am glad that he personally welcomes housing.
When it comes to his party, on this issue, as on so many others, the view you get depends on what part of the country you are in.
We are absolutely committed to increasing the delivery of social and affordable homes.
We have taken decisive early steps to bring that forward, including by securing an additional £500 million in the Budget for the affordable homes programme.
