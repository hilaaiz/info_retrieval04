I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
He has huge expertise in this area from his time as Chair of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, and he is absolutely right.
We have been clear that the best way for local communities to shape the decisions about what to build, where, is through local plans.
It is appalling that we have inherited a situation in which less than a third of places are covered by up-to-date local plans.

If  the hon.
Member for Hamble Valley (Paul Holmes)  will allow me, what we are looking at, in the changes that we are consulting on, in a soft form, through the working paper, is how we can ensure that planning committees make decisions on the most significant and controversial applications, including those that are not in line with local plans, rather than spending their time poring over decisions that have been made in an allocation framework through the local plan process.
Hon.
Members will see in the working paper that one of our proposals, for a national scheme for delegation, would require all applications that are in accordance with the development plan to be determined by officers.
That will free up committees to focus on controversial development that is out of step with the local plan that elected members and officers put forward after consultation with their communities.
