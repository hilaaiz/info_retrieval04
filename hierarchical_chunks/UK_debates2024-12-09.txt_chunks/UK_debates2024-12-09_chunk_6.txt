As I said, schools have until  20 December  to apply to take part in the early adopters scheme.
That is because we want to ensure that we establish the scheme, and understand the benefits and challenges, before we roll it out across the country.
We are determined to get this right, and we will build on the early adopters to deliver universal free breakfast clubs in every primary school in England.
While the children’s wellbeing Bill proposes statutory breakfast programmes, research from the Food Foundation shows that such clubs are more likely to benefit wealthier families because of the convenience that they offer working parents.
By contrast, offering children free school lunches is known to help iron out inequalities.
Some 800,000 children in poverty are ineligible for free school meals, and more than 200,000 eligible children are not registered.
Does the Secretary of State agree that expanding school lunches, and implementing auto-enrolment for free school meals for all children, would be an effective and equitable approach to tackling food insecurity and supporting our children’s health and academic performance?
The hon.
Lady is right to identify the importance of ensuring that all our children have healthy, balanced and nutritious diets, including at school.
However, she will know that the situation that this Government inherited from the previous Government means that we have had to take some very tough decisions.
We will set out more in due course as we set out legislation that we promised in the King’s Speech.
I slightly take issue with some of the evidence she points to, because the evidence on breakfast clubs demonstrates wider benefits for all children in attainment, wellbeing and overall performance.
