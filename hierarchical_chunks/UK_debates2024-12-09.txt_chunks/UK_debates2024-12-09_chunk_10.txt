I thank the hon.
Lady for her recognition of the additional funding.
We expect the funding to create thousands of new places, particularly in mainstream schools but also in special schools and other specialist settings.
We will confirm the allocations for individual local authorities in the spring, as they know best how to invest in their local area.
We are keeping the free schools programme under review and will provide that confirmation in due course.
