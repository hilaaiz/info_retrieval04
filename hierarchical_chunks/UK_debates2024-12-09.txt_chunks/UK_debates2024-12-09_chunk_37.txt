I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that question.
We have to take steps to fix the ailing planning system that we have inherited.
It is failing on a number of fronts, and trust and confidence in it is at a record low.
As for the assertion that we have heard, for all the hyperbole from Conservative Members, we are not seizing power from the centre.
We are saying to local communities, “Put an up-to-date local plan in place, and when sites are allocated through that local plan, you can be confident that they will be built out in the manner that you have specified.
It is through local plans that you get your control.”
However, when it comes to the decisions on specific sites, let us ensure, if we can, that elected members are directed towards the most significant and controversial applications, as opposed to some of the minor applications that involve technical reserved matters questions.
I have sat on a planning committee; I do not know whether the right hon.
Gentleman has.
In the case of those applications, the initial decision can be re-litigated and revisited, rather than the technical issues being put to us.
Let us ensure that those decisions sit in the hands of trained planning professionals, and get planning committee member time focused on the applications that deserve it.
