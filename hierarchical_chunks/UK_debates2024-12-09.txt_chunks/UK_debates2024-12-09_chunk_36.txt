There is nothing more controversial than Governments seeking to bypass local democracy.
I saw that with the desire of the last Government to bypass local democracy by imposing a special development order on RAF Scampton, and I see it now with the many applications to build solar farms that are ostensibly national infrastructure projects.
The present planning system was largely created by the Labour Government, and has stood the test of time.
Can the Minister assure me that whatever he decides finally, we will not degrade local democracy?
It is essential that people join a council, and join a planning committee, knowing that they have real powers and are not under the cosh of Government, or plans imposed by Government.
