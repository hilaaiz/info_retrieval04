I welcome this Government’s ambition to ensure that 40,000 extra children are school ready every year.
However, at schools such as West End school in Oswaldtwistle in my constituency, there are no extra classrooms to make extra nursery provision available.
Will the Minister consider capital funding to ensure that lots of primary schools have the opportunity to extend high quality nursery provision?
