I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his very good question.
It is important that kinship carers, as well as the children they are looking after, have the support they need.
Through the process of family group decision making, families will come together to have conversations about how best to support children in kinship care.
Respite and other related matters will be discussed to ensure that the right provision is in place.
This Government are committed to getting it right for children, especially where the previous Government failed.
