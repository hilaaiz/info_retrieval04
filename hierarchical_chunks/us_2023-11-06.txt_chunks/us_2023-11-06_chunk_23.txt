Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Councilwoman Wendy Pate for all that she has done for the City of Trenton.
Both in her position on the city council and in her private life, Wendy has worked tirelessly to make Trenton and the Downriver area healthier and more sustainable for future generations.
I thank Wendy.
