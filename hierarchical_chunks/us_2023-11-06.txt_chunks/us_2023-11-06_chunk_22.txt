Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wendy Pate, City Councilwoman for the City of Trenton, on the occasion of her retirement.
The dedication and love that she has shown to her community during her tenure is worthy of commendation.
Wendy is a lifelong Downriver resident, and she and her husband, Carl, have lived in Trenton for the last 19 years.
Together they have two children, Daphne and Carl III.
Her family has been volunteering in community activities for years, including working with the local Boy Scouts and events put on by the Trenton Business Association, the Trenton Educational Foundation, and the local Student Council.
Wendy is a retired high school math teacher and MEA-retired member.
She served as MEA-RA, class congress sponsor, and staff morale committee chair.
Wendy was elected to the Trenton City Council in 2019.
She was a member of the City Beautiful Commission and is a member of the Trail Town Advisory Committee.
She also co-founded a community action group, the DCC Coal Grant Riverfront Community Group, whose mission is to support the Trenton Coast Resiliency Master Plan and engage residents to support sustainable uses for Trenton's waterfront and revitalize their downtown.
Wendy also spearheaded the project to paint murals on West Jefferson Ave in order to beautify a main intersection in Trenton as well as celebrate their 2021 designation as a Pure Michigan Trail Town.
