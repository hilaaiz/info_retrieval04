Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Ms. Maria Gamboa, an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Interpreter in the Okaloosa County School District.
As an employee with more than 25 years of service, 
Ms. Gamboa worked in Exceptional Student Education (ESE) at Crestview High School for 13 years before spending the past 14 years as an ESOL Interpreter at Pryor Middle School and now Choctawhatchee High School.
At Choctaw, 
Ms. Gamboa offers academic support both in the classroom and in the afterschool tutoring program.
She provides the right level school and taking advantage of the opportunities which lead to graduation.
Ms. Gamboa has also assisted in implementing a monthly English Language Learners (ELL) Parent Information Night to better inform families about high school life.
Furthermore, she assisted in creating a weekly language acquisition class for any ELL family that wants to strengthen their English skills.
According to her principal, Michelle Heck, 
Ms. Gamboa has ``earned the respect, admiration, and love of our Choctaw staff because of her kind-hearted self, always making time to lend an ear to any and all who need someone to listen, bountiful amounts of patience and her endless generosity to our students, parents, and staff members alike.''
