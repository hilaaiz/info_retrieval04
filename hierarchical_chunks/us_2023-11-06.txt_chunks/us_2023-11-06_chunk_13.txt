Ms. BOEBERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Bosq, an exceptional restaurant in Aspen, Colorado, for being awarded the coveted Michelin star.
This honor puts Bosq among the finest restaurants not only in Colorado, but in the entire world.
Bosq joins the ranks of just over 200 restaurants in America to have this great honor.
The Michelin star represents years of hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to culinary excellence.
Michelin stars are a hallmark of fine dining and coveted honor by many of the world's top chefs and restaurant patrons.
Not easy to obtain, the stars are awarded to restaurants that are the absolute best in a given city.
Restaurants gain immense prestige and exposure as a result of this honor.
An Aspen native, Barclay Dodge and his wife Molly have created a dining experience that is nothing short of exceptional.
Bosq offers four, five and nine course menus.
Bosq is the only restaurant in Colorado's Third Congressional District to earn the Michelin star.
Bosq is set apart not only by its exceptional cuisine but its commitment to our Colorado community.
The restaurant collaborates with local farmers and ranchers to ensure that the food is as fresh as it is delicious.
They embody the very best of Colorado excellence and have brought a world-class dining experience to Colorado's Third Congressional District.
Bosq is a beacon of what can be achieved when talent, dedication, and love for one's community come together, and I am incredibly proud to represent this outstanding establishment.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Bosq for being awarded the Michelin star and redefining culinary excellence in Colorado's Third Congressional District.
