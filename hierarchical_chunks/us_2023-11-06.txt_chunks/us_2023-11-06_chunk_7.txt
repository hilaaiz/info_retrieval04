Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, FMC Fort Worth Warden, Freddy Garrido.
Warden Garrido has spent almost 30 years in the Bureau of Prisons and is retiring on October 31, 2023.
During his impressive career, Warden Freddy Garrido has served selflessly to promote responsibility and lifelong skills for those incarcerated.
Through his passion for service, Warden Garrido has used his role to give an underserved community hope and a second chance.
Warden Garrido served at various duty stations including, FDC Oakdale, FCI Forrest City, FCC Butner, FMC Lexington, FCC Florence, FCC Victorville, and FCC Beaumont before moving to North Texas at a critical time to provide leadership and direction at FMC Fort Worth.
Those who work closely with him say that his attitude and leadership style make them more empathetic and compassionate in fulfilling their own duties.
During his time at FMC Fort Worth, Warden Garrido has made leadership development and training a priority.
By establishing vocational programs, like a ``second chance cafe'' and HVAC program, the incarcerated have the opportunity to learn valuable life skills to equip them upon their release into society.
I want to congratulate Warden Garrido on his retirement and thank him for his outstanding career of service.
