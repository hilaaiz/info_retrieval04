Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Jason Howard, U.S. Army, Retired, has always been there to lend a helping hand to his fellow citizens and his efforts to make his beloved community a better place has made lasting and positive impacts on the region.
He is a dedicated soldier, devoted public servant, and a fitting recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
SGT Howard has extensive military experience including serving at Fort Cavazos and deployments in both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.
He worked closely with our Kurdish allies and even met with future Iraqi President Jamal Talabani.
His great work didn't go unnoticed as he was awarded a Bronze Star Medal, Army Commendation Medal, and a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and among others.
After retiring from the Army, SGT Howard found his way back to Central Texas.
Fueled by his passion for wanting to serve and lead others, SGT Howard serves as the Alderman for the Village of Salado while giving back to his community through numerous volunteer opportunities.
He pours himself into making Salado a great place to work and call home, all while ensuring that the voices of residents are heard in the halls of government.
His actions reflect the commitment of a devoted public servant.
Once a soldier, always a soldier.
I commend SGT Howard's incredible contributions.
This soldier-forlife's patriotism, citizenship, and commitment to excellence reflect the very best.
I join his colleagues, family, and friends in honoring his career, commending his commitment to public service, and celebrating his outstanding achievements.
