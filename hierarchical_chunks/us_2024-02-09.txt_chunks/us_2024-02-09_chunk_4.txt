Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the career and accomplishments of Ann Marie Miller, a committed advocate for the arts, as she marks the closing of a 28-year career tenure that has shaped the art sector within New Jersey.
Raised in East Brunswick, Ann Marie Miller was inspired by a strong high school arts program to become an art teacher.
She graduated from Moore College of Art and Design with a Bachelor of Science in arts education and taught visual art in both public and private settings.
Her 28-year journey has been nothing short of extraordinary, leaving an indelible mark on the cultural tapestry.
I applaud Ann Marie's dedication and she has most definitely made a significant impact in the arts community.
I wish Ann Marie a peaceful retirement filled with joy, relaxation and cherished moments spent with loved ones.
