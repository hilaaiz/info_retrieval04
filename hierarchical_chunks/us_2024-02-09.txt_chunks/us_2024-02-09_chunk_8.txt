Mr. FULCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Max Clark Black.
Max passed away surrounded by loved ones on November 10, 2023.
He leaves behind a legacy of public service, having served 20 years as a 
Representative in the Idaho State Legislature, where I had the pleasure of serving alongside him.
Max was a dedicated husband of 62 years to Clydene Salmon Black and a loving father to Jeffrey, Gary, and Wendi.
A lifelong learner and passionate historian, Max enjoyed crafting wooden items and was a devoted fan of Boise State University athletics.
Max is survived by his wife, Clydene Salmon Black, children Jeffrey Clyde Black, (Deanna Black), Gary Ernest Black (Kyra Burstedt Black), and Wendi Black Cleverly (Kyle G. Cleverly), 9 grandchildren, and numerous relatives.
He was preceded in death by his parents, sisters Reveau Black and Bonnie Black Edwards, his brothers Keith Ernest Black and Shirl R. Black, his brother-in-law Gordon Eugene Edwards and his sister-in-law Shari Lyn Draper Black, nephews Robert Kim Black, Matthew Shirl Black, and Gregory Dale Kehl.
Max will be remembered not only for his professional achievements, but his unwavering devotion to his faith, family, and community.
His presence will be deeply missed.
