Mr. GOSAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the good work of a Phoenix-based veterans care facility called Phoenix Oasis.
Phoenix Oasis, headed by its Director Anthony Pfeffer, demonstrated its commitment to our veterans and offered key assistance to U.S. VetsPhoenix.
When U.S. Vets lost its lease, but did not yet have a new facility ready, Phoenix Oasis stepped in and allowed U.S. Vets to continue serving veterans.
U.S. Vets stayed and offered services to veterans for months after the lease had expired, and in that way, Phoenix Oasis allowed veterans in need to have continuity of care in a stable and supportive environment.
Indeed, 
Mr. Pfeffer prioritized providing assistance to U.S. Vets notwithstanding the needs of his own program at Phoenix Oasis.
The veterans served by U.S. Vets benefitted tremendously by this compassionate effort and the sacrifices made by Phoenix Oasis and Mr. Pfeffer.
It is commendable that 
Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis take their responsibilities to our veterans so deeply and personally.
It is rare these days to see that level of commitment and I applaud them in so doing.
It is also the 10th anniversary of the founding.
The dedicated staff at Phoenix Oasis have provided a decade of service delivering safe housing and substance abuse treatment services to thousands of veterans during that time.
And they did so with dignity and respect to our veterans.
Our veterans helped America when we needed them.
When our veterans need help, people like 
Mr. Pfeffer and Phoenix Oasis step in.
I thank them on behalf of everyone they have helped in the last decade.
