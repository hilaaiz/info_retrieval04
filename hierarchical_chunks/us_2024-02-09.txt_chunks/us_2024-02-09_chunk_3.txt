Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Mrs. Martha Tice's 100th birthday.
Born on February 11, 1924, Martha hails from the wonderful South Texas town of Sinton in my district.
A retired schoolteacher, she is well known throughout the community for her selfless heart, as the proud matriarch of her loving family, and someone who still takes every opportunity to give back to others.
Martha and her late husband, Henry, raised their two daughters in Sinton and have been blessed with five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
On this truly wonderful occasion, I join her family and the whole Sinton community in wishing Martha Tice a wonderful 100th birthday.
May God continue to bless her and her family in the months and years ahead.
