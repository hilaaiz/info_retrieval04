Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Technical Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for his dedicated and humble service to our Nation in the United States Army.
Frank, a Flint, Michigan, native answered our Nation's call and enlisted in United States Armed Forces in 1952.
Frank served honorably in the Korean War in 1953 with the Armored Cavalry, seeing combat as a Tank Commander and spending 11 months overseas.
He earned the Korean Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal in gallant service to his country.
After returning stateside, Frank was stationed at Camp Carson in Colorado, where he was honorably discharged from the Army on May 5th, 1954.
While overseas, Frank had frequently written to a pen pal, who was serving as a wartime nurse back in Michigan.
Upon his separation from the military, Frank married his beloved pen pal, Mary Lou.
In their 70 years of marriage, they had four children--Tim, Janet, Rebecca and James.
Rebecca and James went on to serve honorably in the Marine Corps themselves.
In addition to their children, Frank and Mary Lou were blessed with five grandchildren, two step-grandchildren, two great-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.
The Pifhers currently reside in Tuscarora Township where they have lived for 34 years.
