Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans have engaged in a cynical and unserious attempt to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas.
Their report to accompany H. Res. 863 resorted to sloppy misrepresentations in an attempt to justify this baseless, political stunt.
For example, the report misquoted Professor Frank Bowman, who testified before the Committee on Homeland Security on January 10, 2024.
Professor Bowman testified that the Constitution did not support the impeachment of Secretary Mayorkas over mere policy differences.
The majority report, however, twists a passage of Professor Bowman's book on impeachment and uses it out of context to suggest policy differences were grounds for impeachment.
Republicans also tried to misrepresent Professor Bowman's writings during the hearing, but they did not afford Professor Bowman an opportunity to explain his work.
I submitted clarifying questions to Professor Bowman to supplement the hearing record, but the majority did not transmit those questions to Professor Bowman before the legislative report was filed in the House.
I include in the Record Professor Bowman's responses to my questions to make the professor's thoughts on impeachment over policy differences abundantly clear, since the Republican majority cannot be bothered to conduct a proper investigation with a complete record.
