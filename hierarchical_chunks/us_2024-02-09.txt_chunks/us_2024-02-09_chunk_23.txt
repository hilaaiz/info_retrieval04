Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank Technical Sergeant Frank L. Pifher for his exemplary service to the United States.
Our gratitude extends to him not only for his courage and humility, but also for his legacy of service that he has passed down to his children and their children.
May God bless Frank and his family.
