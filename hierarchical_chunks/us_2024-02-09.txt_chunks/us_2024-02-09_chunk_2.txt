Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the retirement of James Blanton after his incredible 35 years in law enforcement.
James' journey started in 1989 as a Patrol Sergeant and Criminal Investigator for the Caldwell County Sheriff's Department, where he played an important role in the CAPCO Drug Task Force and solidified his reputation as a trusted law enforcement professional.
His career brought him through a variety of roles, including Investigator for the Bastrop County Sheriff's Department, Deputy for the Comal County Sheriff's Department, and Deputy Constable for Precinct 2 in Hays County.
In each and every assignment, James' integrity and professionalism stood out among his colleagues--leading to a decorated career.
Most notably, James has been awarded with the Master Peace Officer classification by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, recognizing his excellence in the field.
But more than any award or career achievement, James is known for his character, and his respect for all individuals he encountered during his service.
His unwavering commitment to serving his community marks truly a job well done, and a life well lived.
As James embarks on this new chapter of his life, it is my honor to recognize his remarkable service and dedication.
I join the communities James has served in thanking him for his years of service.
May God bless him and his family in the months and years ahead.
