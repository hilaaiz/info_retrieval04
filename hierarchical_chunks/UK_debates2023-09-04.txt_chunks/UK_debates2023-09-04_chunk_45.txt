I welcome the resignation of the Chief Constable.
It is a pity it took so long.
I think he saw that the writing was on the wall when he knew a motion was going to the Policing Board calling for his resignation, and so he should.
He has lost the confidence of officers, not just because of this data breach but because he was prepared to throw two junior officers to the wolves in order to placate Sinn Féin, and it is right that he should go.
