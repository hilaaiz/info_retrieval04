Last week I met the citizens advice bureau in Cheshire west and Chester, which informed me that 75% of those who appeal their PIP assessments win.
Why does the Minister not get it right in the first place, and what is he doing, at pace, to address that?
I am very appreciative of citizens advice bureaux around the country for all the work they do in supporting constituents in each of our constituencies.
In the interests of time, I will just refer the hon.
Gentleman back to the points I made earlier about the steps we are taking.
The recent changes to access to means-tested benefits for those in receipt of vaccine damage payments are very welcome, and I thank the Minister for his engagement.
Will he join me in paying tribute to those who campaigned for that change in the law, including my constituent Sheila Ward?
I pay full credit to Mrs Ward and also to my hon.
Friend.
I read with interest the Stoke Sentinel report on this particular issue.
There is a genuine change to be made, there has been a long-standing campaign, and all parties should be pleased with the outcome reached.
In all honesty, I probably ought to declare an interest, but pensioners living in Edinburgh and Glasgow do not face the same sorts of increases as pensioners  living in a remote and faraway constituency such as mine when it comes to living costs such as running a car, buying groceries and heating the house.
Will the Government look at ways of targeting these particularly hard-hit people?
We of course look at particularly targeting harder-hit pensioners through pension credit, and the Pensions Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Sevenoaks (Laura Trott) , has done a huge amount to promote that.
But we are always open to receiving further ideas and having discussions, and if the hon.
Gentleman would like to come forward with further ideas, we will certainly look at them.
I have been contacted many times each month by parents left seriously out of pocket by their ex-spouses’ failure to pay child maintenance owed.
What steps are the Government taking to ensure parents are able to receive their child maintenance on time so that many families are not left subjected to coercive control by their ex-spouses or left out of pocket?
