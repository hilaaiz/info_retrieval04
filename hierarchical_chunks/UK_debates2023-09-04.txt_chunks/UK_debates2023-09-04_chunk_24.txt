I very much welcome the Court of Appeal’s decision in July, meaning that the national disability strategy is lawful.
The Government are now able to continue with the important work of implementing that long-term strategy, and I can confirm that my hon.
Friend the Minister for Disabled People will shortly come forward with further details of some of the individual commitments we will be making around that strategy.
