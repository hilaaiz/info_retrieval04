I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the work he is doing in his constituency.
I assure him that that is exactly what the Government are doing.
We recently launched an “invitation to claim” trial, which has been rolled out in 10 constituencies and is using housing  benefit data to target those who might also be eligible for pension credit.
We will report back on the results of that trial later this year.
