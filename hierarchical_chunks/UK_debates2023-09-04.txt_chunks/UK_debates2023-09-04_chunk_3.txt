The Minister talks about the UK having a reputation for allowing legitimate businesses to thrive, but we are here this evening to challenge the other reputation that has built up over the years.
The UK has now become a hub for dirty money, which is funnelled through the UK’s financial system by an army of enablers.
This Bill is an opportunity to dam that flow and to stop this dirty money, but as the excellent “Catch me if you can: Gaps in the Register of Overseas Entities” report, published by the London School of Economics and CAGE Warwick, says, “there is no point building a dam halfway across a river.”
Without closing the loopholes and the gaps, that is what this Government are doing.
