I thank the hon.
Lady for making those points.
Child maintenance payments keep about 160,000 children out of poverty each year and are absolutely  vital.
They play a key role in ensuring both parents play their part in supporting their children whether or not they live with them.
If the hon.
Lady has particular cases or interests, I am happy to meet her.
