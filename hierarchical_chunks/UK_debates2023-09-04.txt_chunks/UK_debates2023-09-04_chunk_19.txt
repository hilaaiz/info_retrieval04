The Secretary of State’s comments suggesting that unemployed over-50s should consider becoming delivery riders clearly show that the Government are failing to help older workers into stable employment.
Rather than glorifying precarious work in the gig economy, will he commit to rolling out a plan that gives older workers the dignity, respect and support they deserve to rejoin the workforce?
I think it is very unfortunate when any Member of this House looks down on a certain category of job that is employing hundreds of thousands of people perfectly satisfactorily.
In fact, in that interview I said: “I think as a department we shouldn’t be prescriptive,”— referring to the over-50s— “so we’re not here to start pontificating about whether people should or should not go back into work”.
Hopefully that has put the record straight.
We are doing a huge amount to support those over 50 who have retired prematurely, including the midlife MOT, returnerships and the tax changes we have made around pensions,  and we will continue to support people.
That is why we are seeing those inactivity rates above 50 declining quite strongly.
Sickness and sick pay are an anchor when it comes to getting people back into work, as well as helping to grow the economy.
That is why the Centre for Progressive Change produced an excellent report that has support from Members across this House.
Will my right hon.
Friend therefore meet me and my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) , who has also supported it, to look at the proposals made, so that we can really help to improve sick pay—something that has the backing of 75% of British businesses?
I would be very happy for either myself or the relevant Minister to meet my hon.
Friend or my right hon.
