We all want to see both unemployment and economic inactivity as low as possible, but the Office for National Statistics, quoted approvingly by the Minister a few minutes ago, reports that this spring’s quarter showed a large fall in the number of people moving from economic inactivity into employment, and that the net movement from employment to economic inactivity was the largest since the covid autumn of 2020.
Given that this is the Department’s priority, what assessment has he made of why this is going wrong?
My assessment of economic inactivity is that it is falling; it has fallen by around 350,000 or more since its peak during the pandemic.
That leaves us below the average rate of economic inactivity across the G7, the European Union and the OECD.
We are making real progress and will continue to do so.
What estimate his Department has made of the number and proportion of unsuccessful benefit decisions that were overturned on appeal in the last 12 months.
Our aim is to make the right decision as early as possible in a claim.
In 2022-23, there were 80,000 social security and child support appeal tribunal hearings, with 50,000 overturned.
We recognise that the overturn rate at appeal is high.
However, the numbers must be seen in the context of overall decisions.
The majority of appeal tribunal hearings relate to PIP.
Since PIP was introduced, 8% of initial decisions have been appealed and 4% overturned at a hearing.
