May I say that I look forward to working with the Secretary of State in the interests of peace, prosperity and progress in Northern Ireland?
The release of the names and workplaces of thousands of PSNI officers and staff was doubtless inadvertent, but its consequences could not be more serious.
That has now been recognised by the chief constable, Simon Byrne, who is resigning—I join the Secretary of State in thanking him for his service.
Those who serve in the PSNI confront great risks every day in their job to keep the public safe, and we thank them.
But they already knew that dissident republicans were targeting them and their families, and now they know that those who would do them harm have this list.
The damage to morale and confidence should not be underestimated.
They are asking urgently, “What will be done to reassure and protect us?”
Does the Secretary of State agree that the inquiry needs to be completed as quickly as possible?
Can he confirm that he will approve the appointment of the new chief constable in the absence of a Justice Minister in Northern Ireland?
Does he intend to review the operation of the Northern Ireland Policing Board and how it functions?
Does he recognise that there will be additional costs in protecting staff, as well as responding to potential civil claims?
There were already great pressures on the Northern Ireland policing budget, and the cuts it now faces will, in the words of the PSNI, leave the service “smaller…less visible, less accessible and less responsive”.
Finally, the whole House wants to ensure that the staff get the support, protection and reassurance they need, but to succeed in doing that we need leadership from the Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland, to get the Assembly and the Executive up and running again as quickly as possible.
