The right hon.
Gentleman asked about the inquiry.
Yes, it needs to be expedited.
A timetable has been set up by the Policing Board, which is independent, and I believe that it reports in three months’ time.
It is quite a fundamental inquiry, and I hope in that time it will be able to bring all the answers required to the table.
He asked about the appointment of a future chief constable; if the institutions of the Executive and the Minister for Justice are not present, we will have to pass secondary legislation in this place to allow that to happen.
All that depends on the Policing Board going about its business and recruitment—I believe that is very much a rubber stamp of its work.
The right hon.
Gentleman asked about the Policing Board and reform.
I spoke to a number of board members before the resignation of the chief constable, and they all know that the spotlight is on them and how they deal with this.
I would like to wait and see how they discharge their duties over the course of the next few weeks before I commit to reform, because there are good people there who have the ability to do the job.
Finally, on the budget, which I mentioned in my answer, the right hon.
Gentleman forgot to mention that the Information Commissioner will come out with a decent fine for the data breach.
We will have to take a whole host of things into account.
As and when they materialise, we will look at them.
