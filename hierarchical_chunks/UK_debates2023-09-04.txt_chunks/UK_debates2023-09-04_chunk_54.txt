On  18 August , as the whole House is aware, Letby was convicted of the murder of seven babies and the attempted murder of six others.
She committed these crimes while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.
As Mr Justice Goss said as he sentenced her to 14 whole life orders, this was a “cruel, calculated and cynical campaign of child murder” and a “gross breach of the trust all citizens place in those who work in the medical and caring professions.”
I think the whole House will agree it is right that she spends the rest of her life behind bars.
I cannot begin to imagine the hurt and suffering that these families went through, and I know from my conversations with them last week that the trial brought these emotions back to the surface.
Concerningly, that was exacerbated by the fact the families discovered new information about events concerning their children during the course of the trial.
