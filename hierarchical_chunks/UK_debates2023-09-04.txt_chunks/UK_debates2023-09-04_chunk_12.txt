It might be hard to imagine on a sunny day like today, but winter is just around the corner.
The reality for many worried pensioners in my constituency is that this winter there will be a choice between heating and eating.
We have a Government who are tiptoeing around the real issues while our constituents struggle to make ends meet.
When will the Government make a real plan to tackle the cost of living crisis and implement meaningful action to help thousands of pensioners in poverty?
With respect to the hon.
Lady, that is exactly what we are doing.
That is why we have put the cost of living payments in place, which are worth £900 to all those on pension credit, and why a cost of living pensioner payment worth £300 is coming out in the winter.
All the while the Labour Mayor of London is charging pensioners £12.50 when they want to drive to the hospital.
Clearly, there is a stigma attached to claiming pension credit, because this is on poorer pensioners who desperately need the money.
What action can my hon.
Friend take to remove that stigma?
My constituency has recently been added to the pilot, and I am looking forward to its results, because elderly people deserve to get the money they need to fulfil their lives.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right on that, and I praise all the work he has done in his constituency on pension credit.
We are trying to do exactly what he sets out: encourage as many people as possible to claim this important benefit, at a time when they are going to need it most.
I note that across the House good work has been done in individual constituencies.
