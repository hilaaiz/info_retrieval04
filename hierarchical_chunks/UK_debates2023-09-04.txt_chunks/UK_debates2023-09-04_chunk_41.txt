I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He talks about the additional security funding that the Government put in.
The UK Government’s contribution to the financial year 2022-23 is £32 million in this space.
The cost implications of the PSNI response are rightly being discussed with the Department of Justice.
Any additional asks for funding would come through an established process.
While it would not be right for me to pre-empt that, the Government are clear that security is paramount.
Our focus remains currently on the asks that have been made of us, which are to provide specialist support and expertise in response to the latest assessment.
