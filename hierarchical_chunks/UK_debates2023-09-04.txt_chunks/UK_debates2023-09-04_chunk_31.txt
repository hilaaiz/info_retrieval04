I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his urgent question.
As you know, Mr Speaker, I was keen to do a statement on the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s data breach on  8 August , so I am pleased to have this opportunity.
I am also happy to provide an update to the House on this matter.
However, since writing this answer, and as the right hon.
Gentleman will know, news of the PSNI’s Chief Constable’s resignation has broken over the past few minutes.
I thank Simon Byrne for his years of public service.
The right hon.
Gentleman will know that the appointment of a new Chief Constable is a matter for the Northern Ireland Policing Board, and I will continue to liaise with the senior management team of PSNI while the process of appointing a successor gets under way.
The PSNI continues to have my and the Government’s full support in responding to the data breach, and we are focused on providing appropriate and proportionate data and expertise.
