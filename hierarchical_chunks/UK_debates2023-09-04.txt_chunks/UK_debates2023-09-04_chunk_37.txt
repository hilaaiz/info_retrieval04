I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman to his place and look forward to working with him.
As I mentioned outside the Chamber, I will happily brief him on any aspects and will arrange technical briefings from my officials so that he can be brought up to speed quickly.
I would like to put on record my thanks to the former shadow Secretary of State,  the hon.
Member for Hove (Peter Kyle) , who is present, for the way he went about his business and for the very co-operative way we dealt with business.
I appreciate it and wish him well as we move forward.
