The Minister seems to forget that the two-child limit impacts people who are on in-work benefits.
The only exemption to the two-child limit is if a woman can prove that her third or a subsequent child has been born as a result of rape.
How many people has the Minister’s Department asked to prove that they have been raped in order to get an exemption to the two-child limit?
We do not use the language used by the hon.
Gentleman, but I will of course write to him.
I am disappointed that the Minister does not know, because his Department has made 2,590 women prove and relive the ordeal of being raped, simply to get that state support, but given that the Labour party and the Conservatives support the two-child policy and rape clause, does it give him comfort to know that when the “Ghost of George Osborne Future” comes into office, his legacy in promoting astronomical child poverty rates will be safe in the hands of the Blairites on the Labour Benches?
I can only repeat that, compared with 2009-10, there are 400,000 fewer children in absolute poverty after housing costs.
What recent progress his Department has made on tackling benefit fraud.
We continue to bear down on fraud and error.
It decreased by 10% in 2022-23.
There is of course still more to be done, which is why we are investing £900 million to reduce that figure still further by £2.4 billion by 2024-25.
During the pandemic, the Government rightly got support out to people as quickly as possible, but that inevitably meant that errors were made and some people took advantage of the situation.
What is being done to clamp down on fraud and errors in universal credit?
A huge amount, including the targeted case review, which over the next five years will review hundreds of thousands of universal credit claims to look for fraud and error.
Of course, we use emerging new technologies for that purpose as well.
