I absolutely support the principle that those who carry out benefit fraud must be made accountable, but what I find in my office—I think that others in the Chamber will probably find this as well—is that many people have filled in an application form, document or review and inadvertently ticked the wrong box.
By doing so, they have left themselves in a very difficult position where they find that they have to make a repayment.
Sometimes people need help at the initial stages to ensure that they get it right.
What can be done to help those people so that they do not get into debt that they did not expect to be in?
