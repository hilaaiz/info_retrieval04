If the hon.
Gentleman will forgive me, I am very wary of mentioning security matters for those at highest risk, so I will not do so.
There is a continuing process to make sure PSNI has both the budget and the process available to ensure that extra security measures can be taken, and to ensure there is extra training and conversations to reassure people.
It will be a little while before we see much upward pressure on budgets, and I will then happily update the House.
