A constituent of mine has a small work pension, rendering her ineligible for pension credit yet still struggling to get by.
Another constituent who is 80 and misses out on pension credit by just £10 has contacted me several times angry and hurt that he now has to pay for his TV licence.
Will Ministers review the rules on pension credit, because ineligibility for so many of the passported benefits leaves many of my constituents out of pocket?
They want to be eligible for it but are not.
Obviously this is without looking at the individual case, but it is important to note that the threshold has gone up significantly, so it is worth questioning whether the hon.
Lady’s constituents are now eligible.
If not, applications to the household support fund can be helpful, and local councils may be able to offer housing benefit support.
If there is an individual case that she would like to write to me about, I am happy to respond.
That completes the questions.
Those who wish to leave should do so.
Before I call  the right hon.
Member for Lagan Valley (Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson)  to ask the urgent question, I wish to make a short statement about the sub judice resolution.
The matter of the data breach is not sub judice, but I have been advised that an individual has been charged with terrorism-related offences following the data breach.
While I am content to waive the sub judice resolution in this and other proceedings to allow simple reference to the fact of the arrest, any further discussion of the circumstances of that case would not be in order.
(Urgent Question): To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the breach of security and data protection at the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
