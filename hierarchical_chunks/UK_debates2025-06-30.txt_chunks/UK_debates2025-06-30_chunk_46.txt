Our objective here is as it always has been, and I am grateful to my hon.
Friend and others for all their engagement with us.
We are making these changes because we have to both get more people who can work into work and try to begin to focus this really important benefit on those with higher needs so that it is sustainable for the future.
That will not affect existing PIP claimants, who will have their incomes protected; that is a very positive change that we are making.
The Timms review will look at those descriptors and the points that are allocated as part of a much wider assessment, because we have to ensure that this benefit lasts for the future so that it is always there for those in greatest need.
