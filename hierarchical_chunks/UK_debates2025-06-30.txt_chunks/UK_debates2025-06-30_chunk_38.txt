I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend for her statement.
I absolutely agree that we must reform our social security system; under the previous Government, it neither supported nor protected disabled people.
I am also very supportive of the principles that the Government have set out.
May I query some of the points that the Secretary of State has raised, however, particularly about a new PIP assessment process under the PIP review that my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Social Security and Disability will be undertaking?
The Secretary of State said that the four-point requirement will not apply until November 2026, and that the review will report in November 2026, but surely the PIP review should determine the new process.
If this is being truly co-produced with disabled people and their organisations, the review should determine the new process, the new points and the new descriptors.
We should not predetermine it as four points now.
