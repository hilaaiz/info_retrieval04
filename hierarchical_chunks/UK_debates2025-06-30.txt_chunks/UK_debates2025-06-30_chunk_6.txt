I thank the Minister for his answer and for his kind words about Roy Briggs.
His family and I are also grateful for letter that he wrote to them.
I had the privilege of attending his funeral last week.
He was a real servant to our country, having flown in many brave missions over Europe.
He was part of one of the RAF’s first ever humanitarian missions when dropping essential food over the Netherlands and he also flew many missions in RAF bombers.
