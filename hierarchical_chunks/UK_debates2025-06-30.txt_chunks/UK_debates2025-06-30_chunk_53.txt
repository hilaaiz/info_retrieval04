The PIP review is not driven by an objective of making savings; it is about making sure that this vital benefit is fair and fit for the future.
As is the case now, people can request reassessments whenever they want.
Existing claimants will remain under the current rules, unless they request a reassessment, until November 2026.
From then onwards, there will be that four-point minimum.
If this is what Labour thinks people voted for and what people wanted when they voted in July last year, why was it not in the Labour manifesto?
Why did Labour not put in its manifesto that it was going to cut the winter fuel payment, keep the two-child cap and push 150,000 more disabled people into poverty?
Is it perhaps because the Secretary of State realised how deeply unpopular and wrong these changes would be?
I do not expect the hon.
Member to have read every line of our manifesto, but reforming the benefit system was in it.
So too was our commitment to tackling child poverty, and I am beyond proud that the Chancellor invested the resources we need to extend free school meals to all families on universal credit and lift 100,000 children out of poverty.
That is a down payment on our child poverty strategy this autumn.
