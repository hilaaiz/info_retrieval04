In response to my written parliamentary question, the Minister for the Armed Forces said that the Ministry of Defence assesses support to foreign forces on “a case-by-case basis.
UK training courses promote British values, including human rights…and…international humanitarian law.”
How does that response square with our continued support of Israel’s war crimes in Gaza?
Will dual nationals serving in the Israel Defence Forces be held accountable?
All actions of the UK Government are in compliance with international humanitarian law.
We want to see an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
We have fewer than five personnel from Israel on non-combat academic courses currently, but we keep all our training under review.
Ministers will be aware of the recent launch of XV Excalibur in the south of England.
It is an autonomous submarine vehicle that is the future of naval capability.
What other investments are being made, under the strategic defence review, in autonomous vehicles, unmanned submarine technologies, and glider technologies?
