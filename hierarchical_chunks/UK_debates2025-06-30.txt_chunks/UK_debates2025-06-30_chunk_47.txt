The Secretary of State tells us that this week’s U-turn will cost £2,500 million a year by 2029.
Will she tell the House how she proposes to cover that expense?
This change will be fully funded, and that will be set out in the normal way at the next fiscal event, as I am sure all hon.
Members will appreciate.
