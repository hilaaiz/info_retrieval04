I welcome the recent announcement of funding to improve military housing, but our fantastic service personnel deserve more than short-term fixes.
This year’s armed forces continuous attitudes survey showed that one in five personnel plan to leave, and over a quarter of them cited the standard of accommodation as a reason.
That should be a wake-up call.
Will the Government commit to going further and show a real commitment to retention by finally U-turning on their decision to block Liberal Democrat proposals to bring all military housing under the decent homes standard?
