My hon.
Friend is a powerful voice, and I know she will always remain so in this House.
We are absolutely committed to co-producing this PIP review, led by the Minister for Social Security and Disability.
She may know that we are also setting up collaboration committees on access to work and pathways to make sure that we really get this right.
I look forward to meeting her and many other disabled people and their organisations to make sure that we get this right as we go forward.
To describe it as fair and equal to treat people with identical conditions differently purely on the basis of whether they are an existing recipient of benefits is Orwellian newspeak on stilts, isn’t it?
So why did the Conservative party do it for 14 years?
