I welcome the words of the Secretary of State that recognise the need to enable disabled people to fulfil their potential.
Since April, I have engaged with the Government, making it clear that I could not support the proposals on PIP.
Our manifesto committed to championing the rights of disabled people and the principle of working with disabled people.
Having no public consultation on these plans excludes the voices of disabled people.
This is not just about process; this makes disabled people worse off.
The principle of fairness means that disabled people had a legitimate expectation to be consulted, in order to fulfil the public sector equality duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.
Why did the Department for Work and Pensions choose not to consult with disabled people on the PIP proposals, and what work will it do to win back the trust of disabled people?
