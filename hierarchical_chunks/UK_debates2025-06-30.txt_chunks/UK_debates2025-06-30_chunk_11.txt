I thank the Minister for her answers.
She is a regular visitor to Northern Ireland and supports the SMEs there, so when it comes  to the defence industrial strategy to support SMEs, could she update the House, and myself in particular, on what she and the Government are doing to help SMEs in Northern Ireland to increase jobs and also increase contracts?
