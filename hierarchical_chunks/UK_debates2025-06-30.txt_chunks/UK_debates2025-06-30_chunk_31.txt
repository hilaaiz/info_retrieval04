I thank my hon.
Friend for all his support for cadet forces and the armed forces.
It would be remiss of me not to say that cadet forces provide an excellent social mobility platform for young children across the country by giving them hope, priorities and principles, and pushing them to be determined.
This Government have committed to raising the cadet force by 30%, and to giving more children across the country better opportunities.
