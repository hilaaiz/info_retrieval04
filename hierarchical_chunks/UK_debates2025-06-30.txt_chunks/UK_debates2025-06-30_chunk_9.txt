I thank the hon.
Member for that really important question.
There are two pieces that I would highlight.
The first is the armed forces career transition partnership, which helps individuals during the two years prior to their leaving the service, and for two years after, to find jobs.
The second is Operation Ascend, which looks to partner career opportunities and businesses—of which we have engaged with over 400—with any veteran or individual leaving the armed forces, which has engaged with 3,000 individuals.
Part of our veterans strategy will include that from a women’s perspective.
We are doing everything we can, and over 86% of veterans who seek help go straight into employment within the first six months.
