Yes; as I set out my statement, we intend to co-produce the Timms review with disabled people, the organisations that represent them, other experts  and MPs, so my hon.
Friend’s constituents will absolutely be able to feed their views into the review.
We want to strike the right balance here, because co-production takes time.
We want to do it as quickly as possible, but it has to be done as effectively as possible.
I look forward to working with my hon.
Friend and involving her constituents’ views.
I spoke to a resident—a friend—in my constituency over the weekend.
She is a wheelchair user since a failed back operation some years ago.
She currently gets PIP.
She gets three points for dressing and undressing and two points for washing and bathing.
She needs help with both, yet she fears, as do I, that anybody with her exact needs applying after next November will be left without help.
We are right, are we not, to be concerned and to fear that?
That is unjust and uncaring, isn’t it?
I repeat to the hon.
Gentleman that it is common through the benefit system to protect existing claimants from new rules and rates.
I also say to him that we are putting billions of pounds extra into the NHS so people can get the health and social care support they need.
We are putting in place the biggest-ever employment support investment for sick and disabled people because we know disabled people who are out of work are twice as likely to be in poverty.
That is the investment we are making.
His constituents will be protected and will not be put into poverty as a result of the changes in this Bill.
