Does the Secretary of State support the action taken by the United States to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities?
As I said in my response to  the hon.
Member for Surrey Heath (Dr Pinkerton) , we are absolutely determined that Iran should never have a nuclear weapon.
We have been working with allies, on a diplomatic path.
Now that a ceasefire is in place, the mind of all NATO leaders, including President Trump, was on putting our weight behind that diplomatic path.
That is the way towards ensuring a sustainable and verifiable end to any nuclear programme.
It is extraordinary that a British Secretary of State for Defence is unable to give his explicit support to the military action of our closest ally, the United States.
Is the real reason why Labour cannot back US military action against Iran not the same as the reason why it will not U-turn on Chagos or on Northern Ireland veterans—that when it comes to choosing between legal theory and the national interest, this Prime Minister is a lawyer, not a leader?
Absolute rubbish!
The UK and the US are the very closest of defence, intelligence and national security partners.
The US was strongly behind the deal we have done on Diego Garcia, because it knows that that deal secures the operational sovereignty there of the UK and the US for the next 100 years and beyond.
ITP Aero supports over 700 jobs in Hucknall in my constituency.
I recently went to visit the site with representatives from Unite to meet those highly skilled workers, who are essential not only in supporting our defence sector, but for protecting our national security.
What are this Government doing to ensure that work done under future contracts is completed in the UK, by UK workers?
