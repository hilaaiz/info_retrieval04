Nothing matters more than home, so I welcome the huge progress that has been made on  forces housing over the past 12 months, especially for forces families.
Does the Minister agree that the Opposition’s half-baked reprivatisation plan would be a huge threat to those in the armed forces and their families?
That is a really valid point.
The trouble is that the plan risks the deal we had with Annington.
It would outsource all the housing, and take control away from the Government, the Ministry of Defence and the military families who would be living in that housing.
Our housing strategy will come in after the summer, and it will be well thought through and delivered.
