I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and I look forward to giving evidence to the Select Committee about our overall proposals.
The Bill brings forward a four-point requirement for all new PIP claims after 2026; I have been very clear that that will apply  only to new claimants.
We are also committed to the wider review of PIP so that it is fit for the future.
That will include considering the assessment criteria, the activities, descriptors and associated points to ensure that they properly reflect the impact of disability in today’s world.
The review will conclude by autumn 2026, and we will then implement as quickly as possible any changes arising from it.
