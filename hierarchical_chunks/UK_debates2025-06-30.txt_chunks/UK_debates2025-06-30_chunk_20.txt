I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to the Dispatch Box and to the Conservative Front Bench team, alongside his two very distinguished colleagues,  the right hon.
Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr Francois)  and  the hon.
Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) .
I gently say to him that, since the election, his colleague the shadow Defence Secretary argued 13 times for 2.5% by 2030.
He only changed his tune after February, when the Prime Minister showed how it was going to be funded and said that we would do it three years earlier, in 2027.
We have shown how we will raise the extra funding for this record increase in investment in defence since the end of the cold war.
We have shown exactly how it is costed and exactly how it will be funded in this Parliament, and in the next Parliament we will do the same.
