I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the vital role of ITP Aero on some of our most important defence platforms, not least Typhoon and the A400M.
The strategic defence review makes it clear that we will back British-based businesses where possible, and ITP Aero is already helping to show that defence is an engine for growth in her community.
