We all agree that the welfare system needs reform but many of us in this place believe that changes to disability support should not take place without listening to disabled people’s voices and experiences.
Over the last few days, I have been hopeful that the Government have shown strength in listening and moving on what they have heard.
However, I have a question on sequencing.
What is the logic of making changes for future claimants before finishing the Timms review, which is now to be co-produced with disabled people?
Could this lead to not just two tiers but three: existing claimants; new claimants, who will lose out; and post Timms review claimants?
No, that is not correct.
As I set out in my statement, existing claimants on PIP will be protected.
The reason we are making the changes for future claimants is that we want to start to focus that, for future claimants, on those with higher needs.
For current claimants of both PIP and the universal credit health top-up, no one will be pushed into poverty as a result of the changes in the Bill.
Health and sickness benefit spending is set to hit £100 billion by the end of the Parliament, so why is the Secretary of State not bringing forward proper reforms rather than these rushed cuts imposed by the Chancellor that save only £2 billion, and that duck the difficult decisions to deal with the scale of the challenge that we face?
Perhaps the hon.
Member should make that point to those on his Front Bench, who had 14 years.
