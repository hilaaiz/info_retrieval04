I thank the Secretary of State for her commitment to bring forward a stronger Bill, working with colleagues across the House.
The reality is that any one of us in this House could become disabled—disability does not discriminate.
It is important for us to recognise the network of informal care that keeps our social care system going.
The reality is that a number of carers would not be eligible for carer’s allowance without the PIP eligibility, and so many carers who receive carer’s allowance are in poverty.
Those people do not do it for the money; they do it because they want to help a loved one or family friend.
I know from personal experience, being a carer for my mum, the toll it takes when you help someone to bathe, to get out of bed, or to cook and clean.
These people do not do it for the money, but they are scared.
Can the Secretary of State confirm that we will protect those carers in any future PIP changes because it is right that those carers should not be pushed further into poverty?
