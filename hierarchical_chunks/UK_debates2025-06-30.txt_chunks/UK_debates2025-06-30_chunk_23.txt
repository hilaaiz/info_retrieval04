I welcome the Liberal Democrats’ support for the commitment we have made at NATO; the Leader of the Opposition was unable to offer that support at Prime Minister’s questions last week.
If the hon.
Gentleman has ideas about how we should fund that commitment in the next Parliament, I would be perfectly happy to hear them.
