Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kami Welch for being named an Outstanding Woman in Business by the Denver Business Journal.
Each year, Denver Business Journal chooses 34 exceptional women in the Denver metro area who are the area's top executives, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and influencers.
This year, Kami was selected for this award after 14 years in the Chamber industry, including 10 years with the Arvada Chamber.
She is an outstanding leader, dedicated to the success of the Arvada community and focused on supporting women in business.
Kami's efforts to develop meaningful industry and business solutions have led to significant improvements in the city's domestic tourism, a more diversified economy, and a stronger environment for local and small businesses.
Those who have had the privilege of working with Kami attest to her unwavering commitment to the Arvada community.
