Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a momentous occasion in the history of New York State, the Town of Schuyler Falls' 175th anniversary.
In the early 19th century, a group of visionaries established a settlement bordered on the north and east by the Saranac River.
Through their determination and perseverance, these settlers laid foundations for what would become the prosperous town of Schuyler Falls, formally erected from the Town of Plattsburgh on April 4, 1848.
Residents have preserved its unique heritage, embraced progress, and fostered a vibrant spirit of unity that continues to this day.
Schuyler Falls has beautiful rolling hills, accessible agriculture, timber, and waterpower, all of which provided early residents with key resources in the Town's founding industries.
The initial successes of the Town's founders paved a way for a stalwart, close-knit community that values hard work and dedication.
Today, Schuyler Falls continues to flourish with a plethora of local farms, small businesses, and a growing commercial businesses sector.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, it is my honor to recognize and celebrate the
