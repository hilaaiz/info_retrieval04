Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a valued staff member and trusted advisor, Zachary Isakowitz, as he leaves to embark on the next steps in his career.
Although he will be greatly missed, I could not be happier for the impact he will continue making within the technology sector.
Zach has served as my Legislative Director for the last two and a half years.
His role has been vital to the passing of some of my most important legislation, including the CHIPS for America Act.
Zach's work was, foremost, dedicated to promoting the growth of semiconductor manufacturing in America.
Together, we have seen billions invested in the technology industry in Texas and across the nation.
We have secured funding for dozens of projects in Texas-10, including many at institutes of higher education.
And we've passed crucial legislation combatting childhood cancer.
I would like to thank Zach for a job well done.
I am grateful for the dedication and support he has given to me, the staff, and the people of Texas' 10th Congressional District.
I wish him all the best, both in life and throughout the remainder of his career.
While his presence in my office will certainly be missed, I know Zach will continue to leave a positive mark on D.C. and our Nation.
And remember, once a member of team McCaul, always a member of team McCaul.
