Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the naming of the portion of U.S. Highway 50 from Bahner Quarry Road to Tower Road the ``SGT James L. Shipley Memorial Highway.''
Sergeant Shipley was a great man who served his country valiantly during the Second World War.
At only 19 years of age, 
Mr. Shipley made the decision to go to his local recruiting station and serve his country during a time of war, which led to him becoming a crew chief and mechanic for the 332nd Fighter Group.
Little did 
Mr. Shipley know this decision would place him in one of the most respected military organizations from World War II which would pave the way for African Americans' service in the armed forces.
After Germany's surrender, Sergeant Shipley returned home to Tipton, Missouri where he ran a farm and operated a gas station along U.S. Highway 50 with his loving wife Mildred.
While working hard to support his family, Sergeant Shipley frequently made time to share his experiences with community groups and schools in the area.
Sergeant Shipley's long and storied life charts several important chapters in our state's and country's history.
The ``SGT James L. Shipley Memorial Highway'' will stand as an important reminder of his tremendous dedication to his community and country for generations to come.
