I turn to the cost of living crisis.
On Friday, Ofgem said that energy bills will go up again in January, after last month’s 10% rise.
Millions of people are really worried about how they will make ends meet this winter, not least hundreds of thousands of pensioners who are in poverty but above the pension credit limit, who will now lose winter fuel payments.
With energy bills going up again, will the Prime Minister reconsider and restore winter fuel payments?
Obviously the whole House is concerned about energy bills, which are actually lower this year than they were last year.
The long-term way to deal with this issue is to have clean power by 2030, to make sure that we drive energy bills down on a permanent basis, and that is what we will do.
On the winter fuel allowance, the right hon.
Gentleman knows very well what the Government’s position is; indeed, I have rehearsed it with him many times.
Antisocial behaviour involving modified and off-road bikes is a menace, and has a huge impact on communities such as mine in Sunderland.
Although I welcome the work that Northumbria police does in partnership with our council, they need stronger powers and more resources.
Can the Prime Minister outline how he will back the police to tackle the misery caused by intimidating and downright dangerous antisocial behaviour on bikes?
