I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the important aspect of business innovation and for mentioning those businesses, which are important to Northern Ireland’s economy.
We are working with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure the best outcome for Short Brothers and its staff in relation to Spirit.
The Department for Business and Trade remains in contact with Spirit, Airbus, Boeing and other potential buyers.
We want to see an outcome that includes a commitment to develop Short Brothers and its supply chain as part of any acquisition and that provides the best possible opportunity for growth in Northern Ireland.
The Department for Business and Trade continues to provide over £13 million of support for Short Brothers’ research and development activity.
