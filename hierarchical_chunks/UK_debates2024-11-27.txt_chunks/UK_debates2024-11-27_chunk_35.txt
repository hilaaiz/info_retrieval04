I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue, because antisocial behaviour affects so many people.
Sometimes it is described to me as “low level”, but its impact is not, particularly when it comes to off-road bikes.
That is why we are implementing tough new respect orders, which will give powers to the police, including powers to seize off-road bikes and, crucially, a power of arrest for breach of orders—something that has been missing in recent years.
We will tackle this problem, because it blights communities across the country.
