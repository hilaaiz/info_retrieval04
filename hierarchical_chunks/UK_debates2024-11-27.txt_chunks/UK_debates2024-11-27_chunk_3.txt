I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point and the connection to Weston-super-Mare.
There is a lot of work that we can do to support innovation across the whole country, including through the business innovation grant that I mentioned, which is especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
It offers grants of up to £20,000 to enable those enterprises to come into the market.
