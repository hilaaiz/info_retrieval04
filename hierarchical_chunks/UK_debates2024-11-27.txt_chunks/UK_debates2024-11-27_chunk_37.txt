I thank the hon.
Member for raising that tragic case, and I pay tribute to Tracey for her campaigning.
I have met a number of families on the issue of bleed kits, so I know at first hand how important this is.
We are taking measures in relation to knife crime, including banning the online sale of knives to make them less available, steering young people away from offending and implementing real penalties.
I am happy to look at bleed kits, and I will make sure that Tracey gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to hear more about what we are doing and to make her case.
