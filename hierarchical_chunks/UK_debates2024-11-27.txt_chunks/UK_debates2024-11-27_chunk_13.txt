The Secretary of State knows that there is extra funding for the running of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and about the  issues with police recruitment, but there is also the issue of not having a new police college.
Will he give a commitment that he will speak to the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Justice Minister to ensure that that police college is built at Kinnegar?
That is an issue for the Executive, but as the hon.
Member alluded to, the position on police funding has been improved, with additional money being given to the PSNI by the Executive out of extra funding that the Budget provided.
The UK Government have also increased the additional security funding that is given in recognition of the security needs in Northern Ireland.
With 14 miles between my constituency of Dumfries and Galloway and Northern Ireland, I know how much we have in common.
Unfortunately, we also share the fact that hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland and much of Scotland are not benefiting from a 75% discount on business rates bills.
That cannot be called “headwinds”; to quote Van Morrison, it is a “Full Force Gale”.
Does the Secretary of State agree that by increasing employer national insurance contributions rather than growing the economy on both sides of the North channel, we are threatening jobs, stopping investment, jacking up prices, and putting business viability at risk?
The businesses I meet in Northern Ireland are vibrant and looking forward to the future.
Of course the increase in employer national insurance contributions presents challenges for some businesses, but there is no getting away from the fiscal inheritance that this Government found when we arrived in office.
The foundations had to be fixed, and that is what we are doing.
