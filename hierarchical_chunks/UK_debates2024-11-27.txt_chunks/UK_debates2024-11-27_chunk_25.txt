Residents in Redhouse Park in my constituency are suffering from soaring management fees and poor service from their fleeceholder management company.
Recent BBC reporting has once again demonstrated the consequences of the outdated and feudal leasehold system.
All of them are frustrated by the broken promises of the previous Government.
Will the Prime Minister reassure them that this Government will introduce legislation as soon as possible to resolve the fleeceholder and leaseholder crisis?
Yes, we will do so.
I agree that the last Government totally failed to tackle the unfairness of the leasehold system.
We will provide homeowners with more powers, protection and data rights by bringing that legislation forward.
