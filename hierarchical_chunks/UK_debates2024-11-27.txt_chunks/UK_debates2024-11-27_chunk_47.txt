I thank the Secretary of State for advance copy of his statement.
Yesterday, like the Secretary of State, I attended the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders annual dinner, and I greatly appreciated the opportunity to hear directly from such an important sector for the British economy.
UK car manufacturing brings billions of pounds into our economy.
It employs hundreds of thousands of people directly, and many more thousands across its supply chain.
It is at the forefront of the green transition, and of making transport sustainable for the future via electric vehicles.
Most importantly, the industry is always willing to be frank with me and with other politicians; it reaffirmed to me that it sees major hurdles on the horizon, and the closure of Vauxhall’s 100-year-old factory in Luton is a sign of great troubles ahead.
