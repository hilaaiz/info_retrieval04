I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that case, and I am sure the thoughts of the whole House are with the family involved.
Obviously there is a very important vote on Friday, but whichever way that vote goes, we must invest properly in care across our health service.
That is why, in addition to putting the NHS back on its feet, we are putting forward a 10-year plan to make sure that the NHS can give the care that everybody would expect across the spectrum, including end of life care.
