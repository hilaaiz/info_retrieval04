May I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s remarks about the terrible impact of Storm Bert and all the flooding?
Our thoughts are with all those affected, with thanks to our amazing emergency services.
Christine’s father was told that he needed end of life care, but after a few days it was removed due to funding cuts.
He was told that he would not get it, and he died a  few weeks later in excruciating pain.
Christine says that it was terrible to watch him suffer.
Does the Prime Minister agree that, whatever the House decides on Friday, it is urgent that we improve access to high-quality end of life care?
Will he make that a key focus of the 10-year NHS plan, and will he now commit to protect hospices from the national insurance rise?
