I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
This is a sad day for the 1,100 workers at the Luton Vauxhall factory, and our thoughts are first and foremost with them and their families.
They are the most recent custodians in a long history that goes back to 1905, when their factory opened its doors for the first time.
Luton-built white vans are icons of British business, representing to many the hard graft and skill of millions of traders, the self-employed and small businesses across this country.
