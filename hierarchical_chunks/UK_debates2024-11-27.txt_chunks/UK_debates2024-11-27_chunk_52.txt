I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House on such a difficult day for the car industry, and all our thoughts are with the workers in Luton today.
I thank him for the work he is doing in engaging with the industry and with unions on a better way forward on electric vehicle targets.
This news is really disappointing, but does he agree that we can and should be positive about the future of the automotive industry in this country?
It matters to me locally as the MP for many businesses in the automotive supply chain, as I know it also matters to many Members across the House.
