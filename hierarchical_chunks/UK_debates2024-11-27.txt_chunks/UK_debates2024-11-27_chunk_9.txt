I thank the hon.
and learned Member for rightly singing the praises of Wrightbus.
The transition to net zero presents huge opportunities, as he has identified, for businesses like Wrightbus in Ballymena.
It is producing 1,000 low-carbon buses, securing 500 jobs in its factory and creating 1,500 additional jobs across the UK supply chain.
This shows that Northern Ireland is leading the way, and we will continue to work on such opportunities through our industrial strategy.
