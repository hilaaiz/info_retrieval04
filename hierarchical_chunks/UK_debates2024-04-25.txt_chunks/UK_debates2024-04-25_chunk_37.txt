I thank the hon.
Lady for highlighting Frank Field’s legacy, as many other Members have done.
The work of the organisations that he helped to found, and that he worked with, will continue.
The hon.
Lady will know that we brought forward a cost of living package that now exceeds £108 billion.
She will also know that there are hundreds of thousands fewer children living in absolute poverty, and over a million fewer workless households.
We stand on that record, and we want it to continue.
