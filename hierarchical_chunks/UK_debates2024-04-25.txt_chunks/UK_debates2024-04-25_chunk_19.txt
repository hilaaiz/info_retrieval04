I thank my hon.
Friend for asking that question.
He is a tireless campaigner on this matter, on which he has met with me and the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.
As I said to my hon.
Friend, I am dealing with this matter with the permanent secretary; he will know that we have a new permanent secretary in the Department, and we are working at pace to resolve it.
