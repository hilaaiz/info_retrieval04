I thank my hon.
Friend for all her work to ensure that her constituency is on the map.
The investment zone will make Wrexham the absolute leader in the field of advanced manufacturing, as well as in the creative and digital sectors.
We expect this to encourage further growth, with up to £160 million of support for the zone, which will help to protect tens of thousands of existing skilled jobs and create many thousands more.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on her part in it.
