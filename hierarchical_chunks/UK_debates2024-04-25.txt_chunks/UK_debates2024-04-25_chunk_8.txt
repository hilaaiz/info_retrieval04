The Prime Minister recently announced an extraordinary round of honours, which many described as lacking integrity and bringing the system into disrepute.
It included a donor who had donated £5 million to the Conservative party, and four Conservative MPs loyal to the Prime Minister.
In the run-up to a general election that he is widely tipped to lose, what could possibly be the justification for the Prime Minister announcing and recommending a round of honours outside of the traditional King’s birthday list?
Order.
It would have been easier if you had been here for the beginning of the question.
Stretching the question is testing my patience and the patience of the Government Front Bench.
