I thank the Paymaster General for all his hard work on the contaminated blood scandal.
However, as you would expect, Madam Deputy Speaker, I still urge him to go further and faster to get this situation resolved.
If the infected blood compensation authority is to be established upon Royal Assent, can the Minister outline the timescale and process for the appointment of the chair and the other directors, and how those with lived experience will be involved and included among those directors?
