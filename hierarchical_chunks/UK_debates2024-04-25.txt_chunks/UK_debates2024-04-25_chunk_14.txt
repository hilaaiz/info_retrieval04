I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the question.
Anzac Day is an incredibly important day.
I was in Australia only a few months ago.
We are only as strong as our relationships with our allies.
They have made an extraordinary contribution to world peace, particularly during the world wars.
I pay tribute to veterans across the globe.
It is not easy fighting wars, particularly wars of choice that are not global conflicts, and then coming back and reintegrating into society.
Veterans can be incredibly proud of their service.
People like me and my counterparts in Australia and elsewhere will continue to strive night and day to improve their lot in civil society when they return.
