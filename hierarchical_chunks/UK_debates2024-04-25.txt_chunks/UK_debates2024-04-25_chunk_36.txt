Like many across this House, I was utterly floored to hear the sad news of my friend Lord Field’s passing.
His was a life devoted to helping those in poverty, especially children.
We worked together on the all-party parliamentary group on hunger,
the School Holidays (Meals and Activities) Bill and the Food Insecurity Bill.
We then set up Feeding Britain, a national charity that continues to alleviate  hunger across the UK, but we both knew that our charity should not have to exist in a country as rich as ours.
With over 4 million children in poverty, does the Leader of the House agree that it would be a fitting tribute to our dear friend to hold an urgent debate on ending child poverty?
