I first associate myself with the comments about our old friend Frank, whom I knew for many years.
It is widely acknowledged, in this Chamber and elsewhere, that Iran is run and controlled by a bunch of clerical fascists and homicidal maniacs who have now taken to attacking people on British soil, which is a bit of a break with what used to happen.
However, there is a difference of opinion over how we should respond, especially with regard to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
I know that we have had plenty of statements and urgent questions about Iran, but could we have a statement next week?
The point raised by the hon.
Gentleman is a regular theme at business questions, and throughout the week.
These are very serious matters, and he is right to point out that this activity is not limited to the strait of Hormuz or other parts of the world but is taking place on British soil.
Our citizens are being threatened, and many representatives such as councillors and others who hold public office are having to be protected as a result of the appalling campaigns against them and the death threats.
I will ensure that those at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office have heard what the hon.
Gentleman has said, and will encourage them to update the House.
The United Kingdom has a vibrant classic car sector, but the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency seems to have taken against it somewhat, forcing cars that have been subject to modest repairs or even heinous crimes such as the fitting of seatbelts to have Q-plates.
As I know from attending the Heritage Matters Insight Day event held by the Historic & Classic Vehicles Alliance during the Easter recess, and indeed from my own inbox, the problem seems to be getting worse.
I have raised it numerous times in the Transport Committee, but it is not going away.
May we have a debate in Government time to iron out these issues and ensure that the Department for Transport gets a grip on the DVLA’s attitude to the classic car sector?
I would be happy to raise the hon.
Gentleman’s point with the Transport Secretary, as Transport questions will not take place again until  16 May .
This is not just about people’s personal vehicles; it concerns an enormous number of UK businesses.
We have a huge export market, and Britain is, of course, very well known for its motor sport and motoring in general.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on his campaign on this important matter, and will ensure that all relevant Secretaries of State have heard what he has said.
Frank Field was a great mate.
We even forgave him, in the end, for his daft views on Brexit.
He was a great guy and a great colleague, and we miss him dearly.
I genuinely seek the guidance of the Leader of the House this morning—I am not trying to make a political point.
We have worked very hard to ensure that standards in this House are of the highest order, and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rhondda (Sir Chris Bryant)  has played a big part in that.
This Parliament’s reputation is based on standards here and in the upper House.
Is it possible for her to have a conversation with her senior colleagues in the House of Lords?
I do not know whether she saw a recent article in The Sunday Times that said the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, a former MI6 chief in Moscow, is a lobbyist for a man in the US who is believed to be involved in Russian gang crime.
Everybody knows there is a group in the upper House that is very close to Russia.
Could we look into this issue?
It will impinge on Parliament if it is not dealt with.
Is the hon.
Gentleman relating his question to the business of the House?
Oh, and may we have an early debate on it?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman.
I hope that others will follow his learned example.
I will answer the hon.
Gentleman with the same good faith with which he asked his question.
If he has serious concerns about anyone on the parliamentary estate, he needs to raise them formally, and in the appropriate way, with the House authorities.
That would be the right course of action if he had genuine concerns about anyone.
I do not quite agree with the last answer given by the Leader of the House.
We know who we are talking about, and I agree with those on the Opposition side of the House.
May we have a debate in Government time on the Three Rivers development in Mid Devon—I have mentioned this before—which is now becoming a cover-up and a financial scandal?
The chairman of the scrutiny committee has done a runner and slunk off to rented accommodation in Bampton, which is a disgrace.
I am afraid this is now becoming a serious issue for local government.
Mid Devon Council has no scrutiny, no responsibility, and absolutely no idea what it is doing.
In Government time, can we talk about local government that is not taking its financial responsibilities seriously and is covering up major issues?
I am sorry to hear about what sounds like a very concerning issue that is affecting my hon.
Friend’s constituents.
Given that the next questions to the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities are not until June, I will ensure that he has heard what my hon.
Friend has said today.
May I add my condolences to the family of Lord Field?
He was an exceptional man and an outstanding politician, and I had the privilege of knowing him for two years while he was still a Member of Parliament.
Working or studying in other countries has wide-ranging benefits for young people.
Perhaps the saddest outcome of Brexit is that the number of young people from the UK working and studying in EU countries, and the number of young people from the EU working and studying here, has dramatically reduced.
In order to reverse this worrying trend, last week the EU proposed youth mobility visas, but the Government rejected them outright, even though they would have brought a wide-ranging and welcome boost to our economy—I mean that in good faith.
Can we please have a statement from the Government on why that proposal was rejected outright and how they propose to boost youth mobility between EU countries and the UK?
