I thank the right hon.
Lady for her kind words and her constructive approach.
It is absolutely right that she continues to press me, as she does at every opportunity.
Reflecting on our conversations and what she has said to me, the key thing is to ensure that we maintain and reclaim the trust of the infected blood community in all its dimensions.
She will know that I am engaging with them in depth over several meetings on 1 and  10 May .
Sir Brian Langstaff made clear that the infected blood community and all those accessing the scheme should have a role to play in its delivery, so, consequential to listening to what they say to me, I will be thinking about how we build that in.
As she knows, the Government have made provisions for committees and sub-committees to ensure representation of the communities, while also maintaining an independent, arm’s length body.
I will need to reconcile those.
I am sorry that I cannot give her a timetable, but I am working on it in some detail.
