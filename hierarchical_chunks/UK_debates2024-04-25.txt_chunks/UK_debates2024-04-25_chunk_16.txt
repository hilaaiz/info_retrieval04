May I begin with a moment of unity?
The Deputy Prime Minister and I are both pushing for an early general election as soon as possible.
I very much welcome his recognition that there is absolutely no point in this Conservative Government carrying on in office a moment longer.
Further to the question a little earlier by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Weaver Vale (Mike Amesbury) , this week two people were charged in this country, under the Official Secrets Act, with spying for China, one of whom worked for politicians in this House.
Order.
I must stop the right hon.
Gentleman.
It seems to me that he is about to go down a road on a matter that is sub judice, which cannot be discussed here in this Chamber.
The Speaker made a statement at the beginning of business earlier this week, asking Members not to refer to this matter, because it is sub judice.
Can the right hon.
Gentleman ask his general question in a different way, and not refer to that specific issue?
Thank you for your guidance, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I shall ask a policy question.
The Government recently awarded a contract for a supercomputer to Lenovo, a China-headquartered firm that has been the subject of enforcement action by the United States on security grounds.
This supercomputer will be used by critical Government bodies such as the UK Atomic Energy Authority.
How will Ministers safeguard the public against any possible misuse of sensitive Government data as a result of the awarding of the contract?
