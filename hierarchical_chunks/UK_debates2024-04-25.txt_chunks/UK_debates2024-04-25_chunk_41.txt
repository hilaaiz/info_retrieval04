The counter-disinformation unit, now known as the national security online information team, has a remit to tackle the greatest national security risks facing the UK, and misinformation and disinformation cause risks to elections.
Disturbingly, a racist letter riddled with misinformation and disinformation was posted to all Hindus in Brent and Harrow.
It attacked our current Mayor of London and our Assembly member, Krupesh Hirani, incorrectly stating that Sadiq and Krupesh do not care about Hindus, which is a complete and utter lie.
With one week to go until the mayoral election, will the Leader of the House condemn the letter and ensure that the NSOIT investigates it?
May we have a debate on the Floor of the House on the NSOIT’s role?
