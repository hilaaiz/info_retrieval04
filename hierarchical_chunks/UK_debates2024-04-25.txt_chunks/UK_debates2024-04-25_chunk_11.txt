The amendment that was tabled by my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson)  and passed by this House at the end of last year was to set up a compensation scheme within a strict time limit of three months.
That time limit must remain in the Bill and victims need concrete action.
Will the Paymaster General tell us when the Treasury will set out its detailed costings for the scheme?
Secondly, and most importantly, when can victims expect their final compensation payments?
The costings will be a responsibility of the Treasury, but a joint team between the Cabinet Office and the Treasury is working to give advice to the Prime Minister so that we can make decisions in a timely way as soon as possible from  20 May .
I am conscious of the fact that across all the different communities of infected and affected as much clarity is needed as possible.
They have had to wait too long, so I am making sure that, as far as we can, when those final decisions are made there will be not only a headline decision, but clarity on process thereafter.
It is those details I am working on now and I hope that a decision can be made as soon as possible from  20 May .
