The Prime Minister previously backed calls for Horizon victim and campaigner Alan Bates to receive an honour, yet his name was absent from the Prime Minister’s surprise honours list last month.
However, Russia-linked Mohamed Mansour’s name was on that list.
What was it about the multi-millionaire, generous Conservative party donor that attracted the Prime Minister to the idea of giving him a knighthood?
The gentleman whose name has just been mentioned is a very successful businessman and philanthropist, and I am sure those qualities were very much in the Prime Minister’s mind when he was put forward for an honour.
Extremely distinguished names from the world of artificial intelligence and the creative industries were also recognised for their contribution to our country.
One.
I advise the hon.
Gentleman to go back and check the list because, not for the first time in this House, he is wrong.
