My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to point to the failings of the London Mayor.
London has got less safe and crime is on the rise, particularly violent crime, and it is no surprise to hear that my hon.
Friend’s constituents are very concerned about that.
Unfortunately, many of the areas he mentions are the responsibility of the Mayor of London, but there is something that not just Government Members but the general London public can do in the coming days, and that is vote in a new Mayor of London.
I think people will agree that you are indeed “Safer with Susan”.
