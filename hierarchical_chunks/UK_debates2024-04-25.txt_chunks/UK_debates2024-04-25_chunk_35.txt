I thank my right hon.
Friend for congratulating Dan and the other councillors who have done so much for their community.
Dan is proof that age is not relevant, but political hue is.
Elsewhere, in the west midlands, Andy Street has been following Harlow’s example.
He has never raised any taxes, and he does not charge an additional precept, yet he has brought billions of pounds of investment into his region, in stark contrast to Sadiq Khan in London, who has increased the mayoral precept by more than 70%, and Labour-run Birmingham, which is increasing council tax by 21% to pay for its errors.
It is very clear: if you want better services at lower cost, vote Conservative.
