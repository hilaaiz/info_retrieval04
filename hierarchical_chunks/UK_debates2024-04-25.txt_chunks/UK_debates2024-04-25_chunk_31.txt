I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that incredibly important issue.
We could run a positive public health campaign; rather than just telling people not to drink or smoke, we should also ask them whether they have had enough sleep.
We should be proud of the research that has been done in the UK.
Professor Russell Foster at Oxford University has done amazing work  which is leading to improvements in the general population, but particularly among veterans who have suffered blast injuries and lost their sight.
I would be happy to raise what my hon.
Friend has said with the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, because I think that that would be a very good initiative.
