I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point of order.
I cannot help agreeing with his final point, having sat in the Chair for   thousands of hours and heard the same question answered again and again.
He makes a very good point: Ministers are responsible, and have a duty to answer the question again and again.
However, if the Minister thought—today or at any other time—that the appropriate answer in the circumstances was the one that the hon.
Gentleman just quoted, that is not something that I can criticise, or a matter on which I can take action.
As Mr Speaker has said many times, and as I am very pleased to repeat, what Ministers say at the Dispatch Box is not a matter for the Chair.
