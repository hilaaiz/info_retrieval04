I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important matter.
She is absolutely right.
She will know that in March the Treasury launched a consultation on anti-money laundering regulations to further strengthen the effectiveness of that regime, and to ensure that they responding to emerging changes and that the burdens placed on businesses are appropriate.
I will make sure that the relevant Minister has heard her interest in this matter and that she is updated.
