Gentleman referred to his role as general election co-ordinator for the Labour party.
I understand that he sits on the quad, which determines Labour policy, so perhaps he could clear up, for the benefit of us all, this question on an issue of national security.
Does the Labour party support our £75 billion increase in defence spending?
If he cares about these things, the answer should be plainly, “Yes, we do”.
When we announce a policy, we ensure that it is properly costed and funded, which I recommend to the Deputy Prime Minister.
One other cyber-threat that modern states are facing is prepositioning: the planting of destructive software in critical infrastructure that can then be activated at a later date.
The director of the FBI said that prepositioning of the Volt Typhoon type discovered in American infrastructure was “the defining threat of our generation”.
America’s cyber-defence agency said that Five Eyes allies were also likely to have been targeted.
Have the Government looked for or found Volt-Typhoon-type infiltration of any parts of our critical national IT infrastructure, and if so what action is being taken to remove it?

Gentleman has been around this place long enough to know that he is delivering a non-answer on Labour’s support for defence spending.
The whole House will have noted that, although he raises an important issue in respect of prepositioning.
He will appreciate that there are limits to what I can say from the Dispatch Box given that some of this relates to high-side intelligence, but I assure him that we are working with our Five Eyes allies, in particular the United States, since the US and the UK have exceptional capability in these areas, to ensure that we both have adequate knowledge and understanding of such prepositioning, and take effective steps in respect of it.
Eight weeks ago, on  29 February , at first order questions, I asked the Minister without Portfolio what the Government would do to assist people who are adversely affected by the statute of limitations as a result of having been injured by covid-19 vaccines.

Friend said in response that she had taken the issue to the permanent secretary.
Will she update us on what has happened with the permanent secretary over the past eight weeks?
