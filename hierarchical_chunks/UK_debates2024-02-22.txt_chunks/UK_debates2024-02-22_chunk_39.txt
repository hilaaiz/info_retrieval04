Let me first pay tribute to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)  for securing the urgent question, and indeed for all the work he has done over many years, along with other Members, in trying to secure justice for sub-postmasters.
The Post Office Horizon scandal is one of the most insidious injustices in our country’s history.
It has robbed innocent people of their livelihoods, their liberty and, all too sadly, their lives.
At least 60 sub-postmasters have died without seeing justice or receiving compensation, and at least four have taken their own lives.
More than 20 years on, the victims and their families are still suffering from the consequences and the trauma of all that they have been put through.
They have been trapped in a nightmare for too long.
We all want to see the exoneration of all who remain convicted, and the delivery of rightful compensation to all affected sub-postmasters, as quickly as possible.
Labour wants to see a swift and comprehensive solution to this insidious injustice, and we are willing to work with the Government to ensure that happens.
Will the Minister please provide an update on the timeline to which he is working to amend the seismic damage that this scandal has caused, and will he please give an assurance that he is acting with the appropriate speed that is required for necessary legislation to go through?
Victims have already waited too long for justice, and we must act now, with the speed and urgency that this awful scandal requires.
