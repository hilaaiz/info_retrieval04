I thank my hon.
Friend for so ably representing his constituents who have fallen victim to this scandal.
People do not need to have gone before a court of law to be compensated.
A postmaster with a contract with the Post Office can access either the Horizon shortfall scheme or the GLO.
A prosecution of any form is not required to be able to claim through those schemes.
I think he raises a point about somebody who worked for a postmaster or for the Post Office.
That is separate and I am very happy to talk to him about that point, which has been raised by a number of Members.
The Post Office would not necessarily know whether a postmaster who is working independently and runs an independent business had disciplined their members of staff, so it might not be as straightforward as he sets out.
Nevertheless, I am happy to engage with him on that.
