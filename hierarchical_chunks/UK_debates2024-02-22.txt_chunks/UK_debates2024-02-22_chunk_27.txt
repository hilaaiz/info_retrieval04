I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving me advance notice of his question.
I am so sorry that he has experienced this after giving more than 40 years of service to this Parliament and this country.
I will endeavour to meet him next week with security officials to go through his concerns one by one.
I hope to see him at a meeting next week if he is free.
