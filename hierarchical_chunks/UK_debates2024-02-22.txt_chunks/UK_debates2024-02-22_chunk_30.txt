I am sorry to learn of my hon.
Friend’s concerns.
I will certainly feed that straight back to the hierarchy of the Church and ensure that those meetings happen.
However, I am pleased to tell him that following his question to me on this issue last month, the police have arrested a suspect for a series of church burglaries in Barnet, Brent and Harrow, and he is remanded in custody.
I have been told that the Metropolitan police is in close contact with the diocese of London and local churches, but there clearly needs to be more dialogue.
I will ensure that that happens.
I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Holy Trinity church at Dunkeswell, which sits on the site of the Cistercian  Dunkeswell abbey in my constituency.
Visiting it is a moving, spiritual experience.
Given that some sites such as that are in rural, remote areas where there will simply never be the footfall that the hon.
Member describes, can he assure us that we can continue to keep them open in spite of any threat of theft?
I completely understand the hon.
Gentleman’s point.
Like him, I am a lover of our rural churches.
I suggest that he points the churchwardens and the priest to the comprehensive advice on the Church of England website and perhaps has further conversations with the diocese and local police.
If there are still issues, I ask him to come back to me about that.
