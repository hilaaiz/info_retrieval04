I understand this issue and the concerns that my hon.
Friend has mentioned.
I know that, as Chair of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, she understands and appreciates these matters.
I want to assure her that the conclusion of the initial public offering working group is absolutely not the end of our work to find an appropriate regulatory solution for AI.
We are absolutely committed to ensuring that AI development supports rather than undermines human creativity.
For example, we will be focusing on ensuring greater transparency from AI developers and that AI outputs are properly attributed.
It is also right, as she highlights, that creators should be compensated for their work.
Good morning, Mr Speaker.
AI firms are committing large-scale abuse of copyrighted material, using copyrighted images and pieces of media to train their AI tools without consent or compensation for copyright owners.
The United Kingdom Government say that they want to reduce barriers to AI companies, but that can only come at the expense of creators and artists.
How does it make sense to sacrifice the 10% of UK GDP that comes from the creative sector in favour of less than a quarter of a per cent of GDP that AI produces?
I recognise the point that the hon.
Member makes in relation to the importance of protecting creative rights—the creative ingenuity that is such an important part of both our British culture and economic value.
That is why I am hearing from the sector, and why, in the Government’s AI White Paper, we recognise the importance of ensuring greater transparency from AI developers.
We are continuing to work on that across Government.
