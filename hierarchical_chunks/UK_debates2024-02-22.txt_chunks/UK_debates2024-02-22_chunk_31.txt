I thank the Second Church Estates Commissioner for that answer.
We live in an age where modern technology is available as a method of addressing these issues but is incredibly expensive.
What funds are issued to us in Northern Ireland through Barnett consequentials to ensure that churches can adequately secure buildings with security cameras and CCTV?
If there is currently no funding, could that be considered when we take into account the rural and isolated status of so many church buildings?
