I thank the hon.
Member for his question, but unfortunately, on the point of substance, somebody coughed and I slightly missed the key point—I apologise.
I think he asked about sharing expertise with Northern Ireland.
We will be happy to do so, because it is important to learn the lessons of how these issues are being addressed across the country.
In Labour-run Wales, there is a real mess over how to deal with the issue of holiday accommodation, and the situation is similar in Scotland.
We want to learn those lessons for the English scheme and we will be happy to share the lessons with Northern Ireland.
