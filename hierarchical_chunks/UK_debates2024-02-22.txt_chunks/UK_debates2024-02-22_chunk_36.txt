On the letter from the chief executive to the Justice Secretary, I am aware of the allegations by Mr Staunton.
They are very serious allegations that should not be made lightly or be based on a vague recollection.
If the right hon.
Gentleman looks at the letter from the former permanent secretary, it is clear that she believes the allegations are incorrect, and that there was never any conversation along the lines referred to by Mr Staunton.
I think it is pretty clear that those allegations are false.
The right hon.
Gentleman has regularly brought up Capture.
We are keen to continue to engage with him on that to ensure that those affected are included in any compensation where detriment has occurred.
I note his point about an oral statement.
As I say, I am always keen to give such statements whenever possible, and to be interrogated on our plans.
I do not think he will be disappointed by what we announce later today.
Now that the then permanent secretary has outlined that she did not implicitly or explicitly tell the then chairman of the Post Office to slow down compensation, I hope we can spend time less time talking about someone who has lost his job and more time talking about postmasters who have lost everything.
Will the Minister, who is doing great work in sorting this out, recommit to August as his target date for getting compensation—life-changing compensation —out of the door as soon as possible?
