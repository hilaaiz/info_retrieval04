I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question and for making that point; she is absolutely right.
Disclosure both to the inquiry and on individual cases, which is required to be able to compile claims, has been too slow.
If Post Office Ltd and its management team are going to rebuild trusts with claimants and the wider public, it is absolutely incumbent on them that this is done properly and that the governance around it is done properly.
That is part of the reason why the Secretary of State acted as decisively as she did, but I absolutely concur with my right hon.
Friend.
Alongside her, I urge Post Office Ltd to deliver disclosure more quickly.
