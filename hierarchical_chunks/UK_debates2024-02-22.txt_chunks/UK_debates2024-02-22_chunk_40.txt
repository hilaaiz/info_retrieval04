I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the way in which he has approached this matter.

As I said earlier, 78% of claimants have received full and final compensation, but we fully share his wish, and that of his party, for a swift resolution and a swift end to this, and we have engaged significantly and extensively with his colleagues on the Front Bench.
As for how we overturn convictions, the measures that we are taking are clearly unprecedented, but this is an unprecedented situation.
