I associate myself with the words of praise for the Minister’s speed and attention on this issue.
I think a legally binding instruction for the Post Office and the Department to deliver at speed is a necessity in the new Bill.
The Minister has told us today that about £160 million has been paid in compensation, but there is provision for about £1.2 billion, which means that only 13% of the money has been paid  out.
He updated the House on the number of claimants, and there were 555 people in the GLO group and 700 who were convicted.
As the Minister told us, only 73 people have had their final compensation fully paid, which is only 6% of the two groups.
The confusion at the beginning of the week about who said what to whom shows there is confusion about the instruction to deliver at speed.
When the Bill comes before us, will the Minister reflect on the necessity for a legally binding deadline under which the Post Office must make information available in 20 to 30 days and an offer must be made to settle within 20 to 30 days, with a legally binding deadline for final resolution?
Otherwise, frankly, I worry that the ambiguity will still cause delays.
He knows as well as I do that justice delayed is justice denied.
