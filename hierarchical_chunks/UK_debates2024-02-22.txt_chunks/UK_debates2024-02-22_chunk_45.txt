I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work he has done on this issue—not only on the Front Bench, but on the Back Benches.
No amount of compensation can compensate the victims of this complete scandal.
However, it does help, and speeding up the process is obviously important.
Will he, during the passage of the legislation that the Government have promised to introduce, ensure that innocent victims are not only compensated, but completely exonerated?
In their communities, they have suffered the stigma attached to all this, and they need to have their names cleared and their reputations restored.
