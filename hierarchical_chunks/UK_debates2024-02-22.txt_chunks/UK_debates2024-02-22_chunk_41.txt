Gentleman asked about the timeline.
We have always said that it is weeks, but it is fewer weeks now than it was.
I do not think he will be disappointed— I said this to the right hon.
Member for North Durham as well—by what we will say, hopefully, later today, but this has taken too long.
We are working daily to resolve these issues, and the overturning of convictions, the legislation and the compensation cannot come too quickly.
