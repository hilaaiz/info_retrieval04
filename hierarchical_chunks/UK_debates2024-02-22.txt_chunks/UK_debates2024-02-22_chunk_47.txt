My hon.
Friend is right to say that no amount of compensation can make up for what happened to many people’s lives.
We want all the innocent people to be exonerated.
We know there is nervousness, with some victims not trusting the process—they have simply had enough.
We met Howe & Co., one of the solicitors, to talk about this issue yesterday, and its contention is that around 40% of the people who received a letter saying, “We will not oppose an appeal,” still will not come forward.
We need a process that does not require people to come forward if we are to have a mass exoneration of those affected by this horrendous scandal.
We hope to announce that later today.
