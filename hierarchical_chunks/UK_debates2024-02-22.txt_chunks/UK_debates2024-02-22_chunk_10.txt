What progress her Department has made on responding to the consultations on the gambling White Paper.
The Government launched three consultations following the gambling White Paper.
We are considering all the evidence that was received and will publish the Government response soon.
Our response to the consultation on the introduction of the online slots limit is due to be published imminently, and we are on track for implementation of the recommendations by the summer.
Will the Minister ensure that the highly regulated land-based industry can better innovate and grow by, for example, ensuring that the right option is chosen on the changes proposed to machine rules for the adult gaming sector, which are out for consultation?
The hon.
Lady is right that the rules for the land-based sector have been very out of date for some time.
That is why doing these consultations has been really helpful; it has identified further work that needed to be done.
We have had a second consultation on some of that but, again, we will still be on course to implement the changes by the summer.
