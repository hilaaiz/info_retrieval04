On Monday it was a privilege to speak at the launch of the “State of the Sector” report, which found that charities are propping up Government services by £2.4 billion a year.
Will the Minister tell me why the Government expect the charitable sector to pick up the tab for Government responsibilities in the first place?
Clearly, the hon.
Lady does not understand the charity sector if that is the position she is taking.
Having worked in it for 16 years, I will not be lectured on this.
For example, I found that the hospices I worked in were able to respond to the needs of families in a much better and more holistic way than the state sector could.
I am proud of the contribution that charities make to this country, and long may that continue.
What discussions she has had with representatives of the creative industries on the impact of AI on that sector.
I recognise the enormous potential of AI, but also its risks.
I have had extensive engagement with the creative sector on these issues, including a  series of roundtable talks on AI with, among others, media, music and film representatives.
I am now working closely with the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology on a programme of further engagement with the sector.
