I thank my hon.
Friend for his answers thus far.
He will recall that I have previously asked at Church Commissioners questions about thefts from churches in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies, St John’s and St Andrew’s.
At St Andrew’s, the theft took place during the mass, which is outrageous, to put it mildly.
In my view, the Church Commissioners are not listening to the police’s advice and support.
What needs to happen is for churches to get at least the same support and assistance from the police as other places of worship.
Will he use his good offices to go back to the Church of England and ensure dialogue between the police and the Church to protect our churches as places of worship?
