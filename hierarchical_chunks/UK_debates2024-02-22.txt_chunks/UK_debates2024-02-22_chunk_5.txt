My hon.
Friend is a real champion for her local Devon tourist economy, and she is aware of the challenges that tourism can present in local communities, especially when it comes to short-term lets, which can make it too expensive for people working in the tourism industry to live near their job.
This is a difficult issue, and we are trying to strike the right balance between people being able to have second homes and ensuring that hotels have a level playing field and that the local community has the right accommodation.
I appreciate my hon.
Friend’s campaigning on this issue.
The next phase of the project will work with the sector to get the details of the registration scheme right.
We will be reaching out to representatives of the visitor economy and likely users of the scheme to make sure it delivers for everybody as simply as possible.
North Norfolk has a significant number of holiday lets, Airbnbs and the like.
I am glad that the Minister says the Government will look at this in moderation because, in life, too much of anything is sometimes a bad thing.
There is a difference, a nuance, between a person who rents out a room in their home via Airbnb to earn some extra income and whole streets and areas being turned into holiday lets.
Can the Minister assure me that we will properly consider the nuances?
I can provide my hon.
Friend with that assurance.
We are aware that the proliferation of short-term lets has caused real concern in communities such as his.
We do not want to clamp down in a way that will make life difficult for people who rent out their rooms on a very irregular basis, but as he said, when whole streets are causing a problem, we think the most important thing is that we get an understanding of the scale of the problem.
Our scheme is designed to give us that data and the next steps can be taken after that.
