The delays will be deeply worrying and will make financial planning very difficult for those affected, all of whom are people who have dedicated their working lives to supporting the NHS and tirelessly saving lives.
NHS workers and their families are being left in the dark by Government delays and may as a result miss out on using their full allowances, which is unacceptable—they deserve better.
The revised delivery plan prioritises members based on their likelihood of facing financial detriment, so clearly some financial detriment is expected for those who are impacted.
Can the Minister estimate what the likely financial detriment is of missing the statutory deadline, or how much compensation, as she just mentioned, is likely to be paid?
Can she tell us why the NHS Business Services Authority has failed to meet the deadlines?
In response to a written question from my hon.
Friend  the Member for St Albans (Daisy Cooper) , the Minister said that there are 112 people working on it.
Will she confirm whether that is likely to be sufficient to ensure that future deadlines are met?
