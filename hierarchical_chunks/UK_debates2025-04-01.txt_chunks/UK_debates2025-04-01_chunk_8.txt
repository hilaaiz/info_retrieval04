I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Decisions on how ODA will be used will be considered as part of the  ongoing spending review.
Reducing the overall size of the budget will necessarily have an impact on the scale and shape of our work.
I can say, however, that our important work and support for Gavi is immunising 300 million children and saving up to 8 million lives, and our £1 billion pledge to the Global Fund for 2023-25 is supporting prevention and treatment for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and will help to save over 1 million lives.
