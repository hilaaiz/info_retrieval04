Does the Minister agree that it is important that the affected members receive those statements to allow informed decision making?
The Government have worked to minimise financial detriment to those affected, but this issue is part of the mess we have been clearing up.
We have had record investments into pharmacies and more GPs, and we have cut waiting lists and stopped the junior doctors’ strikes.
We are on the road to recovery.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right that we are on the road to recovery—and that, of course, is what the Opposition cannot stand.
This is a complicated issue, as they well know.
As I said, we inherited this complication in July, when we were made well aware of it.
The Conservatives could have done more about it while they were in government, but it is yet another issue on which they have let people down—this time, it is staff.
We will ensure that we remedy that.
The timelines are available in the written ministerial statement that I issued yesterday.
We will continue to work with trade unions and employers to ensure that people understand.
As my hon.
Friend said, it is important that people do understand their own personal positions.
