I thank the Minister for her answers to the questions.
Waiting lists are clearly beyond the pale.
If the Government were able to address the remedial pension savings statement, we might be in better position to entice our doctors to take on additional hours.
Will the Minister confirm that this is a Government priority, and that there is an understanding that a functioning NHS requires straightforward paths to working overtime, and payment at every level?
