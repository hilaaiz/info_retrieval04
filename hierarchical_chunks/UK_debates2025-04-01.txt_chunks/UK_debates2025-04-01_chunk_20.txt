I thank my hon.
Friend for that important question.
The Foreign Secretary spoke with his Azerbaijani and Armenian counterparts on 19 and  21 March  respectively, and I have also been in contact with representatives of both countries.
We warmly welcome the progress made by both sides on concluding negotiations on the text of a peace agreement, and we urge them both to sign that agreement as soon as possible.
We encourage all sides to refrain from rhetoric or actions that undermine the prospects for peace.
