I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
I do not have to hand the exact number of people working on this, but I will make sure that I respond to her on that point in writing.
We are ensuring that individuals do not face detriment as a result of these delays.
The NHS cost claim back compensation scheme provides resources for direct financial losses incurred by the NHS pension scheme members impacted by the McCloud remedy, including professional service fees and certain HMRC interest charges that may arise, as I outlined in my statement.
HMRC has also confirmed that self-assessment late filing penalties will be waived on appeal in certain circumstances where a member receives a delayed pension savings statement as a consequence of the implementation of the McCloud remedy.
