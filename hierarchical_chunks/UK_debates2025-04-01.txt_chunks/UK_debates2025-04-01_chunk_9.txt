I agree with the Minister on what he just said, but Gavi says that the changing policy will mean that 37.9 million fewer children will be immunised, which means that over five years, 600,000 will die.
How on earth does he live with himself with that policy?
With the greatest of respect, the right hon.
Gentleman will know my record on these important issues, having advocated for them over many years in this place and outside.
I do not accept his characterisation.
Decisions have not yet been taken; they are being taken as part of the spending review.
He will know that the UK is one of the largest donors to Gavi.
We have committed £1.65 billion in the current strategic period up to 2025 and that will make an important impact on children’s lives around the world.
Gavi was created very much with the UK as a driving force.
It is one of the proudest achievements of the previous Labour Government.
It has immunised almost 2 billion people in the world, and not only is it saving lives but it is important for jobs and work here in the UK in our fantastic life sciences sector.
Will the Minister give a commitment that we will continue to be a leading force in Gavi at the replenishment in June?
The Foreign Secretary has been discussing these important issues with the Health and Social Care Secretary.
My hon.
Friend is right to point out the important role of Gavi, as well as our role in that.
The decisions will be set out in due course, but I hear what she and, indeed, other hon.
and right hon.
Members are saying on this important issue.
