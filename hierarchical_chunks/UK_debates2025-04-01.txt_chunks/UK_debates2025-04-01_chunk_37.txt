I thank the Minister for coming to the House and giving her response.
We all know the issues she is talking about when she mentions the state of the NHS that we inherited, and I echo that with the issues I hear about from patients and staff at Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow.
On pensions, can she outline what the Government have done to mitigate the delays in the process?
