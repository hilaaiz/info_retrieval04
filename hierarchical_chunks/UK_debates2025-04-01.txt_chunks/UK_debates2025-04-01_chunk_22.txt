I thank my hon.
Friend for her important work on these issues.
The UK has consistently called for the release of all the remaining prisoners of war.
We continue to urge the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that those detained during the long-standing conflict with Armenia are afforded a fair trial and provided safe conditions.
I raised that specifically with the Azerbaijani President’s special representative in October, and we continue to engage with them on this issue.
