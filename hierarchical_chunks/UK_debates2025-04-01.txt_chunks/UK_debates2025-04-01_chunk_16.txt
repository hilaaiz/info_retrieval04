The whole House continues to stand united with the people of Ukraine in their existential struggle.
Although there has been much coverage of tentative steps towards a Black sea ceasefire, does the Foreign Secretary agree that, with the brutal war raging on land, we must continue to constrain Putin’s war machine with every tool at our disposal?
Could he update us on his plans for doing so beyond sanctions?
Does he agree that the onus remains squarely on Putin to prove whether he is in any way serious about the kind of lasting and just peace that President Zelensky wants to see?
The right hon.
Lady should know that, with EU colleagues yesterday, at the G7 a few weeks ago and, I am sure, with colleagues as I head to NATO, we are discussing an oil cap in particular and how that would limit Putin’s reserves.
We continue to discuss not just the freezing of assets but the seizing of assets.
We recognise that some European colleagues are more exposed than we in the UK are.
Nevertheless, why should we use taxpayers’ money?
We should use Russian money that has caused so much damage in Ukraine.
Of course, we continue to look at the arsenal of sanctions that we can use, and I am sure that I will have more to say on that in the coming weeks.
