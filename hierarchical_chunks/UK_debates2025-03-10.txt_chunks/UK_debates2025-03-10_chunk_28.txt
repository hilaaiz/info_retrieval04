How on earth can the Secretary of State justify spending £90 million on a one-year contract for advertising and media while cutting a £4 million Latin excellence programme mid-year that is helping to improve school standards in some of the most deprived areas of the country?
Does that not show that the Secretary of State’s priorities are all wrong?
The right hon.
Lady was a Minister in the Treasury, and she was responsible for leaving behind the black hole that this Labour Government are having to sort out.
We face unprecedented challenges.
When it comes to Latin, we are working with classics associations to ensure that children can continue to study Latin.
It is important that children in our state schools have that opportunity, but the Conservatives designed the scheme to terminate in February.
Maybe the right hon.
Lady can tell us why that was.
