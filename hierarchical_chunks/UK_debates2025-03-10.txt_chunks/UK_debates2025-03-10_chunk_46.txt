The Minister paints an extremely concerning picture of what is happening in Syria.
On  9 December , the Government announced a temporary pause in accepting asylum applications from people from Syria, because of our hopes for the country’s future.
In the light of what he is telling us, what conversations has he had with his colleagues in Government about what should inform that assessment moving forward and what it means for people in our country?
The events over the weekend are still unfolding.
I am not really in a position to provide any further commentary on what they might mean in relation to other parts of Government, but I will return to the House when I am.
