There is no challenge more crucial for this Government than tackling child poverty.
The taskforce has started the urgent work of publishing the strategy, which will look at levers across four key themes: increasing incomes, reducing essential costs, increasing financial resilience, and better local support, especially in early years.
Parents whose children have special educational needs and disabilities do not wish to send their children to far-away schools, but they have to, because of a lack of local provision.
If the children are over the age of 16, however, it is at the discretion of the local authority to decide whether to meet the cost of transporting them to school, even though education is effectively compulsory until the age of 18.
Many local authorities, including in Leicester South, are now passing that cost entirely on to parents.
Will the Minister commit to dealing with SEND transport costs in the Department’s work to reduce the cost of sending children to school?
I will happily meet the hon.
Member to discuss those issues further.
