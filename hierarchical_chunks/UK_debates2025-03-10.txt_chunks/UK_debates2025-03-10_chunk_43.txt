My hon.
Friend has worked on these issues for many years, and he is right about the vital role of civil society.
I was pleased to meet Syrian civil society organisations with him, and indeed separately.
I am pleased to confirm to the House that we have been talking to a range of Syrians in Syria, including Alawites, after the events of the weekend.
