I thank the Minister for his statement and thank the Government for the support they have given to the people of Syria.
The terrible events of this weekend bring home the vital importance of an inclusive process for all people in Syria.
I am aware of the Minister’s response to a previous question about our diplomatic presence in Syria, but are the Government also looking at ways we can increase our engagement with civil society in Syria?
It is not just the Administration with which it is important to engage, but civil society.
Civil society groups want to carry out a number of peaceful initiatives to build a more inclusive society, but they are struggling to get governmental and non-governmental funding and to have the right conversations.
Is that something the UK Government could look at, as we build a more peaceful and inclusive society in Syria?
