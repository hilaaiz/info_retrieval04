I thank the Minister for his answer and congratulate the Department on its excellent work on the child poverty taskforce.
Lesson time and learning are being significantly affected by high levels of child poverty.
Schools in Sheffield Central tell me that many low-income families are really struggling financially.
Will the Minister confirm what specific action the Government are taking to turn the tide on child poverty and put money back into people’s pockets?
