The Secretary of State will know that one of the ways to reduce reoffending is to break the cycle of drug misuse.
The problem of course is that in too many prisons there is a high incidence of drugs getting in, so what is he doing to reduce the amount of drugs in our prisons?
The hon.
Member is right: it is of course really important that we tackle drugs coming into prisons.
We have rolled out £100 million in prison gate security, to ensure that there is airport-style security.
There are scanners, including body scanners with very high resolution, so that people coming into jails can be scanned for illicit contraband that may be being transported internally; that is important.
We are also rolling out additional technology that can scan mail for psychoactive substances impregnated into the paper.
That is just one of a suite of measures that we are taking—plus there are the drug abstinence wings.
May I take this opportunity to say that I misspoke earlier?
