I thank the Minister for the productive and supportive way that he has engaged with me on the appalling situation with Legacy funeral directors in Hull.
I am utterly committed to regulating this industry and never again allowing that appalling, heartbreaking situation to be repeated.
I have heard the Minister’s response to  the hon.
Member for Bosworth (Dr Evans) , but could he speak a little bit more about timeframes?
Does he agree that in the interval before statutory regulation comes in, we should encourage all funeral directors to subject themselves to voluntary regulation by one of the trade bodies, and to do everything they can to reassure the public that not all funeral directors are in a situation like the appalling situation that we have had in my constituency?
