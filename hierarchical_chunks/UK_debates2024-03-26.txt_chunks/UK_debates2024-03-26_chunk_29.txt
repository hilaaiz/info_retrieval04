I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this incredibly important case and for taking it up so powerfully on behalf of his constituents.
In the Sentencing Bill, we have a proposal such that people who commit crimes of murder involving sexual and sadistic conduct will not be released, because they will be expected to serve a whole-life order.
That is just, on behalf of the British people, and it also helps to keep communities such as that of my hon.
Friend safe.
