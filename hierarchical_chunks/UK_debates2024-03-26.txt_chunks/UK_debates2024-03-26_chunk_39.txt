Yesterday the UN Security Council passed a resolution for a Ramadan ceasefire—in effect, a pause.
Intrinsic to that pause was the release of hostages.
Can the deputy Foreign Secretary please update us on progress to get those hostages home to safety, because the resolution was very clear that that should happen immediately?
Who is enforcing the immediate release of hostages?
Can he also clarify whether the Government agree with the US statement this morning that the UN Security Council resolution is non-binding?
How are we going to ensure that, on both sides, the return of hostages and the ceasefire for Ramadan are enacted?
If they are not, I fear that the UN Security Council will face an existential crisis.
My hon.
Friend, the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, sets out with great eloquence what the international community now requires to take place as a result of resolution 2728 being passed yesterday.
As I set out in my earlier remarks, we regret that the resolution has not condemned terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas on  7 October , but I want to re-emphasise that all the things that Britain has previously been calling for are now accepted and were recorded in that resolution.
We will, as my hon.
Friend suggests, continue to do everything we can to ensure that the resolution is implemented.
