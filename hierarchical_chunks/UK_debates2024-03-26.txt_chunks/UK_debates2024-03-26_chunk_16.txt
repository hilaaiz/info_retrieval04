I thank my hon.
Friend for his excellent question.
I give him a similar answer to the one I gave  the hon.
Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) .
One thing that has been transformative in victim support is the provision of not just independent sexual violence advisers, but independent domestic abuse advisers.
Again, there are nearly 1,000 advisers in the system helping victims every step of the way.
One thing that I am most excited about in this challenging area of the law is the pilot launching next month for domestic abuse protection orders, which will give police or victims the ability to go to the magistrates court or the family court to seek a blend of measures, whether that is a non-molestation order, an occupation order or a stalking protection order, and create positive obligations on the perpetrator, whether that is on alcohol abuse or through the perpetrator programme.
There is a comprehensive package of support for domestic abuse victims.
