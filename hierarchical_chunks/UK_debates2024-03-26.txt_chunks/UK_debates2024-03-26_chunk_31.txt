I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I was asked about my priorities when I was appointed to this role, and I said that the guilty should be convicted, that the innocent should walk free and that the public should be protected.
It is very important that people who are accused of an offence have confidence that  the process will be prompt and humane.
Ultimately, the British people are fair minded.
They want people to be rightfully convicted, but they also want the innocent to walk free.
