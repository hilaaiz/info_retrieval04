I thank my right hon.
Friend for the interest he is showing in this issue.
He is absolutely right to pay tribute to the New Futures Network, which does exceptional work in custody.
Of course, it is very often able to liaise with employment advisory boards—local business people in the area—to ensure that prisoners are trained in the skills that they need for jobs in that area.
When I went to HMP Berwyn, which is of course in Wales, one of the things that I was so impressed by is that its employment hub has a video suite, so that prisoners can be interviewed by employers on the outside.
On my right hon.
Friend’s point about ROTL, that is something that prison governors keep under review.
Certainly in the right cases, where ROTL is safe for the public, it can be a useful tool to ensure that prisoners are rehabilitated and get into work, so that they can be law-abiding citizens in the future.
