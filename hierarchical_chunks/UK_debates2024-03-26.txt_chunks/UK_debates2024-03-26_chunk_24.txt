May I gently say that there a lot of people I need to get in?
If we could shorten the answers, that would be helpful.
I recently met my constituent David Winnett, who is a family law solicitor and a member of Resolution.
He told me about Resolution’s vision for family justice.
I wonder whether my right hon.
and learned Friend is familiar with that vision, particularly the importance placed on early legal advice in family disputes.
Is there scope to add Resolution’s proposed scheme to the mediation pilots that the Government currently have planned?
Resolution does exceptionally important work, and in the Budget the Chancellor announced an additional £55 million of support for separating parents, including £12 million to deliver a new pilot.
We are working with Resolution and other organisations to implement the pilot, which we aim to launch in September this year.
