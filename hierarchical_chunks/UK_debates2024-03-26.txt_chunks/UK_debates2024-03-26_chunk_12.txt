Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I welcome my right hon.
and learned Friend’s comments about the progress made on tackling reoffending, but he will be aware that it remains stubbornly high.
We are in an unfortunate position: we imprison more people than most of our neighbours in Europe, but still have higher rates of reoffending.
Does that not posit the fact that we need to make more intelligent use of prison, and of alternatives to custody, as parts of a joined-up system?
Would he agree that the Sentencing Bill is particularly valuable in this regard, and can we hope for its swift return to the House?
