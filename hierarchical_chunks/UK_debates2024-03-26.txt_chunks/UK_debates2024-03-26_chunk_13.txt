I thank my hon.
and learned Friend for his excellent point.
He says something with which I passionately agree: strip out the emotion and follow the evidence.
The evidence shows that there are tools available to this generation of politicians that were not necessarily available 10 or 15 years ago.
I am talking not just about GPS tags, which we have doubled, but alcohol tags, with which there is a 97% compliance rate.
The reoffending rate among those who live with the sword of Damocles hanging over them can be much lower than for those who spend a short time in custody.
