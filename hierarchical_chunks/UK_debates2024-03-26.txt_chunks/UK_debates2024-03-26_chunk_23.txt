I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
When I was in practice, I had to listen to the then Labour Home Secretary say that he was going to cancel the three Titan prisons that he had boasted he would open.
Not one was built.
We have opened Five Wells and Fosse Way, and Millsike is under construction.
We have more cells coming online in Birmingham, Liverpool and Norwich.
We have rapid deployment cells, and we have new houseblocks in Guys Marsh, Rye Hill and Hatfield.
This is the party that is delivering.
We will be tough on crime.
