Radioman Scarpelli also served alongside his three brothers: Frank, who fought in the Pacific with the Army; John, who took part in the invasion of Northern France; and Augie, who manned guns on a Navy merchant ship in the Pacific.
Their shared service reflects the extraordinary sense of duty and sacrifice that defined their generation.
After the war, which he served through 1945, Radioman Scarpelli returned home to Michigan.
He completed a tool and die apprenticeship, earned a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and began a distinguished career at Ford Motor Company in Manufacturing Engineering.
There, he developed an innovative single-piece rear differential system that was later acquired by MIT.
He married in 1953, retired at age 55, and spent the decades that followed traveling the world, remaining dedicated to his family, faith, and community.
