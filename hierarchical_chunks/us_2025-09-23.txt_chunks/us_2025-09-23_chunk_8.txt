Mr. GRAY.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself and Congressman Kevin Mullin, I rise today to honor the life of Richard ``Dick'' Keigwin, a loving father and an employee of Nabisco and Kraft Food for 35 years.
Richard was born on May 8, 1944, and passed away on September 5, 2025, at the age of 81.
It is my honor to recognize a man who spent his life uplifting young people and caring for his family.
Richard served his Marlborough, Massachusetts community in a multitude of ways.
He coached Marlborough Little League, Northborough Little League, Boys Club Basketball, and CYO Basketball.
His devotion to coaching and mentoring earned him the title of ``Father of the Year'' by the Marlborough Boys Club.
He was also awarded Man and Boy of the Year 1987.
Richard was adored by his family.
He and his wife Cheryl Keigwin were married for 59 years.
He is survived by Cheryl and his sons, Richard Keigwin, Jr., Bryan Keigwin, and Adam Keigwin, along with grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Richard loved spending time with his family and especially enjoyed watching History Channel and National Geographic.
Adam and the Keigwin family are lifelong friends, and it is an honor to recognize Richard and his contributions to his community.
