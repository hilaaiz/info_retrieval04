Mr. Speaker, Nate Scarpelli's life is a testament to service and resilience.
Whether on the deck of the USS Moreno or in the engineering halls of Ford Motor Company, his contributions strengthened both our Nation's security and its industry.
It is my distinct honor to recognize him as our Veteran of the Month for October 2025.
