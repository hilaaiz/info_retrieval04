Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the final flight of the Bravo Company, 7-158th Chinook Helicopter General Support Aviation Battalion based out of the New Century AirCenter on September 7, 2025.
As a result of the Army Transformation Initiative, the unit was officially deactivated on September 15, 2025.
Based at New Century Airport for more than 40 years, this unit has become a staple in Gardner, Kansas and the surrounding community.
From the familiar sight of the Chinooks flying over Gardner, to the generations of families brought to our community through their service at New Century, the unit leaves behind decades of memories.
I am deeply grateful to the soldiers and their families who were a part of this unit, especially those service members who paid the ultimate sacrifice.
Our nation and communities are better and safer because of their service.
Furthermore, I want to express my strong support for the current service members who are facing uncertainty in the aftermath of the unit's deactivation.
I urge Army leadership to keep these dedicated service members in mind as they continue with the Army Transformation Initiative.
After all our service members and veterans have done for us, we must have their backs.
