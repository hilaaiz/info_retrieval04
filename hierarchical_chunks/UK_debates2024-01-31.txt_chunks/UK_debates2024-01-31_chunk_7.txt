On the issue of the energy mix, the Tata workers I met last week know that the virgin steel they make is vital to supporting our renewable energy aspirations, such as offshore wind in the Celtic sea, so the loss of 3,000 jobs is a kick in the teeth for our proud and skilled Welsh steelworkers.
It will devastate local economies and the sovereign steelmaking capacity that would build the wind turbines we need, yet the Business Secretary told us at the weekend: “It’s not about the job losses”.
Does the Secretary of State agree with her comments?
I am sorry that the hon.
Lady has me replying to that question, not the Secretary of State.
It is important to recognise that the investment from this UK Government has saved thousands of jobs across the United Kingdom.
Of course, the transition board is now working with the individuals affected in Port Talbot, which is the proper and right thing to do.
I am glad that both the UK and Welsh Governments are working towards that; it is absolutely the right outcome.
We need to think about these things in the wider context, which is our responsibility.
