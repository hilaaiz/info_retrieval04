That was a perfect answer.
I have to tell the House that we have a lot of business to get through today, and I will therefore need short questions and admirably short answers, because otherwise not everyone who is standing will have a chance to ask a question.
I do not agree with most of what the Minister has said today.
We are all in favour of pharmacies, but I think this statement is a distraction from the real problems in our health service, our GP service and much else.
Order.
Will the hon.
Gentleman please ask a question?
Has the Minister looked at the number of pharmacies that have closed in the poorest areas of our country?
Lastly, what is she going to do about companies like Boots?
It has even closed its local branch in Westminster— Order.
Because of his seniority, I have allowed the hon.
Gentleman a little leeway.
One question, one answer.
The more deprived parts of England are much better served by community pharmacies than better-off areas are.
We have amazing pharmacists in Watford, and I have championed community pharmacies such as Sigma, which is a fantastic local business.
Can the Minister provide an assurance that the general public will be made massively aware of this fantastic new service?
Yes, there will be a significant communications package, beginning today.
