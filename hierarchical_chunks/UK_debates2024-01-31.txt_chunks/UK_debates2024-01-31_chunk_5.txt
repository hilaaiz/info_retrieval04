I thank my right hon.
Friend, the Chair of the Select Committee, for that question.
I am delighted that today the Crown Estate is hosting a bidders day to drive forward plans for innovative floating wind projects in the Celtic sea.
The UK Government are supporting FLOW through our contracts for difference scheme, securing a long-term pipeline of projects in the Celtic sea.
I would be happy to write to him with a further update on when more progress can be discussed.
