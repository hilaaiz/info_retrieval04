Let me start by paying tribute to the many organisations that have been involved in preparing for this launch and the thousands of pharmacies across the country that have embraced this initiative.
Labour has long been arguing that pharmacists should play a greater role in the NHS, so we support this move.
As the Minister has said, pharmacies already do far more than just dispense repeat prescriptions and sell shampoo: they are medicine experts within the NHS; they are highly trained; they are easily accessible right across the country; and, as we saw during the pandemic, they are a highly trusted part of their communities.
But their skills and knowledge are often under-utilised.
Therefore, bringing more services to British high streets for patients to get treated more quickly and  conveniently is absolutely right.
It is why, as we announced last week, we want to bring NHS out-patient appointments closer to people through high street opticians too.
