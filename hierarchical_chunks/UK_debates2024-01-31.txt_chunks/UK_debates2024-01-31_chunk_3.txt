Some 8,000 homeowners in Wales face the Tory mortgage bombshell this month, with households projected to pay an extra £240 per month as their fixed-rate deals come to an end.
Despite the Conservative party’s opposition, the Welsh Government have put in place measures to prevent   repossessions, and a UK Labour Government would require banks to protect homeowners.
What is the Secretary of State doing to help homeowners facing massive bills caused by the Conservative party’s economic mismanagement?
The UK Government have put in place a number of measures to support any mortgage holders facing difficulties at the moment, but the most important measure has been to bring down inflation.
Inflation actually peaked at a higher rate in Europe than in the United Kingdom.
Inflation is now down at 4%—much less than half of what it was previously—which will have a beneficial impact on mortgage interest rates over the longer term.
I ask the hon.
Lady whether, in all fairness, she thinks that her party’s plans to borrow £28 billion a year, which is going to increase inflation and have a very bad impact on mortgage interest rates, will be good or bad for homeowners?
