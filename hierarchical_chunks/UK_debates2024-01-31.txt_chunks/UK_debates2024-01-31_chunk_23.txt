I welcome the Pharmacy First initiative—its roll-out is long overdue—but what expectations are we creating in the minds of patients attending pharmacies?
Will pharmacists be trained in denying medication to people who turn up expecting to be given a prescription of some sort?
Clearly, the initiative will encourage more people to present in order to get medication when it may not be necessary.
