The Prime Minister just does not get how hard it is for millions of people across the country like Phil.
That is the primary problem: they are struggling with their mortgages, their bills and the spiralling cost of living.
The Prime Minister’s response is never to take responsibility, and never to show contrition or even any level of basic understanding.
He is so detached that he thinks he can paint a world in which their problems simply do not exist.
The problem is that he cannot even fool his own MPs, let alone anyone else.
The hon.
Member for Mid Norfolk says he is “exhausted” and is looking forward to new opportunities outside of Parliament.
Why does the Prime Minister not do him a favour and call an election, so that he and the whole country can move on?
Whether it is Phil or everyone else across the country, the plan that we are putting in place is working to help people and we are making progress: just this week, taking action to stop children vaping; just this week, ensuring that people can visit their pharmacies to get the healthcare they need, freeing up millions of GP appointments; and just this week, millions of working people starting to see hundreds of pounds of tax cuts delivered in their pay packet.
That is a plan that is working.
All the right hon.
and Learned Gentleman is offering is £28 billion of tax rises.
And that is the choice: a brighter future with us or back to square one with them.
