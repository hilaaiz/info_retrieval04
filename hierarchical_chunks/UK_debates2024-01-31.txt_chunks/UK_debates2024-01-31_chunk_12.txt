The Prime Minister likes to attend live sport, so I wonder whether he will join me in welcoming the planning inspector’s decision to uphold Rugby Council’s rejection of an application for development at Brandon Stadium in my constituency, to keep the doors open for it to remain a sporting venue so that future generations will enjoy the thrills and spills of motorcycle speedway and stock cars.
I join my hon.
Friend in paying tribute and being proud of Britain’s rich history in the automotive and motorsport sectors.
The stadium he talks about is an historic motorsport venue.
While it has been a shame to see it fall into disrepair, I hope that the  decision he refers to will enable the possibility of both speedway and stock car racing to return.
I know that he will continue, rightly, to champion this cause.
