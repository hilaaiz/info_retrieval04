Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition of Philip Brunelle, world-renowned conductor, organist, and choral scholar, in celebration of his 80th birthday.
Throughout his life and career, 
Mr. Brunelle has promoted the choral arts in all its forms.
At age 19, he became the youngest member of the Minnesota Orchestra, and by age 25, he was appointed choirmaster of the Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis, MN, a position that he still holds today.
In 1969 
Mr. Brunelle founded VocalEssence, 1 of the largest and most prestigious choral organizations in the country.
Under his leadership, VocalEssence has commissioned more than 300 works to date, promoting rarely heard works from the past in addition to remarkable new music.
VocalEssence has brought great distinction to the Twin Cities arts community, earning numerous recognition and awards from the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, as well as the Margaret Hillis Achievement Award for Choral Excellence, an outstanding achievement and an unparalleled honor in the choral music community.
