Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my dear friend former Maryland State 
Senator Norman R. Stone, Jr., who sadly passed away last month at the age of 87.
I join many Marylanders and Americans in mourning his loss and in giving thanks for his life of service.
Elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1962 and later to the State Senate in 1966, Norman served in the Maryland General Assembly for 52 years.
We became good friends and close colleagues during our time in the State Senate together.
He had become the longest-serving member of the Maryland General Assembly by the time of his retirement in 2015.
Not only was the length of Norman's tenure admirable, so too was his character.
Norman was 1 of the most steadfast, trustworthy, and honest people I've known.
Although I did not agree with him on every issue, he never judged me or anyone else for a difference in opinion.
He was humble and forthright--never 1 to resort to showmanship and politicking.
You always knew where he stood on an issue.
And you always knew that Norman would do what he thought was right for his constituents.
He was truly an exemplary legislator.
Norman showed devotion not only to public service but also to his family.
My prayers are with his wife of 38 years Joanne; his children Norman, David, Jerry, and Lori; his stepson Lennie Lehner, Jr.; his 7 grandchildren; and the rest of his family.
I like so many others throughout our community and state, grieve with them.
I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring Norman, who lived a life worthy of emulation--a life of service, character, and conviction.
