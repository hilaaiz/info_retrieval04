Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack's 20 years of service on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Justice Roggensack's legal legacy will be long remembered.
She helped to guide the court throughout her tenure during some of its most important times.
She has mentored countless attorneys and judges and will continue to serve as an important role model for the next generation of judges.
She will always serve as their fiercest advocate.
Justice Roggensack led a historic career.
Before serving on the Supreme Court, Justice Roggensack served on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals for 7 years.
She was elected to the Supreme Court in 2003.
I had the great honor of working for Justice Roggensack shortly after law school and saw her dedication to the law, her diligent work ethic, and her compassion for serving Wisconsin.
Everyone who has worked with Justice Roggensack, including myself, has benefited from her mentorship.
12 years after her election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice Roggensack became the first Justice to be elected by her colleagues in the court to the position.
She held the position of Chief Justice for 6 years until relinquishing it in 2021.
Justice Roggensack's incredible service, dedication, and outstanding accomplishments will be long remembered after her July 31, 2023 retirement.
I congratulate Justice Patience Roggensack on her retirement and 20 years of service to Wisconsin.
