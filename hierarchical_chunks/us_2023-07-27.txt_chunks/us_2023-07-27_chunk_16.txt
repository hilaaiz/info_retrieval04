Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Gerald W. Duncan, who passed away on July 10, 2023, after a valiant three-plus year fight against Alzheimer's Disease.
After receiving his undergraduate degree from Virginia Tech and a master's in business administration from Radford University, 
Mr. Duncan began his career in 1967 as a software developer with the Research, Development, & Acquisition Information Systems Agency, Department of the Army, where he was honored with many awards during his 35 years of service.
He then pivoted careers, being elected as Treasurer of Giles County in 2000.
His success as Treasurer led him to being voted Treasurer of the Year for the State.
Mr. Duncan loved serving the people Treasurer.
When not working, 
Mr. Duncan loved to hunt deer, bears, and turkey throughout the country.
He was elected president of the Virginia State Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation for 3 consecutive terms, championing conservation of the wild turkey.
But most importantly, 
Mr. Duncan's proudest achievement was being a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
