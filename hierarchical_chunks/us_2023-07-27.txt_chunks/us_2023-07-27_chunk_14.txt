Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Harry Edman Sexton, a U.S. Marine Corp Colonel who graduated from my alma mater, Anaheim High School, in 1950.
Born in Anaheim, Colonel Sexton passed away Feb. 15, 2023, after living 90 years of a full life that included a distinguished military career.
He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps 2 years after graduating from Anaheim High and served for 26 years.
A Navy Cross awardee, our country's second-highest award for bravery, Colonel Sexton flew more than 400 combat missions during two tours of Vietnam.
During his first tour, he commanded the only Marine F-8 Crusader Fighter Squadron to deploy from Navy Carrier USS Oriskany.
On his second tour, he commanded a squadron of HMLA-367 ``Scarface'' Cobra Helicopters, providing air support, day or night, under all weather conditions, to Marine ground combat units.
He received the Navy Cross for heroism during Operation Tailwind as he and his fellow ``Scarface'' Cobra Gunships engaged the enemy to provide cover for the extraction of a nearly overwhelmed force of U.S. Army Special Operators out.
He was also awarded two Legion of Merits with Combat ``V'', a Distinguished Flying Cross, 44 Air Medals/Strike Flight Awards, and was inducted into the Golden Eagles for his distinguished career as an aviator.
His wife of 65 years, Ann, son Harry Jr., and daughter Stacie will remember him as a husband and father who lived for others, giving freely of his time, skill, and love to all who were fortunate enough to have known him.
He is also survived by 4 grandchildren; and a great grandson.
I thank the Colonel for his service.
