Mr. STAUBER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of my friend, Terry Stone, from International Falls, Minnesota.
Terry embodied the spirit of northern Minnesota throughout his life.
He started a radio club while attending Falls High School and later graduated from Bemidji State University.
He was a local businessman who was actively involved in his community, and even served as the president of the local Chamber of Commerce.
Terry also spent time as a volunteer with the International Health Service in Honduras where he helped provide medical and dental care to those in need.
He even used his passion and expertise in radio to help set up solar powered radio systems to help clinics in rural villages communicate with each other.
Terry had a servant's heart and a passion for helping out those in need.
He will be missed.
May Terry's legacy live on in our communities.
