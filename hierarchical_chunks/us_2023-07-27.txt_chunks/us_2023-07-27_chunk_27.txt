Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Turkish American Cultural Association of Michigan, it is my honor to recognize the 99th anniversary of the founding of the Republic.
For nearly a century, Turkiye and the Turkish people have served as a beacon of cooperation, democratic ideals, and good citizenship.
Over the course of my career, I have had the opportunity to travel to Turkey, meet with Turkish leaders, and get to know the Turkish-American community in Michigan Turkish Republic Day is an annual milestone and has been celebrated with great pride and joy since the republic's founding on October 29th, 1923, by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk By replacing an aging empire with a vibrant democratic republic, Turkiye facilitated its own modernization and established itself on the National stage, including by being an important member of NATO for 70 years.
Today, Turkiye remains a vital ally--from our work together against terrorist organizations, to countering international adversaries like Russia In Michigan, the Turkish diaspora community and those of Turkish descent have had a lasting impact on our state's culture, economic development, and education system, and have personified Michigan's ideal citizen This especially includes the Turkish-American Cultural Association of Michigan, which has worked to promote Turkish culture and support programs benefitting the welfare of citizens throughout the state.
The impact of their work on the people and communities of Michigan cannot be understated
