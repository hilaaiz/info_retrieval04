Mr. RUTHERFORD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 15th anniversary of Deutsche Bank in Jacksonville, Florida.
Over the past 15 years, Deutsche Bank has played an integral role in supporting our region's thriving financial sector and community.
While Deutsche Bank's roots in America go back to 1872, their Jacksonville office began as a small operation in 2008 consisting of approximately 100 employees.
Since then, the Jacksonville office has grown to become Deutsche Bank's second largest location in the Americas, employing approximately 2,400 talented individuals and generating significant local economic activity.
The Deutsche Bank Jacksonville office is a multi-functional site that generates new business and provides client and bank-wide support services with a significant presence and expertise in sales and trading, anti-financial crime, compliance, technology, cyber security services, client onboarding and operational support.
In the last 15 years, the office has created thousands of jobs, financed local businesses, and supported many community causes such as public education, the arts, combating hunger, work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy.
