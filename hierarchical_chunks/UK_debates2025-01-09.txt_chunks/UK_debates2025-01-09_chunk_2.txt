The Secretary of State was asked— What financial support she is providing to local transport authorities and mayors.
Welcome, Secretary of State.
May I start by saying it is very good to be here?
I wish you, Mr Speaker, and the House staff a happy new year, and I wish the Aviation Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane) , a happy birthday.
He will not want to be reminded of his age.
[Laughter.]
In the Budget, the Government confirmed more than £1 billion of funding to support bus services, an additional £200 million for the city region sustainable transport settlements for eligible mayors, more than £650 million for local transport outside the city regions, a £500 million increase in local highways maintenance, and £485 million in capital funding for Transport for London.
I begin by welcoming the Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box for her first question time.
She brings great experience of working to bring transport authorities together.
My constituency of Worsley and Eccles suffers from regular serious rush-hour congestion.
How can she support transport authorities in urban areas to work with neighbouring authorities to ensure a strategic approach is taken across commuter belts to alleviate congestion?
