I welcome the Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box, and say happy birthday to the Aviation Minister.
Buses in my constituency are not adequate and the situation has been made worse since the £2 fare cap was lifted.
Local authorities in Bath want to improve the situation.
They want to franchise bus services themselves, but their hands are tied by the Labour West of England combined authority Mayor, who refuses to do so.
What should local authorities such as Bath do?
