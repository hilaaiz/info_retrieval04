I welcome my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State to her place.
Potholes represent a serious issue in Basingstoke, with many constituents telling me of damaged vehicles and even physical injuries.
The AA, which is based in Basingstoke, highlights inconsistent standards across the country, with some potholes left unaddressed for longer than others.
The Pothole Partnership urges UK-wide standards and permanent repairs over temporary fixes.
I welcome the Government’s additional investment to tackle this issue, but will the Secretary of State consider ensuring that councils adopt common standards so that communities such as Basingstoke no longer face dangerous, crumbling roads?
