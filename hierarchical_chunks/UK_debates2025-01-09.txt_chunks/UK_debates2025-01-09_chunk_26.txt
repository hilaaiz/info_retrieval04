May I take this opportunity to express my sadness at the passing of my Liberal Democrat transport colleague, Baroness Jenny Randerson?
Jenny was a force of nature, intelligent, kind, hard-working and principled, with a mischievous wit and love of life.
I learned a huge amount from her in the few months we worked together, and will miss her deeply.
Improving transport links to Wales was an issue close to Baroness Randerson’s heart, and one she regularly pressed in the other House.
Will the Secretary of State review the Tories’ decision to class HS2 as an England and Wales project, thus depriving Wales of billions of pounds of Barnett formula funding, and will she commit to a high-speed rail link from Birmingham to Crewe to ensure that mid and north Wales can at least share the benefits of HS2?
May I extend my condolences and those of the Government to the family of Baroness Randerson?
I know she was a deeply loved and highly respected colleague to many.
On the hon.
Gentleman’s substantive question, I have already met Ken Skates, the Welsh Minister for Transport, and I am working closely with the Secretary of State for Wales to ensure that we bring public transport improvements to Wales, which I hope will be Baroness Randerson’s lasting legacy.
What steps she is taking to improve accessibility at Pokesdown railway station.
South Western Railway has been working closely with Network Rail and the local authority  to provide a viable scheme that will result in the installation of new lifts at the station.
To establish the likely cost of the scheme and assess affordability, detailed design works are under way and are expected to be finalised in 2025.
