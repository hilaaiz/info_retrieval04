On  6 November , the Chancellor said: “We have now set the envelope for spending for this Parliament, and we are not going to be coming back with more tax increases or, indeed, with more borrowing.”
I am sure, because the Chancellor is an honourable lady, that she will not be opening that envelope, putting her sticky fingers inside and coming out with more borrowing or tax increases.
Will the Minister give an absolute assurance of no more tax increases or borrowing?
I can absolutely assure the Father of the House that we are working through this spending review on the basis of the envelope set at the Budget.
Public services will have to operate within the means that we are providing to them.
The OBR forecast will come in March, which will give us the latest set of information, and we will work to that with Departments.
This is why we have set up organisations such as the Office for Value for Money, why we have set tough productivity and efficiency targets for Departments and why we are investing in, for example, technology to improve the productivity of the public services we provide.
Public services must live within their means, as set out in the Budget, and that is an absolute guarantee from this Government.
