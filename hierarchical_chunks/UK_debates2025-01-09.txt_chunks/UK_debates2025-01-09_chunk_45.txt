I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for her question.
As the House knows, we have started the second phase of the spending review, to set public  sector budgets from 2026-27 onwards.
The Chancellor confirmed in a written ministerial statement before the House rose for Christmas that there will be a forecast from the OBR and a statement on  26 March .
As I said in my response, that will be the next time the OBR will give a view about the UK economy and the levels of funding for public services.
Between the OBR forecast in March and the conclusion of the spending review in June, the House will be updated in the normal way.
