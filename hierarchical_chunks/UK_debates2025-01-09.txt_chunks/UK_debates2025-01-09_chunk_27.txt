I thank the Minister for that very helpful answer.
The people of Pokesdown are certainly very keen for their lift, which they have been waiting a long time for.
Back in the 1980s and 1990s, train services between Bournemouth and London Waterloo took the historically fastest time of 90 minutes.
Will the Minister meet me and South Western Railway to discuss whether we can restore that fast time, as well as to discuss Pokesdown?
