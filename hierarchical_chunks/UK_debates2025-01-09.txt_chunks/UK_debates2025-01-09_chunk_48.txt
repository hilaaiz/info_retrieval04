I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
He will note from the Prime Minister’s plan for change that the NHS is the subject of one of this Government’s key commitments, with commitments to get the elective waiting list down and to invest in the national health service so that we can do so.
He will have heard that from the Chancellor at the Budget in the autumn, and he will see that it is a continued commitment from this Government.
We can do that because of our commitment to the fiscal rules and because of our investment to grow the economy, which is the only route to long-term, sustainable public financing.
