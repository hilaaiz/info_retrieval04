The Secretary of State’s constituents will also be affected.
Compensation comes in many forms.
It may be in the form of better wi-fi on trains to improve the service for business users.
It may be in the form of more rolling stock to end the bizarre practice of running half-length trains out of Paddington at peak times.

I hope the Minister will confirm that all these things are being looked into for passengers in my constituency and the Secretary of State’s constituency.
The Rail Minister has met MPs from both sides of the House to discuss this issue and has attended an industry programme board to ensure that passenger interests are considered and that disruption is minimised for passengers, both during and after construction.
2025 is an exciting year for Derby, partly because of the progress on Great British Railways, which will be headquartered in Derby, and rightly so.

This means improving performance and timetables to make the best use of the capacity we have, but it also means investing in new and improved infrastructure, such as High Speed 2, the trans-Pennine route upgrade and East West Rail.
