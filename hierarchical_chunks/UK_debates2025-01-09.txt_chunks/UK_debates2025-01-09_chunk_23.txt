The original vision for HS2 was to link London with the midlands and the north, and to address the growing capacity challenge on the west coast main line with a whole new rail line.
The last Government panicked and mothballed much of the project because of cost overruns on phase 1, thus incurring yet further costs.
I welcome the Secretary of State’s commitment to get a grip on the  phase 1 cost overruns, but do the Government plan to deliver a rail solution linking phase 1, north of Birmingham, to the rest of the country, thus delivering the Government’s vision to drive growth for the whole country?
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on her election as Chair of the Transport Committee.
She will be formidable and I look forward to working with her.
I am pleased that my hon.
Friend raises the question of the mess we inherited from the Conservative Government on HS2 and rail connectivity in the north.
When we entered Government in July, we found a rag-bag collection of half- baked, unfunded spending commitments for rail schemes up and down the country.
The previous Government drew up their Network North plans on the back of a napkin.
As part of the spending review, we have started the hard work of identifying a realistic pipeline of schemes that is affordable and will deliver better connectivity in partnership with local leaders.
