I thank my hon.
Friend, who has been a huge campaigner for Grangemouth.
We have committed to bringing forward the revenue certainty mechanism.
We have already legislated for a 2% fuel mix in the SAF mandate, which came into force on  1 January  this year, and we look forward to the Bill coming before the House when parliamentary time allows.
