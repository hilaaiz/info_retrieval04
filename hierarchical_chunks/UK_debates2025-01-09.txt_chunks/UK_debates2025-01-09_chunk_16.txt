The hon.
Member is a doughty champion of air travel and SAF in Northern Ireland.
Through the advanced fuels fund, we have 13 projects and we are currently investing well over £100 million across the UK to see what comes forward in the market, and I hope that Northern Ireland will be integral to that process.
