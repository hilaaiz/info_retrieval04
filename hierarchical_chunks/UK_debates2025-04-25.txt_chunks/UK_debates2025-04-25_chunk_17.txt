The hon.
Gentleman is asking us to take a leap of faith.
The Bill is one line.
If he had the answers to those questions already, the referendum result might well have been different.
[Interruption.]
Sorry, the Bill is two lines.
The Bill could create uncertainty for employers, particularly in sectors that rely on a flexible and diverse labour market, such as construction, healthcare and agriculture.
I have outlined the similarities of my constituency to those of my Scottish colleagues, but were I to suggest that the Isle of Wight had its own immigration laws to help correct our demographics and workforce, they would beg me to talk more about ferries.
My hon.
Friend is making an excellent speech, and he makes a pertinent point that there are parts of the United Kingdom outside Scotland that also suffer with demographic challenges.
One of those is Stoke-on-Trent.
To suggest that Stoke-on-Trent should be able to issue its own visa or have its own immigration policy to solve that is for the birds.
Given that the last Government left record high levels of inward migration to this country, does he agree that part of the solution is to think about how we make it more attractive to work in these places, rather than simply rewriting the system for our own benefit?
I agree entirely with my hon.
Friend.
While the Bill clearly seeks to help and support employers in Scotland with workforce issues, consideration must also be given to employers in England that do not want an extra layer of bureaucracy added to their recruitment processes.
Moreover, this Bill does not explain how a devolved system would integrate with the existing national framework.
It is one thing to talk about devolving powers, but where is the clarity on how the new system would coexist with the broader UK immigration process?
Without the answers, we risk creating more confusion than solutions, with businesses, local governments and migrants alike caught in a web of complexity.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that given that the SNP has failed to run vital services in Scotland, we should not give it control of a border?
I agree with my hon.
Friend.
Let us be clear that setting up a separate immigration system in Scotland would not come free or cheap.
We are talking about creating entire new departments, new staff, new infrastructure, new IT systems and likely new border controls, all of which would need to be designed, staffed and maintained.
Who would foot the bill for that bureaucratic expansion?
It would be ordinary working people across the whole of the UK.
Let us not forget that immigration is already a complex and resource-intensive process under a single UK system.
The hon.
Member is asking us some valuable questions on things that need to be probed a little bit deeper, such as cost and complexity.
Those are all matters we are having to consider under Brexit, which is costing £40 billion a year.
[Interruption.]
I can hear the chuntering, but I am addressing the Member on whom I am intervening.
[Hon.
Members: “Ooh!”] Are you surprised?
That is how a proper adult debate happens.
I ask the hon.
Member this important question: given that he is asking some legitimate questions that he and we would like to explore, why not bring the Bill to a vote, so that we can take it forward to Committee to explore those questions further?
Order.
Before I call Richard Quigley, may I just remind Members that good temper and moderation are the hallmark of this Parliament?
