I am sorry to interrupt my hon.
Friend’s excellent speech.
He spoke about the flow of people.
What this two-clause Bill does not set out is any controls or mechanisms by which that could be measured.
There was mention of Ireland earlier; I have a slight fear that this will turn into a debate about a soft and hard border, and what that means for the UK.
I find this very divisive.
Does he agree?
Indeed I do.
For example, will there be immigration checks at the border?
What happens when someone granted immigration status in Scotland seeks work in Newcastle, Manchester or London?
Will employers in those cities suddenly be tasked with verifying whether an individual is subject to Scottish immigration rules?
These are not just theoretical concerns; they are real logistical and administrative challenges.
Without clarity and co-ordination, businesses across the UK could be forced to navigate a confusing patchwork of immigration rules that add unnecessary complexity and cost to the workforce.
