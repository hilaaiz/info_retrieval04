I thank the Secretary of State, because that was a valuable intervention and he raises a good point—[Interruption.]
I am glad that he is paying attention now.
I raised that point at the start of the debate, when I said that this is not ideal.
It is a short Bill that was proposed some time ago and, as I have said, I am very open to it being amended.
I hope we will vote on this today and I ask the Secretary of State to meet me so that he and I can sit down with his officials, and Home Office officials if they will listen to him, and bring them in.
I am looking to the Secretary of State and hope that he will today give that commitment to meet me so that we get something that works for his party, can work for others and can hopefully work for the sector as well.
[Interruption.]
I will take that as a yes, so I am very glad and thank him for being so constructive.
