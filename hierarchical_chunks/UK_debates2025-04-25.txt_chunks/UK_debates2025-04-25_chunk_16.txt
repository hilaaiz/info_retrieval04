I thank the hon.
Member for giving way.
He talks about the challenges of operating a system across  the Scotland-England border effectively.
That is not difficult in an age of digital technology.
Does he agree that it could be easily achieved?
If we can achieve the arrangements that we have with Ireland and a common travel area, why could it not work to have a regional immigration system?
