I thank  the hon.
Member for Arbroath and Broughty Ferry (Stephen Gethins)  for his speech, although, as my children say, that is 50 minutes we will never get back.
Even though I rise today representing a constituency that lies some 488 miles from Scotland, much of what I hear from Scottish colleagues on both sides of the House resonates deeply with me as a Member from an island constituency.
Although this Bill may focus on matters far from Isle of Wight West, it has given me a chance to reflect on some fond memories of Scotland, whether that is searching for dolphins around Nairn, regularly visiting Edinburgh, or my trip to Faslane to learn about nuclear submarines.
I have a very fond memory of my visit to Largs to work with the Scottish office of the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust, an organisation that does fantastic and vital work with children to rebuild their confidence after their battle with cancer.
Its dedication is a powerful reminder that no matter the distance between our communities, we share common challenges and, often, shared solutions.
