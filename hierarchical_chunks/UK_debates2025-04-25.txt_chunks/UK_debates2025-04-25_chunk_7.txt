I thank the hon.
Member for giving way and for bringing forward this debate, which is interesting if nothing else.
How does the SNP suggest we encourage people to live in Scotland, and particularly rural Scotland, given that anyone in Scotland earning over £28,500 pays more income tax; local government has a £760 billion-odd shortfall, which affects rural communities more, given how money is spent over a larger area; and Scotland has a housing crisis?
How do those things attract people?
