I thank the hon.
Gentleman for indulging me a second time.
He references Brexit.
Can he clarify for the House why his party spent less on campaigning against Brexit than on a local by-election campaign in Scotland?
The newfound conversion to opposing Brexit might be welcome, but that clarification would be helpful.
