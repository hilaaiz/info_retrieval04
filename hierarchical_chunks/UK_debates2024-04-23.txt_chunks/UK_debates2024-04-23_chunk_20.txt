I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that matter, which shows the cynicism with which the tobacco and vaping industry is approaching these landmark public health reforms.
On vapes, we have committed to consulting on the powers that we are adopting in the Bill precisely because we want to ensure that the regulations, when they come to the fore, address the realities of the market and the cynicism of the companies behind it, and help to ensure that our children do not continue being plied with these horrible items to get them hooked on nicotine.
