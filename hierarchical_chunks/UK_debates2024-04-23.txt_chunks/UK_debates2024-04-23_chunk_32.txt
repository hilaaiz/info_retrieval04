The hon.
Lady asked me, as everyone does, about the Government’s substantive response on compensation more broadly.
As I have indicated, I appointed the expert group in January to examine some of the issues in the recommendations, such as the need for redress for those living with chronic hepatitis B when that chronic infection definition did not exist.
I have been seeking professional advice on the operationalisation of the recommendations.
The conclusions of those deliberations, and the quantification and discernment of compensation, will be a matter for the Government when the final report has been published.
Like others, I have cases that have been waiting decades for a resolution, and which were pursued by my predecessor.
When will those affected be able to start applying for compensation?
I refer my hon.
Friend to my reply a few moments ago about the £100,000 payment to the estates of deceased infected persons.
The ultimate compensation will depend on what is arranged through conversations across Whitehall as soon as possible after  20 May .
We are making good progress, and I want to bring that forward as quickly as I can after  20 May .
Given the will of the House and the letter signed by so many MPs, it is pretty clear that it is on the Government to deliver, and that is what I am seeking to do as quickly as I can.
