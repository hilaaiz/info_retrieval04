I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this, and I very much send our best wishes to her constituent.
The hon.
Lady raises a really important point.
The symptoms that women can experience are often very different for conditions relating not just to cancer, but to heart attacks, for example.
Part of my prioritisation of women’s health is to get that message out to clinicians so that, as this case demonstrates so tragically, they are able to make the best and most prompt diagnosis for all women.
