I thank my right hon.
Friend for his remarks and for what he has done on this matter.
He is right: I feel responsibility both to get the substantive announcement agreed as quickly as possible and to ensure clear communication with the infected and affected community so that they have clear expectations of what will happen following that announcement.
From all I have read and all that my officials have briefed me on, I recognise that this is likely to be one of the biggest scandals in the NHS that this country has seen.
I respect Sir Brian Langstaff and his extensive work over several years.
I wait respectfully for his final report on the wider issues on  20 May .
