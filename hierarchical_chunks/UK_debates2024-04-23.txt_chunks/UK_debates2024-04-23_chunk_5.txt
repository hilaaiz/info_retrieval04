At the last general election, the Government promised to deliver 6,000 more GPs by 2024-25, but there are still 2,000 fewer GPs than in 2015.
Part of the problem is that morale has plummeted in the past decade, meaning that experienced family doctors and newly qualified GPs are hanging up their stethoscopes.
What does the Minister say after scrapping two GP retention schemes last month?
Will she come clean today about another broken manifesto promise?
The hon.
Lady is choosing numbers out of the air.
She will be aware that there are almost 3,000 more GPs now than in 2019, and very importantly the long-term workforce plan is scheduled to introduce 6,000 new training places by 2031-32.
In 2022, we had the greatest number ever of new trainee GPs.
That is great news for GP practice, as they are crucial to primary care.
What steps she is taking to ensure adequate funding for hospital repairs.
May I wish you a happy St. George’s day, Mr Speaker?
I also wish  the hon.
Member for Bristol South (Karin Smyth)  a speedy recovery; I hope to see her across the Dispatch Box soon.
The Government have invested significant sums to maintain and modernise NHS buildings, including £4.2 billion for integrated care boards this financial year.
This is on top of the expected £20 billion for the new hospital programme.
We have invested a further £1.7 billion for over 70 hospital upgrades across England, including in mid and south Essex.
