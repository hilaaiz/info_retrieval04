I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that matter.
I understand that a consultation was conducted locally and that more than 5,000 local people and staff responded.
Their feedback will be analysed by an independent research agency, which will produce a report for the Mid and South Essex ICB, and a meeting is due to take place in public in July.
I will, of course, continue to take an interest in this matter.
