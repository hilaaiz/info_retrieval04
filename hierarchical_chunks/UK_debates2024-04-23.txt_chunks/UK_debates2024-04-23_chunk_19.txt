Ministers will be aware of a rather boastful claim last weekend by the makers of Elfbar and Lost Mary vapes.
They have already launched rechargeable, refillable products, which, with a coil in each pod, are not by definition single-use or disposable according to the published regulations.
Can the Minister reassure the House and parents that they are alive to that and will pivot as necessary now that the Tobacco and Vapes Bill is going into Committee?
