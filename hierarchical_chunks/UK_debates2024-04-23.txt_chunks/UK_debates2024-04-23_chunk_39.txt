I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his heartfelt representation on behalf of his constituent Mark Fox, and I am sincerely sorry for what he has experienced.
I am doing everything I can to bring as much clarity as possible, but I cannot give the hon.
Gentleman a definitive timetable today.
I am working towards—I hope—giving a definitive timetable at the point of, or very soon after, the publication of this final report.
I will do everything I can to bring clarity to all groups involved.
