I thank my hon.
Friend, both for what he has said today and for his engagement privately in recent weeks.
I agree with everything he has said, and I have heard his challenge to be clear about communications to prominent charities, organisations and support groups.
Letters were sent by my officials yesterday evening to set up those meetings.
I have talked to cross-party representatives of the all-party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminated blood, seeking input on the names of groups.
I am trying to respect their confidence while also meeting as many representative groups as possible, and to do that well before  20 May .
