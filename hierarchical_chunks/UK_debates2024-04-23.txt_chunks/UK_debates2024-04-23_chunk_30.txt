I congratulate my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson)  on securing an urgent question on this vital issue.
Nobody could fail to be moved by the scale of the horror and injustice of this scandal.
The latest revelations about apparent experiments on children, to which the urgent question relates, are truly appalling and show yet again how badly the victims have been let down.
I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned so hard on the issue.
As part of delivering the justice that is so long overdue, the Government must now deliver on the compensation scheme.
Time is of the essence: every week that passes without further Government action matters.
Those who were infected with contaminated blood are dying at a rate of one every four days.
Ministers have repeatedly accepted the moral case for compensation, but victims understandably have little faith and want to see firm action.
That is why Labour was very disturbed to hear that the Government have tabled an amendment to undo the cross-party changes to the Victims and Prisoners Bill passed by this House in December last year.
The changes that the Government want would have the effect of removing a clear commitment to delivering on the compensation scheme within three months of the Bill’s passing—yet another missed opportunity; yet another delay.
I would be grateful if the Minister answered the following questions.
Will the Government now consider accepting the cross-party consensus of establishing a clear three-month limit for the setting up of the scheme?
Can the Minister confirm when victims can expect to receive final compensation payments following the publication of Sir Brian Langstaff’s review?
