I thank my hon.
Friend, and also wish her the very best of luck, as she is due to abseil down the hospital next month for its radiotherapy appeal.
I very much hope she lands safely and does not trouble Southend hospital.
I was delighted to visit the hospital at her invitation earlier this month, and I was very much impressed by the immediate improvements that the £8 million funding has meant in the Dowsett  ward and for discharge and treatment times through accident and emergency.
This is part of our plan, both through the urgent and emergency care plan and through our recovery plan for electives and the new hospital programme, to rebuild hospitals and provide that investment so that clinicians can use it to treat their local patients.
