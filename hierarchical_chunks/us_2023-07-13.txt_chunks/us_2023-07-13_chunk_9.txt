most important issues of the day, but never stopped thinking ahead.
From early in his career, Bruce anticipated the importance of the Indian Ocean region and Oceania to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific.
Given the importance of the region to my constituents, Bruce was a valuable resource to me and my legislative staff in preparing for official travel, welcoming high-level delegations from the region and organizing briefings.
Even after Bruce's passing, staff and Members will continue to rely on his written analysis and expertise.
I offer my sincere condolences to Bruce's family, friends and colleagues at the Congressional Research Service, and hope they may take comfort in the knowledge of his indelible and ongoing contribution to the work.
Congress has lost a distinguished public servant.
I thank Bruce and honor his life and his work.
