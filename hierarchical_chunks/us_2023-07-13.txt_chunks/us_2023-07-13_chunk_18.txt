Mr. Smith's service was, and remains, essential to maintaining the freedoms we as Americans are so fortunate to enjoy.
Again, I thank him for his dedication and commitment to the United States.
Every American owes a debt of gratitude to him.
His dedication and courage in uniform helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of this Nation and all the people in it.
Happy Birthday to 
Mr. Francis Albert Smith.
Here is to many more.
