Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the achievement the historic accomplishment of the Heroes' Alliance Vehicle Technology Team, a group of high school students from our district that won the 2022 national Solar Car Challenge within their division.
Heroes' Alliance was founded in 2009 by the late Pastor Reginald M. Lane, who established the organization in response to the educational and residential climates existing in the city of Detroit at that time.
The Heroes' Alliance is a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) program that challenges students to develop innovative technology focusing on renewable energy and automotive engineering.
Today the project serves as a capstone for students who participate in the Heroes' Alliance Cooperative Learning Center, which utilizes vehicle technology for the basis of bringing together education, innovation, and industry as students work together to design and engineer a solar vehicle.
This summer, their journey will culminate in the Solar Car Challenge, a cross-country race from Fort Worth, Texas to Palmdale, California.
The students will face rigorous tests and evaluations to demonstrate the capabilities of their solar-powered vehicle.
I am so proud of this hard-working and talented group of young people from various schools in Metro Detroit and want to congratulate them on their achievements.
Please join me in recognizing Michigan's Heroes' Alliance Vehicle Technology Team, as we cheer them on to victory.
