Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Colonel Matthew W. Luzzatto on his retirement from the United States Army after more than 25 years of service.
COL Luzzatto has exemplified honor, integrity, and professionalism throughout his career and his service is truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Throughout his decorated career, COL Luzzatto has held various command and officer positions, including Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Charleston District, and Chief of the Host National Funded Construction for U.S. Forces Japan, Yokota Air Base, and has served the country in deployments to Kosovo and Kirkuk, among others.
His experience, knowledge, and initiative have distinguished COL Luzzatto as an outstanding leader who has upheld the core values and mission of the U.S. Army and U.S. Army Corps.
As Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District, COL Luzzatto has been a valuable partner to my office and the community.
Together, we have worked on projects to reduce storm and coastal flood risks to protect residents, properties, and infrastructure.
He has overseen vital beach replenishment, dredging, and flood control projects, working in coordination with federal, state, and local entities.
It has been an honor to work with COL Luzzatto to protect our communities, and I thank him for his leadership.
