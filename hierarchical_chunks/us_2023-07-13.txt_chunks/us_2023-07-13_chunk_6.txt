This team of elected officers that span the European continent and the political spectrum are assuming office at a critical time for transatlantic and global security.
I look forward to cooperating with them closely in the coming year, particularly as I assume the responsibility of Head of Delegation for the United States in 2024.
I want to express my deep appreciation to our Canadian hosts at the Annual Session in Vancouver, British Columbia, especially Dr. Hedy Fry, Head of the Canadian Delegation, who demonstrated tremendous hospitality and outstanding organization in orchestrating this large and complex event.
The natural beauty, personal warmth, and cultural diversity we experienced in Vancouver made for an ideal setting for our meeting.
