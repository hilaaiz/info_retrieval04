Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Union County Public Schools teacher, Dawn Helms Stegall, on her retirement after 48 years of serving Union County's students and families.
Dawn graduated from Piedmont High School in the class of 1972 before attending both Wingate University for a degree in history, and Meredith College for a degree in social studies and secondary education.
In 1975, Dawn started her teaching career at UCPS at Sun Valley, where she taught history for 10 years.
She accepted a job at her alma mater, Piedmont High School, where she taught history for the next 38 years.
She was named UCPS Teacher of the Year for the 1989-1990 academic year and was later named the Region IV Teacher of the Year.
Year after year, Dawn's students register among the highest scores for AP U.S. History.
Dawn's dedicated leadership in the classroom has inspired several of her students to further study history and return to teach in the UCPS system.
Dawn's years of service to the UCPS community also extends far beyond the classroom.
Dawn helped start the Piedmont Barbecue in 1986 and continued every year until 2019.
Over these years, the Barbecue has raised more than one hundred thousand dollars for Piedmont High students.
It is clear, Dawn is the epitome of servant leadership.
Once again, on behalf of the entire 8th Congressional District of North Carolina, I rise to congratulate Dawn Helms Stegall on a successful career and a well-deserved recognition for her years of dedicated service to Union County.
