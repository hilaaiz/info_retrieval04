Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in remembrance of John Durm, Marion County Sheriff Deputy, who died in the line of duty on July 10, 2023, at the age of 61.
He is survived by his wife, Ramona, and 4 children.
Deputy Durm was well liked and respected by all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Described by his colleagues and friends as genuine, courteous, and sincere, Deputy Durm always had a smile and joke to brighten someone's day.
A shining example of what it means to serve and protect, Deputy Durm worked in the Marion County Sheriff's department for 38 years, alongside his wife.
Inspired by their service, 1 of their sons is currently training at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.
Our community mourns the loss of a brave and selfless man who was dedicated to his family and the community he served.
He lived out his values every day.
Deputy Durm's legacy of service and friendship will be remembered by family, community members, and his Marion County Sheriff's Office coworkers.
Today, I solemnly ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Deputy John Durm and his loved ones.
