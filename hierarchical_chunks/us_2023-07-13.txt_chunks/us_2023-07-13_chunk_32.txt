Mr. Speaker, I hope all Members will join us in cosponsoring the ``American Food for American Schools Act.''
Our Nation's schoolchildren should be served nutritious, American-grown foods produced under the strictest food safety standards in the world, as required by federal law.
That is exactly what our bill would accomplish.
I look forward to working with the Committee on Education and Labor to ensure that our bipartisan bill is included in any future Child Nutrition Reauthorization or the upcoming Farm Bill.
