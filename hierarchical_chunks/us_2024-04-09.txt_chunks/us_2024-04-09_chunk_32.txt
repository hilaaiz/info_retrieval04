Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Daniel Pritz, who serves as a volunteer Board Member for the local non-profit, Brooksville Main Street.
These outstanding volunteers put in hundreds They have all come together for a common cause--to serve the community by bringing much-loved events to downtown Brooksville.
Each of these board members have servant hearts, and their dedication and commitment to our community is impressive.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that Daniel Pritz and fellow board members have made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.
