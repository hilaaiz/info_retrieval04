Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Courtney S. Lim for her continued service to her patients.
Dr. Lim conducts herself in a way that our future doctors should aspire to: thoughtfully listening to each and every patient, and serving as a steady, compassionate force for patients to find comfort with.
I have no doubt she will continue to exhibit her dedication and genuine care in treatment for many years to come.
