cooking, canning, farming, quilting, and caring for babies, all while dedicatedly managing her household and working for Aiken County Public Schools.
Her spirit of generosity shines through in her unwavering commitment to caring for others.
Whether tending to her own children and many grandchildren or extending her kindness to members of her community, Clara's compassion knows no bounds.
As a devout Christian, Clara acknowledged her faith at an early age and was baptized at Good Hope Baptist Church in Ridgeway, South Carolina.
She later became a member of Samaria Baptist Church in Springfield, South Carolina, where she still faithfully attends.
Her love for both her church and her family is palpable, evident in her years of dedicated service to both.
At the age of 100, Clara has witnessed many significant landmarks of American history: the Great Depression, World War II, Briggs v. Elliott, Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Cold War, 9/11, and the first African American President of the United States.
Today, I honor 
Mrs. Clara Singleton Williams and wish her a happy 100th birthday.
I am pleased to join her family and friends in congratulating her on this remarkable milestone.
