Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Nathaniel ``Ray'' Tuck, Jr., who passed away at the age of 52 on February 11, 2024, after battling cancer for the past two and a half years.
Ray was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on April 30, 1971, to Nathaniel Ray and Barbara Z. Tuck.
He later graduated from Radford University in 1994 and earned his Doctor of Chiropractic from the National University of Health Sciences in 1997.
After graduating, he joined his father's chiropractic clinic in Southwest Virginia where they practiced together for many years.
His son, Nathaniel R. Tuck, III is currently in chiropractic school, hoping to continue the family legacy.
During Ray's incredible career, he served as the President of the Virginia Chiropractic Association, Chairman of the Board, and later President of the American Chiropractic Association, and was also appointed to be the chiropractor on the Virginia Board.
Ray is survived by his wife, Bonnie, of 29 years, his daughter Abi Dolgos (husband Dakota Dolgos and grandson Gatlin Dolgos), his son Nathaniel (girlfriend Abby E. Markham), his mother Barbara, his sister Amelia Martin (husband Buddy Martin), and his brother Ben M. Tuck (wife Priyam Chipper).
I wish them peace and strength during this difficult time.
I was lucky to know Ray personally, as my daughter, Abby, has dated his son Nathaniel for a number of years.
He was a good man, and I was glad to have been able to know him before he passed.
We will all greatly miss him.
