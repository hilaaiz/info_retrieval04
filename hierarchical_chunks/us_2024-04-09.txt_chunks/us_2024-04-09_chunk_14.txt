Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mr. Angelo K. Tsakopoulos upon receiving the American Hellenic Institution Hellenic Heritage Lifetime Achievement Award.
Mr. Tsakopoulos is the founder, CEO, and co-chairman of AKT Development and has devoted his career to improving California for all.
Born in Arcadia, Greece, 
Mr. Tsakopoulos first came to the United States at the age of 15.
He worked diligently to send money home to his family in Greece and attended the University of Illinois and Sacramento State University, where he cultivated his passion for learning.
In 1964, he founded AKT Development, beginning what would become a lifetime of leadership in California's residential and commercial development.
