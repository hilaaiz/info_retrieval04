Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable organization, Delta Missions.
Delta Missions Ministry is a nonprofit Christian outreach organization dedicated to advancing the gospel of Jesus Christ, offering discipleship training to local residents, and empowering them to actively engage in their local churches.
Our mission is to impact lives and nurture spiritual transformation through weekly Bible studies, lay training, recreational activities, and mentoring programs tailored for youth, adults, and senior citizens.
