Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate two hardworking Georgia establishments that were named among the Nation's top 100 restaurants.
Recently, the restaurant review website `Open Table' released its Top 100 Restaurants in America for 2023 list.
Both `Elizabeth's' and `The Olde Pink House' made it on the list.
The review states that `Elizabeths' has ``Southern hospitality, fine coastal cuisine, and well-chosen wines in a comfortable, elegant 1900 mansion have made Elizabeth on 37th a favorite destination in Savannah since 1981.''
As far as the `Olde Pink House' goes, the review states it is ``Savannah's only 18th-century mansion
[and] is famous for memorable dining experiences featuring seafood caught daily in local waters, prime aged beef, and traditional southern fare.''
Congratulations to these establishments, and I wish them both continued success.
