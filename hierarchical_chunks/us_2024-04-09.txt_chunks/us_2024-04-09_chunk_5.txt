Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two Georgia quarterbacks--Calvary Day School's Jake Merklinger, and New Hampstead High School's RaShawn Truell, for their tied win of the Finocchiaro Award.
The Michael Finocchiaro Memorial Outstanding Football Player Award, now in its 43rd year, crowns the standout high school player in Savannah and Chatham County.
Remarkably, the recent award ceremony marked only the second occasion in its history where two players tied after voting concluded.
Merklinger, the senior quarterback who is committed to Tennessee, also took home the Ashley Dearing Award as a junior, which is awarded to the most versatile male high school athlete.
Truell says ``this a big honor for [him], especially as a junior, to win this award.''
He followed that by stating, ``It show's that all the hard work that I have put in has paid off.
But everything I work for is to help our team--our goal is to win a state championship.''
Congratulations again to both Jake and RaShawn.
