Ms. Stemler joined my office in January of 2023 as an intern, having graduated from George Washington University.
In June of 2023, she started her role of Press Assistant and, from day one, helped revitalize and significantly increase our online engagement.
Many of my highest-performing social media posts occurred during her tenure, for which I am grateful.
She raised the bar for my office's digital media and set an example I will hold my staff to for years to come.
During her tenure on my staff, 
Ms. Stemler demonstrated an unfaltering work ethic and a high level of creativity.
Whether it was taking videos or writing captions, she approached every task with enthusiasm and humor.
She cared deeply for her colleagues and was always willing to lend a helping hand.
These same qualities will serve her well in her future endeavors.
