Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic on their 30th anniversary.
Their commitment to music and community is an incredible accomplishment and has helped preserve music and tradition for future generations.
I cannot wait to see all they accomplish in the years to come.
