Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Bill Greer for his outstanding service to Milligan and our region.
His retirement marks the end of an era of exceptional service and dynamic leadership.
I am certain his legacy will continue to inspire current and future generations.
I wish him and his family all the best in his retirement and his continued service as Chancellor of Milligan University.
