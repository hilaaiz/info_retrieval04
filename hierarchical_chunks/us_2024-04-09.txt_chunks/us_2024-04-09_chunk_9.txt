Indianola, Rev. Wilson identified an opportunity to utilize the vacant Bethune Center at the heart of the community to launch a VBS camp.
The Executive Director of South Delta Housing generously granted access to the center without charge.
The inaugural VBS camp took place in the summer of 1995, drawing over 100 enthusiastic kids.
The overwhelming positive response led to the transformation of the summer camp into a weekly gathering, providing not only spiritual education but also recreational activities, arts and crafts, and occasional outings for children and their families.
This grassroots initiative laid the foundation for Delta Missions, which is proud to celebrate its 30th year of service to the Indianola community this summer.
