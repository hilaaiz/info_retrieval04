In 2000, after twelve years of exemplary service as an enlisted sailor, LCDR Belton was commissioned as an Ensign.
As a Naval Officer, he continued to serve with distinction aboard several vessels including the USS Saipan, USS Tortuga, USS John Paul Jones, and USS Kearsarge.
His roles varied from Auxiliary Systems Officer to Main Propulsion Officer, showcasing his versatility and leadership abilities.
His contributions extended beyond the confines of individual commands, as he served as a Training Center Administrator, Master Training Specialist, and Surface Warfare Officer, among other roles.
After 28 years of honorable and dedicated service, LCDR Belton retired from active duty, but his work did not stop there.
In 2018, LCDR Belton founded Course Correction LLC, a service-disabled veteran owned small business which specializes in financial literacy education, leadership training, and contract management.
His legacy of excellence continues to inspire and guide those who follow in his footsteps.
LCDR Belton passed away unexpectedly on February 12, 2024.

It is with great pride and gratitude that I recognize the outstanding service and life of Lieutenant Commander Issac L. Belton.
