Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and acknowledge the remarkable achievements of student Jaylen Watson.
Jaylen Watson, born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, is the youngest of two children to his parents, Chandra and Ronald Watson, Sr.
His older brother is Ronald Watson, Jr.
Currently, a student at Madison S. Palmer High School in Marks, Mississippi, Jaylen is excelling in his academic studies and maintaining an impressive 4.0 GPA.
As a proud member of the class of 2024, Jaylen looks forward to graduating soon.
Throughout his high school years, Jaylen has actively participated in various community and educational activities.
Some of his involvements include being a member of the Beta Club, FCCLA, The Global Teaching Project, and Jobs for Mississippi Graduates, among others.
Within these organizations, Jaylen has taken up leadership positions, such as serving as a Chick-fil-a Leadership Ambassador and currently holding the role of Vice-President in his school's Beta Club.
Additionally, he takes on responsibility of Class President for his senior class and Vice-President for Jobs for Mississippi Graduates.
While Jaylen has achieved many accomplishments and held numerous leadership roles, his faith in God remains his utmost priority.
He is an active member of the New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church in Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he finds solace and support from his church family.
Apart from his academic and extracurricular pursuits, Jaylen has a strong passion for caring for the elderly in his community.
To support this cause, he organized a community service project to raise funds for blankets and sock footies during the cold winter months.
Jaylen successfully purchased these items for all the residents of Quitman County Health and Rehab, bringing joy and comfort to the vital citizens in need.
Furthermore, he has also extended his support to preschoolers by sponsoring a class during Christmas time, motivating and uplifting their young minds with toys and treats.
Jaylen finds great satisfaction in nurturing the future leaders of his small town.
With a deep commitment to giving back and caring for his community, Jaylen has decided to pursue nursing in his undergraduate studies in college.
His ultimate goal is to continue his education in graduate school, aiming for a doctorate degree to make a significant impact on his community.
Jaylen is driven and excited to be the best version of himself, striving to make his family, friends, and community proud.
He firmly believes that nothing is impossible with faith and lives by the inspiring words of Philippians 4:13, ``I can do all things through Christ who strenghens me.''
