Ms. Stemler will be starting a new role as a Communications Associate at the Pew Charitable Trusts.
Her contributions have left an indelible mark on my team, and I am confident that she will excel in her new position.
While we will miss her deeply, we all look forward to 
Ms. Stemler's bright future.
She will always remain a deeply valued member of Team Garamendi.
