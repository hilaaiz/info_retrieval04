First, this is a terrorist attack of the utmost barbarity, and it deserves to be condemned by all.
My thoughts are with the families of those killed.
The killing took place in a popular tourist location, and most victims were tourists.
Among the victims was a man married only the week before, who was honeymooning with his   wife.
The manner of the selection of the victims was particularly horrific, with the killers actively seeking out non-Muslims before killing them in cold blood.
The Minister will be aware that the Kashmir region has been the scene of previous terrorist attacks that have claimed many innocent lives, including in Chittisinghpura, where 35 Sikhs were killed in 2000.
What support can the UK provide to ensure that the terrorists are found and brought to justice, and to ensure that their networks of support are dismantled?
Secondly, there has been a significant escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan, including the measures that the Minister has outlined.
India and Pakistan have engaged in large-scale military hostilities in the past in the region, and there is a real risk that the nations could revert to a military conflict again.
What can the UK do to encourage a de-escalation of tensions, while ensuring the eradication of the terrorist organisations and their support networks wherever they exist?
Finally, the Minister will be aware that there have been protests in the UK outside India and Pakistan’s high commissions.
Those protests have been characterised by provocative language and gestures, including what appears to be a throat-slitting motion by an alleged Pakistan official.
Windows have been smashed at Pakistan’s high commission in London, and an individual has been arrested and charged.
Does the Minister recognise the importance of proactive work with communities across the UK to ensure that we do not see a downturn in community relations here?
