One area where we could show significant leadership is in the sphere of floating solar, which comes with huge benefits.
My constituency has 2,000 acres of raised reservoirs where we keep half of London’s drinking water—you cannot see the top of them, Mr Speaker.
Floating solar is twice as efficient as land-based systems and comes with none of the opportunity costs of putting solar panels on grade A agricultural land; in fact, floating solar panels actually improve the water quality underneath, so that Thames Water would have to use less filtration downstream.
I hear, however, that the Government’s solar road map has disappointingly little about floating solar.
Would the Secretary of State agree to meet me to discuss this further, prior to publication?
As I understand it, the solar road map has not yet been published, so watch this space.
I have been having conversations in the past couple of weeks with international counterparts who are interested in floating solar, and I would be happy to get the hon.
Gentleman a more detailed response on our plans on that front.
As the Minister knows, global leadership is about adaptation and mitigation.
Does she expect the Climate Change Committee’s report on adaptation, which is due out tomorrow, to say that the Government are doing enough in this regard?
Furthermore, will she show real leadership by requiring local authorities and major infrastructure providers to carry out climate risk assessments, so that, statutorily, they will have to ensure that climate resilience and preparedness form a part of their plans?
I cannot pre-empt what is in the report.
We will wait for it to come out, and then respond in due course.
On local leadership, the hon.
Lady and I share a local authority, and I would be very happy to discuss with it what more we can do to set an example—as Bristol has done so many times in the past—on how things can be done at a local level.
