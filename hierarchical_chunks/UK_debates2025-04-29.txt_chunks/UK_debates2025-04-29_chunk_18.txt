My hon.
Friend raises a really important point about the crucial role of local authorities in relation to these issues.
One of the things that my right hon.
Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has done is devolve more funding to combined authorities on this.
We want to go further, including in relation to local authorities, because it is local authorities—including my hon.
Friend’s, which I congratulate—who know best the particular needs of their own localities, and they are a key part of the answer to the energy efficiency upgrade that we need.
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of Great British Energy on job creation in industrial communities.
Great British Energy will support the creation of thousands of high-quality, well-paid jobs right across the country and help rebuild the UK’s industrial heartlands.
Just last week, the Prime Minister announced £300 million for Great British Energy to kick-start supply chains here in the UK.
Once the Great British Energy Bill finishes its final stages in Parliament, we will come forward with more exciting plans for our domestic clean energy champion.
