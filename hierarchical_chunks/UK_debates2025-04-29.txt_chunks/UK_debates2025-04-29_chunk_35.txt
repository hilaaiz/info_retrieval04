First, I will address the scenes on UK streets.
We are aware of reports of the video that my hon.
Friend refers to; the Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning.
We take seriously our responsibility for the security of all embassies and high commissions under the Vienna convention, so both the Pakistani and Indian high commissions will receive all the support of the UK state to ensure that they stay safe.
As my hon.
Friend has said, and as I know many in this House feel, these issues have long been discussed with passion on British streets.
We call on all sides, all community leaders and all involved to call for calm at a time of tension in the region.
