Following the publication of the Severn estuary commission report on tidal power, will the Government produce a national policy statement to support tidal range energy, and will they publish a review of the available opportunities?
I have had a number of meetings on this issue since coming into post.
Clearly, tidal could play an important part in an energy mix.
We have been clear that we are supportive of it in principle, but questions about its cost benefit and value for money must be answered.
We are happy to continue looking at it in future, as projects develop and more detail comes forward.
