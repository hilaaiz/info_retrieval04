My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to point out that, with Great British Energy and our clean power mission, we are trying to create the jobs that will deliver that transition here in the UK, which is something that the Conservatives failed on for many years.
We expect that funding, and much more that will come from Great British Energy, to mobilise more than £1 billion in private investment in domestic supply chains, driving forward manufacturing and industry here in the UK and the good jobs that go with it.
What assessment has the Minister made of the number of jobs that Great British Energy will create in the People’s Republic of China?
I think the right hon.
Gentleman gives the game away there.
Although the Conservative party did not particularly care where the supply chains were, we in the Labour party are committed to delivering good, well-paid jobs in this country.
If he was so concerned about investing in British supply chains, he might have bothered to vote for Great British Energy in the first place.
