I thank the right hon.
Lady for her questions.
India is a friend to the UK, and we have been clear about the depth of our friendship in our response to this incident.
She would not expect me to comment in detail on intelligence and security matters in relation to this attack, but I assure her that we are looking at it very closely.
She is right that wherever terrorism is found, it is a threat to global peace and security, including in the UK.
I will not comment further from this Dispatch Box on links between some of the groups that the right hon.
Lady has mentioned, but I assure her that our security agencies take these matters very seriously, as she would expect.
