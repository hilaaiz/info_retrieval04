The right hon.
Lady asks important questions about the Indian high commission.
As I said in my earlier answer, we will offer our full support.
There is 24/7 enhanced protection outside the high commission, and it will be a top priority for the Government to ensure that no harm comes to any Indian diplomats or, indeed, any other diplomats here in the UK.
We are playing our role to try to ensure that tensions do not escalate.
Many of us in this House are familiar with the tense and storied history between the two countries.
We are friends to them both, and we do not want to see an uncontrolled escalation in tensions.
May I pay my respects to those who have lost loved ones in the horrific terrorist attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir?
My thoughts are with them at this devastating time.
Many of my constituents have written to me about the escalation of hostilities here in the UK.
Can the Minister say what conversations he is having with Indian and Pakistani counterparts to address this situation?
This escalation is unsettling for communities within the UK.
British Pakistanis and British Indians are valued parts of our community, but we look to all community and faith leaders to spread the message that now is the time for coming together across religious and ethnic differences, not to play out the tensions between two states on the streets of the UK, and we will continue to send that message.
