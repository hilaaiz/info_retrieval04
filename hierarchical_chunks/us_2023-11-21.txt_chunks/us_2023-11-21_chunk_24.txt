Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Battalion Chief Kenneth Murray for his twenty-six years of service with the Dearborn Fire Department in Michigan's 12th District Strong.
Battalion Chief Murray started with Dearborn Fire Department in 1997 as a firefighter.
He steadily rose through the ranks, serving as engineer, lieutenant, and captain before he was promoted to battalion chief in 2020.
Over the course of his career, Battalion Chief Murray has garnered numerous awards and accolades for his meritorious service, including Lifesaving, Unit Award, Perfect Attendance, and Safe Driving.
He was also recognized as the Dearborn Exchange Club's Fire Officer of the Year in 2016.
On top of his numerous duties with the Fire Department, Battalion Chief Murray has prioritized his education and pursued specialized training in collapse, rope, and trench rescue.
In short, Battalion Chief Murray has been an outstanding public servant to the communities served by the Dearborn Fire Department.
Please join me in recognizing his twenty-six years of commitment to protecting our families' safety across Michigan's 12th District Strong as we wish him well in his retirement.
