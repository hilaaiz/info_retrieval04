Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, Today I want to recognize my friend, William ``Bill'' Goodman.
Bill was an iconic member of our Detroit legal community who never wavered in fighting for the working class, the most vulnerable among us.
I met Bill over fifteen years ago when he was President of the Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice.
He was a mentor to many of us young attorneys and a hero to many who were seeking justice.
Born in 1940, Bill grew up in northwest Detroit, where he witnessed the injustices of racism and segregation.
This, combined with the values instilled in him by his parents, informed the path Bill would take with his career and life's work.
He earned his juris doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1964, returned to Detroit during the height of the civil rights movement, and went to work in partnership with his father, Ernie Goodman.
Over the course of his career, Bill took on numerous high-profile cases.
He worked as legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights, where he represented Guantanamo Bay detainees, Vietnamese survivors of Agent Orange, and the wrongfully detained.
He sought to focus his work on the protection of civil liberties.
Bill eventually returned to Detroit as partner at the law firm Goodman Hurwitz, where he continued to represent families and individuals who were victims of police and government misconduct.
Bill worked with a number of legal advocacy organizations, including the National Lawyers Guild, ACLU, and Sugar Law Center, where I got to know him when we both served as board members.
I knew Bill to be a fierce advocate, a brilliant legal mind, and a tenacious but kind warrior for justice.
Please join me in tribute to Bill Goodman, remembering his life and distinguished career.
May he rest in power.
