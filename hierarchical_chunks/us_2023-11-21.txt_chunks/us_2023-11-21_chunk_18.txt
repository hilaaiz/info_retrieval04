Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Chris Jones and his service to Virginia's First District, commonly called ``America's First District'' and the Nation.
This is both a moment of reflection and a time to express our heartfelt appreciation for a job well done.
Chris began his career in public service as a District Representative for my predecessor, Rep. Jo Ann Davis, covering the regions of the Middle Peninsula and the Northern Neck, Chris' family has called the Northern Neck home for generations.
Chris joined my office in 2007 and worked his way up to Deputy District Director.
Chris has been the epitome of public service excellence, a dedication of over 20 years to the betterment of our community, our Commonwealth, and our nation.
His journey has been one of tireless effort, navigation through the complexities of government--from the local, state, and federal--to serve citizens with grace, resilience, and an unyielding sense of purpose.
During Chris' tenure, he has been a beacon of leadership, inspiring those around him to strive for excellence and to uphold the values that define our Congressional office and as a true Virginia gentleman.
Chris' genuine concern for the well-being of America's First District citizens, has left an indelible mark on all of us.
Today is not only a farewell; it's a moment to express our deepest gratitude.
Chris' tireless dedication has set a standard for excellence that will be hard to match.
His infectious enthusiasm will be sorely missed, but Chris' legacy will undoubtedly endure in the continued success of America's First District constituent services.
