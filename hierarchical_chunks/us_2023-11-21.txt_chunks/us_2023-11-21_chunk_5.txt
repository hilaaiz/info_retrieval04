Senator Rich was first elected as Broward County Commissioner in 2016 and re-elected, unopposed, in 2020.
She was recently selected by her colleagues on the County Commission to be the Vice Mayor of Broward County through November 2023 and now selected to serve as Mayor.
Her top priority has been addressing the affordable housing crisis in Broward, as well as ending homelessness.
Prior to her service on the County Commission, 
Senator Rich was elected to the Florida State Senate in 2004 after serving two terms in the Florida House.
She was recognized as one of the most passionate and dedicated members of the Florida Legislature and was the first woman to be elected Senate Democratic Leader.
Her years of advocacy and activism on behalf of women, children, and families is admirable and inspiring.
She served as the National President of the National Council of Jewish Women, the first Floridian elected to that office.
She was also honored to receive an appointment by President Bill Clinton to serve as a Member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Council in Washington, D.C.
My friendship with 
Senator Rich runs deep.
When I first ran for office at the age of 25, she was one of the first people I called for advice.
She subsequently succeeded me in the Florida House and the Florida Senate.
She is someone who paved the way for women to reach and shatter the glass ceiling--helping to break the barriers of gender-bias and discrimination.
I am proud to have stood on the shoulders of my friend--Florida's friend--Nan Rich.
On behalf of the people of Florida's 25th district, we are grateful for 
Senator Rich's leadership and look forward to the progress she will continue to make as Broward County's next Mayor.
