Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ray Muscat for his public service and commitment to our Dearborn Heights community.
He is a lifelong resident of Dearborn Heights and served on City Council for years.
Since 1969, Councilman Muscat has been an active and engaged resident.
He was drawn to public service after he retired from a 42year career with Ford Motor Company.
As a public servant, 
Mr. Muscat served as Council Chairman Pro Tem.
He was a fixture at city council meetings for many years prior to taking office.
He is appreciated for his passionate commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Dearborn Heights and making it a more beautiful place to live.
As a council member, he was appreciated for his no-nonsense approach and for never shying away from asking difficult questions.
During his tenure, he made himself approachable and available to community members.
No concern has ever been too small for him to address.
Please join me in showing appreciation for Ray Muscat for his service to the people of Dearborn Heights, as we wish him well in all of his future endeavors.
