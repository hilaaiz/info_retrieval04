Mr. Merritt remains an active member of his church, True Love Missionary Baptist Church, he also serves as treasurer of the Ravines Subdivision Homeowners Association in Southfield, and volunteers his time with the Urban Bankers.
He also enjoys spending time with his wife of fifty-seven years, Helen, and his two grown children Necole Merritt and Hume Merritt, Ill.
Please join me in recognizing and wishing Hume Merritt, a happy eightieth birthday and his contributions to our communities in Michigan's 12th District.
