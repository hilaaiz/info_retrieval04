Mr. NEWHOUSE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gary Petersen, a dedicated leader hailing from the Tri-Cities, who tragically lost his fight to cancer this past month.
It saddens me that rather than announcing his next great achievement, I am instead here to mourn his passing.
Gary was known throughout both Central Washington, the U.S. Capitol, and the Department of Energy as a fierce advocate for the interests of the Tri-Cities.
His leadership in our communities proved fruitful for decades, sparking both economic development and innovation for the citizens.
His advocacy for the Hanford cleanup mission has been the cornerstone of the success of our region, and I am in awe of the impact he has made over the years.
His immense knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of our community's priorities was matched by so few, and I have no doubt his name will go down in history with the likes of Sam Volpentest and Bob Ferguson.
Gary's legacy includes leading advocacy for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's campus, supporting the advancement of the Hanford cleanup mission, and advocating for growing the local economy at TRIDEC; he will also be known as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and personal friend of mine.
While he will be missed, his legacy will continue to live on in every corner of the Tri-Cities and Central Washington.
