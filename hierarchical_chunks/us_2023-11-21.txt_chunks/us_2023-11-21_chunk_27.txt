Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate St. Mary Grade School's fourth Blue Ribbon Award.
Located in Southwest Ohio and serving students across the region, St. Mary Grade School was founded by the Sisters.
Opening its doors in 1908 with 100 students, the school has expanded and now has well over 400 students enrolled annually.
The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program seeks to honor schools from around the country that have a vision of excellence and hold their students and faculty to a high standard, and I can't think of a more worthy school than St. Mary Grade School.
For over a century, this school has pushed each and every student to be the best they can be, academically and spiritually, and they continue to serve the local community to this day.
I, like the thousands of other graduates who began their educational and spiritual journey at St. Mary Grade School, owe so much of our educational foundation to the dedicated faculty who have devoted years continue to prosper.
I am incredibly proud that the National Blue Ribbon School Program has chosen my alma mater to be one of the forty private schools honored this year as the school is so deserving of this distinction.
I am looking forward to their continued success in the community.
