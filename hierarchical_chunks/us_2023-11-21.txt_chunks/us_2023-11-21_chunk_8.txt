Ruth was recognized with a commemorative historical marker, detailing the notable status of the church in the community.
Carolyn was also one St. Ruth.
As a strong compassionate, servant leader, Carolyn had a passion for supporting and working in the community to fight against cancer.
Carolyn was the team leader for the Dania Beach Relay for Life fundraising walks, where she and others in the community walked to honor cancer survivors.
Carolyn's love for developing young minds led her to be a part of the Broward County Public School District for more than 38 years.
Her esteemed career included Parkway Middle School, Apollo Middle School, and Attucks Middle School.
The pinnacle of Carolyn's educational career was when she was honored as Attucks Middle School Teacher of the Year.
She was also a member of The Charmettes, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and the Red Hat Society.
As a supportive wife, Carolyn stood by her husband Albert as he served on both the Dania Beach and Broward County Commissions.
Truly an inspiration, Carolyn is remembered for her kind and generous spirit and legacy of service to family, church, and community.
My heart is with her family in mourning the loss of this kind, generous, and compassionate soul.
We were forever privileged to have shared this time with her.
May her memory be for a blessing.
