Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Hear, hear!

Go on, Jim!
Do you always have the last question before Prime Minister’s questions deliberately, Jim?
It is up to you, Mr Speaker, but you always call me; you are very kind.
Thank you.
Tackling violence against women and girls can be done regionally, but is it not time to do it on a national level, with England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland working together?
Absolutely; that is central to our manifesto.
Our commitments will take in the whole of the UK—particularly the Home Office commitments on policing, and the commitments in the legislation that we intend to bring forward.
