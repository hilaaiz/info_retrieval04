The Prime Minister did not answer a single question.
He never answers questions.
He wants to talk about the past; the fact is that we have acknowledged where things went wrong, but he will never take responsibility.
He has scrapped a deterrent that the National Crime Agency said we need.
Since he came into government and scrapped the Rwanda deterrent, small boats arrivals have increased by nearly 20%.
His own MPs are complaining about having to house asylum seekers, so can the Prime Minister tell the House how much more his Government will spend on hotel accommodation because he scrapped the deterrent?
I am invited to tell the House what went wrong under the last Government—that would take us all afternoon.
We are going to smash the gangs that are running this vile trade.
We signed a landmark agreement with Germany this week.
[Interruption.]
Order.
Mr Philp, you have been very loud.
I think now we are going to have a little bit of silence from you.
This week, we signed a landmark agreement with Germany.
The Leader of the Opposition should welcome that, because it will make sure that we  have the powers to take enforcement action across the continent, where it is needed.
We have set up the Border Security Command; we have committed £75 million on top of the existing £75 million; and we are extending the powers, so that they are like counter-terrorism powers.
We have returned 9,400 people who should not be here.
A record flight got off.
The Opposition talk about getting flights off, and have done for years, but they did not succeed.
We got the flights off.
