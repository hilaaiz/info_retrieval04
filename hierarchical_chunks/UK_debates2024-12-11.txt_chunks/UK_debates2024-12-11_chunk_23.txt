Last week, the Prime Minister did not seem to want to talk about appointing fraudsters to his Cabinet.
In fact, he seemed to want to talk about immigration, so let us talk about immigration.
He has relaunched yet again, with many new targets, six milestones and five missions, but why was cutting immigration not a priority?
I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition now wants to talk about immigration.
Last week, she said that she did not want to—and for good reason, because the previous Government presided over record high levels of immigration.
The figures just a few weeks ago showed net migration of nearly 1 million.
That is unprecedented—a one nation experiment in open borders under the last Government.
She was the champion; she stood up and praised the then Tory Home Secretary for listening to her on removing caps on migration visas.
She was applauding it.
Now, she is furious about what she was campaigning for.
We will drive down lawful migration; we will drive down illegal migration.
