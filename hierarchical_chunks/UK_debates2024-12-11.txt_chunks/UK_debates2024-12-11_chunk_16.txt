The NHS in Wales is broken.
Under Labour, waits continue and no family, it seems, is without somebody waiting in an ever-growing queue.
It is the highest on record, with one in four of the Welsh population on a waiting list.
In September, 801,000 people were in need of treatment.
If someone has lost their winter fuel allowance, along with any hope of seeing a GP or consultant and getting social care, what does the Secretary of State really have to say and do to reassure older people that the Labour Government here and in the Senedd have the ability to tackle that disgrace of a backlog?
I say to the hon.
Lady that both the Welsh and the UK Governments are looking after pensioners in Wales.
We made the tough, but right, decision on winter fuel payments, given our economic inheritance from the previous Conservative Government.
We are focused on delivering funding and support to the people who need it most.
There has already been a 152% increase in pension credit claims since July’s announcement, and those people who receive the winter fuel payment will get, on average, an extra £1,900 a year in pension credit.
