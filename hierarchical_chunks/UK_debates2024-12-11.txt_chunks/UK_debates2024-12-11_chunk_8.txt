What recent discussions she has had with Cabinet colleagues on support for clean energy projects in Wales.
This Government are supporting clean energy projects in Wales.
Seven tidal, solar and onshore wind projects were successful in the recent contracts for difference round, and we have given the Celtic and Anglesey freeports the green light, which will enable green industries to grow, creating new jobs.
I am also delighted that 13 projects have been successful in the first round of the Crown Estate’s £50 million supply chain accelerator fund, which will support the delivery of floating offshore wind in the Celtic sea.
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Llanelli (Dame Nia Griffith) , was recently with me in Llandudno at a roundtable with the main stakeholders in floating offshore wind in the Celtic sea.
This project is ready to go, and it will bring massive benefits through cheaper, more secure energy for everybody across the UK.
What are the Secretary of State and the Wales Office doing to ensure that the contracts are signed, sealed and delivered as quickly as possible?
We want these benefits to come via Wales, not via other regions or countries.
