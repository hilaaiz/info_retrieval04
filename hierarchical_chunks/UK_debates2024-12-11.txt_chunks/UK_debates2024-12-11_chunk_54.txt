The right hon.
Gentleman makes a really important point about the work upstream.
We did include interior Ministers from north Africa as part of the G7 discussions in Italy in October.
That was important and it reflects a lot of the work with north African countries which Italy, for example, has been leading.
I also agree with him about the importance of the Sahel.
Some of the issues that we discussed in the Calais group yesterday included looking at areas of instability and areas from which people have been making dangerous journeys.
We need to engage with those countries.
We talked about the Sahel and about central Africa, and we talked about Iraq and some of the middle east areas.
We also talked about Vietnam, from where we saw a significant increase in the number of people arriving in small boats at the beginning of the year.
