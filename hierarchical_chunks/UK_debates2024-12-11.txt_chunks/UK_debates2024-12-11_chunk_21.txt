The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 11 December.
May I start by welcoming the fall of Assad?
The people of Syria suffered for far too long under his brutal regime.
What comes next is far from certain.
We have been talking to regional and global allies to ensure that it is a political solution that protects civilians and minorities, and absolutely rejects terrorism and violence.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s remarks welcoming the fall of Assad, and with his hope for the Syrian people.
Since Middlesbrough council has returned to Labour control under Mayor Chris Cooke, it is no longer subject to Government intervention in its children’s services or to a best value notice—and it is on track to become financially stable.
I know that the Prime Minister will want to join me in congratulating Mayor Cooke and the council on their recent successes.
Can he confirm that the spending review will not simply end 14 years of  Conservative austerity, but will unwind it, and provide the resources that councils need to properly serve our communities?
I join my hon.
Friend in paying tribute to that mayor, and to all local representatives across the country, who did a fantastic job even when funding was cut to the bone during the past 14 years of Tory government.
We are boosting local government funding by £4 billion, and investing £1.6 billion to improve roads.
I was proud to see the work on the carbon capture cluster in Teesside, which will create 2,000 new jobs.
