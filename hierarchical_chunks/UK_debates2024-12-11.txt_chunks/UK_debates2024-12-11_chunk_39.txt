I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
I have spoken to many who work in our shops who are very concerned about shoplifting.
It went out of control because of the approach taken by the previous Government.
We are bringing it under control.
It is not low level; it has a huge impact on other customers and a particular impact on staff working in supermarkets.
That is why we are dedicating funding to train police and retailers and to support specialist analyst teams to crack down on the gangs that are targeting retailers.
