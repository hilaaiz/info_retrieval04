I thank my hon.
Friend.
He is a champion of the extraordinary potential of Cornwall, particularly in our transition to clean power by 2030.
Next week, we will publish our English devolution White Paper, setting out our ambitions to move power from Westminster into every part of England, including Cornwall, and I know that he and his colleagues are meeting the Deputy Prime Minister to discuss this next week.
