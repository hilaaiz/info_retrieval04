More than 40 countries and holiday destinations around the world have introduced a form of visitor levy, including Greece, Amsterdam, Barcelona and California, and many of us have paid such levies abroad without noticing.
The money will help to support a long-term thriving tourism industry in Wales.
I am confident that the Welsh Government will work with businesses and tourists alike to get this right.
Does the Secretary of State agree that the successful introduction of similar schemes in places such as Manchester, and indeed in successful tourist destinations around the world, shows that the Conservatives should stop fear-mongering and support something that could really boost Welsh tourism?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
As I said, such levies are already the norm in more than 40 countries and holiday destinations around the world.
Manchester shows it can work, so why can Wales not show that?
