I welcome my right hon.
Friend’s statement and the frankly grown-up approach she is taking to tackling this problem.
Does she recognise the fury that is felt by constituents in Hartlepool and elsewhere that, as this system collapsed over the past five years, with all the costs associated with that, simultaneously our public services were eviscerated?
Does she understand that that is why people in Hartlepool want the system fixed, and fixed quickly?
