I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
We know that floating offshore wind will be critical to delivering our clean energy mission, and Wales has a huge part to play in that.
The UK Government, jointly with the Welsh Government, recognise these opportunities and what they present for Wales, and we are determined to take full advantage of them.
My colleagues in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero are working to move the process forward as quickly as possible, noting the need for certainty and a tight timetable so that we can get on with it.
