I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue, which is of grave concern to her constituents.
The Government are totally committed to supporting the workers and their families at this uncertain time.
The Industry Minister will meet the company this week to discuss plans for workers and the site, to ensure that dedicated support is in place.
We will continue to do so, because I know that it is an issue of considerable concern to her constituents.
