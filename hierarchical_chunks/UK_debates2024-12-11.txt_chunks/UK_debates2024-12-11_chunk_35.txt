I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this case, which he mentioned to me last night.
I pay tribute to Mark, who is in the Gallery, and the work of his foundation.
This diagnosis can so obviously be absolutely devastating, and it is testament, if I may say so, to his bravery and compassion that he is raising awareness of the condition.
I think many of us would question whether we were capable of doing what he is doing, given the diagnosis that he has had.
Last week  I paid tribute to the inspirational Kevin Sinfield, another incredible champion.
I say to both of them, and to all those campaigning, that we stand with you in this fight.
