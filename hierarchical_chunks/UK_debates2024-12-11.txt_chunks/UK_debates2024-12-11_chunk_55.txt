I welcome the Home Secretary’s statement today and congratulate her team on the work that they are undertaking in this very difficult area.
Back in 2021, the previous Government committed to £62 million as part of an agreement with France that included strengthening law enforcement deployments, more wide-area surveillance technology and vehicles, and enhanced physical measures at transport interchanges.
Then in 2023, they committed to a further £500 million and to continuing these agreements.
My constituents see these agreements, and the financial commitments being made with our neighbours, and yet, over the past few years, they have just seen increasing problems with small boat crossings and backlogs.
What reassurance can my right hon.
Friend give my constituents that these agreements will make a difference, and—because this goes to the heart of fairness—that these funding agreements will bring about the change that people want to see?
