The Secretary of State celebrates funding for Wales yet fails to mention that, outside of the NHS, the Welsh Government Budget is 10% lower in real terms compared with—wait for it—2010.
This falls far short of fixing the foundations of collapsing public services.
Does she believe that a Budget that leaves Wales with less compared with 14 years ago is really a Budget worth celebrating?
I think someone should get the right hon.
Lady a calculator, because the Plaid Cymru asks for the Budget would create at least £5 billion a year in unfunded bills for the taxpayer.
Its plans for HS2, the winter fuel allowance and the two-child benefit cap would mean significant spending cuts in Wales.
We are not prepared to subject the people of Wales to that.
If she wants further investment in Wales, her party needs to vote for the Welsh Government Budget in the Senedd.
I am glad that the Secretary of State has mentioned HS2, because her Government’s Budget confirmed that HS2 will run to Euston, and that stretch alone will cost £9.4 billion.
HS2 construction work also means that passengers from Wales will face disruption, as trains will be diverted away from Paddington for seven years.
She previously said that HS2 is “no longer in existence.”
Does she stand by this statement, given that Welsh passengers will bear the huge costs of this project?
The right hon.
Lady knows that I was referring to the second phase of HS2, which the Conservative Government cancelled.
And she knows, because I have said it before and will say it again, that I remain very angry about the previous Government’s broken promises on rail and on HS2.
I am working in partnership with the Welsh Government to develop a long-term, sustainably funded package of much-needed rail infrastructure improvements.
I met Great Western Railway with the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon.
