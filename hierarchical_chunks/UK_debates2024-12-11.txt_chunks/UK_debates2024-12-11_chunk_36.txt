Ryan Cornelius has been detained in Dubai for 17 years.
His property was seized in what was a very unjudicial process.
The Prime Minister has been to the United Arab Emirates.
When he went there, did he demand that Ryan Cornelius be freed, given that the United Nations concluded that his detention was arbitrary and in violation of international law?
Will he make Magnitsky sanctions deliverable on those responsible for that after his release?
That is an important case.
It has, of course, been raised by the Government a number of times, including by the Foreign Secretary as part of the trip that I was on.
I myself raised human rights issues.
It is a serious case, and we will continue to press for the outcome that I know he and his family desperately want.
Stellantis could not have asked for more from the workers at the Luton plant.
Like every generation of Vauxhall worker in Luton, they meet every target set, they make every innovation demanded of them and they never give up.
Contrast that with Carlos Tavares, the CEO who quit days after making the decision to threaten more than 1,000 jobs in Luton.
Does the Prime Minister agree that in the light of the sudden departure of the CEO, Stellantis should review the decision, do what is right by our town and stay put for good or until an alternative is found, to ensure that Luton’s manufacturing history is also our future?
