While Syrians are rejoicing at the overthrow of the brutal Assad regime, many people there and around the world are worried about what comes next, as indeed the Prime Minister said, with threats of extremism, ISIS terrorism and unsecured chemical weapons.
Only an open political process can bring peace and stability, but that will require the full backing of the international community.
Does the Prime Minister share my concern that President-elect Trump said about Syria: “The United States should have nothing to do with it”?
If America steps away, will the Prime Minister step up and work with other allies to provide British leadership over Syria?
The right hon.
Gentleman is right that this is a very serious moment.
We all welcome the fall of Assad
and I hope that this can be a much-needed turning point for Syria, but that is by no means guaranteed.
That is why we have been speaking intently and intensely with our allies in the region and across the globe about how we ensure that this is peaceful, political and a rejection of terrorism and violence.
This could be a turning point, but in the past we have thought that what comes next will necessarily be better and that has turned out not to be the case.
That is why we are working so hard on this and showing the leadership that the right hon.
Gentleman and the House would expect from this Government.
