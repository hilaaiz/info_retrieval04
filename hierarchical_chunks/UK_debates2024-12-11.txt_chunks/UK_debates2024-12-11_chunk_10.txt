Steel is a key component of developing clean energy projects.
In response to my written question, the Government confirmed that they have estimated the cost of nationalising British Steel to safeguard the plant’s future.
Can the Secretary of State explain why the Government did that for British Steel but dismissed nationalisation in the case of Port Talbot?
The Government have no plans to nationalise British Steel.
What discussions she has had with the Welsh Government on the potential impact of the proposed tourism levy on jobs in Wales.
The Welsh Government have introduced a Bill in the Senedd that will give local authorities in Wales the choice to introduce a levy on overnight stays in visitor accommodation.
It will be for individual councils to decide whether they will introduce a small charge paid by people staying overnight in commercially let accommodation in Wales to help support a thriving tourism industry.
