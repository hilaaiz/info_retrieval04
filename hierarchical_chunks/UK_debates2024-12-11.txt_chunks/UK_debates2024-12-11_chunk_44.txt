I thank the Home Secretary for the timely sight of her statement, and I thank her for her comments on Syria.
We certainly support the efforts of this Government and others around the world to secure a transition to a stable Government in Syria that can ensure the return of peace.
We also support the suspension of asylum processing; I am glad that the Government made that decision a few hours after I called for it yesterday.
