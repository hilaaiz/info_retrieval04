Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Judge Diana Becton as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Diana Becton has been Contra Costa County's District Attorney since her 2017 swearing in.
Diana is the first woman, first African American, and first woman of color to serve in the role since its creation in 1850.
This accomplishment alone shows the historical impact she has had on her community.
For 22 years Diana, served as a judge in Contra Costa County where she was elected and became president of the National Association.
She is known not only for upholding the law and holding people accountable, but also for striving to improve Contra Costa County's judicial system by focusing on disrupting the school to prison pipeline, creating safe alternatives for low-level non-violent offenders, and addressing the mental health needs of our community.
She created the Reimagine Youth Justice Task Force to create alternatives to juvenile hall for young offenders and has made efforts to curb racial bias in her department by partnering with the non-profit Vera Institute of Justice to evaluate her office's decision making.
Diana's accomplishments in the judiciary are too enumerable and impressive to list briefly
