Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to honor Ms. Kristen Bennett for her invaluable work as a Congressional Intern serving in my Hendersonville office.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her hard work and recognize the meaningful contributions she made at the office this year.
