Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Claudia Jimenez as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Claudia has dedicated her life to serving the community of Richmond and is a current member of the Richmond City Council, serving the 6th District.
As such, she is not only a proponent for positive social change but also a leader in her community.
She has worked throughout her city to bring about transformative programs in areas such as affordable housing and homelessness.
Claudia is known for forging alliances between key stakeholders across diverse communities.
Her background as an immigrant from Colombia has helped shape her motivations as a community organizer.
Trained as an architect in Colombia, she moved to Richmond in 2009, took English language classes, did volunteer work to practice her skills, and earned a Master of Environmental Planning from UC Berkeley.
Claudia accomplished all this while caring for two children and still found time to lead campaigns and volunteer with other mothers in her neighborhood.
Now as a Richmond City Councilmember, she is even more committed to improving the lives affordable places to live in the Bay Area.
Her commitment to her community and improving all different aspects of public life is an inspiration to all who know her.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Claudia Jimenez for her positive contributions to our community.
