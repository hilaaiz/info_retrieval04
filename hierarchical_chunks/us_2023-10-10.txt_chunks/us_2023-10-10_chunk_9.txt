Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Cheryl Sudduth as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional Districts Women of the Year.
Cheryl is involved with numerous organizations that aim to improve the status of marginalized people in her community.
As a Senior Director for Goodwill's AbilityOne program, she oversaw the building of thousands of fair housing units in Alameda County.
Through this program, Cheryl also created programs that employ and train thousands of people who are traditionally excluded from the job market.
Veterans, disabled individuals, formerly incarcerated people, and people returning to the workforce have benefitted from Cheryl's work.
She has also been involved with Alliance 4 Girls, a local program providing mentorship to young girls to give them a space to grow and thrive.
Through this program and others, Cheryl has personally mentored hundreds of girls in her community.
In addition, she has served on a variety of boards and commissions, including the West County Wastewater District, Contra Costa Racial Oversight Body, ACLU, and NAACP.
She also gives her time to a variety of organizations, ranging from racial justice, education, the environment, public safety, and much more.
She has received numerous awards and recognitions for her considerable contributions to the community at-large.
Cheryl's commitment to her community and improving all different aspects of public life serves as an inspiration to all who know her.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Cheryl Sudduth for her positive contributions to our community.
