as she is truly a pillar of her community and a testament to the excellence found in our district.
Diana, far from doing business as usual, has aimed to fundamentally change many aspects of our oftenharsh criminal justice system to decrease bias and fulfill its duty to serve justice.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Diana Becton for her positive contributions to our community.
