Interns work with staff to serve constituents in North Carolina's 11th Congressional district.
Kristen was chosen from a competitive pool It was a pleasure to work with Kristen, and I am proud to have such an intelligent and ambitious intern representing my office.
Kristen exemplified the spirit of public service and represents the best that Western North Carolina has to offer.
I congratulate her on the successful completion of her internship.
