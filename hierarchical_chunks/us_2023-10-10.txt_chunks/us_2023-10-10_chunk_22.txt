Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Mayor Catherine Moy as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Cat is a dedicated public servant who has offered years of service to her community.
A Fairfield native, she stepped up to serve on the Fairfield City Council in 2008, following a career as a journalist.
Cat's work on the City Council, and current service as Mayor, have helped make life better for the residents of Fairfield, including through reducing gang violence and working to address homelessness.
As a member of the National Conference of Mayors, Cat serves on a task force aimed at finding solutions to homelessness for populations in need across our county.
In addition to her work as an elected official, Cat offers her own time in service to her community.
She has been involved with countless organizations serving youth and those in need, including Girls of the Run, Boy Scouts, and local youth sports programs.
Cat also makes a point of reaching out to those living in homeless encampments, helping them to find the support they need while working toward a more permanent solution.
She is an impactful leader who has offered her time and resources in service to her community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Mayor Catherine Moy for her positive contributions to our community.
