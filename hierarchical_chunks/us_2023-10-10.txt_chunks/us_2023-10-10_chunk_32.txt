Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the Wasco Woman's Club on their 100-year anniversary and to thank them for their significant contributions to the Wasco community.
Founded in 1923, the Wasco Woman's Club was started by 13 young women who joined together to improve Wasco through volunteer service.
Their unwavering commitment to public service has guided their mission over the past century.
The Wasco Woman's Club now has approximately 40 members, many in the community.
The club is passionate about the well-being of the city's residents and focuses many of their efforts on strengthening local schools, libraries, and youth programs.
For a century, the Wasco Woman's Club has offered a chance for women community.
The club is a strong supporter of the Ronald McDonald House and Toys for Tigers organization, helping children and their families get through incredibly difficult situations.
Additionally, the club hosts regular events for those in the community, including the Wasco High School Student Art and Photography Awards and the Christmas with Santa Event for special needs students.
The club is also the proud owner of the oldest adobe building in the city, which they use to host special events and community gatherings.
Amid all of their work, the members of the Wasco Woman's Club are committed to uplifting each other through their long-standing friendships and shared commitment to the betterment of the community.
