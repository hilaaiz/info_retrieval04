Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Technical Sergeant Callie Aberin as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Callie enlisted in the United States Air Force in 2012 and now serves as a Technical Sergeant at Travis Air Force Base.
She was selected as a Senior Instructor at the Air Mobility Command's largest Airman Leadership School, where she educates, mentors, and certifies frontline supervisors on leadership skills, interpersonal skills, and behavioral theory.
Her leadership in these positions have fortified strategic objectives in the personnel of Travis AFB.
In addition to her official duties, Callie serves as the local Air Force Sergeant's Association Chapter President, and advocates for improved quality of life and economic fairness for all military personnel.
Under her leadership, this organization surpassed membership goals by 217 percent.
This community service has extended beyond Travis AFB and into the surrounding community where she has helped raise money for causes such as the Solano County Law Enforcement Torch Run and the Special Olympics.
Callie was recognized as an NCO of the Year for the 60th Air Mobility Wing, Travis AFB Instructor of the Year in 2022, and ASFA's 2023 International NCO of the Year.
Callie's dedication to her community and her country deserves recognition, as she goes above and beyond her official responsibilities to advocate for military personnel.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Callie Aberin for her positive contributions to our community.
