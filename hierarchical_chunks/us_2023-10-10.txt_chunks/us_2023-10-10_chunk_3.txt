Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise to recognize the indefatigable work of Bo Shuff, who recently stepped down as Executive Director of DC Vote after seven years.
At DC Vote, Bo helped lead the movement to make the District of Columbia the 51st state and to prevent Congress from interfering in D.C.'s local affairs.
I have worked closely with Bo on these efforts.
During Bo's tenure at DC Vote, the House of Representatives twice passed my bill, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, that would make D.C. a state.
Those are the only two times in history either chamber of Congress has passed the D.C. statehood bill.
Bo has been involved in campaigns and advocacy since 2000, when he worked on behalf of then-Vice President Al Gore as part of the Florida Coordinate Campaign.
In 2002, he worked on the statewide coordinated effort to re-elect then-U.S. 
Senator Tom Harkin and then-Governor and now-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
In 2003, Bo worked in more than 30 states for the Human Rights Campaign to pass equality legislation and to elect candidates who supported LGBTQ rights.
Bo has also worked for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, serving as Chief of Staff of its foundation, what is now the Progressive Caucus Center.
In 2013, Bo became Campaign Manager for the mayoral campaign of now-D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.
After that successful campaign, Bo became Executive Director of DC Vote.
I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the important contributions of Bo Shuff to the District of Columbia and the Nation.
