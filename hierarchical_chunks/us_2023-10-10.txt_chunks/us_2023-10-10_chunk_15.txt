Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Debra Mason as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Debra is the current Executive Director of the Bay Point Community Foundation and the Bay Point Municipal Advisory Council, where she has served for many years.
Over the years, she has worked for after-school programs and served on the Mt. Diablo School Board, and today she continues to be a fierce advocate for students, parents, schools, and her community.
She has pushed for public safety, nutrition assistance, after school education, and community engagement in schools.
Continuing her work with education, she is also a California School Age Consortium Board Member.
Her dedication, service, and work ethic has been an invaluable benefit to the local community.
One example of a lasting impact that she has made on the community is establishing the Bay Point Branch of the Contra Costa County Public Library.
Debra has been committed to addressing issues that she cares about and is always willing to take action and help others.
Debra has been involved with countless community offices and committees where her leadership has improved our local schools and broader community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Debra Mason for her positive contributions to our community.
