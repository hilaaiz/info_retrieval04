Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Ebony Antoine as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
As a victim of gun violence herself, Ebony founded a nonprofit, Broken By Violence, to help families like hers heal after being impacted by gun violence.
Broken By Violence has provided services to hundreds of families, including rental assistance, food assistance, emergency housing, mental health service referrals, and monthly healing spaces for survivors.
She has worked with Solano Family Justice Center, the Vallejo Police Department, the City of Vallejo, and the Alameda County District Attorney to provide victims services and has also advocated for legislation that would better support survivors throughtout California.
Although her life was irrevocably changed by tragedy, through her strength and determination, she became a beacon of hope for others.
Her resilience and dedication to serving others is an inspiration to all who meet her.
She truly embodies the values of a woman of courage by showing kindness, wisdom, humility, and compassion.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Ebony Antoine for her positive contributions to our community.
