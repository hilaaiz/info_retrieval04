Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, today I rise in celebration of the 125th anniversary.
Located in Indiana's 7th Congressional District, Flanner House was founded in 1903 as a community center for Indianapolis' AfricanAmerican community.
Today, the organization is central to the surrounding community, serving the whole family with programming like the Child Development Center, Center for Working Families, and an Elders Center.
The organization has implemented innovative solutions to problems our community faces, including a Food Justice Initiative that led to the opening Cleo's Bodega Grocery and Cafe, and Flanner Farms.
These efforts provide healthy, affordable, and culturally appropriate produce to address food insecurity while employing young people and neighbors.
Flanner House also continues to feed the soul by celebrating Black history, culture, and talent through the Ujamaa Bookstore and other community-strengthening programming featuring Black artists, scholars, and musicians.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our gratitude and best wishes to an organization that has created immeasurable change.
Organizations like Flanner House care deeply about their community and the people they serve.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations on this milestone anniversary and wish Flanner House many more years of success.
