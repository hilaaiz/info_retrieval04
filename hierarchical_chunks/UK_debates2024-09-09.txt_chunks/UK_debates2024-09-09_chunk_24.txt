Malvern college, Malvern St James girls’ school, Bredon school and other schools in West Worcestershire that offer places to children with special educational needs not only play an important role in our education system, but support the local economy.
Will the Minister state that he does not want to see the closure of any of those important independent schools in West Worcestershire?
This Government’s ambition is that all children and young people with SEND receive the right support to succeed in their education as they move into adult life.
We are committed to taking a community-wide approach, improving inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools, and ensuring that special schools cater to those with the most complex needs.
Children whose places in private school have been deemed necessary by the local authority will not be affected by the tax changes.
