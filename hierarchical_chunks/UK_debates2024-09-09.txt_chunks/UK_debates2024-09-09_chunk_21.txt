I welcome the Secretary of State to her place.
The Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 would have ensured that universities in England had the tools they needed to deal with interference and threats to freedom of speech and academic freedom, wherever they originated.
Now that the Government will no longer implement that Act, will she clarify her alternative plans to protect academic freedom in the higher education sector?
