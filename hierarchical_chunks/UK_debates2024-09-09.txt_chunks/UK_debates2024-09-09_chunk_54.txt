I thank my hon.
Friend for all her hard work while in opposition on these important issues.
This Government see early education as more than just childcare; it is central to our mission to give every child the best start in life.
We recognise the inherited workforce challenges, in both recruitment and retention.
In the coming weeks and months, this Government will set out plans for reform, beginning with a complete reset with the sector, so that the workforce feel supported and valued.
