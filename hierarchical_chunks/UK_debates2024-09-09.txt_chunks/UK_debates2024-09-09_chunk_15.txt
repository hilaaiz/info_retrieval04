I welcome the Secretary of State to her position.
Last year, the House of Lords Industry and Regulators Committee presented its report, which was very critical of the OfS—we did not need to read between the lines to understand just how poorly the Committee thought of it.
It felt that it was serving neither the students nor the providers.
What plans does she have to reset the relationship with the OfS so that it gives renewed focus to the students that it is supposed to represent?
