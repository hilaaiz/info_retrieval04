I thank the Minister for her answer.
It is just over two years since I published the independent review of children’s social care, which was commissioned by the previous Government.
The review called for a radical reset of the whole children’s social care system, which was urgently needed, and the previous Government took some modest steps down that track but failed to realise the potential.
Since the election, a number of the children, families and care-experienced adults who were involved in the review have been in touch with me to share their hopes that we will be able to deliver on the ambition of the review.
Do the Government intend to prioritise the resources that will be needed to implement the review in the upcoming spending review?
