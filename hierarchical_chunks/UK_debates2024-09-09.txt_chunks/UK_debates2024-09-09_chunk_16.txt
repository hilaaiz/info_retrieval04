I thank my hon.
Friend for all his work in this important area to ensure that our universities are recognised as a crucial part of how we drive growth in our country.
Sir David’s review, which we published in July, is a platform for improvement, and I welcome and accept its core findings.
The Government will support the OfS in refocusing on fewer key priorities, to do what is most important for students and universities, and to do it well.
We will take the necessary action to support that work.
