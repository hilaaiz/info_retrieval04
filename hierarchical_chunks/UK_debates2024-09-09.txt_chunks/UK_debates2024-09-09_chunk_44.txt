Last year, there was a 38% increase in the number of CAMHS referrals in Birmingham, while also a sharp fall in the number of young people seen within six months of a referral.
Does the Minister agree that we need much more preventive support in schools, and closer working between education and health bodies?
My hon.
Friend is right.
This Government have committed to recruiting 8,500 additional staff across children and adult NHS mental health services.
That will help to reduce delays, provide faster treatment and ease pressure on busy mental health services.
Family hubs are also crucial to providing that.
