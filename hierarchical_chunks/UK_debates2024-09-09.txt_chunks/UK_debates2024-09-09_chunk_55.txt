As was alluded to by my right hon.
Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Graham Stuart), children with special educational needs and disabilities in some urban local authorities receive three times more funding than they do in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
Will the Secretary of State or her Minister meet me and East Riding colleagues, so that we can secure a fairer future for our local children?
