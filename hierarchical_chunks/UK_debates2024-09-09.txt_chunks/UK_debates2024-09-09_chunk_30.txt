I joined my hon.
Friend in Basingstoke during the general election campaign, so I know that many families in Basingstoke and right across our country were concerned about this issue, and I can give him that commitment.
Members on the Conservative Benches may recall that the previous Education Secretary described the system that she left behind as one that was “lose-lose-lose”.
I agree.
We are determined to turn that around, which is why we have already restructured the Department for Education, with much more focus on support for children with SEND as part of our schools provision.
Speech and language support for children with special educational needs and disabilities was clearly not a priority for the previous Government.
I have seen the damage that that has done to families in my constituency of Ealing Southall: at a recent surgery, one mum told me that she just wants her young son to be able to tell her when he is in pain.
What steps will the Secretary of State take to ensure that children like those in my constituency receive the speech and language support that they need?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight how important it is that all of our children have strong speech and language skills.
That is why this Government will roll out early language interventions to make sure that all of our children get support at the earliest possible point, including extending the Nuffield early language intervention for this academic year, because it is so important that we make a difference when our children are young.
