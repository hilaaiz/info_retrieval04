I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for his question, and will make sure that officials engage with him on that point.
If there is anything further he would like to share, I will happily look at it.
He is right: this is a difficult area, and we need to make sure we get it right.
I am determined to deliver a system where all children and young people have every chance and opportunity.
Particularly when it comes to SEND support, we will have to work across the House to get to a much stronger and better position for our children and families.
What is the Secretary of State going to do about the capacity crisis that is rapidly emerging as tens of thousands of children are being forced out of independent schools by this Government’s deeply misguided VAT policy?
I have a list of 20 schools in Buckinghamshire with no places whatsoever, and Bristol city council is considering buying places from an independent school to put back in that school, at taxpayers’ expense, a child who recently left that school at the parents’ expense.
We were elected on a manifesto of driving high and rising standards in our state schools.
The public back our policy.
We think it is right that we prioritise investment in our state schools where the vast majority of our children go to school, including the vast majority of children in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency.
I suggest that he spends a bit more time thinking about their interests.
