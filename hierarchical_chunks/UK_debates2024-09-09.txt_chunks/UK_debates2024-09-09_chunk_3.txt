The Secretary of State is absolutely right that the previous Government botched the roll-out of T-levels.
In particular, the failure to deliver the T-level in hospitality and tourism was a huge blow to our communities in the lakes and dales.
Her predecessor said that was caused by a failure to gain placements in the tourism and hospitality industry.
Surely that is surmountable, so what plans does she have to talk to the hospitality and tourism industry in order to deliver the T-level to communities like mine very soon?
The hon.
Gentleman makes an important point about ensuring that placements are available.
I am happy to ensure that he has a discussion with the Minister for Skills to make sure we address his concerns about hospitality.
Alderman Tooling in my constituency is one of thousands of employers now investing in the talent of tomorrow.
In five years’ time, does the Secretary of State expect the number of apprentices to be higher or lower than today?
I pay tribute to all the businesses across our country that are providing high-quality skills training and apprenticeship starts.
However, apprenticeship starts for the under-25s fell by 38% in the period 2015-16 to 2022-23.
It will fall to this Labour Government to turn that around.
