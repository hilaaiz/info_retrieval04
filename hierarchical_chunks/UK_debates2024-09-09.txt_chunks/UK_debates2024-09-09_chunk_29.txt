I welcome the Secretary of State’s answer.
On doorsteps, in surgeries and over email, families across Basingstoke have told me countless stories of the obstacles they have to go through just to have the barest acknowledgement of their child’s needs, only to go through a similar obstacle course for their child to be assessed, and yet again for them to get the help they are legally entitled to.
Can the Secretary of State offer families in Basingstoke with experience of this failing system some hope that they can expect better in future?
