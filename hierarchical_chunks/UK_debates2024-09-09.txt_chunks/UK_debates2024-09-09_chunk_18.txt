We have seen attempts by hostile states to influence our higher education sector, which the last Conservative Government took action to counter.
Does the Secretary of State therefore share the concerns about reports that Peking University HSBC Business School in Oxford may be partly operating under Chinese Communist party rules, and does she expect the Office for Students to investigate that?
The shadow Minister will know that the Office for Students is independent, but I will ensure that it looks very carefully at the concerns that he has set out, and addresses them accordingly.
What assessment she has made of the adequacy of levels of academic freedom in the higher education sector.
The Government fully support academic freedom.
Higher education must be a space for robust discussion and intellectual rigour, and it was a Labour Government that enshrined freedom of expression into law.
Our recent decision to pause the implementation of further parts of the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act 2023 was precisely because we believe in academic freedom.
It is therefore crucial that the legal framework is workable.
Baroness Smith in the other place and officials are speaking with a range of stakeholders.
Their views will form part of our consideration of all options for protecting academic freedom into the future.
No options are off the table.
