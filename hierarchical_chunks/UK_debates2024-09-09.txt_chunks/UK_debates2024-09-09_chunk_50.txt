I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and the passion with which it was delivered.
I recently spoke to members of a children and young people’s advisory group, who told me about some of the challenges they face at university.
In some cases, they had not even been informed about the option of university, which is quite shocking.
We are committed to providing the best university experience for care leavers.
Access to higher education should be based on ability and attainment, not background, but too many children across our country do not get the chance to succeed.
The previous Government could have done much more.
