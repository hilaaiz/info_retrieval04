I thank the hon.
Member for highlighting that very serious concern.
Student suicide is serious and a concerning matter.
In the academic year ending 2020, the suicide rate for higher education students in England and Wales was lower than in the general population of the same age group.
However, every suicide is tragic and suicide expert Sir Louis Appleby is overseeing the national review of higher education suicides to learn more to prevent suicides.
It has seen excellent engagement from the sector and will report on that.
