I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work that she has done in standing up for children in social care in recent years.
We will champion the ambitions of all children and ensure that background is no barrier to success.
In our children’s wellbeing Bill, we will set out our plans to raise standards for all children in social care and will ensure that they are supported to thrive.
