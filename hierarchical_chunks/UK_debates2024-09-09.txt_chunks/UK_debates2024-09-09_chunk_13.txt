I thank the hon.
Member for his explanation of all the various challenges experienced by young people and children.
If I had a crystal ball, I would be able to explain what will happen in the spending review, but as we move forward and introduce the children’s wellbeing Bill, we will bring clarity to some of the Government’s reforms.
The spending review will also reveal where the Budget lies in these things.
