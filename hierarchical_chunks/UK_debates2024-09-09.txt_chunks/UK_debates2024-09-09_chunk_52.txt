I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
Breakfast clubs are about more than just food: they provide opportunities for children to play, to learn and to socialise at the start of the school day.
The Government are giving parents more choice in childcare, and are supporting families with the cost of living crisis.
Our plans for breakfast clubs will remove barriers to opportunity by ensuring that every child of primary school age, no matter their circumstances, is well prepared for school.
