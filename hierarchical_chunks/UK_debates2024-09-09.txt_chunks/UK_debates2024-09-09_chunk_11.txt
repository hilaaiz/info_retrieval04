I thank my hon.
Friend for the work he did on the independent review of children’s social care, which this Government are considering as part of our reform programme.
Children’s social care is a key priority for this Government, evidenced by our commitment to the children’s wellbeing Bill announced in the King’s Speech in July.
A full programme for delivery will be produced in order to support that commitment.
We have  inherited a challenging set of economic circumstances.
However, we are committed to reforming children’s social care, and that will be brought forward, as I have already mentioned, in the children’s wellbeing Bill.
