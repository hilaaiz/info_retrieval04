Yes, I can give the right hon.
Gentleman that reassurance.
We looked very carefully and very closely at the way in which the legislation was going to operate.
I want to ensure that we have good, strong, workable legislation.
I was concerned about what I had heard from Jewish groups and other minority communities about the unintended consequences that might follow from the legislation.
That is why I paused commencement, with a view to getting this right, ensuring that we protect academic freedom while avoiding a situation where hate speech is allowed to flourish on campus.
I congratulate the Secretary of State on taking the hard decisions that are needed in Government, and I am very pleased to hear that no options are off the table.
What reassurances can she give me and other women that she will protect female academics, such as Jo Phoenix, Kathleen Stock and Selina Todd, from being bullied and hounded out of successful university careers?
Like my hon.
Friend, I take having strong freedom of expression in our universities, and students being exposed to a range of views—some of which they might find difficult or disagree with—extremely seriously.
That is why it is so important to have a wide-ranging education.
Officials will ensure that we engage with a wide range of views in this important area as we look at next steps, and I would be more than happy to discuss that in more detail with her.
