Young people in Weston-super-Mare and across our country deserve the very best opportunities.
Since 2016, University Centre Weston has transformed access to higher education in our town, meaning that more can study closer to home, improving access.
How will the Labour Government seek to strengthen the strategic objective of the Office for Students to widen participation in communities such as mine?
I strongly agree with my hon.
Friend about the importance of widening participation, and he sets out clearly how universities are a key part of towns and cities right across our country.
The last Government wanted to use our world-leading sector as a political football, talking down institutions and watching on as the situation became even more desperate.
I have appointed the new interim chair to sharpen the focus of the Office for Students, focus far more on the financial sustainability of the sector, and return universities to being the engines of growth and opportunity that we want to see after 14 wasted years.
I am delighted to hear the right hon.
Lady talk about engines of growth and opportunity, because that is exactly what universities are when they are well run.
In my county we have a new university, the New Model Institute for Technology and Engineering, which is doing exactly that, and offering incredible opportunities for young people to do a masters programme in three years, and then, as we are seeing with the new cohort, to go into companies as good as BAE Systems, Kier, Balfour Beatty, the Atomic Weapons Establishment and others.
That work has been assisted by the Office for Students, which granted new degree-awarding powers.
Does the right hon.
Lady share my view that this is a deeply worthwhile enterprise that could be replicated around the country, and will she come and visit herself?
I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this matter.
I would be happy to meet with him to discuss it further.
