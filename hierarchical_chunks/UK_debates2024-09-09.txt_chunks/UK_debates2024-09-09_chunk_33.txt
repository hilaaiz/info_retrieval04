I thank the Secretary of State for her answer, and for her personal commitment to creating a fairer funding system for children with special educational needs.
In that light, she will forgive me if I mention that the East Riding has the lowest high-needs block allocation of any local authority in England.
So many people have been genuinely committed to a fairer system in the past.
Will the Secretary of State set out how she will achieve that?
It is easy to support it in principle, but it is very hard to find a way of delivering it in practice.
