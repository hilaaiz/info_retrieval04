I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and welcome him back to this place.
He is a tireless champion for children in his constituency and regularly speaks up on local schools.
I am aware of the situation at St Joseph’s preparatory school.
Private schools are of course businesses that are responsible for their own finances, but the Department stands ready to assist.
The Government are committed to high and rising standards in schools, and I hope that we can work together to achieve that.
