I thank the Secretary of State for her focus on T-levels and her recognition of the need for a pause.
I back up what my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Mrs Brackenridge)  said about the botched nature of the T-level roll-out.
Does the Secretary of State recognise that it is a challenge for many services, such as the NHS, to absorb T-level students effectively?
Those qualifications need truly to give our young people the opportunities they deserve.
Will she meet me and local further education experts to discuss this issue?
