The shadow Foreign Secretary has talked about phase 2.
There have been stops and starts in this peace process, as there often are in these very difficult situations.
Our role is to continue to speak very closely with the US and with Steve Witkoff to push for practical, day-to-day solutions.
She asked about British aid and what negotiations we are undertaking.
We are in daily contact with the region, and are pushing for discussions, conversations and dialogue, so that aid can get back in.
Following this urgent question, we undertake to contact the Red Cross, one of our partner organisations, with the message that this House wants that aid to re-enter the area, and to save lives.
The powerful scenes of Palestinians celebrating the start of Ramadan, even as their homes and lives have been reduced to rubble by Israeli forces, send a defiant message to the world that despite the displacement and destruction, Palestinians remain rooted in their land.
Will the Minister confirm that the decision to block all aid to Gaza, collectively punishing the entire population, is a war crime and a breach of international law, contravening provisions of the Geneva convention and the Rome statute?
My hon.
Friend is quite right to point out the devastating impact of no aid getting through, and to say that a halt on goods and supplies entering Gaza, such as that recently announced by the Government of Israel, risks breaching Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law.
It is not for Ministers at the Dispatch Box to make legal decisions or judgments, but I assure my hon.
Friend that the former Minister for development pledged £17 million to ensure that healthcare, food and shelter can reach tens of thousands of civilians, and to support vital infrastructure.
My hon.
Friend must reassure her constituents that the Foreign Office is doing all it can to get infrastructure across the OPTs and into Gaza, in order to relieve the suffering.
