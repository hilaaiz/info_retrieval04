I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his words about this Government stepping up the funding for defence.
Last week, we expanded sanctions on Russia, including by looking at financial services.
This week, we have signed off a UK Export Finance package to provide more military support, above and beyond our defence spending and as well as the loan repaid using the profit on those assets.
As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we would look at going further but, as the right hon.
Gentleman knows, it is incredibly complicated to do that in line with international law.
However, we keep  all options on the table, because, as he is absolutely right to say, Russia should pay for the damage that Russia has caused.
