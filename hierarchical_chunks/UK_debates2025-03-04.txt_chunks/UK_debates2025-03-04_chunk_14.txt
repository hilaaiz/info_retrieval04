I thank my hon.
Friend for his questions; I will do my best to answer them.
I can confirm that Treasury officials routinely engage with local and regional officials across the country, including frequently in Manchester with Mayor Burnham and his team.
I would point my hon.
Friend gently to some of the announcements made by the Chancellor, including support for the Old Trafford development in Manchester.
I congratulate the operators of Manchester airport on running a successful business, which we will continue to support in the normal way.
