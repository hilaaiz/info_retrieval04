Sorry, Mr Speaker.
I was nearly as shocked when you called me as I was when listening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Radio 4 talking about economic growth.
She said there had not been a new runway built in this country since 1945.
Manchester airport would be very surprised to hear that, because its new runway has been operating for nearly 25 years.
I was shocked by that but not really surprised, because I think many officials in the Treasury who advise her show a startling ignorance of the English regions, and that leads to a certain prejudice in the formula they use to calculate whether a scheme should go ahead.
Can the Minister and the rest of the Treasury team provide coaches to send Treasury officials around the English regions to talk to people who know about growth?
Secondly, will he look at the formulas that decide where economic growth happens, which are biased against the regions?
