I thank my hon.
Friend for her ongoing campaigning on humanitarian aid for Gaza.
It is very positive that the Rafah crossing remains open: that has led to a significant increase in the number of medical evacuations in recent weeks.
It is vital for Israel to ensure that there is a sustained passage for patients who need treatment that is not available in Gaza, and officials from all relevant Whitehall Departments are exploring avenues to ensure that our support best meets the needs of the those who are critically ill there.
The right hon.
Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)  talked about the medical staff who are under threat.
We have supported them with technical advice and training, and we have also announced £1 million for the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population, to be delivered through WHO Egypt, to support Palestinians who have been medically evacuated from Gaza.
