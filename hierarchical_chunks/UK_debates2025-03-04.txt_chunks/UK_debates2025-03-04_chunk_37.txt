I thank the shadow Foreign Secretary for emphasising the effect on families on both sides of this terrible conflict, but particularly on the British families whom the Prime Minister has met, and on Emily Damari, and their dignity and grace.
She also mentioned all those who want a home, want security in the region, and have been affected by this most horrendous of wars.
She evoked the terrible images of hostages being released while the most macabre of pantomimes went on behind them.
That cruelty is utterly unacceptable, and the UK has made that very clear to interlocutors, both at ministerial and Foreign Secretary level.
