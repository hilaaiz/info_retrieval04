I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and for his expertise on aid and foreign affairs.
He is quite right to emphasise the actions of some settlers.
There are many settler communities that just  get on with it, and that want a peaceful solution, but he is right to say that there is violence in the settlements, which are of course unlawful under international humanitarian law and harm the prospects of a two-state solution.
I thank my hon.
Friend for putting on record the impact on the faith community, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan, and the fact that mosques have been attacked.
We will ensure that that point gets through in our next discussion with our interlocutors, both on the Israeli side and on the Palestinian side.
