The Minister has rightly said that forced displacement is unacceptable.
Indeed, I think she said that the actions of the illegal extremist settlers were unlawful.
You may have seen the Oscars ceremony this week, Mr Speaker, which featured an incredible film called “No Other Land”, which highlights the forced displacements in Masafer Yatta, and was made by Israelis and Palestinians together.
It won the Oscar.
I bet they would trade every gong going for that film to have its desired effect, and for the violence to stop.
We can do something, and if ever there was a time for us to ban the illegal settlement goods that fund those extremist settlers, is now not that time?
