My hon.
Friend is right that humanitarian aid should never be contingent on a ceasefire or used as a political tool, and we urge the Government of Israel to lift restrictions immediately and unconditionally.
He asked what else this Government will do.
We will continue to support the peace process, which should involve both sides getting around the table, freeing the hostages, allowing the aid in, and having a vision for the future of this region that is so affected by conflict and death.
I pay tribute to the former Development Minister, my constituency neighbour  the right hon.
Member for Oxford East (Anneliese Dodds) , for her work in this area, and also for the wise words in her resignation letter.
