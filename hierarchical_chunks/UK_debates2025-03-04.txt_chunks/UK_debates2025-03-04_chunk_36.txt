The Minister rightly referred to Emily Damari and others.
Emily has shared details of her really awful ordeal in captivity by Hamas.
We all wish her well in her medical appointments and in the treatment that she is receiving.
Last week, we also tragically saw the distressing return of the bodies of those killed in Hamas captivity.
Our hearts break for their loved ones, and we mourn with them and with the people of Israel.
I have a series of questions for the Minister.
First, what role is the UK playing in helping to get an agreement on phase 2 of this ceasefire over the line?
What discussions has the Foreign Secretary had with America, Israel, and other regional players in recent days?
What engagement have the Government had with the plans for the future of Gaza that are being discussed in Cairo, and on how to prevent Hamas from continuing to control the Gaza strip?
Secondly, what is the Government’s practical response on aid access?
How are they working to unblock this situation, and what is happening to the British aid that is already in the region or en route?
Finally, what recent conversations have Foreign Office Ministers had with the International Committee of the Red Cross, both on its efforts on hostage release and on humanitarian assistance more broadly?
