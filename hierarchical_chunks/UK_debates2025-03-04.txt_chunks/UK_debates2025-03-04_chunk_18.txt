My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
[Interruption.]
Conservative Members are chuntering, but that is their legacy.
Not once in 17 years was a zero-based review done, not once did former Conservative Ministers require their Departments to go line-by-line through their budgets, and not once did they think that the responsible thing to do was to go through to check  how every pound of taxpayers’ money was spent.
Instead, there was an argument each year: how much more money am I going to get; how much more borrowing will there be to pay for these bills; and how many more promises am I going to make that I know I will not deliver.
The British people were sick to death of that approach to politics, and this Government are taking a fundamentally different approach.
The adoption and special guardianship support fund provides excellent value for money in Mid Sussex for Beacon House, which is a specialist mental health and trauma clinic.
Unfortunately, however, the clinic’s financial future is looking uncertain.
Does the Minister agree that investing in mental health is always a good idea when it comes to getting people back to work and well again and able to contribute to society?
Will the Minister work with the Department for Education to secure future funding for this vital service?
I agree entirely that mental health services are in desperate need of investment and support across the country.
The evidence is very clear that there are, for example, too many people out of work who would be like to be in work, but who are waiting at home unwell and unable to receive the support and services that they need and deserve.
The Health Secretary is working hard on that at the moment.
We are going into the spending review negotiations over the coming weeks and months, and we will set out further detail in due course.
I look forward to being able to provide more information specifically as we go through that process.
