I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a strong champion for his constituency, for raising this rail project.
In relation to such projects, the case that he has made will be an important part of our consideration in the months ahead as part of the spending review.
I will arrange for him to meet the appropriate Transport Minister as we make those considerations.
