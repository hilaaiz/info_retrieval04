I have just come back from the middle east, where I went with the Foreign Affairs Committee.
While the world watches with increasing alarm the disintegration of the peace process in Gaza, we were warned in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the west bank and Israel that the far-right Government in Israel may have no long-term plan on Gaza, but that there is a long-term plan for the west bank, and that is annexation.
The international community is well aware of that.
It sees the evictions, the demolitions, the increasing number of Israeli settlements, and that 40,000 people have recently been displaced.
In these days of hard power, what is plan B?
What will the international community do to stop the annexation of the west bank?
It will not be enough to simply condemn it once it has happened.
