I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
My No. 1 ask is that he has another go at making better jokes in future.
To answer the substance of his question, I agree with him that the state is not productive enough on a whole range of issues.
He talks about civil service headcount, about Government offices and locations, and about working conditions.
He could also talk about digital transformation.
Frankly, we have an enormous amount of work to do, which will become evident through our spending review.
It is something that is being taken very seriously not just by the Treasury, but from the Prime Minister downwards.
I look forward  to his reflecting on what we suggest is the answer to 14 years of failure from his party when it was in government.
