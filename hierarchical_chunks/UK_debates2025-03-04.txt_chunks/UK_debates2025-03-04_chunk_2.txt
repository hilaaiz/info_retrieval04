The Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked— What steps she plans to take to encourage saving.
The Government are committed to supporting people to save and invest, and we want to build a better investment culture.
Currently, 85% of people with savings income do not pay tax on it.
As we announced at the Budget from next month, we will expand the help to save scheme to all universal credit claimants in work.
The nation’s favourite way to save is through premium bonds.
Does the Minister think that they are good for the country and a valuable way of encouraging saving?
For everyone who has them, they are quite exciting every month.
I think that premium bonds do provide excitement, not least in my parents’ household, where they are very popular.
They are already well promoted and popular, and we have seen annual investments in premium bonds increase by more than 50% since March 2019.
The funds raised through them go towards supporting vital public services.
I warmly welcome the Government’s commitment to extend the help to save scheme, which has been running for seven years.
Martin Lewis describes it as “a very clever scheme and one that will work for many people.”
May I urge the Minister to look at what needs to be done to raise awareness of it, because the actual uptake is very low, given that the Government have been giving £1,200 over four years?
It is critical that the right investment in promoting it happens, because it is such a brilliant scheme.
I could not agree with one of my predecessors more.
The right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely correct.
It is a great scheme and now that we are expanding it, we will take that opportunity to promote it better.
