I thank the Lib Dem spokesperson for his words.
He is quite right to emphasise the psychological impact of this terrible conflict, and the traumatised state of people in the region.
As the Foreign Secretary has said, we welcome the release of the 38 hostages in Gaza, including of course Emily Damari, whom we have already mentioned.
We think so much of those members of the Lifshitz family—they of course had strong ties to the UK—who were held hostage by terrorists in Gaza and who died.
We thank Qatar, Egypt and the US for providing support to ensure that the horrific ordeal of individuals and families can come to an end, but unfortunately, this is not the end.
That is why it is so important that we take this moment to push.
