We all know how important it is to encourage savings, because so many people are a paycheque away from poverty, but there has been a lot of discussion about lazy capital in cash-only ISAs, for example, and other savings accounts.
I know there is a drive by Government to see greater investment.
Would the Minister like to expand on the Government’s thoughts on that?
In particular, can she make any comments about the security of the cash ISA?
Cash savings provide a vital source of savings for a rainy day, and we recognise that.
Equally, we want to build a better investment culture in our society, so that it is not just the 8% of people who can afford financial advice who can have the opportunity of better rewards by investing in British companies and others in our economy.
On that point, it has been widely reported that the Chancellor is planning to slash the amount of cash that savers can save in ISAs from £20,000 to £4,000 a year.
Will the Chancellor rule out this punitive measure, which will see savings drop and push even more people into income tax?
We are committed to promoting savings and investment, as I said in an earlier answer.
One measure we are looking at is the Financial Conduct Authority’s review of the advice guidance boundary.
As I said in a previous answer, I do not want it just to be the 8% of people who can afford financial advice who reap the rewards of investing in our economy.
We keep all taxes under review.
