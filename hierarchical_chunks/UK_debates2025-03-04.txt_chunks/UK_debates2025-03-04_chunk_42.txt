The hon.
Gentleman asked what we were doing practically.
We are in daily contact with the region, including our mission there.
Obviously, in the context of the international debate, interventions such as this urgent question push for a just solution for those on both sides of this terrible conflict.
Last week, I was in the west bank, alongside other members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, on our wider trip to the middle east.
While the world’s attention is rightly on the devastating humanitarian situation in Gaza, we met Palestinians in the Jordan valley whose schools were being attacked, whose mosques were being burned, and whose livestock were being stolen by extremist Israeli settlers.
This is happening with the apparent connivance of the Israeli security forces, and it appears to be part of a wider plan for annexation.
What steps are we taking to prevent further erosion of Palestinian land in the west bank that would put the two-state solution even further away?
