Yesterday the all-party parliamentary group on UK-Israel heard from the families of five of the remaining hostages.
It is estimated that of the 59 who are still in captivity, only 24 are alive and 35 have been murdered.
The recently released hostage Eli Sharabi described the conditions in which he was detained: he was held in chains, brutally beaten and starved.
Alon Ohel, who was held alongside him, remains in captivity.
The families believe that the remaining hostages are in a very vulnerable position.
Clearly the demand must be for all of them to be released immediately, and that should be the aim of the British Government.
What action is the Minister taking to ensure that happens?
