I thank the hon.
Member for his ongoing support for peace in the region.
He specifically mentioned the family of Eli Sharabi, and we know that those families have a UK connection.
The UK has played an active role in co-ordinating with international partners since the beginning of the conflict.
The Foreign Secretary has visited Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories on three occasions since taking office, and has worked closely with European partners in pushing for a resolution to secure the ceasefire.
I think the situation has improved on that front in the last couple of weeks, but the hon.
Member is right to emphasise the importance of the return of hostages as part of the negotiated next part of the peace process.
