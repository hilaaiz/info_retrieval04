As recent days have shown, the ceasefire continues to be incredibly fragile.
Of course, we all want this agreement to hold, and none of us should be in any doubt that that hinges on the release of each and every hostage held by the Iranian-backed terrorists Hamas, who caused the conflict by their sickening acts on  7 October .
As the Minister has pointed out, those hostages and their families have now suffered unimaginably for more than 500 days, and that cannot go on.
The hostages have been held in barbaric conditions, and the world has been shocked by the distressing scenes involving those who have been released.
