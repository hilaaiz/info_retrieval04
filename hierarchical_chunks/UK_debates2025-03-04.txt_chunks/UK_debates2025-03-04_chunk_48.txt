I thank the Minister for updating the House on this troubling matter.
The Israeli Government’s decision is contrary to international humanitarian law and clearly undermines such a fragile ceasefire.
Both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have been absolutely clear about the right of Palestinians to return home to Gaza to rebuild their lives.
Does the Minister agree that their right to  return is jeopardised by the blocking of critical humanitarian aid, and what actions will the Government take if that right continues to be restricted?
