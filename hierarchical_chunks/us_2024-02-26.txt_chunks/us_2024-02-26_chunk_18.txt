Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Michael Berning for his years of service to our community.
Although retirement signals the end of his 44-year career with HEAPY, his legacy of success and leadership certainly serves as a model for others to follow.
I congratulate Michael and wish him all the best in a well-deserved retirement, and look forward to many more years of continued friendship.
