Mr. TURNER.
Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to honor the career of Michael Berning, a dedicated member of my community in Dayton, Ohio, and a close personal friend.
Michael will retire this month after 44 years of service at HEAPY, an engineering firm that has its fingerprints all over Ohio and throughout the country.
Michael started at HEAPY when he was still a Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Dayton, but he will end his tenure as its Chief Innovation Officer.
Michael was an early pioneer for the development of `green design' and sustainable building practices, and his efforts culminated in 2015 when he was named a LEED Fellow.
This prestigious recognition is muchdeserved because of Michael's leadership in HEAPY's regional sustainability conferences, assisting Montgomery County in establishing the Dayton Regional Green Initiative, and for his contributions to Environmental Design+Construction Magazine as both a writer and member Outside of Michael's work, he has served his community through multiple Boards, including Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Wright State ARTSGala, and the U.S. Green Building Council Ohio Chapter.
Michael served as chairman of the Montgomery County Republican Party in the early 1980s, and he managed my first campaign for public office when I ran for mayor of Dayton in 1993.
He put together a great team for my election victory that year, in a predominantly Democratic city, and led my successful reelection effort four years later.
