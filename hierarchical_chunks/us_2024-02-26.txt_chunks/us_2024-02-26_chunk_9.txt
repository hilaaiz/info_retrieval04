and multistate conservation grants.
D.C. does not receive any funding under this Act.
The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act provides funding for sport fish restoration, aquatic education, wetlands restoration, and boat-related activities.
Under this Act, states receive a minimum of one percent of the total amount apportioned, while D.C. is capped at one-third of one percent.
This omission and lack of parity under these Acts have serious consequences for D.C. D.C. has roughly 7,800 acres of parkland covering nearly a quarter of the city, which means it has more parkland per capita than any other city in the United States.
This bill would define ``State'' in these Acts to include D.C., providing D.C. with equal funding for wildlife conservation in our Nation's capital.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
