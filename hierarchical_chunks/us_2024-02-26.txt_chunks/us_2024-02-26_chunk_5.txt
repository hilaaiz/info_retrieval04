Mrs. Carlow was a devoted woman of faith and was a lifetime member of the Maud United Methodist Church.
While there, she taught Sunday school and led the Methodist Youth Fellowship church group for ten years.
Mrs. Carlow was always a thoughtful woman who sought to put a smile on your face.
Along with her husband James, she hosted daily happy hours for friends and loved ones so they could spend quality time together during the pandemic.
She also started a weekly tradition of sending flowers to others so that they wouldn't feel alone.
You could always count on her to help guide you throughout life and encourage you to do the right thing.
Mrs. Carlow's tragic passing leaves behind a legacy of hard work, entrepreneurship, and family values that can never be replaced.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of 
Mrs. Carlow's beautiful and uplifting life.
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.
