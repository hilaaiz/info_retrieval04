With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on levelling up.
This Government are committed to levelling up and creating opportunities across all regions and nations of the UK.
Last year, we set out our 12 levelling-up missions in the levelling-up White Paper, all principally aimed at tackling regional inequality, because we believe that people’s opportunities should be the same wherever they live, be it in a city or town, on an island, or in a rural or coastal community.
I am proud to say that since 2019 this Conservative Government have committed over £13 billion of local growth funding to levelling up.
Through the levelling-up fund, the town deal, the UK shared prosperity fund, the future high streets fund and much more, we are regenerating town centres and high streets, improving local transport, funding heritage assets and boosting productivity, jobs and living standards.
