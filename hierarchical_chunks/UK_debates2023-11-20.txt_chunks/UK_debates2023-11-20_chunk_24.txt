I thank the Minister for his answer.
As a Member from north-east Wales, I am interested in how we promote defence spending in all regions of the United Kingdom, meaning that there is some balance, with defence jobs and investment not concentrated in the same part of England every time.
What can the Minister do to assure my constituents in Delyn that they will have as much opportunity as those in places such as the south-west of England?
