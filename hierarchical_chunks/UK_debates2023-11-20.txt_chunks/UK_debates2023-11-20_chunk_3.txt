I thank the Secretary of State for that answer, but since the horrendous Hamas attacks on  7 October , 12,000 innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed; and two thirds were women and children.
The UN Secretary-General has described Gaza as a “graveyard of children”.
Today an Israeli airstrike on a United Nations Relief and Works Agency school has killed 12 people.
The Indonesian hospital in Gaza is currently surrounded by Israeli Defence Forces tanks.
Can the Minister confirm whether arms sold by the UK have been used in violations of international humanitarian law, and will he explain why arms sales to Israel have not yet been suspended?
