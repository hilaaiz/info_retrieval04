My hon.
Friend makes an excellent point.
She has been a long-running champion of the steel sector and its importance to her constituents.
Of course, we want a smooth transition between blast furnace and electronic arc steel making technology.
Steel remains incredibly important to the defence sector.
Take the Type 26: almost 50% of that is British steel.
That is 1,400 tonnes per ship.
That underlines why it is so important that, in constituencies such as my hon.
Friend’s, we continue to support the steel sector.
