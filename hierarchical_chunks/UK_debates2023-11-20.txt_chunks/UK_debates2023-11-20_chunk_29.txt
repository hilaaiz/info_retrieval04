I am delighted to add my thanks to my hon.
Friend’s brilliant volunteers.
It is an opportunity to mention from the Dispatch Box the many thousands of people who turned out across the country on Remembrance Weekend to commemorate and remember those who bravely gave of themselves so that we can be here in freedom today.
