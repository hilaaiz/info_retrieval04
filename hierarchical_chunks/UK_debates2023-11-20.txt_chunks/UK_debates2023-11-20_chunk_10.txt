The Minister may be aware that earlier this year one of the accommodation blocks in HMS Collingwood in my Gosport constituency was shut down all together because it just simply was not fit for human habitation.
There are also some issues with the accommodation blocks in HMS Sultan.
Could I invite the Minister to come to Gosport to have a look at some of the accommodation on offer for our service personnel?
It is simply not good enough, and they deserve better.
I would be more than happy to do so.
