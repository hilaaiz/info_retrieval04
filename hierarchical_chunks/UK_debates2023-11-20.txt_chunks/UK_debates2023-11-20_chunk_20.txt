I thank the Minister for that response.
Beyond the Battlefield, an independent charity in my constituency, does incredible work with veterans who are homeless, giving them accommodation and some skills.
I have extended an invitation to the Minister to come to Northern Ireland to visit Beyond the Battlefield, so I will extend that again.
I think he will be impressed—I know I am—and he will see that what we do in Northern Ireland can be done elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
