I thank the Minister for advance sight of his statement.
I start by congratulating all those areas that have been successful in their bids—including Chorley, Mr Speaker.
Commiserations to all those areas that have missed out once again, although the truth is that even the areas that have won will find that this money is a drop in the ocean, compared with the £15 billion cut from local government funding since 2010.
Only six weeks ago there were reports that councils face a £3.5 billion shortfall in their budgets for this year alone.
How does today’s announcement help them face that existential threat?
