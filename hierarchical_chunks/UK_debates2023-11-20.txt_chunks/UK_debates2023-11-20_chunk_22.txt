I thank the Minister for his response but, respectfully, I do not find it sufficient.
My constituent has provided more than a decade’s service within the Ministry of Defence Guard Service.
He reports that he and his contemporaries are disincentivised to apply for promotion, because it would mean switching to the new OMEC contracts from their legacy contracts and an extra six hours’ work a week.
Many are leaving.
Will the Minister promise to investigate this issue thoroughly?
