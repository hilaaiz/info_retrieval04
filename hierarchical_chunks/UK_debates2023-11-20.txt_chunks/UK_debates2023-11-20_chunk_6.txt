My right hon.
Friend will know that we have indeed pledged to increase defence spending to 2.5%, as economic conditions allow.
This year, it will probably be around 2.4%, so we are making good progress.
Prior to getting this role, I talked about my own desire to see higher defence spending, because we are living in a much less certain world, with many more variables.
He is right to point out Iran’s action, with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syrian militias in Iraq, and Houthis in Yemen very much driving the situation.
The reality is that neither the long-term security of Israel nor justice for the Palestinians will be found through bombs and bullets.
As an international community, we need to be doing all we can to move to an enduring cessation of the violence, but while we are doing that, can the Secretary of State say how the UK armed forces will be utilising their capacity to help those getting aid into Gaza to get much bigger quantities in than is happening at the moment?
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right about the UK’s desire to do that, and I have talked about how we have deployed a large increase in personnel  in the region to work with various Governments.
I have personally spoken to most of the middle eastern Governments, and on those calls the first thing they have done is welcome our deterrent and the fact that we have brought such a large amount of aid—now £30 million—to help the Palestinians.
It is not just the hostages themselves who are being held hostage; the population of Gaza are being held hostage by Hamas, and therefore the solution is to deal with Hamas themselves.
