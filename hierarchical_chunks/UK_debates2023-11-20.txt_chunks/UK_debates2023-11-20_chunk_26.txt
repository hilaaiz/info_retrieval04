I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising the work of the slightly less glamorous part of the Royal Air Force that does long-distance surveillance missions.
They are an important part of the UK’s defence strategy and our ability to monitor and observe what our adversaries are doing.
Their work over the past year above the north Atlantic and the high north, the Baltic, the Black sea, the eastern Mediterranean and across the middle east has been central to defence operations.
The team at RAF Waddington and at Lossiemouth should be congratulated.
