I thank my hon.
Friend for his statement.
I have lost my voice cheering for the £1.1 million for Swadlincote town.
This is the first time in 50 years that Government money has been put into regenerating that area, which is the heart of South Derbyshire, and I thank him very much indeed.
I have had a word with the chief executive of the new Labour council, and I will sit on the board that ensures we have spades in the ground.
I thank the Minister very much.
