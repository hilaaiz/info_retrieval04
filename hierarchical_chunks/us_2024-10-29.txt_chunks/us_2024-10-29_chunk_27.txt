people and places they serve.
They are the foundation upon which our communities stand--the ones who lift others up, inspire hope, and, in doing so, call us all to higher standards of service and compassion.
Elizabeth has embodied this spirit in ways that words can scarcely capture.
Over the past two decades, Elizabeth has poured her heart and soul into handcrafting over 300 blankets for the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society Budget for Baby Program and Camp Lejeune.
Rita Fountain, the Relief Society Director, emphasized the profound impact of Elizabeth's contributions to the Navy and marine Corps families at Camp Lejeune preparing to welcome new babies, often many miles away from their loved ones.
Elizabeth's blankets provide these families warmth, comfort, and a sense of community while serving as a token of appreciation for their service and sacrifice.
This year, Elizabeth was recognized with the prestigious 10,000-hour pin and a custom-etched glass wedge by the Marine Corps League Patriot Detachment 1230 on behalf of the NavyMarine Corps Relief Society.
Elizabeth's compassion and generosity are a shining example of how one person can make a profound difference in the lives of others.
Through her blankets, she has woven a tapestry of hope, solace, and belonging for our military families far from home.
