Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Ohio National Guard Company B, 3rd Battalion, 238th Aviation Regiment from Green as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.
Hurricane Helene caused serious flooding and damage across Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee and Virginia, which left roads underwater, basements flooded, wires down, people trapped in their cars in flooded areas, and people stranded in their homes.
Ohio National Guard Company B, 3rd Battalion, 238th Aviation Regiment answered the call to assist.
These brave men and women navigated through flooded North Carolina streets to assist people stranded in their homes and cars.
Ohio's 13th Congressional District is made up of champions who work hard and don't hesitate to lend a helping hand to a neighbor in need.
The unwavering and selfless work of these service members in the wake as the ``Birthplace.''
I thank the members of the Ohio National Guard Company B, 3rd Battalion, 238th Aviation Regiment for their collaboration, bravery, and service in the aftermath of this hurricane, and for dedicating their lives each and every day to protect our community and country.
