Mr. Speaker, it is through the work of people like Elizbeth that our communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger.
Her actions remind us that progress is not forged in grand gestures, but in the cumulative power of selfless acts.
She embodies the timeless American values of resilience, generosity, and compassion, showing us that the future is built by those who care deeply, act decisively, and give without hesitation.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, I extend my deepest gratitude to Elizabeth Todderud for her extraordinary service.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose leadership and spirit of service will inspire generations to come.
May her example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to make our communities, country, and world a better place.
