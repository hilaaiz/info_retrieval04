Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 25th anniversary of the St. Helena High School Agricultural Program, an esteemed organization of our Napa community.
This milestone reflects decades of dedication, community support, and profound impact on students' futures.
This program is more than just an educational opportunity; it is a cornerstone of the community.
The Agriculture Program at St. Helena High School aims to shape young minds, nurture responsible leaders, and prepare students for successful careers in agriculture and beyond.
This program not only fosters practical skills and knowledge but also instills values such as stewardship, leadership, and community service in our students.
The St. Helena Agriculture Program has touched the lives of over 3,500+ students in the St. Helena community through positive experiences in relevant, rigorous, and relationship driven coursework and involvement in the National Future Farmers.
These opportunities have been made possible by the financial backing of the St. Helena Agriculture Booster Organization.
The Ag Boosters have supported state-of-the-art facilities improvements, curriculum development and equipment, student travel, student leadership conference participation, supervised agricultural experience participation, and making sure that all students can take advantage of what the Future Farmers of America and Agriculture Education have to offer.
