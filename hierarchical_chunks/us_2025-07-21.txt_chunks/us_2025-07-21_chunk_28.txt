woman Secretary of the U.S. Senate from 2021 to 2025.
I know I speak for all of us in expressing our gratitude to the Berry Family for decades of service to their country and to their Congress.
We will continue to keep Ann, Elizabeth, and their family in our prayers.
On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life of Reginald Berry.
