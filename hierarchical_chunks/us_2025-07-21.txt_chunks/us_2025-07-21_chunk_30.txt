Ms. DelBENE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Anusha Arora on being the Gold Medal recipient at the Washington State Science and Engineering Fair for her project titled ``Smart Strings: A Novel LowCost Multimodal System for Intelligent Sensory Feedback through Artificial Intelligence.''
The Washington State Science and Engineering Fair aims to advance the studies of STEM in grades 1-12 through the State.
They work to provide opportunities for students to display their projects and provide support and guidance for the operation of science and engineering fairs throughout Washington State.
Additionally, Anusha had the opportunity to represent Washington State at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair.
For more than 70 years, thousands of students from various science fair networks have explored their passion for scientific research at the world's largest pre-college science competition.
Students from more than 75 countries, regions and territories competed across 21 different STEM disciplines.
This year, Anusha competed among the top young scientists from around the globe and was selected as a Grand Award Winner in the category of ``Technology Enhances the Arts.''
Anusha Arora attends Interlake High School in Washington's 1st Congressional District.
