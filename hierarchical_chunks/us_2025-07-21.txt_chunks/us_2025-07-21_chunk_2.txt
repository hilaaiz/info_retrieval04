Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true champion from Northwest Ohio, Cassandra Wilson.
Cassandra is not only the first woman in Lucas County to bring home gold medals four years in a row for Special Olympics Powerlifting, she is also a fearless advocate who has served as the first Self Advocate from her county on the State Developmental Disabilities Council.
Since the age of five, Cassandra has been a voice for those too often left unheard.
Her advocacy, determination, and unbreakable spirit have shattered barriers and inspired communities.
Even when faced with coaches who doubted her, she stood strong.
She proved--and continues to prove--that strength isn't just about lifting weights; it's about lifting others up with you.
She reminds us all that true leadership begins with courage, and true change comes from those who never give up.
She is not just breaking records, she's breaking ground.
Cassandra is a living example that hard work and confidence, not gender or circumstance, defines our potential.
May her story continue to lift hearts, open minds, and pave the way for many more to follow.
