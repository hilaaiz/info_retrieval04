Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman whose life of faith, service, and leadership has left a lasting impact on her community and the Church.
Mother Regina Rose Edwards, who is celebrating 90 blessed years, is a native of River Rouge, Michigan.
She has dedicated her life in service to her Church and community and has raised a proud family.
Throughout our Nation's history, we have always been inspired by those whose faith and unwavering commitment uplifts others.
Mother Regina Rose Edwards goes beyond these criteria.
For decades, Mother Edwards has embodied compassion, wisdom, and dedication in her role as matriarch within the Church of God in Christ and as a beloved member of the Michigan Southwest First Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction.
Her ministry has brought comfort and community to countless families.
Through prayer, mentorship, and love, she has been a guiding light to many.
As she celebrates her 90th birthday, I wanted to take an opportunity to recognize her faith, service, and lifetime of commitment to her community.
