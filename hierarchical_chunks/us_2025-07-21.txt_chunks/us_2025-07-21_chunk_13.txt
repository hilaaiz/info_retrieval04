Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and mourn the passing of 
Mr. Donald R. Dwight of Holyoke, Massachusetts.
Mr. Dwight was a Marine, newspaper executive, and dedicated public servant.
Born in Massachusetts, he attended Deerfield Academy and Princeton before serving as an active-duty Marine, where he earned the rank of captain.
A man dedicated to his country, 
Mr. Dwight held multiple public offices, including serving as the 64th Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts.
As Lieutenant Governor, he worked behind the scenes to serve his state and always stood up for what he felt was right.
After leaving public office, 
Mr. Dwight led newspapers in Minneapolis and New England and was responsible for printing seven separate publications.
He was dedicated to local, independent journalism and never hesitated to follow a difficult story.
Outside of his public life, 
Mr. Dwight was a loving husband, father, and grandfather.
To those who knew him, he was endlessly curious, and never afraid to try new things.
He always knew how to ask the right questions and was driven by unflinching dedication to the common good.
The mark he left on his community, state, and country will never be forgotten, and for that, we are forever grateful.
