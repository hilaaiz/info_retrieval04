Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Edgar Ontiveros, a leader and public servant who has been named California's 4th Congressional District 2025 American Dream Award Recipient for Lake County.
This award recognizes the achievements of immigrants in our district who have made remarkable contributions to our communities in the areas of Arts and Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, or Community Service.
For many years, 
Mr. Ontiveros came to Hidden Valley to visit his uncle during the weekends.
In 2003, he had the chance to visit Clearlake for the first time, sparking his love for the Lake County community.
By 2004, he had the opportunity to purchase a house in Clearlake and has lived in the area ever since.
In 2009, 
Mr. Ontiveros joined the staff of Lake County Behavioral Health Services (LCBHS) as a Cultural Specialist and Ethnic Services Peer Support Specialist.
In 2014, LCBHS created the La Voz De la Esperanza community center, appointing 
Mr. Ontiveros as the center's supervisor.
The La Voz, or the Latino Wellness Center, located in Clearlake, works to connect the Latino Community to culturally relevant service and ensure that Spanish speakers are equipped with tools to navigate health and wellness services.
With volunteer translators and various educational opportunities, they help to break the language barrier that often prevents people from seeking help and offer referrals for mental health services when requested.
