Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mrs. Drusilla ``Dru'' Wade Newman of Frisco, Texas, and present her with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Dru has dedicated herself to faithfully serving our community.
Dru is a fourth-generation resident of Frisco and graduated from Frisco High School in 1974.
She earned her bachelor's degree in secondary education from Baylor University in 1978.
For over 45 years, Dru has been a fantastic community leader and passionate advocate for youth education.
She worked closely with the Frisco Education Foundation to help provide students with scholarships.
Furthermore, Dru mentored young adults at her church while being involved in local parent-teacher associations and booster clubs.
In addition to her work on education, Dru has continued to be involved in charitable efforts in Frisco to help families in need.
She participated in mission trips around the world to support humanitarian efforts and share her faith.
Dru also worked with the Frisco Heritage Association to organize and fundraise for their annual Heritage Days event, which highlights the beauty and rich history of the city.
She has a servant's heart, and her generosity and kindness has not gone unnoticed by those around her.
In her free time, Dru is an avid sports fan, and she enjoys cheering for the Baylor Bears.
Along with her husband Jim, she attends Frisco First Baptist Church.
I am proud of the work Dru has accomplished for our community, and I wish her continued success for many years to come.
