Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Pride Month and honor an LGBQTIA+ community leader in New York's Tenth District, Jan Lee.
Jan Lee is a dedicated community organizer, activist, small business owner, and lifelong New Yorker.
He is a third-generation resident of Manhattan's Chinatown and has been organizing his community since the 1990s, advocating for Chinatown's post-9/11 recovery, the reopening of Park Row, and representing the community's interests with regard to the borough-based jail.
For far too long, Manhattan's Chinatown has not received the recognition, services and representation that its residents have deserved.
Jan's work has begun to change that.
From his community activism to helping manage the apartment buildings that have been in his family for over 100 years, Jan's commitment to his community is inspiring.
I'm proud to call Jan a friend and partner as we continue to revitalize Chinatown and give the community the attention it deserves.
