Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Turner Industries' pipe fabrication facility in Paris, Texas.
Turner Industries specializes in innovative industrial contracting to fully meet client needs while prioritizing safety, efficiency, and reliability.
Turner Industries was first established in 1961 by Bert Turner, a young engineer with an entrepreneurial vision.
Over the years, it has expanded its presence along the Gulf Coast and offered additional services, including construction, transportation, maintenance, and steel fabrication.
In 1998, Turner opened its state-of-the-art pipe fabrication facility in Paris with over 375 acres of space.
Each pipe assembled here is precision-built to support power generation facilities, refineries, and petrochemical plants across the nation.
For its outstanding work, Turner Industries has been recognized as the number one industrial contractor in the Associated Builders and Contractors' Top 250 Contractors list.
It has also been honored by the Construction Users Roundtable and presented with the prestigious Construction Industry Safety Excellence Award three times for its commitment to employee safety.
In addition to serving as a critical energy backbone for our nation, Turner employs over 20,000 hardworking professionals across its facilities.
It has invested in a new Operations Building at its Paris facility, which will greatly contribute to the North Texas workforce and community.
I would like to especially recognize 
Mr. Chris Bailey, who serves as the Plant Manager and Vice President for Turner's Paris operations.
Mr. Bailey has dedicated himself to building and supporting educational programs in the North Texas community.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize this historic occasion and investment for the people of District 4.
Congratulations to Tuner Industries, and I wish them the best.
