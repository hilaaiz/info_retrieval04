Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Peter Burns of Frisco, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Peter has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community and country.
Peter was born in 1960 in Kingston, Jamaica.
At a young age, his family moved to the United States and settled in Brooklyn, New York.
In October 1978, Peter enlisted into the United States Army Signal Corps, where he served in various leadership roles.
His service took him around the world, including South Korea, Germany, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia.
In 1999, Peter retired from the Army and joined the telecommunications industry.
He obtained his Master of Business Administration from the University of Phoenix and completed the Entrepreneurial Development program at the University of Texas at Dallas.
In 2020, Peter founded The Bridge Delivery Service, which works closely with Amazon Logistics to ensure the timely delivery of packages for North Texas residents.
At the same time, Peter is actively involved in numerous charitable and educational initiatives to benefit our community.
He is a board member for the Frisco Education Foundation, Junior Achievement of Dallas, and Be In Health Foundation, where he leads efforts to improve youth entrepreneurship and provide scholarships for students in need.
Peter is also a devoted man of faith, and he is the Youth Director at Friendship Baptist Church.
For his outstanding work, Peter was recognized as Citizen of the Year in 2014 by the Frisco Chamber of Commerce and named 2017 Person of the Year by Frisco Style Magazine.
