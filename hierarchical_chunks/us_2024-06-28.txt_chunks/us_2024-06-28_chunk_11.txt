Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations and honor A Tribe for Jazz for receiving the Battelle Central Ohio STEM Grant for their innovative Jazz Lab Mobile Pilot Initiative in partnership with COSI, the PAST Foundation, and Columbus Department of Recreation and Parks.
Since its establishment in 2021, A Tribe for Jazz has not only been a beacon of cultural enrichment and social impact, but also a catalyst for change in our community.
Through a multifaceted mission that includes visual storytelling, live and virtual performances, education, and community engagement, the organization has consistently championed the preservation and evolution of Jazz, leaving an indelible mark on our cultural landscape.
The Jazz Lab is a mobile pop-up session uniting jazz music and science through immersive experiences that nurture curiosity, inclusivity, collaboration, and wonder.
The pilot program for middle and elementary school students explores systems thinking in jazz through technology, engineering, and math, highlighting the intersection of jazz and STEM.
With support from the Battelle Central Ohio STEM Grant, students in Central Ohio gain enriched access to jazz and STEM education.
The Jazz Lab Mobile Pilot Initiative is valuable for everyone in Central Ohio.
It illustrates the possibilities for STEAM in all fields and everyday life.
Congratulations to A Tribe for Jazz for bringing this extraordinary educational experience to our children.
