Mr. SCOTT.
Madam Chair, I rise today in support of the inclusion of a pilot program for a national simulation-based emergency preparedness network in the Fiscal Year 2025 Homeland Security Appropriations Act.
This pilot program will support the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Health Security's (OHS) mission to strengthen the Nation's health security through leadership and partnership, a safer and healthier Department of Homeland Security (DHS) workforce, and optimal care for patients.
I worked on this language with my fellow co-chairs of the Modeling and Simulation Caucus, Reps. Bergman, Sorensen, and Rutherford and am pleased to see it included.
The simulation-based emergency preparedness network will deliver simulation-based training that meets existing and emerging local and regional needs to licensed healthcare professionals, first responders, and volunteers.
This network supports all five phases of emergency management by ensuring our vital healthcare workforce is prepared prior to an emergency, able to respond effectively, save lives, prevent further damage, and contribute to healing during recovery.
The program will also serve the training needs of the greater U.S. healthcare system.
Unfortunately, the underlying appropriations bill fails to invest in other national needs.
It fails to fund effective strategies to keep our communities safe, much needed programs to
