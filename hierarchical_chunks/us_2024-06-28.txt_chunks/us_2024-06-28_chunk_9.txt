Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Pride Month and honor an LGBQTIA+ community leader in New York's Tenth District, Marquis Jenkins.
Marquis is a community activist with deep roots on the Lower East Side, a lifelong organizer dedicated to building solidarity around issues affecting underprivileged Americans.
He has worked at the NAACP to combat issues around criminal justice, he has directed organizing at WE ACT to advance issues of environmental justice, and he is currently director of organizing at Common Justice, a nonprofit dedicated to advancing solutions to violence and addressing issues in our criminal justice system.
Marquis has never forgotten the NYCHA public housing complexes where he grew up, and first entered activism at the age of 17 when he ran for resident association president at Bricetti Plaza.
Marquis's dedication to the Lower East Side is evident to everyone who knows him, and our district is lucky to get to call him ours.
I thank Marquis.
