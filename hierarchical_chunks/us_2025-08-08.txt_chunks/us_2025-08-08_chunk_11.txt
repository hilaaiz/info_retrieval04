Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and celebrate the Land of Make Believe, an amusement park that has been an important landmark of the Hope Township, New Jersey community, for over seven decades.
Since its founding in 1954 by Herman Maier, the park has remained family-owned and operated, with the Maier family upholding the same high standards of excellence and service that have defined it from the beginning.
Today, Christopher Maier, Herman's son and the park's current owner, attributes its enduring success to a commitment to affordability, safety, and family-centered fun.
As we mark the park's 71st anniversary, I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring this beloved institution and its legacy.
I look forward to seeing it continue to bring joy to generations of families for years to come.
