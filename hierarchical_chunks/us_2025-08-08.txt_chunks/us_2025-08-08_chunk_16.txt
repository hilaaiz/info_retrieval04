Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Flemington Jewish Community Center (FJCC), which is marking the celebration of its 100th anniversary as a cherished spiritual and cultural home in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.
Since its founding, the FJCC has exemplified the spirit of community, service, and faith: principles that have guided it to its position as a flourishing center of Jewish life and learning.
The history of the FJCC stretches back to the early decades of the twentieth century, when a wave of Jewish farmers, inspired by the promise of opportunity and liberty from oppression, found their way to Hunterdon County.
1922 marks the founding of the Hebrew Citizens Congregation of Hunterdon County, the brief precursor to today's Flemington Jewish Community Center.
The FJCC's earliest permanent home was a small house on Park Avenue in Flemington, which was remodeled to suit the religious and cultural needs of its growing membership.
During these formative years, the congregation's devotion to community and Jewish life was evident not only in weekly services and holiday observances, but also in robust cultural activities.
Furthermore, as the world plunged into the Second World War, the Center turned its attention outward, raising funds for defense bonds and organizing to support displaced Jewish populations worldwide.
The congregation's compassion, resourcefulness, and generosity established the Center as a moral beacon in Flemington and beyond.
In the post-war period, the FJCC renewed efforts to build a larger and more modern facility--a vision realized through a new synagogue on East Main Street, which was dedicated in 1948.
Under the steady guidance of religious leaders like Rabbi Maurice Idell, and later Rabbi Evan Jaffe, the FJCC's mission expanded even further.
Hebrew classes, a Ladies' Auxiliary, youth activities, and vibrant cultural programs created a profound strength of community.
As the congregation continued to thrive, it outgrew its Main Street home and, in 2006, celebrated the completion of a new 23,000-squarefoot facility in Raritan Township.
Under the guidance of Rabbi Eric Cohen, dedicated officers, staff, and volunteers, the congregation has embraced this modern space.
From its Nursery and Hebrew Schools to adult education and dedicated interfaith outreach and charitable engagements, the FJCC stands today at the head of Jewish life in Hunterdon County, and reaches members from Trenton to Princeton, and from Annandale to Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
As the earliest members hoped a century ago, the FJCC today is far more than a synagogue--it is a true community center.
It provides a welcoming atmosphere for families on Friday evenings, Torah discussion on Saturdays, and learning opportunities for youth and adults alike.
It brings together individuals of all backgrounds, reflecting the pluralism and mutual respect that are hallmarks of both American democracy and Jewish tradition.
May it continue to be a sanctuary where tradition thrives, learning flourishes, and community guides generations to come.
On this 100th anniversary, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Flemington Jewish Community Center.
