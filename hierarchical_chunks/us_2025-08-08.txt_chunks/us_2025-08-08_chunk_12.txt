Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lifelong service longest-serving commissioner in Clay County history, with a tenure of nineteen years.
Before his time on the Board of Commissioners, Mr. Penland served eight years on the Clay County Board.
In total, Commissioner Penland has spent 27 years at the helm of local public policy in Clay County, serving as a voice of reason and unyielding advocate for his community.
