Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Villareal Johnson, Sr. Villareal was a District of Columbia native, military veteran and dedicated civil servant.
He passed on July 7, 2025, in the District.
From a young age, Villareal had an interest in military service and saw himself fighting for what was right.
Villareal followed his interests and joined the military, where he served in Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm.
In 2013, Villareal retired from military service with the Sergeant First Class rank, after serving in the Army, Army Reserves, and D.C. National Guard, as Military Police.
After his retirement from military service, Villareal, like his father, began a career in the civil service, working as an investigator for the Child Support Division of Office of the D.C. Attorney General.
Villareal's dedication to service extended beyond his work.
In his spare time, he tirelessly served his community as Boy Scout troop leader for Minnesota Ave.
Troop No. 1202, where he shared his passions for the outdoors with his scouts and taught boys wilderness survivals skills.
In addition to his passion for the outdoors, Villareal was also passionate about do-it-yourself projects and the arts, as he was an artist, poet and writer.
Villareal's selflessness and dedication to both D.C. and our Nation should be recognized.
