steadfast commitment to accessibility, independence, and empowerment.
Founded in 1905 as the Maine Institution for the Blind, with the support of Helen Keller, the organization initially focused on teaching trades to help blind and visually impaired individuals enter the workforce.
Over time, its mission has evolved to offer comprehensive training programs that meet people where they are--equipping them with the skills and confidence to live independently.
These programs cover a wide range of daily life skills, from kitchen safety to technology use.
The Iris Network offers services at its Portland facility and travels throughout the state to support individuals in their homes.
Further, they offer holistic guidance to assist organizations businesses, and employers in making their environments welcoming and equitable.
Their dedication to accessibility can be found in every aspect of their work.
In addition to its training programs, The Iris Network operates a thriving residential community.
In 2006, they opened Iris Park Apartments, a Level I assisted living facility that now serves over thirty residents.
Iris Park offers a safe, supportive, and empowering environment where technology is thoughtfully integrated, appliances are adapted with sensory guides, and community-building activities--like braille bingo--foster connection and independence.
The Iris Network exemplifies the positive impact that comes from uplifting others.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to The Iris Network for 120 years of dedicated service and for improving the lives of countless Mainers.
Their leadership, compassion, and unwavering commitment to accessibility deserve our deepest admiration and commendation.
