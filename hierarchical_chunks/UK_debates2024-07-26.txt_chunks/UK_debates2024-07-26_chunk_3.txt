I thank and pay tribute to my predecessor, Chris Stephens, for his dedicated service to our community over the last nine years.
His commitment to social justice and workers’ rights is inspirational and will leave a lasting impact.
I am particularly thankful for his advice and counsel during the handover process that is currently taking place.
