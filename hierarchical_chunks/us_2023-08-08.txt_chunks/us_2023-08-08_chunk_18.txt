Mr. Speaker, although we mourn the profound loss our region has experienced in the passing.
Chief Post, we can take solace in his inspiring legacy of the lives he saved, and the countless colleagues he has positively impacted throughout his life--whether as a rescuer or mentor.
It is during this time that we pay special attention to Jeffrey's family, his wife Chrissy; two children, Olivia and John; brothers Scott and Daniel; parents Steven and Cynthia; and extended family.
To this end, I ask that my colleagues in this chamber join me in honoring the example left by Asst.
Chief Post.
