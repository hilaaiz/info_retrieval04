Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Homer Fire Department in Cortland County, New York.
The Homer Fire Department was established on April 10, 1873 as part of the Village.
Since then, the all-volunteer department has worked tirelessly to protect the citizens of Homer and has served as a backbone of their community.
