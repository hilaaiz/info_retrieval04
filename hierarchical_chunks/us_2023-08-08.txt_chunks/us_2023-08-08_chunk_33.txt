Mr. Speaker, South Carolina's Third District is known for its people and is home to countless heroes.
I'm honored to recognize Officer Matthew Hare, a hero who was taken from us far too soon.
Ashley and Easton will carry the fond memories of Officer Hare in their hearts forever, and Easley will remember this demonstration of selfless service.
Officer Hare's final actions truly exemplify John 15:13, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''
Thank Officer Hare for choosing to serve and giving us a great example of how we ought to love others.
The Easley community learned this lesson as is evident by the outpouring of support for him and his family since his passing.
Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the Hare family and the Easley Police Department as they lay to rest Officer Hare.
