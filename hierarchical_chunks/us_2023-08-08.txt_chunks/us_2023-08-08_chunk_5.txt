Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor KBBF and the Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation to recognize their 50 years of providing reliable, bilingual public radio for the North Bay.
The Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation was founded in 1971 with KBBF's first broadcast airing in 1973.
Spurred on by the Chicano movement, KBBF's founders pioneered a new model to engage our entire community in all public broadcastings benefits of education, culture, and news access.
KBBF is the first bilingual, bicultural radio station in the United States.
Today, the station reaches five million households and specializes in English, Spanish, and several indigenous languages.
Of their many listeners, one million are from primarily Spanish-speaking households.
Since 1973, KBBF has been primarily run by volunteers.
Their team remains a critical source of information for many Spanish-speaking members of our community.
In 2017, when numerous wildfires devastated Sonoma and Napa Counties, KBBF was instrumental in helping to translate lifesaving evacuation guidance for Spanish-speaking residents of our region who were seeking critical public safety news.
In recognition of their decades of work, KBBF was honored with the 2020 Silver Heart Award by the Northern California Chapter of the Society.
The station has been a vital resource of information and services for the Latino community.
KBBF is vital in increasing access to information at the local, state, and national level.
