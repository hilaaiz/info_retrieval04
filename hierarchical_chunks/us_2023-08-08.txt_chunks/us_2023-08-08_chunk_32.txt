Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Easley, South Carolina Police Officer, Matthew Hare, who was killed in the line of duty on August 2, 2023, while saving the life of an individual suffering from a mental health crisis.
Officer Hare was driven by a desire to serve his community which led to his pursuing a career in law enforcement upon graduation from Easley High School.
Officer Hare is survived by his mother, Ashley Hare, in addition to his brother, Easton Hare.
At only 22 years of age, Officer Hare had just begun his career in 2022 and showed great promise after completing the SC Criminal Justice Academy.
When not on duty, he loved to be with his family and friends at the dinner table, outside on their next adventure, or playing the latest video game.
Despite many hobbies, Officer Hare always found time to cheer on his favorite football team, the Clemson Tigers.
On August 2, Officer Hare displayed the greatest form of love and act call for an individual who was suffering from a mental health crisis and was precariously on the train tracks in Easley.
Knowing a train was coming and committed to saving this person he didn't know, Officer Hare sacrificed himself to save a member of the community he swore to serve and protect.
