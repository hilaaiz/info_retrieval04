Mr. Sigmund has committed his career to improving water quality throughout Wisconsin, as well as promoting a national water policy to create a more equitable water future.
On July 13, 2023, 
Mr. Sigmund completed his service as president of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies.
I stand today to recognize 
Mr. Sigmund's impressive leadership at NACWA as well as his service to the clean water industry.
Since 2007, 
Mr. Sigmund has led NEW Water, the brand of the Green Bay Metropolitan Sewerage District, as its executive director, facilitating the delivery of the utility's wholesale conveyance and treatment services to 238,000 people throughout 15 municipalities in Northeast Wisconsin.
Under 
Mr. Sigmund's leadership, NEW Water has achieved 100 percent permit compliance and ushered in a new era for the utility in recognizing that material sent to the facilities is a valuable resource to be recovered and reused.
He orchestrated the Resource Recovery and Electrical Energy, or R2E2, project, which recovers valuable resources from the wastewater stream to produce electricity and recovers heat for processes that run the facility.
