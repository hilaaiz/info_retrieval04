Mr. Sigmund launched an adaptive management approach to achieve water quality improvements more cost effectively by working collaboratively across rural landscapes in the Green Bay watershed.
These efforts target a reduction of sediment and excess nutrient run-off into impaired waterways, an improved ecosystem, and a pathway for continued success.
Under his leadership, NEW Water entered a partnership with NASA to advance scientific knowledge of harmful algal blooms and their impact on public health.
This initiative is housed under NEW Water's Aquatic Monitoring Program, which was established in 1986 and is one of the longest running water quality monitoring programs on the Great Lakes.
