Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine, a scientific expedition on behalf of the United States Navy that sent our Nation's first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, to the North Pole.
Nicknaming themselves ``PANOPOs'', an acronym from the phrase ``Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole'', one-hundred and sixteen crew members made the historic voyage under the polar ice, showing true American dominance in science, innovation, and naval capability.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I am proud to recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine and thank both Nautilus Alumni Association and the Submarine Force Library and Museum Association for their dedication to keeping American history alive.
