Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the town of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire for hosting the first ever Lake Winnipesaukee Day celebration.
Lake Winnipesaukee is 1 of the treasures of our state, a recreation and tourism hub, and an economic driver for the entire region.
Above all, it is a precious natural resource and habitat that we must continue to protect and preserve for generations to come.
With proceeds benefiting advocacy groups fighting to preserve the quality of the lake, Lake Winnipesaukee Day is a shining example of Wolfeboro's commitment to keeping Lake Winnipesaukee clean and healthy for years to come.
The Lake Winnipesaukee Day celebration brings together 8 different non-profit climate advocacy organizations to educate visitors and highlight the importance of climate action and preservation in the Lake Winnipesaukee region.
The celebration's live laser shows, food, drinks, games, and music have worked to create an engaging local space that will serve as both an opportunity and prominent platform for climate groups to advocate and educate.
New Hampshire's way of life is rooted in our natural surroundings, and it is the responsibility of each and every 1 of us to ensure that future generations can enjoy the benefits and beauty of our natural environment.
I sincerely commend Wolfeboro's work to raise awareness and forge an impassioned, strong community of well-informed citizens, and I look forward to many more Lake Winnipesaukee Day celebrations in the future.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to congratulate the Town of Wolfeboro for its dedication to the protection of Lake Winnipesaukee, and the work it has done to educate and advocate for climate change action.
I am proud to represent residents of Wolfeboro in Congress, and I can't wait to see the success of this celebration in the years to come.
