part of the faculty, leading, guiding and mentoring aspiring faith leaders.
Dr. Jackson served as a spiritual advisor and mentor for the congregation and for the community.
In 2018, Dr. Jackson founded the Rehoboth Followship Church.
He was diligent in fostering this ministry and created a welcoming place of worship for all.
He loved his Rehoboth family and was always thinking I was honored to join Dr. Jackson in his tireless work to bring together faith leaders, register and empower voters, combat the scourge of gun violence in our communities, remedy the historic wrongs of our criminal justice system, and inspire the next generation to seize opportunities to get an education and improve the world they will soon enter.
Whenever they needed something good for the community done, they didn't have to seek out Dr. Jackson.
He was already there, and he welcomed them with open arms.
Dr. Jackson was a tremendous advocate for his community, at the local and state level, and I was proud to call him my friend.
This world has lost a great leader.
I dedicate today to mourning and remembrance as well as furthering Dr. Jackson's legacy of service and sacrifice and uplifting those who follow in his path.
May we all be even half as successful as Dr. Jackson was at leaving the world a better place than we found it.
