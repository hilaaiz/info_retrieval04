Mr. HIMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a tremendously impactful leader and my good friend, Stamford's own Reverend Tommie Jackson.

The Jacksons would later return to Baltimore, Maryland where he completed law school at the University of Maryland Law School.
Dr. Jackson was enormously proud of his daughters, Erin Marie and Evinn Leigh.
He answered his first call to Pastorship in 1990, at Calvary Baptist Church in Chester, Pennsylvania.
While there, Dr. Jackson, Dorye and his daughters touched the lives of the community.
Dr. Jackson's dedication to God's work then brought him and his family to Stamford, Connecticut in 1997, where he answered his second calling to Pastorship at Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church.
