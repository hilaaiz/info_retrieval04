Mr. Speaker, Paul's passion for biodynamic and organic farming was rooted in his deep respect for natural cycles, his reverence for the land, and his belief that agricultural business has responsibility beyond generating profit to preserving and restoring land.
We respectfully ask that you join us in extending deep condolences to Paul's family and many friends, and in expressing our strong appreciation for Paul's decades of leadership in responsible winemaking and sustainability.
