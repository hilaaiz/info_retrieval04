Mr. MURPHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Jasper L. Lewis of Greenville for his remarkable contributions to dentistry and his community, state, and Nation.
Dr. Lewis graduated from Wake Forest University and received his doctorate in dental surgery from the University.
From the beginning of his professional career, Dr. Lewis was committed to using his talents and expertise for the betterment of others.
After receiving his degrees, Dr. Lewis decided to join the Air Force as a dental officer.
Dr. Lewis returned home to Greenville and founded his own practice, Eastern Orthodontics & Pediatrics.
He has earned the reputation of an esteemed leader in his field, serving as President of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and Vice President of the North Carolina Dental Society.
He is also credited as a significant contributor to the founding of the Eastern Carolina University School of Dental Medicine and has a professorship named in his honor.
Dr. Lewis has a big heart for the children of Eastern North Carolina affected by oral healthcare disparities.
He helped bring the American Dental Association's ``Give Kids a Smile'', a nationwide program providing free dental services to uninsured children, to Eastern North Carolina.
As all can see, Dr. Lewis's charity and influence touched many lives.
Dr. Lewis was recently recognized by the Greenville-Pitt County Chamber of Commerce and became one of only ten recipients to receive the Legends Award.
