Ms. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Magnolia Park's own Gilda Ramirez.
Gilda was born on February 12, 1963, in the shadow of Port Houston, a place that would come to define her life, and where some of her fondest memories were born, like hunting for Easter eggs in Mason Park.
She knew at a young age that the door of opportunity to the halls of power had been cracked open for her generation, but it was up to her to open that door all the way and hold it open for the community.
Gilda, ever-curious, took what she learned at Stephen F. Austin High School and Houston International University and embarked on a historymaking career as an executive at Houston's Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Port of Houston, a place she loved dearly.
She was amazed at all the different things that came through the Port and all the jobs and families it helped.
She said she could never live far away from Magnolia Park.
She kept coming back.
She found joy in connecting people, fostering friendships, and serving the community that had given her so much.
Through it all, Gilda never forgot those who would follow.
She stayed committed to mentoring future professionals and supporting and empowering small, minority and women-owned businesses, and keeping that door open.
