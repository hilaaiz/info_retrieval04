Mr. Speaker, Gilda swung the door wide open, and she held it there through her final days.
Because of her work, Latina women have a seat at the table, our future leaders have a seat at the table, our community has a seat at the table.
Gilda won countless honors, from ``Hispanic Executive of the Year'' by the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to ``The One Woman Soaring Heights Award'' by the Texas Business Alliance, but it is especially sweet to honor the life of my friend in the Congress of the United States.
Our prayers are with her husband, Richard Arevalo, her sister, Rebecca Pena, and her lovely and sharp girls, Coco and Lola.
May God bless Gilda.
I thank her for everything she did for us while she was with us here.
May she please keep watch over us as we continue the fight for greater inclusion and shared properity for all.
