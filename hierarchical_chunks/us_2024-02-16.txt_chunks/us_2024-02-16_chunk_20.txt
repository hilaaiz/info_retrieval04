Mr. Speaker, once again, it is with pride that I recognize the remarkable history and contributions of The Stone Pony and congratulate it on its 50th anniversary.
The Stone Pony continues to bring local talent and renowned musical acts to residents and visitors, drawing crowds from across New Jersey and beyond.
Its impact on the community and the music scene is undeniable, and its legacy has echoed throughout New Jersey and the country for five decades.
