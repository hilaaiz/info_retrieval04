Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to congratulate The Stone Pony on its 50th anniversary as its staff, patrons, and the community gather to celebrate ``Stone Pony Day'' as proclaimed by the City.
The Stone Pony is a landmark music venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey and this milestone and its historical significance are truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Opened on February 8, 1974 by John P. ``Jack'' Roig and Robert ``Butch'' Pielka, The Stone Pony has become synonymous with Asbury Park.
Its storied past has seen triumphs and tribulations, but throughout its 50 years, The Stone Pony's connection to rock and roll history has cemented its status and success as preeminent music venue.
Its stage has been graced by a venerable list of talent, including New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen, Ronnie Spector, the Ramones, Joan Jett, Peter Frampton, Green Day, Kenny Chesney, and The Black Crowes.
Many artists launched their careers at the Pony, including New Jersey rock band The Smithereens, who credit The Stone Pony for their start.
One of the venue's first house bands, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, helped buoy the venue's following and still play there today.
The venue is a mainstay of Asbury Park, and its history is woven into that of the city.
The Stone Pony's commitment to promoting local and national musical acts has contributed to the thriving cultural landscape of the city.
In addition, it has supported local charities and philanthropic efforts throughout its history, hosting benefit concerts for hunger initiatives, local youth programs, Parkinson's disease research, and music education, among others.
