Mr. KEATING.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dudley Davenport and on the dedication of the gymnasium at Sharon High School in his honor.
Born on December 14, 1937, Dudley Davenport was raised in Westport, Massachusetts, where he found a passion for sports, specifically basketball, at a young age.
During Dudley's time at Westport High School, he was a four-year starter on the basketball team and set an all-time scoring record with 1,529 points throughout his high school career.
This record held for 50 years and earned Dudley a place in the Westport High School Athletic Hall.
It was also in Westport where Dudley first met the love of his life, Shirley.
