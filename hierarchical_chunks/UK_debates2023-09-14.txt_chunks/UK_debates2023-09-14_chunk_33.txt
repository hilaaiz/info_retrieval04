I thank my hon.
Friend the Father of the House for those very sensible and proportionate comments.
He is right that, as political parties, we all have a responsibility to ensure that our constituents and those voters take part in our democratic process.
That is what this process is about.
I am afraid that the kind of scaremongering comments that we have just heard from the Liberal Democrats, and that no doubt we will hear from all the other Opposition parties, are damaging the important cause that we all stand behind: ensuring the safety of our precious democracy, which now more than at any other time could potentially be at risk.
I am proud to be part of a Government who are taking sensible steps to protect our democracy from the kind of interference that we all fear could happen in this day and age.
