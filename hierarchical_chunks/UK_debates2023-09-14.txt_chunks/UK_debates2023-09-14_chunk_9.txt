Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Business investment is lower in the UK than in any other G7 country and we rank 27th out of 30 OECD countries, ahead of only Poland, Luxembourg and Greece.
More than half a trillion pounds-worth of  under-investment by Government and business has left our economy trapped in a growth doom loop.
What is the Secretary of State doing to undo this damage?
What the hon.
Lady did not say is that business investment is increasing at a faster rate than in other countries.
She is right that investment has been lower here, but that is why the Chancellor brought in policies such as full expensing to tackle this issue.
She also did not mention the fact that we are the top destination for investment across financial services and many other areas.
The UK is actually doing very well when it comes to inward investment, and we will continue to create policies that ensure we stay at the top of the pack.
What recent progress she has made on regulatory reform.
My Department is making it easier to do business every single day.
Our smarter regulation programme—which includes implementation of the reforms recommended in the report by the taskforce on innovation, growth and regulatory reform, co-authored by my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers) —is reducing regulatory burdens for business and reducing costs for consumers.
We have announced reforms to employment law, wine regulation and product safety regulations, and further reforms will be announced soon.
