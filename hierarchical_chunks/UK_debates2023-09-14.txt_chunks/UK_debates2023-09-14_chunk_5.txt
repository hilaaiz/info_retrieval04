In Wales, it is reported that this Government will spend half a billion pounds to make thousands of Port Talbot steelworkers redundant.
Head north to Derby to a train assembly plant, where thousands more jobs are under threat because this Government bungled High Speed 2.
Head around the UK coastline and the Government have managed to misjudge industry so much that they secured zero offshore wind contracts.
That is a UK tour of almighty Conservative incompetence.
Labour will harness this country’s talent.
Will the Minister explain how many jobs the Government are losing us at Tata Steel, how many jobs they are losing us in Derby, how many jobs they are losing us in offshore wind, and why they are so intent on levelling down our great British industries?
