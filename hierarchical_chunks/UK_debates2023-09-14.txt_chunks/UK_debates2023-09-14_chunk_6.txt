I welcome the hon.
Member to her post, but I suggest that leading on stories in the paper is not a good way forward.
That is all speculation; we do not comment on commercial decisions.
The reality is that there is £730 million in support with energy costs and more than £1 billion of support with decarbonisation.
She talks about plans.
Well, I am not sure if the Labour party’s plan stands for anything because it flip-flops so often.
It is not just me who says that; let us reflect on a statement made by a union leader.
They said that Labour was not only just an ’80s tribute act, but that it tends to sit on a “wobbly fence”.
Who knows what Labour will say tomorrow after a statement made today?
