I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The UK will continue to show global leadership in encouraging all states to uphold international human  rights obligations and to hold those who violate or abuse human rights to account.
The UK has successfully included labour, environment and gender provisions in the free trade agreements that we have signed—with Australia and New Zealand, for example.
Those both contained dedicated chapters on trade, gender equality, labour and the environment.
They uphold human rights but, crucially, also level the playing field for our UK businesses.
