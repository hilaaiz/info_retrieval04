I thank the Minister for his deep and sincere interest and for his commitment, which is what all of us in this House wish to see.
Our Government and our Ministers have never been found wanting when it comes to helping, and we appreciate that.
He has outlined the devastation and loss of life from Storm Daniel.
Like others, my thoughts and prayers are with those families who have lost loved ones.
Charities such as Christian Aid, alongside church groups in my constituency of Strangford and across Northern Ireland, are already setting up a page.
It is clear that there is a desire to help.
How can the Minister and the Government work alongside the charities and the churches to get aid to the right place as soon as humanly possible?
