I wish to inform the House that I have received a letter from  the right hon.
Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)  informing me of his resignation as Chair of the Defence Committee.
I therefore declare the Chair vacant.
I will announce the arrangements for the election of a new Chair in due course.
