What recent assessment she has made of the impact of her trade policies on the cost of food.
Food prices are driven by many pressures, including the global economic climate.
We recognise the important role that trade can play in improving food security through diversification of supply chains.
Our programme of free trade agreements is securing access to global supply chains, removing barriers and lowering costs for traders.
Furthermore, in 2022, 84% of agricultural and food imports entered the UK tariff-free.
By delivering trade deals and working with international partners, we are ensuring that British consumers have access to good-quality and good-value food.
Will the Minister explain how the Government’s plans for a £43 inspection fee on each consignment of food imported from the European Union represent barrier-free trade?
Can she tell small food retailers, restaurants and their customers in Glasgow North when or whether they will have to pay this Brexit tax and the higher prices it will lead to?
Can she also remind the House whether higher food prices as a result of Brexit were part of the Leave campaign prospectus?
I know the hon.
Member wants to put all these anxieties on Brexit and forget about all the opportunities we are securing with trade agreements around the world.
The issue he raises fundamentally sits at the doorstep of the Cabinet Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and we are working very closely with them to resolve it.
