I thank the hon.
Member for his support.
The action that is being taken in the short term is the top priority right now.
He makes important points about how we are working to affect those who are climate-vulnerable.
We will continue to do that, but I reassure him that in this moment in time we have found support, we will continue to monitor the situation and we will provide whatever other support we need to provide.
Our funding through the UN is pivotal at this time.
