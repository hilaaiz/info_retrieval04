The loss of Wilko is a significant blow to the nation’s high streets.
However, more concerning is that no rescue has proved possible because several bidders have said that town centre retail is no longer a viable business model.
In the light of that, do the Government really believe that their current policy environment is sufficient for British high streets to thrive?
We are very concerned for the families affected by Wilko’s demise.
The world of retail is a very competitive marketplace.
I do not accept the hon.
Gentleman’s premise that the high street is dead—not at all.
It is reshaping itself, and while it does so we will help it, such as with the £13.6 billion of rates relief over the next five years.
Ministers’ answers do not match the scale of the problem; 12,500 Wilko workers alone are at risk of redundancy.
Labour’s plans for the high street are about reforming business rates, tackling late payment, cracking down on antisocial behaviour and stopping premises being left empty, with councils having more powers.
The problem demands a response from Ministers.
Based on their answers today, this Government have simply given up on the British high street.
That is complete nonsense.
This week, I met Helen Dickenson from the Retail Sector Council to discuss this matter closely.
There are certain situations in certain companies of course.
I guard the hon.
Gentleman against political opportunism on the back of those 12,500 jobs, many of which have been picked up by other retailers such as Poundland in rescues of stores.
On his point about business rates, which I hear time and again, all the Labour party has  done is say that it will cancel £22 billion of business rates, without saying how it will replace those taxation receipts.
Where is the money coming from?
