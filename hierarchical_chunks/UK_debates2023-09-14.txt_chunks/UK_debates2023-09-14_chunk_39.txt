Of course, we must always look at the sensible and practical recommendations from the Electoral Commission.
We will continue to do that.
Before this roll-out, we put a significant amount of investment into working with civil society and charities.
We have made funding available for communications campaigns.
It is just a shame that the Labour party and Liberal Democrats did not take the opportunity to amplify our messages among their own constituents.
We all have a shared responsibility in this place to amplify messages and communicate effectively, particularly to ethnic minority and disabled voters.
I know that is what I did ahead of local elections; I wonder what they did.
