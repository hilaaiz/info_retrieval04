I thank my hon.
Friend for his suggestions.
It is right that we look at all the practical barriers that have been encountered at polling stations.
That is why we are working closely with the sector to listen to its feedback and to representations from civil society, disability charities and others.
We know that where voter identification was trialled in pilots, the proportion of people who agreed that electoral fraud was not a problem increased from 13% to 32%.
We know that most people were able to vote successfully in both the pilot and the last local elections, but it is right to look at all the details, and we will be doing so, in line with the Electoral Commission’s recommendations.
