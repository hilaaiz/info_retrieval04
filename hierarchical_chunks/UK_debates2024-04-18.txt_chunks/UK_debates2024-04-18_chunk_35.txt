I thank my hon.
Friend for asking another question with regard to our Ben Houchen, because his achievements simply could not possibly be crammed into one answer.
He is also enabling Net Zero Teesside, the world’s first industrial scale carbon capture, usage and storage facility.
He is delivering over £200 million of investment in Darlington, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool’s rail stations to improve rail capacity, and he is using reallocated High Speed 2 money to transform local transport, including the long-overdue Darlington northern link road.
Again, I urge anyone who has the opportunity to vote on  2 May  to enable him to continue that good work to do so.
