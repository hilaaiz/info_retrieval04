I thank my right hon.
Friend for allocating a slot on Monday for the hospice debate.
Does she agree that the Prime Minister’s decision to establish the Darlington economic campus, following relentless campaigning by me, my fantastic Tees Valley colleagues and our marvellous Mayor Ben Houchen, was a game changer for Darlington?
Does she further agree that saving our airport, launching Teesworks and restoring Tees pride are further examples of why Ben Houchen should continue to serve Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool?
Can she find time for a debate on the modernising revolution that Ben has unleashed, which is benefiting every part of our great region?
