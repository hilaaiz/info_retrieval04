I thank again the right hon.
Lady for her diligent work on this incredibly important issue.
She met the Minister concerned—the Paymaster General—yesterday, and he will have given her an update on his work.
We recognise that many victims have waited too long for compensation.
This Government established the inquiry, and the Minister established the compensation review that was done.
The Government amendment that the right hon.
Lady referred to includes a provision for interim payments to be made to the estates of people who were infected by contaminated blood products, have passed away, and were registered with the infected blood scheme or its predecessor schemes, where an interim payment has not already been made.
I have regular meetings with the Minister who is overseeing this matter.
She will know that he is working at pace.
I am glad that we have gripped this issue, but we need to get those interim payments and full compensation to people swiftly, and I am confident that that will happen.
