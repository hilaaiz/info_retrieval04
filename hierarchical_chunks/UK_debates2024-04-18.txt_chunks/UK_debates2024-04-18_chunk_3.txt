More than 1 million girls who considered themselves sporty while at primary school drop out of sport as teenagers.
I was one of those girls, and I did not do any sport from puberty until my late 40s, when I discovered running.
This weekend, I will be running my second London marathon in aid of Bristol Refugee Rights—feel free to donate.
On this Government’s watch, inequality between girls and boys on physical activity has got worse, with 22% fewer girls than boys taking part in team sports.
I do not want any tepid words about things the Secretary of State says she is committed to.
We have 860,000 girls missing out on the joy of physical activity—why?
I hope the shadow Secretary of State does very well on Sunday, and I wish her the best of luck.
I am absolutely committed—these are not just warm words—to ensuring that more girls and women get involved in sport.
I say that they are not just warm words because we have a plethora of policies already in play on this issue, whether that is: investing in football and working with Karen Carney on her women’s football review; building pitches to ensure that girls and women have priority access to sport; the £400 million for multi-sport facilities, which goes across the country; or the taskforce that I talked about, which will get 1 million children more active.
We are particularly prioritising people who are inactive at the moment, which unfortunately does include girls.
