I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
This is an important matter that other hon.
Members have raised in the Chamber, particularly when the first incident happened.
The policy is clear, and I am pleased that, in both situations, the arrest was reversed, but it goes to show the importance of our having in place not just the right policies, but the operational policing plan, as well as training being undertaken to ensure that officers, who often face difficult and confusing situations, know exactly what they should be doing and when.
I shall ensure that both the Home Secretary and the head of the Metropolitan police have heard his remarks.
