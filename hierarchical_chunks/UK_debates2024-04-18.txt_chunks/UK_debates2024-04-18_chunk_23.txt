I thank my hon.
Friend for that question, and I will certainly ensure that his request about the Cass review is undertaken.
He knows that a process is being gone through at the moment for the memorial, and I will again ensure that the relevant Secretary of State has heard what he said today.
There are also questions to that Secretary of State on Monday, and he may wish to make use of that opportunity.
