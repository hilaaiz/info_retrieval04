One of my constituents recently got in touch after fleeing domestic abuse in his relationship.
Owing to societal stigma, male survivors are often overlooked, leaving them without adequate safeguarding services or police support.
Given that one third of domestic abuse victims are male, will the Leader of the House find time for a debate, in Government time, about improving support for all victims of domestic abuse?
The hon.
Lady raises a very important point.
Many of the measures that we have introduced to deal with domestic abuse or with people trying to control others in one way or another, including financially, apply to everyone who is in the unfortunate position of being a victim.
Advertising these services to everyone who might be affected is also important, so I shall ensure that the relevant Home Office Minister has heard what she has said.
