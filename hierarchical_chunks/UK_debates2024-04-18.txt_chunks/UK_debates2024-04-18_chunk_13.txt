I thank my hon.
Friend for raising his concerns about the creative community in Leighton Buzzard—it sounds like a buzzing creative community.
As I say, we support creative industries primarily through Arts Council England, which has initiatives that look at workspaces.
I encourage organisations in his constituency and community to make applications for grants, because there are specific funds available.
