I welcome the Government’s work to expand the role of community pharmacies as part of our healthcare system.
I particularly welcome the Pharmacy First scheme, which was successfully  piloted in Cornwall.
However, while we are placing more demand on pharmacies, the number of community pharmacies in Cornwall is falling, with both Boots and Asda announcing closures.
I know that my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Cornwall (Scott Mann)  has written to Asda opposing the closure of its pharmacy in Bodmin.
Pharmacy owners tell me that the current funding arrangements are not adequate to meet the growing demand.
May we have a statement from the Department of Health and Social Care on the Government’s plans to maintain, and hopefully increase, the number of community pharmacies, particularly in rural areas, and ensure that they receive the funding that they need?
