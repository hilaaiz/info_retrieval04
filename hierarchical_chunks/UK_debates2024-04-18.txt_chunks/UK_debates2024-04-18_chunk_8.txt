I thank the hon.
Member for raising that issue.
She talked about one of the substantial funds that we have to help repair and restore museums, heritage sites and other activities.
I am glad that that is making a big difference in her constituency.
We have been looking into the important area of how historic buildings can reduce their energy consumption.
It is obviously difficult, since 2% of buildings in the UK are listed.
We want to help them to reduce their energy consumption, which is a particular challenge for owners of historic homes.
Historic England has guidance to help museums, and we will look at what more we can do.
