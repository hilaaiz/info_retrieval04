It is over a year since Sir Brian Langstaff made his final recommendations on compensation.
The Government have accepted the moral case for compensation to be paid.
More than 100 people have died in the last 12 months, and still no money has been allocated for compensation.
It was a step forward yesterday that amendments were tabled to the Victims and Prisoners Bill in the other place, but the amendment that this House agreed, which included a three-month timeframe for a compensation body to be set up, has been removed by Government amendments in the other place.
Could we have a statement from the Minister on why it is taking so long to set up this compensation body, and to get compensation paid?
If the Government wanted to, they could expedite matters, as they have done with the Post Office scandal,  and could bring a stand-alone Bill to this House.
I am sure that the House would get that Bill through to get compensation to these people before they die.
