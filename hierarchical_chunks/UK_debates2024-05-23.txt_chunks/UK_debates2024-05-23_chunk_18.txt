Can I thank our shadow Culture Secretary?
I am proud of the work that he has done and that I have been able to do alongside him on behalf of the SNP and the people of Scotland.
Mr Speaker, can I also echo your comments about Liam Laurence Smyth?
The number of times I have gone to Liam and said, “I want to get up to some mischief, can you help me?”
I have really appreciated all the advice that he has given me.
I would like to ask the Secretary of State whether the Media Bill will be part of wash-up, because a number of organisations, including STV, have contacted me this morning asking for it to be.
That is certainly what I am pressing for and I am very grateful to the hon.
Member for her support to ensure that that happens.
With the Olympics happening in Paris in the forthcoming months, what work is the Minister doing to ensure that the residents of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and those across the whole country, get to support GB as passionately as if the games were being held on our shores?
We are all looking forward to the Olympics and good luck to Team GB.
UK Sport invested £382 million of Exchequer and lottery funding for the Paris Olympics.
We also want to ensure, with the change maker programme initiative, that, when our athletes come back from the Paris games, they give back to communities such as those of my hon.
Friend.
