The hon.
Gentleman raises an important point.
I know that colleagues in Sport England and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been looking at this issue, particularly as it has affected not just horseracing but other pitches, such as  for rugby, football and so on.
I have some further details on the conclusions of that, which I would be happy to write to the hon.
Gentleman about.
What assessment she has made of the impact of the youth investment fund on opportunities for young people.
As this Parliament comes to an end, I too would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Speaker, for everything you have done and for the support you have given me as a Minister over the past six years.
I would like to thank DCMS and my officials for all the work they have done, the special advisers, who have been superb, and my hard-working and effective ministerial team—we work as a team—and I am thankful for my engagement with the shadow Secretary of State.
It is really important that we support our young people.
That is why we have a programme to build or refurbish up to 300 youth facilities, supporting 45,000 young people each year.
To date, £250 million has been awarded to 227 organisations to build, renovate and expand youth provision.
Like others, I would like to thank everyone who has helped me over my first Parliament—I hope to come back for another one with a different constituency name.
On the substantive question, on  Saturday 11 May  I went to the Middleton St George scout hall to join the local lord lieutenant and deputy mayor as we opened their new scout hall, with more than £350,000 from the Conservative Government’s youth investment fund.
Could the Secretary of State just remind us how important these community groups are—the scouts, the brass bands, and all of the different things that we see around our communities—and maybe just remind us of the breadth and scope of support that this Conservative Government have given to such organisations?
