I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a huge campaigner for his area.
We have given 300,000 opportunities to young people through our national youth guarantee.
That is not just about the youth clubs that I have mentioned; we have also given 12,000 disadvantaged young people an opportunity to have adventures away from home; we have made 30,000 places for the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme; and we have created 250 new uniformed youth groups.
