I associate myself with those comments, Mr Deputy Speaker, and echo the Minister’s comments about the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Bill.
I am pleased to be here tonight to see the final passage of the Media Bill.
It has been 20 years since the last broadcasting laws were introduced, and in that time the media landscape has changed dramatically.
This Bill ensures that our broadcasting sector can continue to thrive with regulation fit for the modern era.
The measures in the Bill have been through several layers of scrutiny, from the White Paper to the pre-legislative inquiry conducted by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee.
I thank the Committee for its work, and I will take this opportunity to say some other thank yous.
