My hon.
Friend is a huge campaigner.
She was awarded £5 million at the spring Budget to support the development of cultural projects in her area.
She will know that it is a matter for each council to identify the most suitable project to be funded in their area.
I am sure she will work very closely with them to ensure that funding will be distributed appropriately.
