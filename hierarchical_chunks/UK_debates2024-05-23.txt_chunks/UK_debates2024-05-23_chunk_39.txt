I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the way he approaches this matter.
It also gives a chance for all of us to thank our casework teams who do so much, and indeed all the staff across DWP.
They know that our customers vary.
They know that, at times in their lives, they need additional support.
That is why we have those specialist services, roles and procedures in place, from the DWP visiting service to the advanced customer support senior leaders.
We have the serious case panel review, and we have the customer experience survey.
We are always listening and learning, and there is a continuous need to do that.
On fluctuating conditions, which other Members have mentioned, we have put a better understanding of needs and diagnoses at the heart of our engagement on reforms, and that is what disabled people have told me as well.
