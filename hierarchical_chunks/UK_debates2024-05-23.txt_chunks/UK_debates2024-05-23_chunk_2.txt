I thank the range of stakeholders, including those throughout our broadcasting sectors, who engaged so extensively with the content of the Bill.
I thank the noble Lords, including of course our Labour Lords team, the civil servants and officials, and the ministerial team.
I also thank my office, particularly Anna Clingan.
While Labour would have added some further measures to future-proof and strengthen the Bill, I am pleased to welcome its passage this evening.
Further to that, I am happy to support the amendments from the other place, which I believe will strengthen the position and purpose of our public service broadcasters.
