I thank the hon.
Lady for her very pertinent and important question.
She will know that the Archbishop of Canterbury himself went out to the Holy Land just after  7 October .
I can tell her that the Bishop of Chelmsford was there very recently and the Bishop of Suffolk is also a frequent visitor.
The worldwide Anglican communion, as well as the Church of England, will absolutely continue to play its part in bringing peace and justice to this terrible conflict, which has gone on for far too long.
