Last week, I highlighted to the Minister a report from the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that concluded that the UK had failed to take all appropriate measures to address grave and systematic violations of the rights of people with disabilities.
She said that the UK Government were “committed to ensuring that the UK is one of the best places to live and work as a disabled person.”—[Official
Report,  15 May 2024 ; Vol. 750, c. 244.]
Does she really stand by that assertion, given the serious concerns raised by the Equality and Human Rights Commission?
Does she understand why its chair said that they are extremely worried?
The EHRC also said that it believes that the DWP may have broken equality law.
What does she have to say to the disabled people watching?
She must understand that it is a clear demonstration that this Tory Government are content simply to disregard disabled people, their rights and their needs.
If she disagrees, let her tell us specifically why.
