Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to shine a light on the incredible accomplishments of a member of the Michigan State University jazz community: Associate Professor of Jazz Piano, Xavier Davis.
It was 1994 and Xavier Davis, then a college student from Grand Rapids, Michigan, was performing with a small ensemble at a convention in Boston when his tunes caught the ear of the legendary jazz vocalist Betty Carter, a native.
Carter scooped him up and brought him to New York, hiring him to work exclusively as the pianist for her jazz trio.
Davis spent many years in New York, cultivating his talent, learning from and playing with some of the greatest names in jazz, including Carl Allen, James Williams, Billy Hart,
