Mr. Speaker, I have personally witnessed Cindy in action and can attest to her knowledge, skills, and commitment to animal welfare.
As Cindy Machado retires after 40 years of service, she leaves an indelible legacy of good deeds for animals in Marin County and the extended region.
I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing heartfelt gratitude to Cindy for her generosity of spirit, innumerable achievements and in sending her best wishes on her next endeavors.
