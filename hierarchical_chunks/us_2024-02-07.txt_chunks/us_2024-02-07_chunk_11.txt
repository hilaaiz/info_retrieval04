Regina Carter, and Wynton Marsalis.
He served as musical director for the Boy's Choir of Harlem during its 1999-2000 season, played keyboard for the television series ``Cosby,'' and has been featured on more than 50 albums, including a Grammy-winning collaboration with Christian McBride in 2012.
We're so fortunate that after six years of teaching at the famed Juilliard School, Davis brought his talents back home and has been teaching jazz piano at Michigan State University since 2014.
In addition to the many students who have benefited from his instruction, Davis has also dedicated himself to uplifting his adopted hometown of Detroit through his music.
Supported by a grant from Michigan State University's Humanities and Arts Research Program, Davis began composing music about Detroit, which eventually became a powerful album titled ``Rise Up Detroit.''
Through his music, Davis focuses on the role Detroit has played on the lives of African-Americans and on the world at large, highlighting the Underground Railroad, the Great Migration, and the boom days of the auto industry.
Professor Davis is a gifted composer, arranger, and producer of music, and widely recognized as one of the most accomplished jazz pianists in the world.
He is also a proud Michigander, continually giving back to the community and the state that put the music in his soul.
While he is the recording artist, it is my distinct pleasure to record his accomplishments and convey my gratitude for his contributions here.
