Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in somber remembrance of Black January and the lives tragically lost during this saddening event.
I also urge my colleagues to join me in strong condemnation of the evils of communism, as well as in recognition of the stalwart friendship between the United States and the Republic.
