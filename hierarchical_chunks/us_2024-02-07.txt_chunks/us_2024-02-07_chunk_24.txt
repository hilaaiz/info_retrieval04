Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend Pastor Gregory Christopher and to recognize his decades of service to Tacoma's Shiloh Baptist Church and the greater Pierce County community.
Pastor Christopher was called to the Ministry in 1989 and studied under the Pastoral leadership of Pastor Lonnie Brown at The Body of Christ Christian Church in Tacoma, Washington.
He began his tenure with Shiloh Baptist Church in Tacoma's Hilltop neighborhood in 1993.
where he is the Senior Pastor, and will be retiring this February 2024.
In his 23 years on the pulpit, Pastor Christopher has created a legacy that puts him on hallowed ground.
His dedication to his community and his faith places him in the same breath as the legendary Black faith leaders of Tacoma, including the late Rev. Earnest Brazill, who was Pastor Christopher's mentor at Shiloh Baptist Church.
In addition to his congregational leadership, Pastor Christopher also serves on the Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, and is an At-Large Board Member of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. Pastor Christopher has been a fierce and tireless leader outside the Church as well.
He is a compassionate advocate for folks experiencing homelessness, a champion for racial representation, and a catalyst for policy solutions to improve the lives of African Americans in Tacoma and throughout the greater Puget Sound region.
His work has been demonstrated through his service as the President of the Tacoma branch of the NAACP, his membership in the Tacoma Pierce County Black Collective, and his past service on the board of the Tacoma Urban League.
Pastor Christopher has been at the center of efforts to promote racial justice and religious social services for decades, working to boost inclusivity through expanding partnerships with marginalized communities within Pierce County.
His leadership and his mission to empower the community have shaped our community for the better.
