Mr. Speaker, beyond detailing all his many accomplishments, I'd also like to express my gratitude for the partner that Pastor Christopher has been to my office and to me personally.
I'm proud to call Pastor Christopher a friend and have appreciated his sage advice throughout my career.
While we will miss him at Shiloh, I am happy that he will have more time with his family, including his wife, Evelyn, who also is a leader in the community, his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.
