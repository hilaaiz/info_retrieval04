Mr. Speaker, it is the dedication of people like the Berkoskis that honor Pennsylvania's rich agricultural traditions.
In addition to being active participants in the Farm Show, the Berkoskis operate a 200-yearold family farm in Conestoga.
I want to congratulate the Berkoskis on their success at this year's Farm Show and thank them for their tireless dedication to honoring our community's rich agricultural heritage and sharing their skills and passion with the thousands of individuals who attend the Farm Show each year.
