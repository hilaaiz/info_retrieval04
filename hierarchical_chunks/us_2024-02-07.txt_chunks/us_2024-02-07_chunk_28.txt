Mr. GOSAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the 34th anniversary of Azerbaijan's Black January, During this horrific January 1990 event.
Soviet troops marched into Baku, Azerbaijan to suppress the freedom and the sovereignty of the Azeri people.
This condemnable action by the Soviet Union during Black January contributed to the deaths of 147 civilians and the injuring of 744 more.
The desires of the Azeri people were fair and reasonable, but to Soviet ]eaders, these desires were unacceptable and had to be crushed.
Despite the savage Soviet opposition on Black January, the Azeri people remained steadfast in their strong dedication to freedom and selfdetermination.
This dedication contributed to Azerbaijan ultimately gaining its independence in 1991.
Black January is a striking reminder of communism's horrors.
The death and despair caused by the Soviet Union is shocking example of this destructive ideology's violent response to dissent and free thought.
Such a reminder is important not only for America, but the whole world.
We can never let the odious forces of communism prevail against the honorable ideals of liberty and individualism.
Today, the Republic of Azerbaijan is a key ally of the United States, Azerbaijan's economic and security partnership advances American interests in Eurasia.
It is in the best interest of the United States and Azerbaijan to maintain close bilateral ties with each other.
Because of this, I hope the friendship between our two countries will flourish for years to come.
