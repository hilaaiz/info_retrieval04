Contrary to what the Secretary of State has just told the House, two weeks ago, the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland published a report suggesting that a third of small businesses that move goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland have ceased supplying customers or partners either in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland.
Under the Northern Ireland protocol, if the UK experiences diversion of trade, we are entitled to take unilateral action to safeguard our internal market.
Will the Secretary of State tell the House whether he thinks that a third of small businesses ceasing trade in that way amounts to a diversion of trade?
If not, perhaps he could tell us what would.
There are other small businesses that are able to trade perfectly—[Interruption.]
The point that the hon.
Gentleman needs to recognise is that if some small businesses manage to move their goods  from GB to Northern Ireland, others can do so.
In the end, it is a decision for an individual business where it chooses to sell its goods.
It is the Windsor framework that applies now, not the Northern Ireland protocol, and I think he will accept that the Windsor framework represents a significant improvement on what was there before.
