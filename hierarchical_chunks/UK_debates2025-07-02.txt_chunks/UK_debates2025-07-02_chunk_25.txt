I thank the women in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, through her, for their hard work on this initiative.
Having 264 women MPs is really significant progress in this House.
I am incredibly proud that at the last election 100 new female Labour MPs were elected, meaning that the number of female MPs in the Labour party is now at a record high.
On the 97th anniversary of the equal franchise Act, it should be a source of great pride to the House that we have a record number of female Members.
