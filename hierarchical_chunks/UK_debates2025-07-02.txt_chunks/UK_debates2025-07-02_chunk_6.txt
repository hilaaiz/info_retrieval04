I welcome the opportunity to promote Northern Ireland’s tech companies here in the Chamber today.
More than 1,500 international companies have set up operations in Northern Ireland.
They tell me that this is due to the Government support, the strong working between the Government and the Executive, the dual market access, the unique concentration of tech companies, the academic support from Ulster University and Queen’s University and, above all, the people.
Northern Ireland has a workforce with industry-ready skills and innovation in their DNA.
