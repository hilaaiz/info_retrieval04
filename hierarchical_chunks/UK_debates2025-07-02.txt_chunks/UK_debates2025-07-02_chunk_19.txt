The Prime Minister has got some brass neck.
Has he read the papers this morning?
That Bill will achieve nothing.
It is a pointless waste of time, and it is absolute proof that he does not have a plan.
Let me tell the House what is going to happen: in November, the Chancellor is going to put up our taxes to pay for the Prime Minister’s incompetence.
We on the Opposition Benches know that you cannot tax your way to growth—[Interruption.]
These are the same Members who cheered when they talked about the national insurance rise—the jobs tax; why are they complaining now?
People out there are frightened.
Can the Prime Minister reassure them by ruling out tax rises in the autumn Budget?
The right hon.
Lady knows that no Prime Minister or Chancellor ever stands at the Dispatch Box and writes future Budgets.
That is not what the Conservatives did and it is not what we are doing, and she knows it.
She talks about growth, but for 14 years we had stagnation, and that is what caused the problems.
I am really pleased to show the progress that we are making, and I can update the House.
Last week, Amazon put £40 billion of investment into this country—one of the biggest investments of its type.
That brought inward investment to £120 billion in the first year of this Labour Government.
I can also tell the House that business confidence is the highest for nine years.
That is longer than the whole time that the Leader of the Opposition has been in Parliament.
Figures this week have also demonstrated and shown that we had the fastest growth in the G7 in the first quarter of this year.
What a difference from the mess the Conservatives made.
That is the difference that a Labour Government make.
