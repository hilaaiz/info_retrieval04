The Minister will be aware of a pending judicial review challenge focused on the lack of consultation with the Chagossians.
Why was there not full and adequate consultation with the Chagossian people?
I will not comment on ongoing judicial matters, but as I have set out a number of times the negotiations were necessarily between the UK and Mauritius.
However, we recognise the importance of the islands to Chagossians, which is why the measures that I just set out have been put in place.
On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.
In answer to  the hon.
Member for St Ives (Andrew George) , the Minister seemed to imply—to Opposition Members’ ears anyway—that the United States would be paying, I think he said, a larger quantum of the funding for the deal.
I think he was referring to the operational cost of the base.
May I ask for confirmation that the United States is not contributing at all to the £30 billion lease under the settlement?
Order.
That is not a point of order for the Chair, as the hon.
Gentleman will appreciate, but if the Minister wishes to respond I will allow him to do so.
Further to that point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.
Perhaps it was because of the noise and the shouting, but I was clear.
The United States contributes to the operations on Diego Garcia, and rightly so.
There is establishment of that in relation to the exchange of notes between the UK and the United States.
It is not contributing towards the costs of the treaty deal.
