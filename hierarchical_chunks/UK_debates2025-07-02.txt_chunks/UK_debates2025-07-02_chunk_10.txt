The Secretary of State has already answered the question on the roads.
It is important that we look at and address all parts of the infrastructure that are holding Northern Ireland back in any way.
Tech businesses in Northern Ireland could take advantage of a Heathrow logistics hub.
Ballykelly in my constituency has a large available land base, a seaport close by, an airport next door to it, and a railway line that runs through it.
Does the Minister think that is an excellent location for such a hub and tech business?
The hon.
Member is an excellent representative for his constituency and the opportunities there.
I am sure his plea and bid has been heard.
