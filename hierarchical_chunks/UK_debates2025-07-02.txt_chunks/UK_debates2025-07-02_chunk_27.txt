I thank the right hon.
Lady for her question.
On  22 May , the Diego Garcia treaty was signed and laid before the House.
As the Defence Secretary told the House on the day of the signature, this treaty secures the strategically important UK-US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.
The Diego Garcia military base is essential to the security of the UK and our key allies, including the United States, and is essential to keeping the British people safe.
It is also one of our most significant contributions to the transatlantic defence and security partnership.
