I thank the Minister for her responses so far.
Northern Ireland is indeed open for business, and I am delighted that companies are investing in my hometown.
Does she agree that the Dublin to Belfast economic corridor, which includes my constituency of Lagan Valley, will play a key part and that it is a huge opportunity for investment?
