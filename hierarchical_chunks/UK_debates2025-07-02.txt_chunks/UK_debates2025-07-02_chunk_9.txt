Belfast is already at the heart of the UK’s industrial strategy on cyber and tech and is leading the world.
The Government have a bold vision to be, by 2035, one of the top three places in the world to invest, create and scale up a tech business.
Belfast and the growth and city deals, which are at the heart of that, is an important part.
I have met businesses across Belfast and Northern Ireland that are leading on this, and it is exciting to see.
Does the Minister accept, though, that poor road access from the north of the United Kingdom is one impediment to investment in Northern Ireland, and therefore another reason why we should see the A75 upgrading?
