It is a pleasure to follow  the hon.
Member for Bury North (James Daly) , who made some important points to which I will return.
At the outset of my speech, however, I will take the opportunity to praise my hon.
Friend  the Member for Ogmore (Chris Elmore) .
He already has a reputation as an impressive and skilful operator in the House, and the way he presented his Bill today will only add to that reputation.
Labour Members want his Bill to make progress today, and perhaps to open up a broader debate about employment rights.
