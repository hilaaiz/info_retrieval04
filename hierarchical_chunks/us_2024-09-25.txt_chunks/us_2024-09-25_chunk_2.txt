Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Ridgway, Pennsylvania's Bicentennial year.
In 1817, Philadelphian shipping merchant Jacob Ridgway purchased 120,000 acres of land in Northwest Pennsylvania.
Forty thousand of these acres would officially become Elk County on April 18, 1843 with Ridgway as the county seat.
According to historians, the town of Ridgway was established in 1824 when one of 
Mr. Ridgway's nephews, James Gillis, convinced Ridgway that his land, which was filled with an abundance of lumber, could become a lucrative business opportunity.
In the past two hundred years, Ridgway has evolved into a thriving community where the lumber industry continues to flourish.
Ridgway is home to the Ridgway Chainsaw Carving Rendezvous.
What began as a shared passion of family and friends enthusiastic about wood carving has grown into the largest chainsaw carving gathering of its kind, attracting visitors from across the globe.
