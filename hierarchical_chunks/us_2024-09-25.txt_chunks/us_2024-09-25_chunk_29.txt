His dedication to supporting fellow veterans and their families highlights his belief in service beyond self.
Those who know Walter describe him as embodying the values of duty, honor, and country.
His selfless commitment to helping others continues to inspire all who meet him.
To honor his sacrifice and service, I am pleased to award retired USN Senior Chief Petty Officer Walter Miller Lavender with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
