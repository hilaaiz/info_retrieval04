Mrs. NAPOLITANO.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate City of Hope's National Medical Center in Duarte, California on being recognized as one of the nation's top 5 hospitals for cancer care by the U.S. News & World Report's 2024-2025 rankings.
In the same report, the center was also rated as high performing in six cancer procedures: lung cancer surgery, colon cancer surgery, prostate cancer surgery, gynecologic cancer surgery, gastroenterology and GI cancer surgery, and in the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.
City of Hope is the only freestanding National Cancer Institutedesignated Comprehensive Cancer Center in California that is not affiliated with a university.
Their system in California includes the Duarte campus, a new cancer center in Orange County, and clinical locations across Southern California, along with cancer treatment centers and outpatient facilities in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Phoenix areas.
City of Hope continues to be a national leader and innovator in a range of complex cancer types and innovative technologies, and because of them, hundreds of thousands of lives continue to be saved through these advances.
I know firsthand of the dedication and devotion that City of Hope is committed to offering all who are in need, particularly to those from traditionally underserved communities.
It has been a trusted institution in Southern California, offering superior care to the community for many decades.
I congratulate City of Hope and all its staff on this well-deserved national recognition by U.S. World News & Reports, and I wish them continued success.
