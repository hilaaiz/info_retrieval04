Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and the late Congressman Don Edwards (D-CA) to restore and conserve the Bay Area's saltmarshes and wetlands.
Thanks to their leadership and steadfast work, the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge in the South Bay now encompasses over 30,000 acres of habitat for millions of migratory birds and endangered species.
It is an honor to continue 
Senator Feinstein and Congressman Edwards' legacy of protecting and restoring resilient bayland ecosystems that benefit both wildlife, people, and our planet.
The ``San Pablo National Wildlife Refuge Expansion Act'' takes a critical step toward preserving the Bay Area's ecological diversity and ensuring the resilience of our communities as we continue fighting the climate crisis.
I thank the hundreds of Bay Area residents and Californians who participated in the public comment period on my draft bill announced in September 2023.
Their thoughtful comments and overwhelming support made this a stronger bill.
My colleagues and I are honored to introduce this bill to help restore vital ecosystems and improve the north Bay's climate resiliency by preserving one of California's special places for future generations.
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to join us in cosponsoring this bill.
