Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Tom Raffio on receiving the Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public Service.
The Walter R. Peterson Award for Education and Public Service is presented to an individual whose contributions best exemplify the late governor's values of public service and dedication to higher education.
As a passionate civic leader, Tom's community leadership spans across numerous New Hampshire organizations that support local education initiatives, youth programs, health causes, and the arts.
Tom believes in the importance of access and affordability to quality post-secondary education for all New Hampshire residents.
Under Tom's leadership, the Northeast Delta Dental Foundation is committed to improving oral health care accessibility and education.
This Foundation supports oral health programs each year throughout New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.
It also addresses the shortage of dentists in under-served communities by raising funding for medicine scholarships and dental education loan repayment programs.
In New Hampshire, one of the dental health education programs serves adult clients with disabilities, many of whom encounter oral health challenges.
Further expanding its community impact under Tom's leadership, it has grown to include numerous local community partners to join this philanthropic mission.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to extend my gratitude to Tom Raffio for his exceptional commitment to serving New Hampshire.
We thank Tom for his leadership and contributions to advance health equity and the overall wellness of our local communities.
His work has enriched so many lives and is an inspiration for us all to join together and improve the lives
