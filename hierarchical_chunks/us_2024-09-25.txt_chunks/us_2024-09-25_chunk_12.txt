Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hometown heroes, first responders and law enforcement, who keep us safe every day.
In recognition of National Police Week in May, my office put out a call for nominations for the first NJ-07 Law Enforcement Hometown Heroes initiative.
Twenty-two law enforcement professionals from across New Jersey's 7th Congressional District were nominated by their chiefs and supervisors for the outstanding work they do every day.
It is my honor to play a small role in recognizing their efforts as a token of appreciation for the difficult and often thankless task of keeping our communities safe.
I will always support these men and women in blue, and I look forward to welcoming each of these hometown heroes to a ceremony in October to formally recognize them in-person.
In recognition of their bravery and commitment, I would like to include in the Record the names of these twenty-two Hometown Heroes: Officer Alyse Brown, Sparta Township Police Department, Staff Sergeant Brent Hawkswell, New Jersey State Police, Officer Connor Strohm, Readington Township Police Department, Sergeant Daniel Kern, Hopatcong Police Department, Lieutenant Donald Sretenovic, New Providence Police Department, Lieutenant Douglas Baylor, Phillipsburg Police Department, Detective Elizabeth Savnik, Westfield Police Department, Corporal Gretchen Malone, Hunterdon County Sheriff's Office, Officer Jarren Mann, Hunterdon County Sheriff's Office, Officer Jessica Gutsick, High Bridge Police Department, Officer John M. Simonetti Jr., Mount Olive Police Department, Captain Jonathan Rachel, Springfield Police Department, Captain Michael Jackson, Mountainside Police Department, Captain Miguel Acabou, Clark Police Department, Officer Nicholas J. Villa, Raritan Township Police Department, Patrolman Peter Zabita, Hopatcong Police Department, Corporal Ryan Kamieniencki, Far Hills Police Department, Captain Scott Rayack, Rahway Police Department, Lieutenant Thomas Polito, Bedminster Township Police Department, Sergeant Timothy Richard, Bernardsville Police Department, Sergeant Tracy Baldassare, Bernards Township Police Department, and Officer Vincent Conti, Scotch Plains Police Department.
We are grateful for the commitment and sacrifice they make every single day.
