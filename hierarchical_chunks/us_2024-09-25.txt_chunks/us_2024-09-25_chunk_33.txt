Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of my constituent, the Honorable Sara J. Smolenski, who is retiring from the Kent County 63rd District Court after 34 years of outstanding public service.
As a trailblazer in our West Michigan community, Judge Smolenski has dedicated her professional life to serving the people of Kent County.
Judge Smolenski served as a private attorney and an assistant city attorney in Grand Rapids prior to her judgeship.
She was first elected to the court in 1990 and served as Chief Justice for over a quarter century, from 1996 to 2023.
Throughout her life, she has supported local organizations such as the Hospice of Michigan, Kent County Literacy Council, RAVE (Resources Against Violent Encounters) to Women of West Michigan, and the Young Women's Christian Association.
Her incredible service to our community has not gone unnoticed, receiving awards from organizations such as the American Red Cross and Women Lawyers Association.
In 2016, Judge Smolenski became the first elected official to enter a same-sex marriage in Kent County when she married her partner of 27 years.
She remains a role model for women and LGBTQ+ people in Michigan's
