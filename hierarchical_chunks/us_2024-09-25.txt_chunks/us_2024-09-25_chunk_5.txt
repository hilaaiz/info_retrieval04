Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable and continued leadership and service of 
Mr. Scott Bieler.
As the President and CEO of West Herr, Scott leads the largest privately-owned automotive group in New York State, and one of the biggest in the United States.
All told, there are over 3,000 employees across 39 locations in Erie, Niagara, Monroe, and Ontario counties, with new expansions and locations always on the horizon.
Scott has continued to go above and beyond, and while he is known as generous--few know the extent of his philanthropy throughout the community.
Scott is actively involved and supports many charitable and community initiatives, including the Roswell Park Alliance Foundation, Visit Buffalo Niagara, and Daemen University.
On Thursday, September 26th, 
Mr. Scott Bieler will be honored at Buffalo Niagara Partnership's Second Annual Economic Development Summit, where he will receive the 2024 Industry Leader Award.
On behalf of Western New York, I am proud to congratulate my friend on his many accomplishments, and I join him in celebrating this well-deserved award.
I therefore ask that this legislative body now join me in celebrating
