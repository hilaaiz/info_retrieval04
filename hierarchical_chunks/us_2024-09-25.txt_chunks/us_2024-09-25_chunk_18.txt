Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chandra Cheeseborough, who was named a 2024 She Leads Woman.
Chandra Cheeseborough is an example of a world record breaking Olympic Champion with a successful coaching career after receiving one athletes.
Chandra broke onto the international track scene at age 16, winning two gold medals at the 1975 Pan American Games, taking the 200 meters in an American record time of 22.77 seconds.
In 1976, she set the World junior record at 11.13 seconds, placing second at the U.S. Olympic trials, then placing sixth in that event at the Montreal Olympic games.
Chandra graduated from Jean Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Florida in 1977, where she set the still standing NFHS national high school records in both the 100-yard and 220-yard dashes.
She attended Tennessee State, where she was a member of national championship teams that set world indoor records.
She qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but was unable to compete due to the Summer Olympics boycott.
She won the national indoor 200-yard dash in 1979, 1981, 1982 and 1983.
Chandra's breakthrough year in the 400-meter race came in 1984, when she set two American records in the event, then placing second in the Los Angeles Olympics in a career best of 49.05, the No. 10 performer of all time.
She made history at the 1984 games when she became the first woman to win gold medals in both relays, which were held less than an hour apart.
In 1999 she was named head coach of both men and women's track and cross-country teams leading her Tigerbells to 6 Ohio Valley Conference Championships.
She also served as assistant coach for the 2008 Beijing Olympics hurdles and sprints.
Her faith in Christ has been a beacon of hope and strength to her student athletes.
