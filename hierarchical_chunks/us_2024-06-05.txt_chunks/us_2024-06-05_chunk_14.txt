Mrs. NAPOLITANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of Catherine ``Cathy'' Marcucci, who proudly served the City of Industry as Mayor Pro Tem until her passing on April 26 at the age of 60, after a hard-fought, three-year battle against aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer.
Cathy was a beloved wife, mother, daughter, and sister, and a dear friend to many.
A lifelong resident of Southern California, Cathy began her civic career in 2017 as a member of the City of Industry city council, where she served continuously, stepping into the role of Mayor Pro Tem in 2019.
Always eager to be involved in meetings with my staff and me, she was very gracious to all and never wavered from her commitment to assist her constituents.
Throughout her tenure, Cathy demonstrated exemplary leadership, fostering collaboration and championing causes that uplifted the lives of people and furry companions alike.
An avid animal lover, Cathy spearheaded efforts to establish the first no-kill animal rescue in the San Gabriel Valley.
Cathy is survived by her husband Steve Marcucci; daughter Lauren Eigel and son-in-law, Pete; parents, Larry and Etta Colson; brother and sister, Tim Colson and Chrissy Lowe, and their families; and countless dear friends.
She is also survived by her rambunctious four dogs and two cats, all equally beloved and in no particular order: Nemo, Lola, Rosie, Louee, Lucy, and Laci.
