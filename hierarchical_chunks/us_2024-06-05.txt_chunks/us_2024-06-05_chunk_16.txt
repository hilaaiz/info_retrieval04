Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wynn JacobsonGalan, a PhD graduate in Astrophysics of the University of California, Berkeley for exemplifying leadership in physics education and service to California's and the nation's scientific community.
Wynn is a great example of the strength and health of the University graduate of Malibu High School and proud California resident, Wynn Jacobson-Galan began his undergraduate career in the community college system, before transferring to the University.
He then attended graduate school at the University of California Berkeley.
Wynn dedicated his studies to furthering understanding the history of our solar system, and how it may shape our planet's future.
At the University of California, Santa Cruz, he conducted research on thermonuclear transients of all varieties under the guidance of Professor Ryan Foley.
At UC Berkeley, he conducted research under the mentorship of Professor Rafaella Margutti, studying the final moments Wynn is graduating as a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley, working on supernova progenitor systems and transient astronomy.
This research involved combining multi-wavelength observations of a variety of supernova types to create a complete picture of the final stages of stellar instability and mass loss before explosion.
Following his graduation, Wynn will be conducting research at the California Institute.
His academic journey would not have been as successful if not for the unwavering support of his family.
Their encouragement and support have been instrumental in shaping Wynn into the dedicated and accomplished leader he is today.
