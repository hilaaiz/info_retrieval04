Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and honor the 250th anniversary of the Prince William Resolves.
Today, I am honored to commemorate the unveiling and dedication of a historical marker in remembrance of the Price William Resolves, a celebration co-hosted by the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, Prince William Resolves Chapter and the Prince William County Historical Commission.
In 1774, the Prince William Resolves were passed in opposition to the British crown and in response to the call for support from patriots in Boston, Massachusetts following the Boston Tea Party.
This moment marked the first act of public defiance against British rule in Virginia.
Today, the Prince William community gathers to celebrate the bravery and patriotism of those who came before us.
Through this marker, visitors and the community alike will continue to learn about the courage with which Prince William's residents stood up to achieve rule by the people.
