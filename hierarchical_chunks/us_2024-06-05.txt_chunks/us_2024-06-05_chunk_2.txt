Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and congratulate Green Township on their 200th anniversary.
I am extremely grateful to be able to be here today and celebrate this incredible milestone.
Over the past 200 years, Green Township has shown itself to be a lively area with a strong community.
In 1824, Green Township emerged from the northern parts of Hardwick and Independence townships.
Over the decades, Green Township has gone through significant changes, including expansions, the incorporation of Fredon Township, and the rise of vibrant communities like Tranquility and Greendell.
As we reflect on its history, we can use the past two centuries as reminders of the resilience and changes our community has gone through, and the future that is to come.
I am honored to have such an amazing township in the 7th Congressional District, and I look forward to what is to come.
