Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to the Oak Knoll School of the Holy Cross on their 100th anniversary.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with you all.
The Oak Knoll School of the Holy Cross was founded by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus and has been at the forefront of empowering students not only academically but also in personal growth and social responsibility.
Over the past 100 years, Oak Knoll has fostered a welcoming diverse student body of inquisitive students who think critically, embrace knowledge, respond with moral and ethical integrity, and make responsible choices that enrich their own lives and contribute to the lives of others.
The Oak Knoll School has maintained a steadfast commitment to integrating faith with education, promoting a community of compassionate and informed citizens who are ready to lead and serve in a global society.
The past 100 years have served as a reflection of the vibrant legacy that will continue to inspire and shape future generations.
The Oak Knoll School of the Holy Cross has stood as a testament to a century's worth of educational innovation, resilience, and dedication.
May the school's next 100 years be filled with as much success as the past 100 years.
