Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ProYouth organization on their 30-year anniversary and to thank them for their significant contributions to the Central Valley.
In 1991, a dedicated group of volunteers from Visalia came together to establish Visalians for a Gang Free Community, aiming to address the challenges faced by children affected by gang violence in the Tulare community.
Three years later, the organization attained non-profit status and became known as ProYouth.
In 1998, ProYouth established their inaugural program, HEART--Health, Enrichment, Academics--to increase access to after school opportunities for students.
For more than 30 years, ProYouth has remained committed to its mission to protect all children from gang violence through after school programs and other essential initiatives.
Today, ProYouth serves nearly 20,000 students annually across 60 schools in the Central Valley.
In addition to their educational grantand contract-based programs, ProYouth's dedicated staff and volunteers also provide meals to students.
Just this year alone, ProYouth is expected to serve one million meals to its program's attendees.
Through their wide range of programs and initiatives, ProYouth develops students' academic, social, and emotional skills, equipping them with the foundation they need to succeed in their futures.
During the COVID19 pandemic, ProYouth was essential in helping Central Valley families who were impacted by school closures and the transition to remotelearning.
ProYouth established a program to provide support and an inperson learning environment for affected students.
For more than three decades, ProYouth has helped not only support our Central Valley students, but they have given them the tools to succeed in life.
Their work to enrich the lives of these students will be felt for generations to come.
Mr Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of
