Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr Speaker, I rise to recognize Nancy Gardner, who retired in April of this year after 44 years of selfless commitment to education.
Throughout her incredible career, Nancy served the Port Huron Area Schools, Landmark Academy, and the East Shore Leadership Academy, which she founded and has led over the last decade.
A Michigan native, Nancy earned her Bachelor of Science from Northern Michigan University and went on to earn two Master of Arts degrees from Central Michigan University.
After graduating, she earned her special education teaching certification and quickly began serving those in need.
She later returned to education to serve as a special education teacher and Assistant Principal for Holland Woods Middle School in Port Huron.
In the evenings, she worked part-time as a substance abuse therapist and registered social worker.
Nancy has also furnished a reputation for her knowledge in crisis management, having received special training from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1999-2000.
Nancy has traveled both inside and outside of the United States to receive--and offer--training to accommodate different learning styles.
Throughout her inspiring career in education, Nancy has spearheaded remarkable change and has, without a doubt, changed the academic landscape in Port Huron and beyond.
I am confident that her decades of instruction, leadership, and commitment to education will leave a lasting impact for many years to come.
