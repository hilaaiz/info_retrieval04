Mr. Speaker, I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in extending our deepest congratulations and best wishes to Wynn JacobsonGalan as he embarks on this new chapter of his life.
His academic contributions will forever resonate within the halls of the institutions he attended, and in the hearts of those who have had the privilege of working alongside him.
We hope he continues to advance our understanding of the universe and we wish him the best of luck in this next chapter of his life.
