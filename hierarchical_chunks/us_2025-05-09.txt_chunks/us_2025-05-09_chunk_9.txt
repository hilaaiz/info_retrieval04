Mr. BAUMGARTNER.
Mr. Speaker, behind every badge is a story, a family, and a heart committed to service.
I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the life of Border Patrol Agent Travis W. Salo, who tragically passed on April 25th in an off-duty vehicle accident near Metaline, in Pend Oreille County.
He was just 36 years old--a life full of promise, commitment, and courage, taken far too soon.
Agent Salo was more than just a dedicated public servant--he was a protector of our Nation's borders, a proud member of the U.S. Border Patrol's Spokane Sector, and a valued agent assigned to the Metaline Falls Station.
He carried out his duties with integrity, honor, and quiet strength.
Those who served alongside him remember him not only for his professionalism, but for the kindness, loyalty, and sense of duty he brought to every shift.
His sudden passing is a painful reminder of the risks and sacrifices that the men and women in law enforcement face--both on and off duty.
Agent Salo's story is one of dedication, bravery, and selflessness.
Today, we pause not only to mourn his loss, but to celebrate his life and express our gratitude.
He leaves behind a legacy of service that will not be forgotten.
To his family, friends, and fellow agents, I extend my most heartfelt condolences.
May they find comfort in knowing that his life made a difference, and that his memory will continue to inspire us all.
