Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and service of Diane Raulston, a devoted public servant, community leader, and advocate for education in Prince William County, Virginia.
Diane Raulston served the residents of the Neabsco District with distinction on the Prince William County School Board from 2015 to 2023.
Throughout her years of service, she was a passionate and determined advocate for public education, promoting efforts to raise teacher pay, close opportunity gaps, and create a more equitable, student-centered school system.
Under Diane Raulston's leadership.
the school division made meaningful strides: graduation rates rose, access to pre-kindergarten expanded, and Career and Technical Education programs grew significantly.
Her steady support helped guide the opening of nine new schools to meet the demands of a growing student population, ensuring that every child had a safe and welcoming place to learn.
Beyond her official role, Diane was known for her kindness, determination, and unwavering belief in the power of public education to uplift communities.
She listened, she acted, and she made a difference in countless lives.
Her legacy is not only visible in the buildings and programs she helped establish, but also in the spirit of service she inspired in others.
As we remember Diane Raulston, we celebrate a life lived in service to others, a life marked by integrity, compassion, and impact.
Her passing is a profound loss for our community, but her contributions will endure for generations to come.
