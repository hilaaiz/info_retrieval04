Mr. Speaker, instead of addressing the harms of the President's onagain-off-again tariffs, or working to address rising costs for American consumers, Republicans used this week to negotiate their Reckless Budget Scheme and rename a body of water.
My constituents do not want Congress to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to billionaires.
They do not want cuts to SNAP or Medicaid, vital lifelines in my home state.
It's time Congress starts working to address the real issues--starting with passing full year appropriations bills.
I am ready to get to work.
