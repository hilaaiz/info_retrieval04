I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Brighton, Kemptown (Lloyd Russell-Moyle)  for the way in which he introduced the Bill.
He is not known on the Opposition Benches as the most moderate of characters, but what he set out today was a moderate Bill—a Bill that seeks to find a consensus and a compromise between those campaigning for full-fat equality and those with gender-critical views.
He has done so with a focus on not taking one side of the debate or the other, but putting the victims of this abhorrent and cruel practice first.
That is what each of us, on all sides, should be thinking about when considering the Bill.
What happens to those people, out of sight and often out of mind, who are preyed on by others who seek to attack them for who they love and who they are?
