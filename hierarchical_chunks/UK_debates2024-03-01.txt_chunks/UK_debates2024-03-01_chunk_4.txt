I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving way.
He is making a very powerful point and I commend him for the amount of work he has obviously done to reassure people.
I think we are all aware that at the moment the debate around transgender issues has become incendiary and difficult, and a lot of damage has been done to a lot of people.
One thing I found about his Bill is that, if I am reading it correctly, it aims to be reassuring.
There is no attempt to stop people discussing their sexuality, there is no attempt to stop them discussing it with people from whom they might want to take advice, and there is no attempt whatsoever to stop them trying to explore the issues on their own.
It is simply protecting them from unwanted interference and traumatic attempts to change them.
