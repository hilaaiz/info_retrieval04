We have to get the Bill to Committee so that we can thrash that out.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right, but that is the point of passing legislation: we make definitions and we make laws.
The whole point of giving the Bill its Second Reading today is to create a definition and pass it into law.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for giving way; I hope he agrees that this is a very helpful conversation.
We have been debating this issue for years, as everybody keeps saying.
The reason there is no definition is because it is impossible to arrive at one.
The Scottish  Parliament cannot arrive at one and we have failed to do so.
It is not possible to find a definition that is between what is illegal already and what we all think should not be illegal.
It does not exist.
The idea that the Bill should go to Committee for us to continue this conversation is absurd.
It cannot be done.
I am sorry, but my hon.
Friend seems to have forgotten the point: this is the first time we are debating a Bill.
We have failed because we have taken five years to arrive at a position where we can actually debate legislation.
That is the failure.
We passed Brexit faster than we have discussed this!
