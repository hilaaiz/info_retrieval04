I thank my hon.
Friend for being so generous in taking another intervention.
He talked about evidence and referred to the survey, which he admitted contained no definition of conversion therapy.
We have heard how many different definitions of conversion therapy there could be, and how many different definitions we all hold, from the most extreme, awful abuse, which is already illegal, to talking therapies and persuasion.
Does the definition of conversion therapy not matter intensely to that survey?
How can it be evidence if there was no definition?
