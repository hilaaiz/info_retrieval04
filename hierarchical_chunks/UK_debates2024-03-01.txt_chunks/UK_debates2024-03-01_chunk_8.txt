I thank the hon.
Lady for her intervention.
Given the risk of running into the same wall that my hon.
Friend the Member for Brighton, Kemptown ran into, I will portray moderation on my side.
I think that that is precisely why she should give the Bill a Second Reading and table any amendments, as she sees fit, to define the matter of concern and make her case in Committee.
I believe that there are currently loopholes in the law that allow that abhorrent abuse to go on.
