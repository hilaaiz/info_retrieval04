I thank the hon.
Member for her question.
That is what we need to be able to discuss and look at in further detail, and to thrash out in Committee.
We need to ensure that clinicians, particularly those in the NHS—we need them to stay in their field—do not face a chilling effect.
The risk of that chilling effect should not be understated: it could make the holistic therapy that is recognised as critical by the Cass review harder to access.
Our priority absolutely has to be the legitimate and workable protection of the provision of good, evidenced care for children and young people.
