Mr. WALBERG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a critical issue impacting millions of Americans who work hard every day so that, when the time comes, they can enjoy their golden years in retirement.
October is National Retirement Security month, so it is a good time to both reflect on the retirement reforms we have recently enacted and look ahead to the remaining work to be done.
America's retirement savings system and the retirement outlook for millions has dramatically improved because of Congress's bipartisan work over the last few years.
Our private sector retirement savings system works well for many employees and employers, but additional improvements could help more Americans achieve a successful retirement for all.
As a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee.
I was proud to play an active role in helping draft and advance the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 into law
