Senator Ted Kennedy and became a Senior Fellow at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies.
Dick Clark has been described as hardworking, studious, well-liked, and a highly respected Senator.
He was all these and more.
I first met him in 1994 when I was invited to participate in my first Aspen Institute Congressional Program as a newly elected Member of the House.
This program, initiated and directed by Dick Clark, fostered relationships with members of both parties and provided high value information on a variety of policies presented by experts and discussed by Members.
Dick Clark said that ``good policy depends on informed policy makers'' and many minds were shaped and policies refined as a result of this superb Aspen Congressional Institute.
Dick was as fine a human being one could ever know... a kind man of enormous integrity, a beautiful friend and a true patriot.
