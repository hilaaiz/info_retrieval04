Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker, I honor a remarkable leader, trailblazer, and advocate for the beloved Town.
It is my distinct privilege to stand before you and pay tribute to a woman whose dedication and unwavering commitment to our community have left an indelible mark on our hearts and history books.
Today, I celebrate Mayor Joyce Whichard-Brown, the first African American and first female mayor.
Mayor Whichard-Brown's leadership journey began in Williamston, where she was born and graduated from EJ Hayes High School.
She then moved to Virginia and worked in the U.S. Patent Office and various private law practices.
In 2005, she returned to her hometown, Williamston, North Carolina, and has served as mayor since 2015.
Her accomplishments extend far beyond Williamston.
She served on the North Carolina League of Municipalities Board.
She has also taken on the role of vice chair of the Highway 17/64 Commission and initiated the quarterly mayor's meetings, fostering regional partnerships and cooperation.
Under her guidance, the Town has seen significant improvements, such as the major upgrade to a fire department building and the transformation of the Stalls Building into a state-of-the-art police department facility.
Mayor Whichard-Brown secured approval for the renovation of Gaylord Perry Park, making it more accessible and enjoyable for citizens.
Her tireless efforts also led to a substantial HUD grant of $750,000, dedicated to housing revitalization and downtown renovation.
Moreover, she was pivotal in securing over $1 million in grants to complete the Roanoke River Boardwalk.
New businesses have thrived under her leadership, raising property tax-assessed values and breathing new life into the Town.
Mayor Whichard-Brown has shown unshakable resolve, a willingness to stand her ground, and a remarkable ability to maintain her sense of humor.
She led with grace, strength, and an unwavering commitment to her community.
Retiring from the Town, she can spend more time with her two children, six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
Let's not forget Mayor Whichard-Brown's lesser-known talent, her incredible singing voice, which she generously shares at an annual stampede.
I thank her for her service and look forward to the continued positive impacts in the town.
