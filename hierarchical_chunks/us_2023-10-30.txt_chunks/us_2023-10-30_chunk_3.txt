Mr. THOMPSON of California, 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Craig McNamara, of Winters, California, as we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Farming, Agriculture, and Resource Management for Sustainability (FARMS) Program.
Craig McNamara was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
After traveling by motorcycle across Central and South America to learn more about the all of agriculture.
Mr. McNamara enrolled at the University of California, Davis where he earned a bachelor's degree in plant and soil sciences.
He then apprenticed under Tom Lum of Dixon for three years and would later rent his first 100 acres of farmland and establish Sierra Orchards.
In 1993, Craig and his wife, Julie, founded the FARMS Program giving high school students access to applied scientific research and careers in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability.
The FARMS Program grew to become a model practice for youth education throughout the nation and led to the establishment of the Center for Land-Based Learning in 2001.
Since its founding, the Center for Land-Based Learning has educated more than 25,000 students from 30 different California counties.
The Center for Land-Based Learning is the only organization of its kind in the state to offer a closed loop of agriculture-based education, internships, and careers.
Because of the program high school students and adults have had the opportunity to discover impactful careers in fields ranging from biological sciences and technology-aided farming to land-use management and robotics.
