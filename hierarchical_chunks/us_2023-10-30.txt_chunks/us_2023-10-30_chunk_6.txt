Mr. BURCHETT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Milton Jones, an East Tennessean who served our country in the U.S. Navy and worked on the Manhattan Project.
Milton grew up with an interest in technology and how it works, which would serve him well throughout his career.
After he graduated from Farragut High School in 1941, Jones earned a first class radio license from Madison College in Nashville.
He then went on to train the Army Signal Corps until he was called back to Tennessee to help on the Manhattan Project.
After the end of World War II, Milton started at WIVK radio as a chief engineer and proceeded to help set up new stations throughout the South.
He retired in 1993, but continued to work as a consultant for different radio stations and helped tune their towers.
Milton raised four children with his wife Anna Ruth Atkins, and turned 101 years old in March of 2023.
He has served his country and his family well, and the East Tennessee community is thankful for the impact he has had on those who have been fortunate enough to know him.
