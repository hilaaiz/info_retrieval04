Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in paying tribute to this remarkable man, his life and his work, and in extending our most sincere condolences to his wife Julie, his three children, three grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.
We are a better and stronger nation because of him.
