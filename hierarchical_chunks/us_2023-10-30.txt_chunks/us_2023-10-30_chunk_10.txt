Ms. STRICKLAND.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize delivery driver Phillip Jackson of Thurston County for his remarkable perceptivencss that helped to reunite a five-year-old boy with his mother.
While making a delivery to a West Olympia Texaco, Phillip noticed an unaccompanied boy without shoes or a shirt walking around the convenience store.
Sensing that something was amiss, Phillip immediately sprang into action and called 911.
It was Phillip's initiative in alerting authorities of the situation that allowed local law enforcement, who had already been working with the boy's mother after she had reported him missing, to locate the child.
Even after the police had arrived, Phillip remained with the boy until the mother and her child were reunited.
Phillip credits his intervention to a workplace training he took that teaches delivery drivers to recognize signs of human trafficking and children at risk on the road.
I applaud Phillip's awareness and quick action to help keep our most vulnerable members of our community safe and I am proud to recognize him today as our community's Constituent of the Month.
