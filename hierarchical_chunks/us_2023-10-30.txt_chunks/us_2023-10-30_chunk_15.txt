Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Horn's Gaslight Bar and Restaurant for 90 years of exemplary service.
I would like to congratulate the Horn Family and their staff on their success and wish them many more years of success.
The Horn family has a long and celebrated history in Mackinac.
In 1915, Ed Horn first came to Mackinac Island to work for the Michigan Life Saving Service, the predecessor to the United States Coast Guard.
During Prohibition, Ed Horn leased the building that would become Horn's and opened a pool hall and snack shop.
In December of 1933, following the passage of the 21st Amendment.
Ed finally opened Horn's Gaslight Bar and Restaurant as we know it today.
Since its start, Horn's has been a staple.
During the day you can hear lively piano music drifting out the door and see eager customers dining on the renowned southwest cuisine.
When the sun sets, the chairs are pulled aside, and the dance floor comes alive.
Horn's is a favorite late-night spot among locals, workers, and visitors alike.
