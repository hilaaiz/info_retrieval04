Mr. KIM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 116th anniversary of the founding of the United States Army Reserve.
For over a century, generations of Americans have served their country in the reserve, leveraging a wide array of skills, educational backgrounds, and expertise to respond to crises across the country, and the globe.
In cities and towns across the country, the Army Reserve has always been composed of brave, strong, purposeful men and women with great passions, talents, and abilities.
Since the creation of the Federal Reserve Force in 1908, the Reserve Corps has been ready to serve at a moment's notice, mobilizing more than one million Army Reserve servicemembers in defense of our country.
Through two World Wars, the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and the Global War on Terror, our brave reserve soldiers have served through crises, emergencies, and natural disasters, making positive impacts on people's lives around the globe.
Year after year, the Army Reserve continues to prove critical to our nation's national security apparatus by harnessing civilian expertise across professions like artificial intelligence, medicine, and engineering, among so many others.
There are more than 190,000 Army Reserve Soldiers and 11,000 civilians are currently stationed across all 50 States and 23 countries across the globe.
Right here in New Jersey we are proud to have 4,000 soldiers and 68 units contributing to their forward-positioned force.
Their service to our country and our great state is invaluable to the readiness and capability of our Joint Forces, and the safety of our communities.
This force begins their next 116 years of service as one of the most experienced outfits in American history, and I am grateful for the service of each and every one of them.
I look forward to continuing to support Army Reserve servicemembers in achieving their mission of-- ready now, shaping tomorrow.
