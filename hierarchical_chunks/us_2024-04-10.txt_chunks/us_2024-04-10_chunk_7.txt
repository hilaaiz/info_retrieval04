Representative Delahunt served as the chair of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight in the 110th Congress.
I had the distinct pleasure of serving with Representative Delahunt, and I still carry a deep respect for Representative Delahunt's strong principles and consistent defense of human rights.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his fiance, Julia Pagana, daughters Kirsten and Kara, and two grandchildren.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the life of a great man of this chamber.
