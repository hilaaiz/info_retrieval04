Mr. JAMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and say thank you to Warren Police Commissioner William Dwyer for serving Southeast Michigan for over 60 years throughout his career in law enforcement.
His career spans the Detroit Police Department, the Farmington Hills Police Department, and the Warren Police Department.
Day after day and year after year, Commissioner Dwyer consistently went above and beyond the call of duty.
He received the Presidential Medal from the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, the Collegian Award from Wayne State University, and the Crime Stoppers of Michigan Police Executive of the Year award in 2010.
He served on the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police, Oakland County Chief's Association, Southeastern Michigan Chiefs of Police Association, HighIntensity Drug Trafficking Area, Federal Anti-Terrorism Task Force, and the Michigan Homeland Security Council, just to name a few.
Even while receiving all these awards, he still found time to turn Warren, Michigan into one of the safest cities in the entire state.
Commissioner Dwyer is the exact, literal definition of what it means to be a public servant.
On behalf of all of Michigan's 10th Congressional District, I thank him for his service.
