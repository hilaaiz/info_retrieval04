Mr. CARL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Foley Mayor John Koniar and his service to Alabama's First Congressional District.
John entered active duty in the United States Air Force as 2nd lieutenant in 1965 and was honorably discharged as a Captain in 1969.
He joined Vulcan, Inc. in 1971, and he retired as a vice president of sales after working there for 37 years.
John Koniar served on the Foley City Council from 1980 until 2006.
He was then elected mayor in 2006 and served three terms until 2020.
John was incredibly influential to the City of Foley due to his strong leadership.
His dedication to the city was vital for the growth.
He took pride in his dedicated employees and how well they represented their community.
His presence and leadership promoted a healthy work environment in which people could succeed.
We are so grateful for all he has done for Alabama's First Congressional District.
