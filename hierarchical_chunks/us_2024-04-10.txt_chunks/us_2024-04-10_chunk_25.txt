Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 488th Intelligence Squadron at RAF Mildenhall.
Through 50 years of peace and conflict, the ``Bats'' of the 488th have delivered time-sensitive intelligence to warfighters and decisionmakers through their superb execution of RC-135 intelligence operations, and in recent years have participated in such Operations as Atlantic Resolve, Inherent Resolve, and more.
The Bats represent the cutting-edge of U.S. intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance efforts in the EUCOM theater of operations, driving allied interoperability with the United Kingdom's RC-135 program, leading analytic integration efforts with new NATO countries, and ultimately rising to the occasion following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing critical intelligence and overwatch for senior United States diplomatic and defense leaders.
I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the ``Bats'' for their dedication and selfless service to keep our country safe, and to congratulate them on this monumental anniversary.
