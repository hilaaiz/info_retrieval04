Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to recognize and congratulate BCI Solutions, Inc. in Bremen, Indiana on being inducted into the Indiana Manufacturers Hall of Fame this month.
I often say that Hoosier manufacturing is second to none, and I am proud to represent the Manufacturing Capital of the World here in Indiana's Second District.
The professional, high-quality work that BCI has done for more than 80 years has played a meaningful role in allowing our District to have and maintain that distinction.
Founded in 1939 as Bremen Gray Iron Foundry, BCI has grown into a renowned name and a leading provider of castings, machining, and complex assemblies.
Because of their continuous commitment to improving and investing in advancing technologies, BCI is on the forefront of providing products to the defense, agricultural, healthcare, lawn and garden and automotive industries, among others.
Additionally, BCI's example as a successful family-owned business now operating in their fifth generation is an inspiration to those looking to start their own companies, as well as a source of pride for many Hoosiers.
Congratulations again to BCI Solutions, Inc. on being recognized for this impressive distinction.
I join Hoosiers in thanking them for their many contributions to Marshall County and communities throughout the Second District.
I wish them continued success and many more years in business and accolades to celebrate going forward.
