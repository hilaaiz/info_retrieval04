Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I want to commend the achievements of Eustace Mita, a prominent figure in South Jersey's luxury real estate industry.
Mr. Mita serves as Chairman and CEO of Icona Resorts, Chairman of Mita Management, and CEO of Achristavest, all of which have left a significant mark on South Jersey's luxury real estate sector.
He founded ICONA Resorts in 2013, quickly establishing a highly regarded brand of luxury hotels in South Jersey, including the top ranked Icona Diamond Beach resort.
Currently, ICONA operates seven hotels along the South Jersey shore in Avalon, Cape May, Wildwood Crest, and Spring Lake.
Mr. Mita's business ventures extend to high-end luxury home development with Achristavest and strategic investments in local real estate and the automotive sectors through Mita Management.
Outside of business, he is a devoted family man to his wife, Susie, and their five children and sixteen grandchildren.
He is a respected leader in the Catholic Church's service initiatives and his contributions were recognized by Pope Francis during the 2015 World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia.
He also serves as the first lay president of the Papal Foundation, a charity that funds Papal requests for charitable grants and scholarships.
It is an honor to celebrate Eustace Mita's contributions to South Jersey's luxury real estate and commitment to community service.
His entrepreneurial spirit and dedication have left a lasting impact on our South Jersey community.
God Bless Eustice Mita and God Bless the United States.
