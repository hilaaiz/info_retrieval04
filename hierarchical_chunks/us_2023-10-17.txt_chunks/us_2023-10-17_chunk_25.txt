Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I want to honor the accomplishments of Aiden Inman, Ethan Scattone, and William Will, students at Oakcrest High School who competed in the SIFMA Foundation Capitol Hill Challenge and placed tenth in the Nation.
They participated as a part of their Stock Market and Investments class under the guidance of their teacher, Joe Cirigliano and their supervisor Nicole Gazia.
This exemplary group of students participated in a 14-week competition where they managed a hypothetical $100,000 online portfolio of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ESG investments, and cash.
Out of a student participation of over 6,500 students, Oakcrest placed in the top ten performing teams in the nation.
I am incredibly proud of these students and all of their accomplishments, and I can't wait to see the big things they do in the future.
God Bless these students and God Bless the United States.
