Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I would like to honor Brian and Kevin Murphy for graduating high school and 8th grade.
Brian has graduated from Rustin High School with honors and headed to Penn State University in the fall where he will study Business.
Kevin has graduated 8th grade with honors from St. Simon and Jude School.
Kevin will continue his journey at Rustin High School next year.
Both Brian and Kevin have recently assisted their baseball teams in winning their Championship games.
Two amazing young men with incredible futures ahead of them.
I know their family is very proud of them, especially their Aunt Allie.
God Bless Brian and Kevin and God Bless the United States
