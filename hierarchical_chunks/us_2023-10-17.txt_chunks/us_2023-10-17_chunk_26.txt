Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this August, I had the pleasure of attending Thomas Tran's Eagle Scout Court.
Thomas has been actively involved in the Scouts since the third grade when he joined as a cub scout.
He quickly climbed the ranks and became an active member of Troop 94, leading the group as their Patrol Leader.
Since then, he has earned an impressive 28 merit badges for his hard work and dedication.
The proudest moment of Thomas's Scouting journey was his Eagle Scout project where Thomas organized the removal and replacement of an old billboard welcome sign at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 8098 in Egg Harbor Township.
This massive undertaking demanded 130 hours of his time and the South Jersey community is thankful for his efforts.
God Bless Thomas Tran and God Bless the United States.
