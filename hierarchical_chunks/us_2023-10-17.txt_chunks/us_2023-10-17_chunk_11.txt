Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize the 349th Air Mobility Wing (Reserve), assigned to the Air Mobility Command, Scott Air Force Base, II.
The 349th, celebrated its 80th anniversary on October 14, 2023.
The 349th AMW (Reserve).
located at Travis Air Force Base, California, is the largest associate wing in the United States Air Force Reserve.
349th AMW personnel fly the C-5 Galaxy, the C-17 Globemaster III, and the KC-10 Extender, and are now transitioning to the KC-46 Pegasus.
The missions of the wing's aircrews include airlifting personnel and material worldwide as well as aerial refueling a wide variety of aircraft.
The 349th AMW is also home to the 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron, responsible for treating patients during medical airlift; the 349th Airlift Control Flight, tasked to enter austere locations and prepare for USAF aircraft arrival; and the 349th Medical Squadron, capable of providing hospital services worldwide, in a contingency environment.
The mission of the 349th AMW is to ``generate and sustain combatready mobility Airmen.''
This makes the wing responsible for training almost 3,500 Reservists who, in turn, work side-by-side their activeduty counterparts in the 60th AMW, also stationed at Travis.
In November 1943, 349th Troop Carrier Group was activated at Sedalia Army Air Field, Missouri.
The 349th TCG had five troop carrier squadrons assigned, including what is now the 312th Airlift Squadron, which is still assigned to the 349th.
The 349th, like the other reserve troop carrier wings, was completely equipped and ready to move with only a few hours' notice as was the case during the Cuban call-up.
Only four hours after the first call to report for duty was made, 95 percent of the wing's flying personnel had checked in and were ready to move.
This proved the value of the Air Force Reserve's ``Ready Now'' concept and the wing's motto ``In Omnia Paratus.''
In all things prepared.
A recall to active duty was again initiated on January 26, 1968, for the Vietnam War, and many hundreds of tons of cargo were carried across the Pacific.
Upon deactivation in 1969, the 349th moved to Travis AFB, CA.
In 1972, the 349th joined the active component in flying and maintaining the C-5 ``Galaxy'' making the 349th a two-weapon system reserve strategic airlift wing.
On February 1, 1992, the 349th was re-designated the 349th Airlift Wing, deleting the word ``military'' from its name to conform with the active-duty Air Force's reorganization and realignment policies.
In September 1994, the KC-10 ``Extender'' tanker mission was added to the Wing and became an ``Air Mobility Wing,'' the only Air Force Reserve unit at the time to fly three types of aircraft: the C-141 ``Starlifter,'' the C-5 ``Galaxy,'' and the KC-10.
With the C-17 ``Globemaster III'' arrival at Travis in Summer 2006, the wing and its host became the only units in the country to fly three major weapons systems.
On May 25, 2006, the 301st Airlift Squadron converted from the C-5 to the C-17 and on June 25, 2006, the 945th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron was activated to support the Globemaster III.
Most recently the 349th Aeromedicine Squadron deployed reserve medical personnel in support of New York City's response to the
