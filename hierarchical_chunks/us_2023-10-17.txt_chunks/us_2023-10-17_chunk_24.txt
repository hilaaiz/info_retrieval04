Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor and remember the life of United States Army veteran Richard Edward Santspree.
Richard was born in Troy, New York on July 28, 1950.
After graduating from Cohoes High School, Richard enlisted with the United States Army in October 1967.
He served in the Army for three years, rising to the rank of Specialist Fourth Class, before he was honorably discharged in October 1970.
For his service, Richard was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and M16 Expert and M14 Sharpshooter badges.
Richard remained with the Army Reserves until 1973.
Returning to civilian life, Richard married the love of his life Christine Hogan Santspree in April 1971.
They moved to Cohoes and started their family together, raising three children; Kimberly, Richard Jr., and Thomas.
Richard spent his professional career with General Electric in Schenectady, working as a machinist for four decades before retiring in August 2010.
Richard was a well-rounded member of the Cohoes and Troy communities, participating in his local church, veterans' organizations, and recreational activities.
He was a member of the Cohoes Moose Club, the Cohoes-Waterford Elk's Lodge 1317, and the American Legion Ruane Post 476.
Richard competed in a league at the Cohoes Bowling Arena, along with the Cohoes Rod and Gun Club's Dart and Horseshoe League.
Richard assisted with St. Rita's Church's annual bazaar, as well as the Rod and Gun Club's kids' fishing contest at the Van Schaick Island pond.
More than anything, he was a proud family man who enjoyed travelling and spending time with his wife, children, and three grandchildren.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to recognize the life of 
Mr. Richard E. Santspree, defined by exemplary service to his community and his country.
