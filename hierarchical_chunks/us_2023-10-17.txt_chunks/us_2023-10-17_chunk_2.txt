Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, in April, I had the pleasure of attending the 25th anniversary celebration of Big Sky Aviation in Millville, South Jersey.
As a full-service, fixed-base operator, this aviation center provides a valuable and enriching experience to our South Jersey residents through its many services.
These services include hangar leasing, aircraft cleaning, jet fueling, pre-purchased inspections, airframe repairs, tie downs, car services, catering, and much more.
They also offer personalized flight school programs working directly with students to create a strategy that aligns with their individual needs and objectives.
The experienced team of aviation professionals at Big Sky Aviation ensure that your visit to South Jersey is as convenient and enjoyable as possible.
I thank all the staff at Big Sky Aviation for sharing their passion for aviation with our South Jersey community for the past 25 years.
God Bless Big Sky Aviation, and God Bless our United States.
