Mr. POSEY.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I would like to recognize Dawn Futch, her husband Mike Futch, and their daughter Stephanie Futch for their charitable service towards the people.
After the sudden and tragic passing of Dawn and Mike's son Michael-Gene, the Futch family created the Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation.
When Michael-Gene Futch passed away in November of 2010, his family requested basketballs instead of flowers due to Michael-Gene's love of the sport.
When over 1,500 basketballs came, the Futch family decided to donate those basketballs to underprivileged children in Brevard County.
This charitable donation led to the creation of the Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation, which aims to help underprivileged families.
Since the Foundation was formed, it has grown far past donations of basketballs.
While continuing basketball donations year-round, the Futch Foundation also hosts a back-to-school drive, sponsor-a-family thanksgiving, and a gift drive for the holiday season.
The Futch Family also holds an annual black-tie affair to raise money for charity.
The Futch family plans to continue their many years of charity work for the children.
I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the Futch family and saluting their selfless service.
The Michael-Gene Kids Basketball Foundation is an inspiration and blessing to underprivileged children, and families in our community.
