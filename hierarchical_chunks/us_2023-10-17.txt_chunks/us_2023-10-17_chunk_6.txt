Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I honor the 100th birthday of Dorothy Helen Dougherty, a woman of great character and dedication.
Dorothy was born on October 7, 1923, and grew up in a loving, multi-generational household in Pennsylvania.
After attending secretarial school in Philadelphia and working as a secretary for several years, she married her husband in January 1948.
Together, they settled in Ocean City, South Jersey and built a successful residential construction and real estate business while raising three sons.
Dorothy remained active in her church and community, and she volunteered in various charitable efforts, including helping the less fortunate through food and clothing donations.
Tragically, she lost her husband at 58 but found solace in Lake Worth, Florida, where she became an active member of her church and excelled as a shuffleboard champion.
Most importantly, Dorothy's legacy continues through her loving family, including three sons, eight grandchildren, and thirteen greatgrandchildren who affectionately know her as ``GiGi.''
So, on Dorothy's 100th birthday, we honor her remarkable life and her enduring impact on her family and community.
God Bless Dorothy Dougherty and God Bless the United States.
