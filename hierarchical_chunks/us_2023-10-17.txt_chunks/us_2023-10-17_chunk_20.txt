served 600 patients in its first year.
Today, CHC serves over 25,000 patients and has locations in five towns across the Upper Cape.
It was also recently announced that CHC received a five-million-dollar grant through the American Rescue Plan to open a new location to serve more patients on Cape Cod.
The new facility will be LEED silver certified and include affordable housing to support the community and workforce.
Since 2003, CHC has been led by CEO, Karen Gardner.
Under Ms. Gardner's leadership, CHC continues to grow and evolve to better serve its patients.
Over the last two decades, CHC has built a 33,000 square foot facility in Mashpee; added oral health, women's health, 340B pharmacy, and vision services; implemented an electronic medical record system; and was designated a federally qualified health center in 2006.
Whether it be transportation or insurance costs, Community Health Center of Cape Cod continuously works to break down barriers to accessing quality healthcare.
By combining the different skills and backgrounds of its board members and staff, CHC always strives to provide the best healthcare to the community that it serves, especially those from vulnerable populations.
Over the last 25 years, CHC has operated with the goal of providing high-quality, comprehensive, and affordable care regardless of a person's ability to pay and has established itself as a pillar of the Cape Cod community.
