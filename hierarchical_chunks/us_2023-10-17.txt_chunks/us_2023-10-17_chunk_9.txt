Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I rise in celebration of the grand reopening of Kountry Kitchen Soul Food Place, a beloved Indianapolis establishment specializing in southern-style soul food.
Located in Indiana's 7th Congressional District, Kountry Kitchen was established in 1988 by 
Ms. Jessie White to bring her southern-style home cooking to the neighborhood, under the name Jessie's Place.
Ms. Jessie's daughter, Nell Wilson, later joined to grow the family business and introduce her own recipes.
Nell and her husband, Isaac, renamed the diner to Country Kitchen.
After Nell's passing, Isaac remarried, and with his wife Cynthia, they renamed the business Kountry Kitchen.
Isaac and Cynthia continue to honor this legacy by serving the recipes passed down to them by 
Ms. Jessie and Nell.
A nationally recognized restaurant, Kountry Kitchen has caught the attention of many notable figures, including Jimmy Fallon, former President Barack Obama, and Indianapolis native Mike Epps.
In early 2020, Kountry Kitchen suffered a devasting fire.
Thankfully, there was no loss of life, but the establishment suffered extensive damage.
With the help of a $400,000 grant, assistance from local organizations, and the entire Indianapolis community coming together, Kountry Kitchen broke ground on its new location in the summer of 2022.
One year later, we are proudly celebrating their grand reopening.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our congratulations and thanks to a beloved community staple and recognizing the enduring legacy of this iconic Indianapolis destination.
