I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement and associate myself with his words about our brave military personnel.
Does he agree that we must reiterate how the Houthi attacks are illegal, are against the UN charter and target the principle of freedom of navigation, which benefits all nations, including our allies in the region?
Does he also agree that our action shows that working in concert with our allies internationally can improve regional stability and security, and indeed our security here at home?
