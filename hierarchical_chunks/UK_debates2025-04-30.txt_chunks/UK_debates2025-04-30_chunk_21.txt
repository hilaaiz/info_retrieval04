Listening to residents in North West Cambridgeshire on the doorstep and at local coffee mornings, there is a clear message: people want local police to have the time and resources to get to know crime in their areas and to tackle it at the root.
I know our Labour mayoral candidate is committed to that if she is elected tomorrow.
Could the Prime Minister update residents across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on how our plan for change is tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and boosting police ranks by 13,000 officers, who will be visible in all local communities?
The Conservatives decimated neighbourhood policing, and crimes like shoplifting and antisocial behaviour ran rife.
I can tell my hon.
Friend what we are doing through the plan for change: extra police officers, extra police community support officers, more special constables, and—on top of that—a named officer for every community, and more teams out in our town centres on Friday and Saturday nights.
That is what you get with a Labour mayor working with a Labour Government to deliver change for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.
Eastbourne war veteran Staff Sergeant Pauline Cole sustained injuries while serving our country.
She was awarded military compensation, but because military compensation is  currently considered income by this Government, her pension credit has been cut from £77 a week to just £11 a week.
We have met the relevant Minister to try to address this to no avail.
With the 80th anniversary of VE Day just next week, will the Prime Minister meet Pauline, who is in the Gallery, and I to address this injustice and ensure that no veteran is penalised for serving our country?
