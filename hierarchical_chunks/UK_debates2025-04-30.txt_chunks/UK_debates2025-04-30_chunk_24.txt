I welcome the Government’s action to fix our NHS and deliver 2 million more appointments, which my constituents are already benefiting from.
Together with Warrington and Halton NHS trust, I recently submitted a ready-to-go proposal for a new urgent treatment centre and out-patients facility in Warrington, which has over 200,000 residents but no urgent treatment centre.
The proposal would reduce A&E waiting times and deliver 100,000 appointments every year.
Will the Prime Minister or the Health Secretary agree to meet me and local health partners to discuss that transformational project?
