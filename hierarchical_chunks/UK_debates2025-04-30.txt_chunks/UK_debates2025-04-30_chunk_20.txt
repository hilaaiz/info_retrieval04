I thank the hon.
Member for raising this, and the Conservatives should apologise to her constituents for allowing record sewage into our waterways.
Our water Act will clean up our rivers, lakes and seas.
Under new powers that came into effect last week, in fact, water bosses can now face years in jail for concealing sewage spills.
We have banned the payment of bonuses and introduced new powers, and of course we are delivering a major review through our water commission.
I reassure the hon.
Member that we will not hesitate to take further steps.
