The hon.
Lady asked, “Why now?”
First, the decision and the action that we took were in line with long-established policy, both UK policy and the United Nations charter.
Secondly, it was a reflection of the fact that, as I have reported to the House, the US is stepping up and we, as a close ally, are alongside it in this action.
Thirdly, our purpose is to protect our economy at home, because most of the shipping in this busiest of international sea routes makes a big detour that pushes up prices and has a direct impact on not just our security interests but our economic interests in Britain.
That is why we are acting.
I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
The Houthis say that they are shelling international shipping in order to help the Palestinians, but does my right hon.
Friend agree that by not just undermining international trade but causing a devastating decline in the use of the Suez canal and crashing the numbers of cruise ships visiting Aqaba, they are actually attacking Egypt and Jordan—two countries which could not be working harder for a future for the Palestinians, which could not be giving more support, whether it is financial, political or diplomatic, and which provide a refuge for so many?
Does he agree that if the Houthis really care about the Palestinians, they should simply stop this?
I totally agree with my hon.
Friend.
Jordan and Egypt are doing a lot of the heavy lifting in trying to support the Palestinians, and it is notable that there is no evidence that the Houthis have provided any aid to the Palestinians in Gaza.
The action that they are taking, which is causing disruption and the intensification of insecurity in the region, is doing absolutely nothing to help the Palestinians’ cause.
