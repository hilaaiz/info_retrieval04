Does the Minister agree that what strengthens this Union is the nations of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland intertwined with England?
It is the Gaelic nations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and their cultures and history that bring us together.
The Union also brings benefits relating to employment, jobs and opportunity.
It is about the constitution and our service in uniform.
All those things bring us together in a way that nothing else can, and mean that this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is better as a Union; we can all do better together.
