I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that terrible case, and I think the thoughts of the whole House will be with Christopher’s family and friends affected by this.
We will certainly look into what else we can do, and if there are further details that could be given to me of that particular case, I will make sure that we follow it up.
