I welcome the tone and content of the hon.
Gentleman’s response to my statement.
Labour backed the last Government’s strikes against the Houthis and, as he pointed out, the rationale then was the same as the rationale now.
That was a useful contribution to this discussion.
The hon.
Gentleman was right to say that the clear and present threat that the Houthis pose to all nations, including ours and our closest allies, is also the same.
