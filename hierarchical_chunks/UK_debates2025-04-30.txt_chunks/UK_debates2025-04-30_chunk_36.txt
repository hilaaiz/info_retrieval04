The Houthis’ destabilising military campaign in the Red sea has had a chilling effect on trade through that vital waterway, threatening lives while imposing costs on British businesses and consumers.
The Houthis cannot be allowed to act with impunity and hold the global economy to ransom by restricting freedom of navigation.
It is important that their military capabilities are degraded to ensure that trade can flow freely, which is why the Liberal Democrats support the case for limited strikes.
We thank the service personnel involved for their bravery, and we are pleased that they have returned home safely.
However, it is vital that we fully understand the operational goals behind the mission, as well as the intelligence planning and co-ordination of the strikes.
Can the Secretary of State explain to the House why the Government have chosen this occasion to join US forces in a joint strike, rather than doing so on previous similar missions?
The recent leaks from President Trump’s Cabinet, also pertaining to military action in Yemen  against the Houthis, raise concerning questions about how secure US intelligence is and the possible impact on British service personnel.
In the light of those leaks, can the Secretary of State reassure us that intelligence-sharing with the US is completely secure, and can he tell us whether the Government have undertaken an assessment of the security of our intelligence-sharing networks with the US?
I was reassured to hear from him that the Government have no evidence of any loss of civilian life, but can he update the House on what steps were taken ahead of the mission in an effort to minimise civilian casualties?
Before I respond to the hon.
Lady, may I point out that I neglected to respond to  the hon.
