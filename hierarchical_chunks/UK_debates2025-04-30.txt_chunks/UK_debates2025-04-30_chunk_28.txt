The Secretary of State referred to Russian involvement.
Can he confirm reports that the Houthis have received targeting assistance with potential ballistic missile attacks from Russia?
Does that not show why supporting Ukraine against Russia is about a much wider strategic picture  that directly threatens the United Kingdom?
He also referred to the use of our military base, Diego Garcia, for regional security operations, but soon it will not be ours.
Does this kind of action not show why surrendering its sovereignty is so reckless?
Let me finally turn to the subject of the strategic defence review.
It is very concerning that the permanent secretary to the Ministry of Defence told the Public Accounts Committee on Monday: “it is a strategic defence review that will need to be translated into a set of specific investment decisions in individual capabilities and projects.
That will be work for later in the summer and into the autumn.”
