On behalf of my party, may I send our congratulations to Mark Carney and the Liberal party of Canada on their historic victory?
We wish them well, as Canada continues to stand up strongly to President Trump’s tariffs and threats.
Canada has learned what happens when a trade deal is done with President Trump; he cannot be trusted to stick with it.
The Prime Minister did not answer my question last week, nor he did answer my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wokingham (Clive Jones)  just now.
Let me ask again.
Will the Government give Members a vote on the Floor of the House on any deal he agrees with President Trump—yes or no?
We are in negotiations on a deal with the US.
We will obviously act in the national interest to make sure that if there is a deal, it is the right deal for our country.
If it is secured, it will go through the known procedures for this House.
I am very disappointed by that reply, and the lack of a yes or no response.
We want a vote, and we will keep pressing the Prime Minister and his Government on that.
Turning to a domestic issue, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Dorking and Horley (Chris Coghlan)  has taken up the cause of Fiona Laskaris, whose autistic adult son Christopher was horrifically exploited and then murdered by a convicted criminal.
As “ITV News” has reported, when Fiona tried to get a mental capacity assessment for her son, she was dismissed, so Christopher never got the support that might have saved his life.
We are going to try to change the law so that families’ concerns over a loved one’s mental capacity have to be considered.
Will the Prime Minister give his personal backing to that change, to prevent another tragedy like Christopher’s?
