Tomorrow I will be visiting the new sexual violence support centre in Rothbury House in my constituency, along with Jane Hutt, the Welsh Government Minister for Social Justice.
This great new facility will support many people in my constituency and the surrounding areas for years to come.
Will the Minister join me in applauding the vital work of the staff—many of them volunteers—who provide lifesaving support to women in need?
I pay tribute to that support centre, and indeed to the many organisations the length and breadth of Wales that help women fleeing domestic violence.
As my hon.
Friend knows, we work very closely with the Welsh Government.
Indeed, I spoke to Cabinet Secretary Jane Hutt only yesterday.
As my hon.
Friend will also know, the Welsh Government launched their own strategy for combating violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence back in 2022, and they are carefully monitoring progress on it.
