Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, Clark joined the Boy Scouts in March of 2019 and quickly achieved the rank of Tenderfoot before climbing the ranks to Star Scout, Life Scout, and finally, Eagle Scout.
He has held a number of leadership positions including Assistant Patrol Leader, Patrol Leader, and most recently, Junior Assistant Scoutmaster.
He earned an extraordinary 40 Merit badges, showing his strong passion to the Scout Oath and Law.
His marksmanship skills were especially outstanding, earning him high honors in both Rifle Shooting and Shotgun Shooting.
For his Eagle Scout project, Clark created a beautiful garden area on the grounds of Saint Gianna Parish, giving church members and visitors a peaceful place for reflection.
His parents, Chris and Paige, are very proud of him, just as I am, and we all look forward to the great things Clark will do in college and the years after.
God bless Clark and God bless our United States.
