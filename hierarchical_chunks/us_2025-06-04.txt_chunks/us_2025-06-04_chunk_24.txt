Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of visiting Zion United Methodist Church in historic Bargaintown, South Jersey, as they were awarded an America 250 marker to honor the American Revolution patriots buried on their grounds.
This church has a rich history, dating back to 1764, when it was built by Presbyterian residents and American Revolution patriot, John Brainerd.
In 1814, the Methodists purchased the building before constructing the brick church that still stands today.
This Church serves as the final resting place for many brave American soldiers from both the Revolutionary War and the Civil War.
Walking through its grounds is a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made for our freedom.
But the Church isn't just about preserving history--it's about serving the community.
Through missions like their Free Food and Walk-In Pantry Distribution, online Bible study, and summer concert series, they continue their mission of faith and service.
I thank Zion Methodist Church, for the great things they do through the love of Jesus and for their incredible commitment to remembering the first heroes to our great Nation.
God bless Zion Methodist Church and God bless our United States.
