Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Ms. Nikki Hayes for her incredible achievements with Pier 31 Chicago and for her continued contributions to our city, including her expansion to the River Walk District.
We are fortunate to have such a dynamic and dedicated business owner in our community.
