Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit and community impact of 
Ms. Toni Taylor and Ms. Malkah Taylor, the visionary owners of The Wrap Bar, a beloved culinary gem on the Southside of Chicago, home to the now-famous jerk wraps.
The dedication these women have exemplified plays a crucial role that family-owned businesses, particularly those led by Black women, play in strengthening our local economies and enriching our communities.
The Wrap Bar, under the Taylors' leadership, is more than just a restaurant; it is a testament to perseverance, culinary excellence, and community building.
As a proud family-owned establishment, it embodies the values of hard work and generational commitment, providing not only delicious and unique jerk wraps that have garnered widespread acclaim but also a welcoming space that fosters local connection and pride.
In the vibrant landscape of Southside Chicago, Black women-owned businesses like The Wrap Bar are indispensable.
They serve as vital economic engines, creating jobs, circulating wealth within their neighborhoods, and providing essential services and products.
Beyond their economic contributions, these businesses are powerful symbols of self-determination, resilience, and success, inspiring future generations and challenging systemic barriers.
Ms. Toni and Ms. Malkah's success with The Wrap Bar shines a bright light on the incredible talent and dedication within the Black women entrepreneurial community.
The Taylors' commitment to quality, their innovative approach to cuisine, and their role as a business leader in the Southside are truly commendable.
They have built a thriving enterprise that feeds both body and spirit, contributing significantly to the cultural and economic vitality of their community.
It is with great honor and admiration that we acknowledge 
Ms. Toni and 
Ms. Malkah Taylor for The Wrap Bar.
Their success is a beacon for family entrepreneurship and a powerful example of the transformative impact of Black women-owned businesses.
