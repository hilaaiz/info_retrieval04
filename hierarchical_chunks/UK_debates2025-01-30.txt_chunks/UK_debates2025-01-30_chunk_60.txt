Targets in the NHS have not been met since 2015, which was under his Government’s watch but, actually, this target has been met—there are only three places in the country that do not have a hub—so there is no target for them because that has already been met.
The issue now is to look at the outcomes from those hubs to see how they are performing.
We think, and the system thinks, that they do a good job.
That is why they are staying, why we are committed to them, and why we want to learn from them.
