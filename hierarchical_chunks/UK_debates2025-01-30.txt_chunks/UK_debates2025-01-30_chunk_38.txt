I thank my hon.
Friend—and he is a friend—for his concern.
Of course, this is of particular concern and interest to representatives from the east of England, and I share that concern.
We have discussed the future of Weybridge and the investment many times before.
I gently point out that the Conservative Government had the opportunity over 14 years to make that investment.
Over £200 million has been allocated by this Government, and we will continue to make sure that the agency is properly resourced.
