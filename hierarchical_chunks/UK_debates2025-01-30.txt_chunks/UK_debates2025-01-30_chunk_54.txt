The Committee report on women’s reproductive health, started under our fantastic predecessors, laid out how medical misogyny has left far too many women suffering.
Women have been left undiagnosed for debilitating conditions such as endometriosis for an average of eight years—not for treatment, for diagnosis.
Black women are four to five times more likely to die during childbirth, and the rate of maternal death in the UK has risen by 15% in the last 10 years.
The leading cause of that is suicide, accounting for 39% of deaths in the first year postpartum.
Does the Minister therefore agree that women, and women of colour especially, have borne the brunt too often of 14 years of disastrous health policies?
How can the Government reverse this trend?
