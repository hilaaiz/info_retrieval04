I am, as ever, grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for raising the issue as it impacts Northern Ireland.
We have been developing a UK-wide response to this, and my officials are in constant contact with officials from his Administration.
We will ensure that this UK-wide response continues to be in place, because it is very important that we work together on all these issues.
I hope in the not-too-distant future to continue my tour of the country, and I very much look forward to taking up his long-standing invitation—not only to Stormont, where I have been before, but to his fishing sector—and the very warm welcome that I know I will receive.
Order.
