I welcome the Minister coming to the House to answer the urgent question, because the argument she is putting forward seems slightly confused.
First, women’s health hubs seem to be working on the whole, and there are lots of them, so why remove the target for everybody to have them if we are already 90% there?
Secondly, many of the hubs seem to be doing good work, and best practice is clearly emerging, so why cancel the target for the programme rather than spread that good practice throughout the system?
I think the broad question from the Opposition is: why remove the targets specifically relating to women from the Government’s agenda going forward?
It feels to many women and to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which has been in contact with me, that that downgrades the status of women in the NHS.
