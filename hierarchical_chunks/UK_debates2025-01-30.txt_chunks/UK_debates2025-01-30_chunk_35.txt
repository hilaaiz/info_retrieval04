On mitigating sector supply, my understanding is there is sufficient supply within the system.
Although the right hon.
Member is absolutely right to raise the point that it was a significant and large producer that was affected, we are confident that supply is secure.
On working with the devolved Administrations, my officials are in regular contact, as I said in my opening statement.
The situation is being constantly monitored.
The right hon.
Member will be familiar with the compensation arrangements because they are the same as when she and her colleagues were in government.
They are designed to control the disease, but of course they are also absolutely important to secure cash flow for farmers.
My recollection from previous bouts of avian influenza is that there were serious problems with delays and with compensation, because farmers who were trying to do a preventive cull of their birds had to wait for an inspection to take place, and if that inspection had not taken place, compensation would not be given.
Therefore, some birds died from avian influenza that should have been culled, and some birds did not die but the compensation was not paid.
I would be grateful if the Minister updated the House on exactly what the new arrangements for compensation will be.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
He will recall the terrible outbreak a few years ago when exactly those questions were raised and, as the shadow Minister, I asked similar questions at the time.
The compensation arrangements were changed by the previous Government in a beneficial way, and I am absolutely confident at the moment that the delays we saw before are not happening.
But he raises an important point: anyone who has a suspicion of an outbreak should report it as soon as possible, and they should not be concerned that they will suffer detriment from so doing.
