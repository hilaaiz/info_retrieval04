The Minister’s Government have changed policy to not issue any new licences for domestic oil and gas, so we will become more dependent on imports at times when solar and wind are not working, unless we can increase nuclear generation.
It is Nuclear Week in Parliament, so what pressure is she putting on the Energy Secretary to make new nuclear an important part of our industrial strategy?
I sit jointly in the Department for Business and Trade and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, so the hon.
Lady can be reassured that I talk to my colleagues and am working with them.
Indeed, I am leading on hydrogen and carbon capture, which is an important part of the mix.
We are clear that nuclear is an important part of our future and that the strongest approach to deliver energy security and bring prices down is to have all the opportunities available to us and to build at pace.
That is why we are trebling our solar, doubling our wind and supporting big nuclear as well as small modular reactors.
She can be reassured that we are putting a strategy in place, which the previous Government failed to do.
What progress his Department has made on developing a steel strategy.
I delighted to tell my hon.
Friend that we are working hard on our steel strategy.
Immediately after we have finished these questions, I will be going to Sheffield to talk to the industry about future demand.
Steel is an important industry for our future, to which we have made a £2.5 billion commitment.
We will ensure that we turn around the decline we saw under the previous Government and deliver a steel industry fit for the future.
The steel industry is an important part of Wolverhampton North East’s heritage and must remain a part of our future.
Will my hon.
Friend outline how the £2.5 billion UK steel strategy and the new steel council will boost competitiveness and secure jobs at Tata’s Steelpark in Wednesfield, which is the UK’s largest processing and distribution centre?
