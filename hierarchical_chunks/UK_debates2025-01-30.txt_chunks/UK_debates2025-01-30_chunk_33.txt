Elsewhere, one of the largest and most modern egg-laying sites in the country has been affected, with more than a million birds being culled.
Given the site’s significant role in processing the UK’s barn egg production, what discussions is the Minister having with the sector to mitigate the impact on supply?
Will he please update us on his discussions with the devolved Governments about introducing similar restrictions to those in England?
Of course birds, and indeed viruses, do not recognise borders.
How is he ensuring that compensation is made without delay, and how much is it costing?
Is the Department keeping the scheme under review, including the loss of profit for farmers and the conservation impacts for zoos housing rare and critically endangered species, such as the Bali starling at Battersea zoo, which I visited this week?
We are also concerned by reports that the avian influenza vaccination taskforce has stalled.
Is that correct and, if so, why?
Finally, DEFRA Ministers— Order.
The shadow Minister is trying my patience.
We have a lot of business to get through today, and time limits are there for a reason.
I call the Minister.
