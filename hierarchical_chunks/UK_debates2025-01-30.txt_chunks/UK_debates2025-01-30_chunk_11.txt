I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, for her defence of her constituency and for her ambitions, which we share.
I believe the report she refers to came out before this Labour Government came to power.
With our new policies and the new drive and ambition from our Secretaries of State for Business and Trade and for Energy Security and Net Zero, we are powering forward with our renewable agenda, and we will make sure that all of our growth driving sectors speak to my hon.
Friend’s area and everyone’s area of the country and drive growth across the board.
