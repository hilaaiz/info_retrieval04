I thank my constituency neighbour for that update.
The previous Government had more than 15 rounds of trade talks with India before the general election, in both India and the UK.
Will the Government ensure that we in the UK gain access to the services market in India, which has previously been denied to UK firms?
That is the key issue in our negotiations.
