I thank my hon.
Friend for her work supporting workers at Stellantis.
I met several of her colleagues and representatives from Stellantis this week, who I meet regularly.
We stand ready to talk to them about whatever they need to remain.
The consultation finished on  24 January  and we await the final decision.
She makes a good point about Luton airport, which I use very often because there are very good train links from Croydon to Luton.
I should say that there are also  good train links from Croydon to Gatwick.
We know that the Secretary of State will be making a decision in due course, but the direction of travel on growth and breaking down barriers was clear in the Chancellor’s speech yesterday.
