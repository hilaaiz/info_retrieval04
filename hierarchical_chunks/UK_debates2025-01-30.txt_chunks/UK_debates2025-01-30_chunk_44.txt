The hon.
Gentleman makes strong points.
I think there is general awareness of, and concern about, what is going on.
It is important to say to people  that, if they have concerns and they see such things, they should report them.
On our work with the devolved Administrations, we have a very strong structure that allows all the devolved Administrations to be involved so that we have a consistent framework.
Again, we rely on the facilities at the Animal and Plant Health Agency, based in New Haw in my constituency, and we thank it for its work.
A few weeks ago, I asked the Minister if he would visit the site with me to see for himself the work that needs to be done and the urgent need for massive investment in the site.
Do we have to wait until the next urgent question or statement before he will take me up on my offer?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his invitation.
I have had numerous invitations.
Last week, I was in Northumberland looking at rural crime, and this week I was at the Fenland SOIL—sustainability, opportunity, innovation, learning—conference.
I will add the hon.
Gentleman’s invitation to my list.
For my daughter’s second birthday, I took her to the wonderful Birdland in Gloucestershire, which has hundreds of different exotic and rare birds.
Could the Minister please tell me how he is going to support that type of business model and how he is going to keep staff and visitors safe?
