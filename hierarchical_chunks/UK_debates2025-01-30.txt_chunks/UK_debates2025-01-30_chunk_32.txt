I thank the Minister for his response.
I regret that the Secretary of State has not made an oral statement on this important matter; particularly in the light of the revelation that a farm worker has been infected with avian influenza, I would have thought that the Secretary of State would have thought to update the House.
However, we have managed to secure this urgent question, for which I am grateful.
On the subject of the farm worker infected with the virus in the west midlands, first, how is this person?
Have they recovered, and has anyone else been infected?
What are the wider risks to human health?
