I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I saw the talent and potential for myself when I visited Exeter in September for Great South West’s annual conference.
I am visiting the region again in a few weeks, because there is huge potential, huge excitement and huge opportunities to grow.
As he knows, there is £1.8 billion from the national wealth fund to invest in our ports.
I am very happy to meet him and others to see what potential we can discuss.
