I thank the Committee Chair for her question.
I think she was congratulating the previous Committee and Chair rather than those who are now in opposition.
I was very pleased to witness some of that work when we were in opposition, and she is absolutely right about it.
The work of many women Members when in opposition, and, to be fair, of many women in the previous Government, have made sure that issues around endometriosis have risen up the agenda; indeed, we had a good debate in the Chamber recently.
We are committed to taking forward the strategy.
We think the health hubs, for example, are doing a good job, but there is a lot of learning to be done on them, and we will continue to do that.
