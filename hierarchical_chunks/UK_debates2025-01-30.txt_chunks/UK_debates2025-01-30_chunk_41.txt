I thank the Chair of the Select Committee, who is absolutely right.
We have heard harrowing accounts in this Chamber of the experiences in Members’ local communities—the situation with wild birds is awful.
Of course, officials and I are constantly in dialogue with those organisations, but the truth is that in the wild bird population there is not much we can do about it.
