I thank my hon.
Friend for his very important question.
I can assure him that an entire apparatus is in place to ensure that all reassurance can be given to the kind of businesses that  the right hon.
Member for Maldon (Sir John Whittingdale)  described.
From an animal welfare point of view, we will ensure that everybody involved in the sector has the kind of  advice and support that is needed.
If my hon.
Friend has colleagues who wish to look at the advice, they should look at the webpages available on Government websites, which are significant and thorough.
If people need advice, they should not hesitate to come to my officials or to me, and we will point them in the right direction.
