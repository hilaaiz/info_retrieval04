I will try to avoid a word salad.
We have heard from various different industrial sectors how important it is to have stable and predictable energy costs.
This month has seen little sun and only intermittent wind, so we have been heavily dependent on imported oil and gas.
Are Ministers in the Department for Business and Trade challenging the Energy Secretary over his policies?
I am disappointed by the hon.
Lady’s approach to this matter, and I am disappointed by the Conservative party’s overall abandonment of previously strongly held views about the need to balance climate change with our economy.
It is a fact that we are moving faster towards renewable energy.
Last year, 50% of our energy came from renewables for the first time.
We are growing them at pace because they are cheaper.
Onshore wind is the cheapest form of energy we have, solar is very cheap and floating offshore wind brings us huge opportunities.
Renewables will bring our costs down and make sure we are energy secure, and they go hand in glove with growth, as the Chancellor set out in her speech yesterday.
