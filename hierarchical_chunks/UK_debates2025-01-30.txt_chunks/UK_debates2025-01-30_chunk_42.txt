Will the Minister clarify how the Government are monitoring the spread of the virus among other species?
The hon.
Lady is absolutely right: we need to be very careful about that.
I can assure her that those are exactly the kinds of discussions that I am having with officials.
We are tracking that and have the technology these days to look closely at what is going on.
