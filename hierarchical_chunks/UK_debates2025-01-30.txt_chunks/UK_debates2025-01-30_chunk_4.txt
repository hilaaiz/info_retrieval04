The hon.
Gentleman has always been a great champion of small businesses in his constituency and in Northern Ireland more generally.
We want the business growth service to complement the support that the Northern Ireland Executive and the Welsh and Scottish Governments already give their businesses, to improve the quality of advice and support available to all businesses in all parts of the UK.
What steps he plans to take to help reduce employment costs.
The Government are pursuing the reforms needed to deliver sustained long-term growth.
Developed and delivered in partnership with business, we have taken significant steps, including launching a consultation on the modern industrial strategy, establishing the national wealth fund, transforming our planning rules, committing to a 10-year infrastructure strategy and introducing the Employment Rights Bill to boost productivity.
We have also added extra protections for small businesses by increasing the employment allowance and freezing the small business rate multiplier.
I think the Minister may have misunderstood my question; I asked how he would reduce employment costs.
The president of the Confederation of British Industry recently said that, because of things like the Employment Rights Bill, employers will be laying people off and will be less likely to employ, and that is before the national insurance tax on employment imposed by this Government.
Does the Minister accept responsibility for the increase in unemployment that we are already seeing?
I think it is something of a stretch to say that a Bill that is not even law yet, most of the provisions of which will not come into force until next year, is driving unemployment already.
I quote back to him what the head of the CBI said yesterday about our growth plan.
He said: “This positive leadership and a…vision to kickstart the economy and boost productivity is welcome.”
