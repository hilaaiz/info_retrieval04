I thank the shadow Secretary of State for her important questions.
First, I reassure her and the House that the individual in question is, in my understanding, making a full recovery, but obviously we want to ensure that no one is put at undue risk.
The advice is clear: the only people at risk are those who are in very close proximity.
People should follow the guidance and advice.
