I do not think anybody would disagree with the comments by  the hon.
Member for Broadland and Fakenham (Jerome Mayhew)  about the redevelopment of the facility  at Weybridge, but I suspect that once avian influenza is in the wild bird population, as it is here, even the best facility in the world will struggle to contain it.
On disease containment, I remember the absolutely heartbreaking experience of walking along beaches in Orkney and seeing dead body after dead body.
Is the Minister engaging with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and other major organisations so that he can at least be aware of the impact on the wild bird population?
