I thank the Government for their strong and fast response, which I know will be a big reassurance for lots of the farming communities impacted.
May I ask the Minister to provide a bit more detail about the support we are giving not just to those who are directly impacted now, but to those who are understandably very deeply concerned about what this may mean for their businesses over the coming months?
