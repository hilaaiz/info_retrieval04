I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing to the House the work that is going on for the Atom Valley development zone, which is incredibly important and exactly what we want to see.
The Mayor of Greater Manchester is to be congratulated for his leadership in this space as well.
I am very interested in the work my hon.
Friend refers to, not least because of the critical minerals strategy we are developing and the graphene work that I know will be under way in the manufacturing  centre hub, so I very much look forward to talking further to him about what is happening and how we can help.
