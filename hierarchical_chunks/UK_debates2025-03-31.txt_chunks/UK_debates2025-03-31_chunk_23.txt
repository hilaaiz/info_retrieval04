I thank the Minister for her response.
In 2015, Baroness May of Maidenhead, the then Home Secretary, accused police forces of “crying wolf” over funding cuts.
In the decade since, police services across the country, such as mine in Gloucestershire, have never truly recovered from her scandalous cuts to their numbers.
Gloucestershire constabulary is one of the worst funded in the country—the victim of an  unfit-for-purpose funding formula.
Last week, the chief constable announced 60 staff cuts as she battles with a £12 million deficit.
Will the Minister meet me and my chief constable to discuss those challenges?
