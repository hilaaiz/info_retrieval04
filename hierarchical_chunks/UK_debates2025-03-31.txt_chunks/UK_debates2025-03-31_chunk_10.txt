I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing to the House’s attention the excellent initiative taking place in Bournemouth.
It is a real example of the results that can be achieved when we get local authorities, businesses and law enforcement all coming together.
I am keen to look carefully at examples such as that of Bournemouth and what is happening in the town centre to see how we can learn from such best practices and they can be disseminated.
