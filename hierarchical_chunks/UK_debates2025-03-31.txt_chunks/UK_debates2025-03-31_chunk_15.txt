I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that vital issue.
Just last month I held a rural crime roundtable in North Yorkshire and met local residents and farmers to discuss this important topic.
Last week, in recognition of the success of the national rural and wildlife crime units, I announced additional funding for both in the next financial year, so that they can continue to support the police in rural areas.
We are also working with the National Police Chiefs’ Council on the next iteration of the rural and wildlife crime strategy.
Later this year we will implement the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023 and put the necessary secondary legislation in place.
Ahead of that, we will publish the Government’s response to the call for evidence on the scope of that legislation.
