I thank the shadow Foreign Secretary for her points.
I am glad she raised Lord Peach because that allows me to put on the record again my tribute to him for all his excellent work as the High Representative; it was a genuine pleasure to work alongside him.
I am also delighted that we now have Dame Karen Pierce, one of our most experienced diplomats, in the role.
She is already playing a crucial role across the region.
As I said, one of her very first visits was to Bosnia, because of the very issues that the shadow Foreign Secretary has outlined.
