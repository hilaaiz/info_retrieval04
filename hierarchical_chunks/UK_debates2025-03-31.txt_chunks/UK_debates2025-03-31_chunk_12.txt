As my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Hertsmere (Sir Oliver Dowden)  has outlined, this weekend we heard the shocking reports that the parents of a nine-year-old girl were arrested by six Hertfordshire police officers and placed in a cell for 11 hours because they complained about their daughter’s primary school on WhatsApp.
At the same time, 270,000 shoplifting cases have been closed without a suspect being identified.
Does the Minister agree that the police should be able to get on with the job of tackling crime on our streets?
Can she comment on whether they were getting their priorities right in that case?
As the shadow Minister will know, this is an operational matter for policing, and it is quite clear that the chief constable and the police and crime commissioner have set out that there will be a review of what happened in that particular case.
What steps her Department is taking to tackle violence against shop workers.
To repeat what I was saying, under the previous Government violence and abuse towards retail workers increased to unacceptable levels.
Everyone has a right to feel safe at their place of work.
Alongside the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers and the Co-op, who have long campaigned for stronger protections for retail workers, we are bringing in through the Crime and Policing Bill a new offence of assaulting a retail worker, to protect those hard-working and dedicated staff who work in stores, and to send a really strong message that violence against retail workers will not be tolerated.
On Friday I visited the central Co-op in Ashbourne, which recently experienced an armed robbery.
Elizabeth and Georgia were working there when the robbery took place and are still deeply affected several months later.
What action are the Government taking to stop violence against shop workers, especially in rural areas where the geographical distances involved often mean that the police take longer to respond?
