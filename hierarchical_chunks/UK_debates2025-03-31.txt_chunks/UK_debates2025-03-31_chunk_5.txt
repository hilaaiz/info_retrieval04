I thank the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee for her questions.
We are currently drawing up a strategy on violence against women and girls, which will be published before the summer recess and will set out the approach that we need to take and the need to reduce domestic abuse, sexual assaults and stalking—the crimes that are most prevalent and of which women are most likely to be the victims, but which we also need to reduce more broadly.
We will set out details on the measures that we will be looking for as part of that strategy.
