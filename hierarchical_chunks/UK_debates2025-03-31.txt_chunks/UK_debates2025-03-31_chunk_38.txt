Lady asks what we are doing.
I have been very clear about the diplomatic efforts that we are taking across the region, working with partners and allies including the United States, the European Union  and members of the Quint.
We continue to work with partners and engage with regional partners, who are absolutely crucial to that stability.
The Foreign Secretary met Croatian Foreign Minister Radman on  24 March , and I spoke to Serbian Foreign Minister Marko Djuric on  27 March , as part of a regular series of engagements that we have been having, including through the Berlin process.

Lady will be pleased to know that we will now be hosting the Berlin process and that preparations for the summit are being led by Dame Karen Pierce.
I assure her that the Foreign Secretary and I have had extensive engagements with regional partners.
I was out in Serbia and Montenegro just a few weeks ago, and I intend to visit the region again soon.

Lady asked about the important role of NATO, alongside EUFOR.
I have referred to EUFOR already.
We continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina’s aspirations for Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.
Through joint training of UK and Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces and our support for reforms, we are helping it strengthen capabilities and enable alignment with NATO standards.
We are working to invest in and strengthen the capabilities of the Bosnia and Herzegovinian armed forces for peacekeeping operations.
Countries that export security are also more secure themselves.
We maintain offices at the NATO headquarters in Sarajevo.
