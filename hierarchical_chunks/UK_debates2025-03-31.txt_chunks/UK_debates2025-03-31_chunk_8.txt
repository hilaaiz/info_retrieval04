The Minister for Local Government and English Devolution recently spoke at an iftar hosted by the European Islamic Centre, which is connected to Jamaat-e-Islami and Abul A’la al-Maududi, the Minister for Social Security and Disability attended the Muslim Council of Britain’s annual dinner, and the Prime Minister hosted Adam Kelwick, an imam who celebrated the  7 October  attacks and told followers to “pray for victory” for Hamas.
Why are the Government  so keen to spend time with and lend legitimacy to organisations and people they say they oppose?
What will the Minister say to the Prime Minister?
We are not, and I do not agree with the proposition that the hon.
Member has made.
All Ministers —of course, including the Prime Minister—take these matters incredibly seriously, and we always engage in the most responsible way.
When the defending democracy taskforce was established, it was proclaimed that its primary focus was to protect the democratic integrity of the United Kingdom.
What work, therefore, has it done on the fact that there is a part of this United Kingdom—namely, Northern Ireland—where the democratic integrity of the United Kingdom has been upended by the fact that, in 300 areas of law, our laws are made not by this Parliament and not by the Stormont Assembly, but by a foreign Parliament: the European Union?
What work has been done to restore democratic integrity to the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland?
I give the hon.
and learned Member an absolute assurance that we work closely with all the devolved Governments on this matter.
In fact, I was in Northern Ireland just recently to discuss this with the Justice Minister.
The work that we are conducting as part of the taskforce is cross-party and designed to ensure that we do everything we possibly can to prevent interference in our democratic processes.
We take the matter seriously, and we will work with others on it.
