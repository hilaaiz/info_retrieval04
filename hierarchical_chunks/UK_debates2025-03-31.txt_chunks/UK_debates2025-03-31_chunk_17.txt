I thank the right hon.
Member for his interest in this subject and for the Westminster Hall debate that he secured last year.
I want to support the police to use live facial recognition safely while  balancing public safety and safeguarding individuals’ rights.
The Home Office invested over £3 million in 2024-25 to develop a small national live facial recognition capability by purchasing and equipping 10 mobile LFR units for deployment later this year.
I have been listening to stakeholders and will outline our plans in the coming months.
