I thank the Minister for that response and welcome the increased co-operation with allies on this vital issue.
It is critical that we stop the dangerous crossings, but without tackling the problem at its source, with aid to tackle famine and conflict and by providing safe legal routes, do we not risk the crisis continuing?
How will the Minister work with colleagues across Government to address those factors to ensure that we tackle the crisis fully?
