called back to Tennessee to help on the Manhattan Project.
After the end of World War II, Milton started at WIVK radio as a chief engineer and proceeded to help set up new stations throughout the South.
He retired in 1993, but continued to work as a consultant for different radio stations and helped tune their towers.
Milton raised four children with his wife Anna Ruth Atkins, and turned 101 years old in March of 2023.
He has served his country and his family well, and the East Tennessee community is thankful for the impact he has had on those who have been fortunate enough to know him.
