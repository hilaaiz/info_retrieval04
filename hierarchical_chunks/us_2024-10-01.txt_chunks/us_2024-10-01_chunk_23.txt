Mr. SESSIONS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Donald Gene Johnson, of Groesbeck, Texas, by presenting him with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His pledge to champion values of support and sacrifice exemplifies American patriotism.
Born in Texas, Donald received his draft notice in October 1965 and joined the Army to serve during the Vietnam War.
He underwent basic training at Fort Carson, Colorado, before being deployed to the front lines in Vietnam.
While overseas, he carried out critical operations vital to his unit's success, such as establishing forward base camps and managing supply runs.
His efforts were essential in maintaining the operational effectiveness of his fellow soldiers under challenging and often perilous conditions.
One fateful night, while stationed at a listening post outside the perimeter, Specialist Johnson and three other soldiers were struck by a mortar round.
Despite being severely injured, he remained composed and took actions that saved lives under extreme adversity.
For his extraordinary courage and selflessness in the face of danger, he was awarded the Purple Heart, a testament to his bravery and dedication.
After returning to Texas, Donald channeled his entrepreneurial spirit into building a successful Pepperidge Farm franchise in Houston.
Upon selling the business, he returned to Limestone County to operate a cattle ranch, applying the same dedication and hard work that characterized his military service.
His commitment to his community remained strong; he drove a school bus for the Groesbeck Independent School District, serving as an inspirational mentor to many young people.
Additionally, he worked as a jailer at the Limestone County Jail, where he continued to positively influence lives through his mentorship.
Donald's military honors include the Purple Heart, the Rifle Sharpshooter qualification, the Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze Service Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.
These accolades reflect his commitment to excellence and the sacrifices he made during his service.
He is part of a remarkable family legacy of service; his four brothers, Charles, Foy, Edwin, and Cecil, also served in the military, each risking their lives for their country.
This collective dedication underscores their character and commitment to the Nation.
I am honored to award Donald Gene Johnson with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His life of service and dedication embodies the spirit of American patriotism, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to his country and community.
