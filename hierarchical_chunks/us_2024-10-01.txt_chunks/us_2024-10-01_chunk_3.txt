Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished service of the Honorable Algenon L. Marbley from my district, who has served the Southern District of Ohio since 1997, after his appointment by President Clinton and unanimous confirmation by the U.S. Senate.
In 2019, Judge Marbley became the first African American from the segregated South to serve as Chief District Judge for the Southern District.
Under his leadership, the Court remained one of the Nation's most productive, even through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2023, the District was ranked in the top 15 most productive federal district courts, and his dedication to justice is unparalleled.
As Chief Judge Marbley celebrates his 70th birthday and concludes his tenure, I extend my deepest gratitude for his service and friendship and wish him continued success in his next chapter.
