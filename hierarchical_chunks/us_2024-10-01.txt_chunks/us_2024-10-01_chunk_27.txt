Mr. SESSIONS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to present Milton Evans Ladnier, of Crockett, Texas, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His service to the Nation and community speaks to the best.
A native Texan, Milton was first called to duty by the United States Army on March 28, 1969, at the young age of 19.
He served during the Vietnam conflict as a helicopter mechanic crew chief in the Central Highlands with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, earning the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, the National Defense Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal.
In the 1990's Milton worked as an appraiser in Harris County and enlisted in the Army National Guard at Ellington Field.
After several years with the Guard, he signed on as a full-time civil service technician and was called to Active Duty in 2006 during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
At the time, he was 55 years old and was assigned as supervisor to thirteen young soldiers in the helicopter engine repair shop.
He received his honorable discharge in 2007.
Milton was awarded the Bronze Star, National Defense Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, and the Armed Services Reserve Medal.
Milton moved to Crockett in 2017, where he immediately became involved with the local American Legion Post 134, serving as Commander two separate terms.
He served as the Houston County Veterans Service Officer for two years and continues to support local veterans.
He was instrumental in renovating the American Legion Post and developed the monthly luncheon for veterans and their families at the Post.
Many days you can find Milton volunteering his time to drive veterans to their medical appointments, as he is always helping others.
The American Legion has awarded him twice as the Veteran of the Year for his ongoing support of local veterans.
It is my honor to award Milton Evans Ladnier with a Congressional Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District.
