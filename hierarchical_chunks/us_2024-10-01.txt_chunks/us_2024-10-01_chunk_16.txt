Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Nicky Nieves is a 2 Paralympian and gold medalist sitting volleyball player for the United States.
She attended Gateway High School in Kissimmee, and during her volleyball career earned All-County Player and Best Attacker of the Year in 2007.
Deciding to transition from collegiate volleyball at Queens College, she joined Team USA in 2011.
Nicky won her first Paralympic gold medal with the team at the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games and her second gold medal at the Paris 2024 Games, helping the team win the program's historic third consecutive gold medal.
Currently, Nicky is finishing her master's in clinical mental health and directing her nonprofit, ``Limitless People Inc.,'' which aims to provide more volleyball opportunities--both sitting and standing.
Through Limitless, Nicky has fed the community of Kissimmee on major holidays and has hosted sitting volleyball clinics and camps to spread the Paralympic movement throughout the state.
