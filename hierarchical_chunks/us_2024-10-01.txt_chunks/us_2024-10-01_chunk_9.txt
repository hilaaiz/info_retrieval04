Mrs. Moss has also made significant contributions through her work as an educator, nurse, and advocate for the aging and disabled.
She made history as the first Black female Board President of the Fort Worth Independent School District.
Her educational background includes an associates degree from Tarrant County Junior College, a license in long-term care administration from El Centro College, a Bachelor of Science in Sociology and Psychology from Texas Wesleyan College, and a master's in Hospital Administration from Texas Woman's University.
Mrs. Moss has served and led on many Tarrant County, State and National Boards.
The couple's unwavering commitment to education paired with their strong focus on giving back to the community has made a lasting impact on many people, particularly their three children: Edmond L. Moss, an accountant; Kimberlyn C. Simpson Moss, a retired nurse and veteran; and Franklin D. Moss Jr., CEO of Franklin & Anthony Tailor/ Clothier.
I am pleased to recognize the enduring contributions of Franklin and Christene Moss's to the Fort Worth community and beyond.
Thank you.
