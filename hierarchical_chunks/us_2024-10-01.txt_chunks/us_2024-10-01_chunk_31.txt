After serving one term as governor, Dr. Camacho retired from public service in 1981 and went into private business.
Dr. Camacho is married to Lourdes Winefreda Ito Pangelinan.
They share seven children: Carla, Mona Lynn, Carlos Patrick, Kevin Frank, Francine, Jiana, and Franklin Luis; four grandchildren: Carlos Joe, Liana Margaret, Lucas Patrick, and Leia Rose.
His own early life experiences as a colonial subject of the Japanese empire and witness to the ravages of war greatly shaped Dr. Camacho's commitment to public service.
His example of learning and service inspires us today and is a legacy he leaves for future generations in the Northern Mariana Islands and beyond.
