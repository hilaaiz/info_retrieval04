Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Northwest Michigan Action Agency for their 50 years of service to the Northern Michigan community.
Since 1974, NMCAA has provided Northern Michigan with community-based service, helping bridge the gap between poverty and self-sustainability by supporting independence and enhancing the quality of life for residents.
Providing assistance for 10 counties across Northwest Michigan, NMCAA has touched countless lives and helped families from across the region find opportunities which due to unfortunate circumstances may have not been available to them otherwise.
During their half century of service, NMCAA has become an anchor for the Northwest Michigan Community.
It is a place providing opportunity for those who need it most and the organization has certainly lived up to their self-stated mission of fostering positive change, improving quality of life, and building stronger and more connected communities.
NMCAA provides a multitude of services for residents, ranging from Housing and Energy Efficiency Services, Homeless Prevention Programs all the way to Economic Security and Child/Family Development initiatives.
Their broad scope of assistance is a credit to the phenomenal staff and volunteers of NMCAA, who work tirelessly yearround to ensure that their impact is felt in the community.
