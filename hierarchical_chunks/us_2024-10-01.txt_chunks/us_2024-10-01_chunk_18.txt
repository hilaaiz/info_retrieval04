Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Revolutionary War Veteran Dr. Eleazer Root on the occasion of the laying of a plaque in his honor at Oak Grove Cemetery located in Manchester, Michigan.
Freedom is not free, and today we pause to remember a man who served his country with honor during the Revolutionary War.
His service to our Nation at the time of its birth is worthy of commendation.
Born in Coventry, Connecticut in July of 1764, Dr. Root first enlisted in the Continental Army as a Private at the tender age of 15.
He was stationed at West Point, New York, where he contributed to the fight for American independence.
Following his military service, Dr. Root moved to Manchester, Michigan not long after its founding in the early 1800s.
He died in 1837 at the age of 72, and Dr. Root's grave was the first at Oak Grove Cemetery.
Doctor Root is remembered for his honorable military service and dedication to our Nation.
He is just one of the few native and adopted Michiganders who fought for our country during the revolution.
It is important for us to honor the veterans of our community who fought for the freedom of our Nation, a value we continue to hold dear today.
We are thankful for the path these soldiers laid out for past, present and future Americans over two centuries ago.
