Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the honorable Dr. Eleazor Root as he is memorialized in Manchester, Michigan.
We join with Americans everywhere in extending our thanks to the Huron Valley Chapter of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, Ypsilanti Chapter Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Sarah Caswell Angell Chapter Daughters of the American Revolution for their work dedication to honoring Dr. Root in the run up to Nation's 250th anniversary.
Today and every day, we honor the brave patriots we lost in the fight for our independence.
We are grateful for their military service and their willingness to fight for the freedom and liberty that we enjoy today.
