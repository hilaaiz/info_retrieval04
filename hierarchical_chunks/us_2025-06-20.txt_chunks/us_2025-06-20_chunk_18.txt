strategist, certified crisis communicator, and former news anchor, she is the founder and CEO of Eleven 11 Communications--a public relations firm rooted in the values of service, inclusion, and impact.
Maria Isabel's career began in media at an early age, with a passion for using her voice to inform and uplift.
She made history as the first Latina to anchor a solo evening newscast in Central Florida, serving as anchor of Telemundo's Noticiero Telemundo Orlando at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. Her work in broadcast journalism gave visibility to stories that were too often overlooked--highlighting the struggles, achievements, and resilience of Florida's Latino communities.
Determined to shape narratives from beyond the anchor desk, Maria Isabel launched Eleven 11 Communications, where she has spent over a decade helping public agencies, corporations, and elected officials develop inclusive strategies that reach and reflect the communities they serve.
Her portfolio spans civic engagement, health equity, crisis response, and culturally relevant outreach campaigns.
Following Hurricane Maria, she became a leading voice for displaced Puerto Ricans, using media and advocacy to connect families with life-saving resources.
She has been named ``Ignitor of the Year'' by the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and recognized by the University of Puerto Rico--her alma mater--as one of its most distinguished communications alumni.
She has served on several influential boards, including the City of Orlando Municipal Planning Board and the Adult Literacy League, and currently sits on the boards of United Arts and the Elle Collective at Seminole State College, where she champions women-owned businesses and the next generation of leaders of color.
Based in Central Florida, Maria Isabel continues to lead with vision and heart.
Her work centers Latino voices in the public conversation, not only ensuring they are heard, but that they help shape the future.
A trusted strategist, changemaker, and proud Puerto Rican, Maria Isabel Sanquirico is building a more informed, inclusive, and empowered community--one story at a time.
