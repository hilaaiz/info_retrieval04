Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Patrina M. Lawrence is a dynamic and accomplished executive who has made a lasting impact on Florida's Ninth Congressional District through her leadership in behavioral health and social services.
As the founder and chief executive officer of Serving Children and Reaching Families (SCARF), a community-based mental health organization headquartered in Kissimmee, Florida, 
Ms. Lawrence has led efforts to deliver high-quality, culturally responsive, and traumainformed care to children and families across Central Florida since 2013.
Guided by the belief that ``safety and security don't just happen-- they are the result of collective consensus and public investment,'' as Nelson Mandela once said, 
Ms. Lawrence has dedicated her career to building systems that protect and uplift the most vulnerable.
Through SCARF, she has expanded access to mental health services, secured funding from the Department of Juvenile Justice, the Department of Health, and Osceola County Schools, and fostered long-standing partnerships with the Department of Children and Families and regional managing entities.
Through an eight-year partnership with the Florida Department of Children and Families, 
Ms. Lawrence was instrumental in creating a diversion program that has helped strengthen families and successfully diverted over 500 children annually from entering the foster care system.
A licensed clinical social worker and seasoned clinician, Ms. Lawrence has provided direct care and clinical oversight to hundreds of clients.
She has authored SCARF's operational policies and training curricula, helping to elevate standards across Florida's behavioral health workforce.
Her work has not only improved outcomes but also ensured service fidelity and compliance with state regulations.
