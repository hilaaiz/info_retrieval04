Mr. MESSMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to give my personal congratulations to the Jasper Indiana High School Girls' Tennis team for becoming the IHSAA State finals champions.
In the stunning final four match, our Wildcats won 4-1, earning the girls' tennis team their first ever State title, and the first State title for any girls' sports team at Jasper High School.
Thanks to these great athletes for showing the world their formidable Hoosier/Jasper spirit.
Congratulations again to the Wildcats and to their head Coach Scott Yarbrough, who led this great group to their historic win.
