Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the work that Literacy KC has done to improve literacy rates throughout Missouri's Fifth Congressional District.
Since 1985, Literacy KC has offered hope to people in challenging situations and acted as a springboard for individuals that receive their services, propelling them to new heights.
Whether helping students obtain their GEDs, study for citizenship exams, or pursue job-specific certifications, their services have left an indelible mark on our community, bringing great meaning, fulfillment, and empowerment to the lives of thousands.
As we mark Literacy KC's 40th anniversary this year, I am proud to commemorate their work and champion their mission of literacy for all.
