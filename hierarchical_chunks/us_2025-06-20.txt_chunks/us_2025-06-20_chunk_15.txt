Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ms. Lillie Connet, for her work as an intern serving in my D.C. office.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her hard work and recognize the meaningful contributions she has made to the office this summer.
Lillie is from Hendersonville, North Carolina, and attends the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Lillie is entering her third year at Chapel Hill where she is studying Political Science.
Interns work with staff to serve constituents in North Carolina's 11th congressional district.
Lillie was chosen from a competitive pool and impressive work ethic.
It was a pleasure to work with Lillie, and I am so proud to have had such an intelligent and ambitious intern representing my office.
Lillie exemplified the spirit of public service and represents the best that our Nation has to offer.
I congratulate Lillie on the successful completion of her internship and thank her on behalf of the people.
