Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home located in El Paso, Texas.
The Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home opened its doors to veterans, their spouses, and Gold Star parents in 2005 to provide longterm care for those in need of specialty care.
Ambrosio Guillen Home has provided quality and outstanding care to thousands of distinguished veterans, ensuring that a welcoming, safe, and enjoyable stay is provided.
The care center focuses on medical and social needs, along with treatment plans that prioritize creativity and expression.
I am incredibly thankful to the medical professionals and staff of the Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Home for their dedication and tireless work to provide care and attention to our veterans and their families.
The long-term care facility would not be what it is today without them.
I ask all Members to join me today in honoring the Ambrosio Guillen Texas State Veterans Home for their 20 years of service and their profound support to our Texas Veterans and families.
