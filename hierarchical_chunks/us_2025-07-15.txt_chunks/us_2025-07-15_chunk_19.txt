Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, one of the most commendable milestones a young man can reach is earning the rank.
This past weekend, I had the distinct honor of congratulating Robert Corcoran on achieving this prestigious award.
Robert's journey began in 2012 when he earned his first Cub Scout rank.
Over the past decade, through dedication, perseverance, and strong character, he climbed the ranks and ultimately attained the highest honor.
Along the way, Robert earned 34 merit badges, including the Light of Christ Award, a testament to his deep and abiding faith in our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
For his Eagle Scout project, Robert demonstrated compassion and creativity by upcycling 31 insulated coolers into feral cat shelters.
These shelters were distributed through the Homeward Bound Pet Adoption Center, providing warmth and protection to South Jersey's stray cat population during the harsh winter months.
I congratulate Robert on this remarkable achievement.
With his unwavering faith, tireless work ethic, and heart for service, there is no doubt in my mind, he will thrive in all his future endeavors.
God bless Robert and God bless our United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
