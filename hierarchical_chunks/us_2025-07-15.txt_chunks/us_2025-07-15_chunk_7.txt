Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and recognize the Minnesota Frisbee Association (MFA) on their 50th anniversary.
Since their founding on July 19, 1975, the Minnesota Frisbee Association has been recognized nationally and internationally as one of the most innovative and successful flying disc clubs.
The Minnesota Frisbee Association has been a trailblazer in Minnesota, building a foundation on the principles of education, communication, community, and competition.
They created the MFA Sport Development Grant Program to educate, expand, and increase accessibility to the sport across Minnesota.
As a result, the grants have created a boom in frisbee infrastructure, programing, and organizational support across the state.
The Minnesota Frisbee Association has also partnered with sports teams such as the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings, and Minnesota's ultimate frisbee team, Wind Chill.
They have leveraged these relationships to engage enthusiasts across the state, host local, national, and international competitions, and create a lasting and dedicated community among neighbors and athletes.
Members of the Association can be found competing with their friends and neighbors, or in the Hall of Fame for their contributions to the sport.
This dedication to the flying disc community is seen off the field--they engage and uplift their neighbors by donating and fundraising for various local and national charitable causes.
Minnesota Frisbee Association is an example of dedication and passion not only to the sport, but also to their community.
Please join me in celebrating the enduring achievements of Minnesota Frisbee Association throughout their 50 years.
