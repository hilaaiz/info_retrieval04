Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Daniel McClave, whose extraordinary commitment and character have earned him the highest honor in the Boy Scouts of America, the Eagle Scout.
Daniel began his Scouting journey twelve years ago, steadily advancing through the Cub Scout ranks, achieving the rank of Scout in 2019, before his resilience, dedication, and selfless service led to the achievement of Eagle Scout this past December.
Throughout his time in Scouting, Daniel earned an impressive 41 merit badges and was awarded four Eagle Palms-- a clear reflection of his extraordinary determination to exceed expectations and lead by example.
For his Eagle Scout project, Daniel transformed a storage room at Clayton High School into a fully functional and accessible food bank, ensuring that students and families in need had a reliable source of support and nourishment.
Even after achieving the rank of Eagle, Daniel's service did not stop.
He has continued to give back by serving as an Assistant Scoutmaster and Merit Badge Counselor, guiding and mentoring the next generation of Scouts with the same wisdom, integrity, and leadership that defined his own journey.
I congratulate Daniel on this outstanding achievement.
His leadership, generosity, and commitment to his community are inspiring.
My district and the Boy Scouts of America are better because of young men like him.
God bless Daniel and God bless our United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
