Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Noah Sarnoff, an exceptional student-athlete from my district who has been awarded the Olympiad Student Athlete by the Jewish War Veterans.
Established in 1972, this award honors the memory of the 11 Israeli athletes tragically killed during the Munich Olympics and celebrates the academic and athletic excellence of remarkable high school students.
Noah exemplifies those values.
A proud representative of Vineland High School, he has consistently excelled both in the classroom and in athletics, balancing a demanding academic schedule with a standout athletic career.
On the soccer field, Noah is a four-year varsity player and two-year team captain.
He leads with talent, integrity, and a spirit of sportsmanship that sets him apart.
He treats teammates and opponents with respect, leads by example, and represents his school and community with pride.
His lasting impact comes not only from his performance, but from the way he uplifts and inspires those around him.
Noah truly embodies the spirit and values that the Olympiad Award was created to honor.
I congratulate Noah, and thank him for making South Jersey proud.
God bless Noah and God bless our United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
