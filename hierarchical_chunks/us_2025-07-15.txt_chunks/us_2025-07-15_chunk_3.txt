Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Fulton United Soccer Club in Gloversville, New York and congratulate them on their fifty-year anniversary.
The Fulton United Soccer Club is a nonprofit soccer league that has given students from Pre-K to 7th grade an opportunity to play soccer since 1975 and currently has 544 children signed up to participate in the club's spring season.
Students are coached in a wide range of soccer skills from teamwork to advanced ball coordination by parent volunteers, many of whom were players themselves.
The legacy of this recreational soccer league is truly admirable and contributes to our district through its commitment to providing athletic opportunities to our youth, which is made possible by the enthusiasm and generosity of members of our community.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I would like to acknowledge and appreciate the Fulton United Soccer Club for its tremendous positive impact on so many children in our communities for so many years.
