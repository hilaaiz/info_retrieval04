CEO Group's Lifetime Achievement Award.
Michael is a Managing Partner at Testa
Heck Testa & White, P.A., and has spent more than five decades building a legacy of legal excellence and public service.
A certified civil and criminal trial attorney, he has been named to the lists of New Jersey Super Lawyers and Top Ten Lawyers more than ten times each-- an extraordinary testament to his professional reputation and courtroom skill.
But Michael's impact goes far beyond the courtroom.
He has dedicated his life to serving the people of South Jersey through various municipal and educational roles, including as solicitor for Buena Municipal Authorities Association, Deerfield Township, and Rowan College.
His service on the boards of the Rehabilitation Hospital of South Jersey, Sun National Bank, and the Landis Theatre Foundation reflects a deep commitment to strengthening local institutions and opportunities.
Michael's legacy is not only defined by his distinguished legal career but also by his selfless dedication to civic leadership, education, and charitable causes throughout Cumberland County.
I congratulate Michael on this wellearned Lifetime Achievement Award, and thank him for his decades of service and commitment to South Jersey.
May God bless Michael Testa, Sr., and may God bless the United States of America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.
