Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Zuni Olla Maidens for the critical role they play in Zuni culture, establishing themselves as ambassadors for all Pueblo communities and proving that traditions are not only necessary for the soul but all future generations.
The Zuni Olla Maidens perform a delicate dance that includes jars or ollas balanced on top of their heads.
It is breathtaking to watch.
For this beautiful dance, they have been rightfully honored as 2024 National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellows.
The dance brings together the beauty of the music together with colors and jewelry and clothing to bring beauty to our world.
There is a power in this ceremony that flows before the singing, the drums and the rattles.
The Zuni songs remind us how small we are in this world and that we need to remember the origins and culture of our people and our homes.
I am honored to recognize the significance of these matriarchs.
Where there are powerful women, there are powerful families and communities.
Let the traditions of the Zuni people ring forever in the halls of Congress.
