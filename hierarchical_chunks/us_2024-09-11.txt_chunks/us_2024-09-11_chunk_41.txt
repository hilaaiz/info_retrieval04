local organizations dedicated to serving and empowering Latino and Latina students and the community at-large.
During Hispanic Heritage Month, I am thrilled to recognize the efforts of leaders, like Lisa, whose service to others strengthens our unique and diverse community.
I'm so grateful for residents of California's 49th Congressional District who dedicate their lives to the betterment of our community, and I'm proud to honor Lisa Montes as my Constituent of the Month.
