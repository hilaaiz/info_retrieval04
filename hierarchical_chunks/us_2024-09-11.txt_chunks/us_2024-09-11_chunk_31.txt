Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jacksonville's City Council President, Randy White for 70 stellar years on this planet Earth.
A lifelong public servant, Councilman White embodies the spirit of Northeast Florida.
Councilman White is a family man with two children and 5 grandchildren.
However, his 32-year career with the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department shows that he views the entirety of Jacksonville as his family.
After three decades of putting out fires and rescuing cats from trees, one might think that Councilman White would be tired.
But no.
Instead, he championed the growth of Cecil Field and public safety in Jacksonville.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in commending Councilman Randy White for his decades of public service.
Jacksonville is truly a much better place because.
Happy Birthday.
