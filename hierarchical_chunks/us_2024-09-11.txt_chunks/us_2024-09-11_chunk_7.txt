Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life and legacy of Albert J. ``Skip'' Gazy of Niagara Falls, NY.
On September 3, 2024, Albert J. ``Skip'' Gazy, 95, of Niagara Falls, NY, passed away peacefully at Our Lady.
Born and raised in Niagara Falls, he was the son of the late Nasri and Victoria (Jacob) Gazy, and the devoted husband of Ramona Gazy, whom he married on June 15, 1968.
Albert served proudly in the United States National Guard.
He worked alongside his brothers at Gazy Brother's Texaco Station until it closed in 1981, later retiring after many years As a passionate boxing enthusiast, Albert boxed at the Niagara Falls Boys Club in his youth.
Known for his sharp sense of humor, Albert found great joy in bringing laughter to those around him.
His greatest joy, however, was spending time with his family, especially his three beloved granddaughters.
Albert was preceded in death by his wife, Ramona, but survived by his children, Monique (Keith) Crossley and Louis DalPorto; his granddaughters, Danielle DalPorto, Samantha DalPorto, and Elise Gazy; daughter-in-law Joanne DalPorto; as well as numerous nieces, nephews, loved ones and friends.
As we remember Albert ``Skip'' Gazy, we grieve the loss of a dedicated husband, father, and grandfather and a beloved member of our community.
