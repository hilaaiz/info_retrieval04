Mr. Massini first joined Penn State Health in 2015 as chief financial officer for Milton S. Hershey Medical Center before being promoted to executive vice president, chief financial officer, and chief administrative officer for Penn State Health.
Throughout his tenure at Penn State Health, the system has grown significantly, 11 developed strategic partnerships, and made investments in expanding the system's reach across South Central Pennsylvania.
These investments included the development of a hospital in Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District, the Lancaster Medical Center, which opened in October 2022.
I appreciated the opportunity to visit this and other Penn State Health facilities in our district to learn about the great work they are doing to serve patients.
I have appreciated 
Mr. Massini's feedback and perspective on federal policies and the impact they have on residents of Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.
