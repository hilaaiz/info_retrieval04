Mr. CRANE.
Mr. Speaker, last week, contestants competed in the 72nd Annual Miss Navajo Nation Pageant in my district.
To become Miss Navajo, contestants participate in a rigorous weeklong annual competition, which requires contestants to demonstrate proficiency in both the Navajo and English languages, knowledge of Navajo culture and beliefs, business interviews, contemporary talents, and traditional skills such as sheep butchering and preparing traditional foods.
I'd like to recognize Amy Naazbah Reeves-Begaye, who has served as Miss Navajo for the past year.
I met Amy last year during her first trip to the U.S. Capitol and learned about her experience and background and the process of becoming Miss Navajo.
We've had a few chances to connect throughout the years and I've been impressed with her hard work and professionalism.
She's been a strong leader and advocate for Navajo history and culture.
I thank Amy for her leadership as Miss Navajo over the last year.
I wish her the best in her future endeavors and know that she will continue to make the Navajo Nation proud.
