Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, when I was a boy, I thought that heroes were imaginary characters who wore capes or masks that hide their secret identity.
As I grew older, I came to realize that there are heroes around us every day: police, firefighters, first responders, and of course, our men and women who serve in the armed forces.
Twenty-three years ago today, when our Nation and this city were attacked by pure evil, the world saw that America is made of heroes, The world watched as we came together to search, rescue, pray and grieve together.
Heroes by trade and heroes by choice answered the call across the land.
That's why today, in the town of Orange Park in the free state of Florida, you will see hundreds of Star-Spangled Banners flying to recognize the heroes who protect us every day.
Flags for Heroes is not just an event, it's a movement.
The Rotary Club of Orange Park Sunrise, led by President Duane Mallicoat, has put together this incredible display to honor men and women who know the true meaning of being a hero.
Each of these flags is individually dedicated to a hero who has personally touched the life of someone in our community.
Today, as we remember one of the great tragedies in American history, I encourage my colleagues to honor the heroes who protected us then and protect us still today.
