I thank my right hon.
Friend for recognising how important this is in farming communities such as mine.
This is crucial, and we have legislation in place, some of which many farmers find quite onerous, to protect the biosecurity of their livestock and land.
It is particularly relevant in my constituency, which has wetlands and bird sanctuaries.
