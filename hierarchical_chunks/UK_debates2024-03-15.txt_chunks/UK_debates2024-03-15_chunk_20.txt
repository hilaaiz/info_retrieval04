I welcome that clause 4 states that a movement is not non-commercial if there are more than five animals per vehicle.
That is very important.
Many institutions and charities wanted the figure to be three per vehicle, but five per vehicle is an awful lot better than 20 per vehicle, because people were picking up passengers and saying, “These pets are with these passengers on board.”
The five animals per vehicle rule will be a game changer.
