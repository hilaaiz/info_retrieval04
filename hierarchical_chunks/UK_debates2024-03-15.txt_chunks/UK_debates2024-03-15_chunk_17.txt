It is a privilege and an honour to speak in this vital debate.
I declare my strong personal and professional interest as a veterinary surgeon and a fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.
I strongly support the Bill.
I have had to frantically rewrite the introduction to my speech, having heard my colleagues name-check their pets.
I know that my two lovely dogs, Poppy and Juno, are following the debate closely, so I now have to name-check them.
They would never forgive me if I did not, and I am sure that they would punish me by rolling in something unspeakable.
We are a nation of animal lovers.
Animals provide us with so much companionship, and help our physical and mental wellbeing.
I commend my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  for driving forward this important Bill and colleagues across the House for supporting this important area of legislation over many years.
I also commend many charities, institutions and organisations.
The British Veterinary Association, Dogs Trust—I mention specifically Paula Boyden, its veterinary director, who has done so much work on this issue—Cats Protection, Blue Cross, Battersea, the RSPCA, Four Paws, the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation and the veterinary surgeon Marc Abraham have done so much on this issue.
The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee has taken a close interest in this area for many years, and we have run various inquiries in recent years.
One was about moving animals across borders, and we have a current inquiry on pet welfare and abuse, which deals with a lot of the issues that we are discussing today.
We had an emergency special session this week on issues facing the veterinary sector, and we looked at biosecurity and animal welfare as well.
