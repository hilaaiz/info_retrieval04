I welcome the fact that this Bill is about dogs, cats and ferrets, because it is important that we encompass all those animals.
I also welcome the fact that the Bill will increase the minimum age on importation to six months.
I note that some measures are not in the Bill, but also that we want to get this legislation on the statute book as soon as possible.
I hope that the Government will bring in secondary legislation to add things as and when necessary.
We need to keep the option open for future secondary legislation to include things such as reinstating the rabies titer checks and increasing the post-rabies vaccination wait time to 12 weeks.
Such measures would help to reinforce the increase in the minimum age to six months.
