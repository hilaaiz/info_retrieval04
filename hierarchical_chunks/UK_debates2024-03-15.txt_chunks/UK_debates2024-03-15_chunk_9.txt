Some protections are difficult to put in place, and I have had long discussions with chicken and wildfowl breeders in West Lancashire about the things they have to do to protect our nation’s biosecurity.
We need to ensure there is continuing awareness of the legislation because, obviously, parasitic infections take no notice of borders.
As I said in my speech, this is not covered by the Bill, and the British Veterinary Association is quite comfortable that it is not fully included and  that the EFRA Committee is continuing its work in  this area.
