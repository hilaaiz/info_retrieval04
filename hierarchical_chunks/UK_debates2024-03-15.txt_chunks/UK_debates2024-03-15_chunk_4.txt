I thank my hon.
Friend for his considered intervention and agree wholeheartedly that we need to make sure that public information and education is improved.
Many people do not understand the impact and possible implications of taking a young puppy or kitten so early.
They often do this out of the goodness of their heart, and with the best intentions of wanting to look after a young puppy or kitten or get one for their children, but we need to ensure that people are aware of the long-term and often permanent damage that can be done to young puppies and kittens in this way.
By removing the ability to import puppies and kittens under the age of six months, we can likely remove the incentive for these animals to be stripped from their mothers at a critically young age and thus reduce the numbers of puppies and kittens suffering from the health and welfare consequences of premature separation.
