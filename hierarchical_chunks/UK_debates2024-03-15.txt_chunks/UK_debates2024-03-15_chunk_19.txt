I hugely welcome the change to the policy on heavily pregnant animals.
On the EFRA Committee over the last few years, we have taken harrowing evidence of the   awful trade in heavily pregnant animals being shipped into this country to give birth and then shipped back out again, sometimes with fresh suture wounds.
It has been awful and harrowing to hear that evidence.
Since 2019, Dogs Trust has taken in 168 pregnant dogs that have been transported.
Currently, it is not permitted to transport dogs and cats in the last 10% of pregnancy.
It is difficult to assess when that is, so including the last third of pregnancy in the ban is a very important step.
We need to keep a watching brief on whether unscrupulous traders are flipping between the non-commercial and commercial movement of animals, and whether we need to act on the commercial importation of pregnant animals as well.
We have taken evidence showing that there are bad people shipping animals in.
Over recent years, these unscrupulous traders have been switching between commercial and non-commercial movement, and when the authorities move one way, they move the other.
We need to keep a watching brief on this.
