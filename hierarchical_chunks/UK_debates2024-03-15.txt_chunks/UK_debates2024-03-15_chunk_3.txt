The Bill will ban the import of puppies and kittens under six months and dogs and cats that are mutilated or heavily pregnant.
It will also address the abuse of non-commercial rules that compromise animal welfare and biosecurity by making it more difficult and less profitable for traders to fraudulently import animals for sale under the disguise of owners travelling with their pets.
The Bill also addresses the issue of commercial imports being disguised as non-commercial movements  by amending the rules that govern the non-commercial movements of dogs, cats and ferrets into Great Britain from third countries.
The puppy trade has become a multimillion-pound, transnational industry, with UK sales of up to 2 million puppies annually and a value of £3 billion.
However, 50% of the industry is either illegal or unlicensed and off the enforcement radar.
Of that, half originates from animals coming from outside the UK.
According to the Animal and Plant Health Agency, in 2023, more than 500 landings of dogs and cats were intercepted at the port of Dover and found to be non- compliant with import requirements.
Of those, 116 puppies and kittens were quarantined for being below the legally required minimum age for import.
That data does not include animals detained at airports or found inland.
We cannot know the true extent of puppy smuggling operations, so those figures likely capture only a small proportion of the animals smuggled into the country.
Ferrets are included in the Bill, because dogs, cats and ferrets are in the same category for rabies risk.
I have not had strong representations from the ferret community, but I would like to mention on the record the ferret of  the right hon.
and learned Member for Banbury (Victoria Prentis) , who was the Minister for the original Bill.
Her gorgeous ferret, Roulette, is no longer with us, but I know that the now Attorney General has previously ensured that references to many of her much-loved pets are recorded in this place, and I am delighted to remember Roulette today.
While not many ferrets have made my inbox, I have done much to support the work of our fantastic animal welfare charities on puppy and kitten smuggling, so I will focus on their travel arrangements.
Pet animals can be brought into the UK from EU member states through two different schemes.
One is for the travel of owners with pets and the other is for the commercial import of pet animals.
Under the EU pet travel scheme, or PETS, vaccinated and microchipped dogs, cats and ferrets are allowed to travel between EU countries for non-commercial reasons, as long as they have a pet passport and have complied with all the requirements of the scheme, which include a rabies vaccination.
The current pet travel scheme is designed to allow a maximum of five pets to travel with their owner rather than for the commercial movement of animals intended for sale as pets.
Under the scheme, pet owners must fill in a declaration confirming that they will not sell or transfer the ownership of the pet.
An approved transport company must be used for the travel of the pets, unless travelling between the UK and Ireland, where a private boat or plane can be used.
Although I understand that the pet travel scheme was created to make it easy for owners to take their family pets on holiday with them, the system has been abused by unscrupulous traders.
Traders have taken advantage of the scheme’s simple set-up to illegally import thousands of puppies for sale, making a huge profit at the cost of welfare.
The most common method of attempting to smuggle puppies into Great Britain is by bringing them in under the pet travel scheme when they are, in fact, being imported for commercial sale and should instead be subject to the requirements of the Balai directive and the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011.
Most of all, I highlight the great work that the pet charities have done to raise this issue.
Dogs Trust exposed the cruel puppy smuggling trade in 2014 and has been pushing for changes to the law to help stop it ever since.
The Dogs Trust puppy pilot scheme was set up in 2015 to aid the interception of illegally imported puppies by APHA at the ports and to provide care and rehabilitation for them until they find loving new homes.
Since then, it has cared for more than 2,000 puppies.
As part of the Dogs Trust puppy smuggling taskforce, I first experienced the documentary and identity checks that currently operate at the border.
I saw for myself the tactics that smugglers employ to avoid detection.
I thank Dogs Trust for all its hard work in campaigning on this issue and for working with me on the Bill’s progress, through the roundtable and the event this Wednesday to discuss their recent “Tragic Tales and the Decade of Delay” campaign, which featured four real-life case studies of dogs who have been helped by the puppy pilot.
Special thanks goes to my local Dogs Trust site in North Devon between Ilfracombe and Braunton, which does exceptional work to rehome dogs locally.
I also thank the RSPCA for its work on this issue and for its #ForPupsSake campaign, especially during the pandemic when interest in getting a puppy sky-rocketed.
The campaign called for a stop to illegal puppy imports and highlighted how smuggled puppies can cost the owner more than they think.
On behalf of the fluffy, furry kittens, I would like to thank Cats Protection, which published its 2023 “Cats and their Stats” survey.
It found that 3% of the cats obtained in the 12 months preceding the survey were from abroad, equating to 50,000 cats.
It is unclear what conditions those cats were subjected to during travel.
There have been significant changes in the cat market in the past five years, with a big rise in pure bred and pedigree cats.
Of the cats obtained in the past 12 months, 42% were pedigree and pure bred cats, compared with 17% five years ago.
It is likely that many of the imported cats are pedigree.
Having had a cat while I was living overseas, I know that cats are extremely stressed by transportation over long distances, which in turn can supress their immune systems so that their risk of infectious disease and other stress-related illness is markedly increased by importation.
Vet charities, such as the British Veterinary Association, have also raised directly with me the significant threat posed to biosecurity by the large number of smuggled puppies entering the UK.
Although it is not in scope of the Bill, I hope that raising the issue is a first step and that the Department will take forward those concerns.
Other charities, such as Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, FOUR PAWS and the Kennel Club, have all done invaluable work to campaign on the issue.
I thank them all today.
Moving on to the Bill and the measures that will be enacted through primary legislation, clause 4 will reduce the number of animals that can travel under non-commercial rules from five per person to five per vehicle, or three per foot or air passenger.
The charities would have preferred three animals per vehicle, as their research shows that over 97% of pet owners have three or fewer dogs.
However, the reduction is a significant and welcome step to tackle the illegal smuggling of pets.
The non-commercial rules are intended to make it easier for genuine pet owners to travel.
Unscrupulous traders  fraudulently claim ownership of several pets that they are actually importing for sale.
They do that because the requirements for owners travelling with pets are less stringent.
The Bill reduces the number of dogs, cats and ferrets that can be brought into Great Britain non-commercially.
Reducing that number is proportionate and takes into consideration other pets owned by the household that may also travel.
Article 5A in clause 4(5) ensures that when a non-commercial movement of a dog, cat or ferret is carried out by an authorised person, it may only take place within five days of the movement of the owner.
There is evidence that the ability for a pet to travel with an authorised person under the non-commercial rules is being used as a loophole to bring in animals that should be moved under the commercial import regime, and therefore subject to more stringent requirements for sale or transfer of ownership.
The new measures will ensure that pets are moved under the owner’s direct responsibility or, where the pet animal cannot be moved at the same time as the owner, under the responsibility of a person authorised by the owner and within five days of the movement of the owner.
An authorised person is one who has authorisation in writing from the owner to carry out the non-commercial movement of the pet animal on their behalf.
This will also ensure that only an owner of a pet can sign a declaration that  a movement is non-commercial.
This will stop non-commercial routes being used as a loophole by traders.
Movements that are not within five days will require the dog, cat or ferret to be brought in as a commercial import, rather than a non-commercial movement.
On the measures to be enacted through secondary legislation, the Bill contains an enabling power to make regulations on the bringing of dogs, cats or ferrets into the United Kingdom for the purpose of promoting their welfare.
The first regulations that can be made in relation to dogs and cats in Great Britain under that enabling power have been outlined on the face of the Bill to provide reassurance of the Government’s intention to lay the measures through secondary legislation.
The enabling powers provide the opportunity for the Government to gather further evidence and discuss the proposals with stakeholders and the public in order to develop the new restrictions effectively.
The powers will enable the Government to tackle low welfare imports dynamically.
They will allow us the flexibility to address known issues quickly, but also act to close down emerging practices, including those attempting to circumvent previous restrictions.
The Government will use that power alongside the other powers in the Bill.
Subsections (2) and (3) to clause 1 introduce prohibitions that restrict the commercial import and non-commercial movement into Great Britain of puppies and kittens under six months.
We are still seeing high volumes of smuggled puppies—dogs under six months which do not comply with current animal health rules and are landed in Great Britain for the purpose of commercial sale—as well as other low-welfare movements and imports of pet animals.
I understand the Kennel Club’s concerns about genetic diversity and rescue dogs that are brought into the country at the age of four months.
However, the need for a six-month minimum age is due to the practicalities of identifying the age of a dog or a cat that can come into the UK: at six months old, the majority of puppies  and kittens will have a full set of permanent incisors, canines and premolars, and can therefore be aged more accurately.
The measure will enable the identification of puppies and kittens that are being moved at young ages and are thus at risk of low welfare.
The prohibition is intended to prevent the import of under-age puppies and kittens by increasing the minimum age from 15 weeks to six months.
To illustrate the importance of that, I want to talk about Bruce, who is available after today’s sitting for photos in room W3, if you would like to meet him, Mr Speaker.
Bruce highlights the need for a change to the minimum age.
He is a French bulldog who was seized at the border at just 10 weeks old alongside three of his siblings, who had all endured a journey in cramped and squalid conditions over thousands of miles from Bulgaria in 2018.
Ten weeks is well under the 15 weeks that puppies must have reached to legally enter the UK.
Bruce and his siblings were found in a poor condition, infested with worms and severely underweight.
All four of the dogs weighed roughly 2.8 kg, which is half the expected weight of French bulldogs of their age.
Their passports were faked, with at least three claiming that the dogs had been wormed before they were even born.
The dishonest traders claimed that Bruce and his siblings were all their own pets.
Upon seizure, however, Dogs Trust staff were able to find evidence of all four dogs being advertised for sale online.
Fortunately for Bruce, the Dogs Trust was able to take him in and care for him until he could find his forever home.
Bruce has now been rehomed responsibly through the Dogs Trust.
He is a very cute French bulldog.
Some of these dogs are bred for fashion, and the Kennel Club, along with other animal charities and vets, has highlighted the health and welfare issues that can be associated with such breeds.
Although the issues of breathing and flat-faced dogs are about genetic mutilation and are therefore not in scope of the Bill, I would like to highlight the need still to safeguard dogs of this type that are already in the country.
We must look at what else we can do to help with genetic mutilations, which cause our pets to suffer.
Last week, it was reassuring to hear about Crufts’s respiratory function grading—RFG—scheme for brachycephalic dogs, such as French bulldogs, pugs and bulldogs.
It was great to meet Dr Jane Ludlow, the vet who has devised the scheme, which assesses dogs with a stethoscope.
The dog exercises for three minutes, and the process is then repeated.
We saw at first hand that the test is quick and straightforward, and it assigns an RFG rating to each dog.
Those with the lowest grades should not breed.
Far too many flat-faced dogs have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, known as BOAS, which can chronically impair the ability of the dog to breathe normally and carry out everyday tasks.
All the dogs at Crufts had the option of being tested, which becomes compulsory next year, and all those that win are tested to ensure that the breed retains high health standards.
I hope that my highlighting this issue today will ensure that more potential pet owners ask questions about the health of the parents of their future pet.
I am really glad that the hon.
Lady has brought up this issue.
I do not know whether she has seen the number of brachycephalic  dogs that are going to Battersea because pet owners cannot afford to have the operation.
The charity has seen an exponential rise in these dogs being dumped.
Does she agree that much more needs to be done?
I have indeed been to Battersea, which is what really triggered much of my interest in this particular area.
Like the hon.
Lady, I was deeply shocked by what I saw, which is why it was such a relief to see the new system come into effect at Crufts.
It gives people the opportunity to find out whether their dogs are unwell—ideally, before they have been adopted as puppies.
Cats Protection has highlighted the issue of under-age kitten smuggling.
Nala was smuggled illegally into the country when she was around eight weeks old.
She had been with her owners for eight days when they brought her into the UK from Germany without a pet passport and appropriate vaccinations.
They became concerned for her health and took her to a vet, who realised that she had arrived without meeting the requirements of the pet travel scheme and reported the matter to trading standards.
The pet travel scheme—PETS—allows pet cats, dogs and ferrets to enter the UK without quarantine as long as they are microchipped, have a pet passport and a rabies vaccination, and have waited 21 days after the vaccination before travelling.
In addition to breaking the terms of PETS and been facing prosecution, Nala’s owners were also unable to pay for the costs of seven weeks of quarantine, which came to £1,500, so they signed her over to feline welfare charity Cats Protection.
It ensured that the tiny cat was appropriately quarantined and received vet care before being taken into its Ferndown adoption centre.
Despite being removed from her mother at about seven weeks old, a week earlier than is advised, Nala was a lively, energetic kitten, and a suitable home was found for her.
Clauses 1(3)(b) and 1(4)(b) introduce prohibitions that restrict the commercial import and non-commercial movement into Great Britain of heavily pregnant dogs and cats—those that are more than 42 days pregnant.
There is an emerging trend in the import of pregnant dogs, but there is a strong consensus to tackle that, with Dogs Trust polling showing 79% support for a ban on the import of heavily pregnant dogs.
The prohibition in the Bill is intended to ensure the welfare of pregnant dogs and cats by lowering the gestation limit to prohibit the movement into Great Britain from a third country of dogs and cats that are more than 42 days pregnant—and so within the final third of the gestation.
That aligns with clear markers in pregnancy, and therefore pregnant dogs and cats under that limit can be more easily identified.
In addition, we expect that traders will respond to an increase in the minimum age for importing puppies and kittens by increasing the number of pregnant dogs and cats that they import.
This measure is needed to prevent that anticipated increase in imports of low-welfare dogs and cats from producers with unacceptable welfare standards.
The tragic case of Snowy, the heavily pregnant bichon Maltese, shows how important this measure is in this Bill.
Snowy was seized at the port of Dover in May 2023, after being illegally transported into the UK.
Before she was intercepted, Snowy had travelled to the UK from an EU country.
Snowy was 56 days pregnant  when she was seized—in the final 10% of her pregnancy, when it is illegal to transport dogs.
Just days after she was seized, and despite her ordeal, Snowy gave birth to four healthy puppies.
Snowy and her puppies have all now been responsibly rehomed through the Dogs Trust.
The disturbing trend of transporting heavily pregnant dogs into the country in the later stages of pregnancy causes significant suffering and health implications to both mum and puppies.
Not only will importing one dog attract less suspicion at the border, but as responsible buyers will ask to see the puppies with their mother, this tactic allows criminals to give the impression of being legitimate breeders, and thus avoid being reported to trading standards.
Clauses 1(3)(c) and 1(4)(c) introduce prohibitions that restrict the commercial import and non-commercial movement into Great Britain of dogs and cats with non-exempted mutilations, for example, dogs with cropped ears or docked tails, and declawed cats.
From my previous meetings with pet charities, I know there is a clear consensus among the charities about a ban on dogs and cats with cropped ears and declawed cats, and I am delighted that it has been taken forward.
The intended approach to the prohibition of mutilated animals is set out in further detail in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs consultation “Commercial and Non-Commercial Movements of Pets into Great Britain”.
The summary of responses and the Government response to that consultation are due to be published in due course, and I am very much looking forward to seeing the consultation response.
The ban on cropped ears mutilations would have helped six-year-old Maisie, who came into RSPCA care in October 2023 due to welfare concerns.
She was incredibly malnourished and underweight.
She is a sweet and gentle girl who absolutely loves playing with a football, chasing tennis balls and eating sausages.
She arrived in RSPCA care with a docked tail and cropped ears.
She has a passport from overseas, so the RSPCA believes she was imported having already been cropped and docked.
Unfortunately, it is not just dogs that are mutilated.
Many kittens are subjected to declawing, an extremely painful and distressing procedure that prevents cats from exhibiting normal scratching behaviour, and is the equivalent of amputating a human fingertip at the first knuckle.
Although it is already illegal for cats to be declawed in the UK.
Cats Protection, the RSPCA and Battersea have been campaigning hard to ensure that cats with this mutilation are included in the Bill and banned from importation.
That is both to deter any market or interest in declawed cats, and to keep in line with ensuring that the highest standards of cat welfare are consistently maintained in the UK.
The PDSA “Animal Wellbeing Report 2022” states that “alarmingly, 5% of cat owners who got their cat from abroad, equating to 31,000 cats, told us that they chose to get their pet from abroad because they wanted them to be declawed.”
Clause 1(2)(b) delivers relevant exemptions to the prohibitions, for example, for recognised assistance dogs or military or service working animals.
The enforcement measures and exemptions for the Bill will be delivered through secondary legislation.
As with the exemptions, delivering the enforcement measures through secondary legislation will enable us to work closely with enforcement bodies to develop guidance and ensure they have the correct tools to deliver these measures effectively.
I commend the hon.
Lady for bringing forward this Bill.
The legislation we pass in this place is only as effective as the enforcement that follows from it.
A 2014 Dogs Trust investigation found that two of the authorities involved in enforcing breaches of existing regulations in this area—the Animal and Plant Health Agency and trading standards—had no officers on active duty at ports of entry over weekends.
Does she agree that, as well as passing this welcome piece of legislation, we need assurances from the Minister about the resourcing and capacity of those agencies to ensure the Bill is properly enforced?
Although I agree that we need to ensure enforcement, as I said to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Dover (Mrs Elphicke) , I believe we have an opportunity today to highlight the need to educate people who are about to adopt a puppy or kitten.
They need to ask those questions.
If illegally imported animals are not adopted, the trade will dry up.
I agree with the hon.
Gentleman, but I also think we have an opportunity today to extend knowledge about the process of adopting —I have learned so much in developing this Bill.
The measures will be enacted through secondary legislation in order to refine the scope and detail of the policy and take on the views of the public and key stakeholders.
The Bill provides that the prohibitions must be enacted the first time the enabling power is used in relation to dogs and cats in Great Britain to show commitment to delivering these measures.
I have been assured by the Department, which I thank for its help in getting the Bill to this point, that it will lay secondary legislation as soon as possible following Royal Assent, and DEFRA officials are already working on developing it.
That will ensure that the Bill is future-proofed and that it responds dynamically to smuggling practices.
As is the nature of organised crime, the illegal pet trade is unpredictable and ever-changing.
These enabling powers will ensure the Government can tackle low-welfare imports dynamically.
They provide the flexibility to address known issues quickly, and ensure that we can act in the future to close down emerging practices whereby people try to circumvent previous restrictions.
Finally, let me set out how this will be applied as a GB-wide Bill, and the extent and application involving the devolved Administrations.
Clause 3 sets out the meaning of “appropriate national authority” regarding the devolved Administrations.
Clause 8 sets out the territorial extent of the Bill and describes the jurisdictions in which the Bill will form part of the law.
The territorial extent and application of the Bill is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, except clauses 4, 5 and 6, which extend and apply only to England, Wales and Scotland.
The Bill relates to animal welfare, which is a devolved matter in Scotland and Wales, including in relation to the regulation of movement of animals for the purposes of protecting animal welfare.
In Northern Ireland, animal welfare is generally a transferred matter, but the subject matter of this Bill means that the reserved matter in schedule 3(20) to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 is engaged.
I thank my DUP colleagues,  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  and  the right hon.
Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) , who are unable to join us today but have written to support the Bill.
The hon.
Lady is making an excellent speech about this really important Bill, which I fully support.
It is good to see it coming forward.
As she outlined, we are still waiting for a consultation response from the Government, but does she agree that it is deeply disappointing that the Government dropped
their Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, which would have looked at these issues more carefully?
We need greater action from the Government on animal welfare.
Even though this Bill will help, we need more.
This Government have done more on animal welfare than any previous Government, and we will continue to do so.
Like everyone else, I was disappointed that that Bill collapsed, but that was due to amendments that changed the nature of the original Bill.
I very much welcome the cross-party support for this Bill.
The amendments to the non-commercial pet travel scheme rules and related measures, which include the maximum number of dogs, cats and ferrets that can be moved into Great Britain within five days of the owner’s movements will extend to England, Wales and Scotland.
The Bill does not apply to the domestic movement of dogs, cats and ferrets within our United Kingdom, so travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britian will not be affected.
Many colleagues and hon.
Friends are in the Chamber to support this Bill, and I know that some may think that we have not gone far enough, but we need to be pragmatic with this Bill and do not want perfection to be the enemy of the good.
I believe that, as it stands, it will do a lot to safeguard the welfare of the thousands of puppies, cats and ferrets that come into Great Britain from overseas each year.
It will also prevent the heartache and unexpected cost to families who unknowingly buy young and ill pets that often come with hidden health conditions.
The measures I have outlined aim to make vast animal welfare improvements to the current pet import rules.
With secondary legislation, the measures will go further than the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill to ensure that loopholes are tightened.
I again thank all the charities and interested groups that have shared their views about the Bill.
I hope that the Bill has met some of the expectations and illustrated the positive steps that we are taking to stop this cruel trade.
We are a nation of animal lovers—a Parliament of pet lovers—and this legislation will ensure that the UK is leading the world when it comes to animal welfare.
It is a pleasure to speak in today’s debate on the Animal Welfare (Import of Dogs, Cats and Ferrets) Bill.
Cestrians are certainly fond of animals and animal rights, and I have received hundreds of items of correspondence from constituents regarding the Bill and asking me to contribute to the debate.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  on bringing forward the Bill.
Like my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bristol South (Karin Smyth)  and many of my constituents, I was disappointed by the scrapping of the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals)
Bill last year—a manifesto pledge on which the Government stood—so I am pleased that  some of the key issues from that Bill are addressed in this Bill.
Again, I congratulate the hon.
Member for North Devon.
As important as this Bill is, does my hon.
Friend agree that its provisions could have been on the statute book by now if the Government had not blocked Labour’s efforts to revive the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill last year?
Yes, indeed.
I agree with my hon.
Friend.
The Bill is a declaration of our commitment to compassion and responsibility towards our furry companions.
It seeks to address several pressing issues concerning the importation of these animals, ensuring their safety, health and wellbeing.
My constituency has always cared for animals and led the way on animal rights.
Chester West and Chester Council was one of the first authorities to permanently ban the practice of trail hunting on council-owned land.
The National Trust soon followed suit.
The changes introduced by the last Labour Government have left an indelible mark on British history and have stood the test of time, from the bans on fox hunting and fur farming, to the action to stop experimentation on great apes and the testing of cosmetics on animals.
We must ensure that we do not stop there.
We should lead the way on animal welfare, and this Bill is another step forward and is long overdue.
Puppies, kittens and other animals continue to be illegally imported into the UK on an industrial scale, alongside increasing numbers of heavily pregnant dogs and cats, and animals with mutilations, such as cropped ears.
Every year, thousands of puppies are illegally imported into the UK to be sold to unsuspecting dog lovers, having been transported thousands of miles with little or no food, water or exercise.
I am concerned that there is widespread abuse of the pet travel scheme to smuggle animals illegally, often under age, unvaccinated and in poor welfare conditions.
Dogs, cats and ferrets can enter the United Kingdom in one of two ways: as non-commercial pet travel movements or as commercial imports.
More stringent requirements apply to commercial imports than to non-commercial movements.
Evidence has shown that commercial movements are frequently being described as non-commercial movements to avoid the more stringent requirements.
In 2023, more than 500 landings of dogs and cats were intercepted at the port of Dover and found to be non- compliant with import requirements.
Of these, 116 puppies and kittens were quarantined for being below the legally required minimum age for import.
That data does not include animals detained at airports or found inland.
We cannot know the true extent of puppy smuggling operations, so these figures likely capture only a small portion of the animals smuggled into the country.
According to Dogs Trust, since the relaxation of the pet travel scheme—PETS—in 2012, the number of dogs entering the country via PETS has increased exponentially.
Dogs Trust has conducted five investigations, which have exposed smugglers using PETS as a cover to illegally import dogs into Great Britain for sale.
In 2015, Dogs  Trust set up the puppy pilot through which it funds the quarantine cost of illegally imported puppies seized at the border and then rehomes them responsibly through its network of rehoming centres.
Since 2015, more than 2,256 illegally imported puppies have been cared for by Dogs Trust through the puppy pilot, which, if sold to unsuspecting members of the public, would have made more than £3 million for the illegal importers.
As many as 75 dogs coming in through the Dogs Trust puppy pilot have had their ears cropped, despite this cruel mutilation being illegal in the UK and the EU.
My hon.
Friend is making an interesting contribution.
From her research, has she any idea to what extent the regulations are enforced to crack down on ear cropping, which is already illegal in Britain, but which we know still goes on?
It is all very well not bringing in dogs that have had their ears cropped, but what does she think is happening to enforce the current law?
My right hon.
Friend makes an important point.
As my hon.
Friend  the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook)  said in his intervention, the Government need to commit to enforcement if they accept this important piece of legislation in order to tackle serious issues like ear cropping.
I thank Dogs Trust and other animal welfare charities, such as Cats Protection and the RSPCA, for the important work they do to support the wellbeing of our beloved animals.
Talking of the RSPCA, I thought that I would take the opportunity to talk a little more about ferrets, which do not seem to have been mentioned much during this Session of Parliament.
With the obvious exception of  the right hon.
and learned Member for Banbury (Victoria Prentis) , I do not think we have talked about ferrets in this place at all—we have been more likely to talk about reverse ferrets than actual ferrets.
I am grateful to the RSPCA for its fun factsheet on ferrets, to which I shall refer.
I have learned a great deal about ferrets in doing research for this debate.
Apparently, ferrets—or Mustela putorius furo, which translates as stinky, raging thief—are a close ancestor to the European polecat and, because of their charming and cheeky characters, have become popular pets.
Ferrets have a number of characteristics, which the RSPCA draws out.
Ferrets enjoy exploring and are very curious.
They are obviously predators, which is a characteristic for which they are more widely known, but they are also very sociable, which is probably why they have risen in popularity as a pet.
They are playful and they also like sleeping.
Apparently, they can sleep for between 18 and 20 hours a day, which is quite a feat.
Ferrets use a range of methods to communicate.
They use a smell to hunt and they are also very vocal, which made me think—in a particularly vocal debate—about how they communicate.
An excited ferret will make a “dooking” noise, which is also called chuckling.
They can also produce a bark-like sound, and sometimes do that if they are afraid.
Continuous screaming is an indication that they are highly alert in the presence of danger.
Ferrets are flexible, colourful and can catch cold.
They sound like a fascinating animal and I am so pleased that the debate of  the hon.
Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  covers ferrets as well.
Let me return to the Bill and welcome some aspects of it.
I welcome the fact that it will ban the import of puppies and kittens under six months old, and dogs and cats that are heavily mutilated or heavily pregnant.
It will also address the current abuse of non-commercial rules that compromises animal welfare and buyer security, by making it more difficult and less profitable for traders to import animals for sale fraudulently in the guise of owners travelling with their own pets.
At its core, the Bill seeks to establish comprehensive regulations and standards for the importation process for dogs, cats and ferrets.
By implementing stringent health checks, vaccination requirements and documentation procedures, we can effectively safeguard against the spread of diseases and prevent the introduction of infectious agents into our communities.
These measures are essential not only for the protection of the imported animals, but for the welfare of domestic animals and the public at large.
Furthermore, the Bill advocates the humane treatment of animals throughout their journey.
From the moment they leave their country of origin to their arrival at their destination, animals deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
We must ensure that they are transported in safe and comfortable conditions, free from stress, fear and unnecessary suffering.
Additionally, the Bill seeks to combat the cruel practices associated with the illegal trade of dogs, cats and ferrets by cracking down on unscrupulous breeders and traders who exploit these animals for profit.
In that way, we can protect vulnerable species from exploitation and abuse.
The Bill goes further on the importance of responsible pet ownership.
Owning a dog, cat or ferret is not merely a privilege; it is a responsibility that requires commitment, care and compassion.
On behalf of my constituents in Chester and the many animal lovers across the country, I once again congratulate the hon.
Member for North Devon on this important and long-overdue Bill.
It is a huge pleasure to speak in the debate.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  on promoting this legislation.
Just from looking at the text of the legislation, hon.
Members can see quite how complicated it is to amend a variety of bits of law on something we would have hoped would be straightforward.
The reason we have got to this place is, frankly, that criminals are abusing the rules we have in place.
They have been smuggling dogs, cats and ferrets to such an extent that more than 500 instances of non-compliance were found in Dover alone just in 2023.
Given people’s concerns, it is right that we update the law.
This single-issue Bill is the right way to make that happen.
During the debate on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, there was understandably considerable concern about mutilation.
I am pleased that the Bill addresses that.
As was said by  the right hon.
Member for Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle) —I used to live in Garston at one point—mutilation is already against the law in this country, but too often people say, “Oh well, the dog came from abroad,” to try to get around the law.
It is important that we address those specific issues.
Concerns have been expressed about the number of pets that can be brought over and what will be considered a non-commercial arrangement.
For what it is worth, I think that a sensible compromise has been reached, but will the Minister answer a question about proposed new paragraph 1A in clause 4(4)(a)?
Someone can bring in five animals if they are in a car, but only three in any other form of transport.
I wondered what the situation was for someone on the train—on Eurostar—but not in a car.
I think going through Eurotunnel is covered.
If the Minister wants to think about that, I do not need an answer today, but I think it is worthy of consideration.
We must ensure that the Bill works across the United Kingdom, so it is important that there is the ability to give powers to Ministers in the devolved Administrations.
During the Bill’s progress—which I hope is rapid— I would like to probe further the different times at which different clauses will come into effect.
It is good to see that clauses 1, 2, 3 and 7 will come into effect straightaway on Royal Assent.
It would be useful to understand a little more why clauses 4, 5 and 6 will take longer.
I appreciate that there might be a transition, but at the moment the Bill says six months.
I guess that the most important thing of all is that we go further in Committee and on Report so that a deadline is put on the introduction of the regulations—certainly as far as the powers of UK Ministers allow.
At the moment, the Bill provides the power to make regulations, but I think it is better, especially as we are trying to  take this legislation through the private Members’ Bill route, to give ourselves a fixed deadline for getting the regulations done.
To that end, I am very conscious of other primary legislation.
Consultation must often happen for regulations, and we know that that can take some time, so I would be grateful to hear whether the Minister has already started preparing regulations to bring clause 1 into effect.
That is a very good point in the Bill to ensure that the first regulations must be about the specific issue of smuggling.
I welcome that.
I am conscious that plenty of people would like to speak today.
I know that the Bill will be welcomed by many pet owners who believe that they are doing the right thing.
I am conscious that a lot of people, when they are on holiday abroad, will see animals and try to bring them back—through conscience, if that is what they feel—but that is not always very wise.
We have to be careful about the sorts of diseases that can be brought into the country, especially in feral animals.
Of course, we are well known around the world for our love of animals, and we do not like to see them in distress or just abandoned.
I encourage people who are considering taking on a pet to go to one of our brilliant charities and give an animal a second home.
I can say from personal experience that it can be very positive; it can also be a bit of a nightmare dealing with some of the behavioural elements, which, later in life, can be a bit challenging to correct.
However, a rescue cat, a rescue pet—I have never experienced a rescue ferret—will love you forever.
It  is a vital part of animal welfare to ensure that they are going to good homes and are not in the hands of criminals.
The Bill will address the loopholes that  exist today.
It is an absolute privilege to speak in support of the Bill and better health and welfare standards in our dog, cat and ferret import industry.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  on introducing the Bill.
I admire the work that she done to tighten our importation regulations and advance animal welfare standards for some of our most loved pets.
Her work is even more important given the absence of any Government legislation to introduce such measures.
Many of my constituents, and many people in the country more broadly, will be heartened by the hon.
Member’s dedication to improving the welfare of our imported pets.
With National Pet Day on  11 April  fast approaching, the debate is timely.
National Pet Day celebrates the contribution of pets to our lives, and highlights the care and welfare requirements of our animals.
Just a week earlier, National Ferret Day will be marked on  2 April , celebrating the estimated 100,000 pet ferrets in the UK.
The contributions that cats and dogs make to our lives will be celebrated on their namesake days, on 8 and  26 August  respectively.
That shows and proves that we are a nation of animal lovers—and one that holds particular affection for cats and dogs.
Like many other Members, I am sure, I grew up with dogs—mainly Lancashire heelers.
That is, sadly, a dying breed, but they are wonderful dogs that are particularly special to my West Lancashire constituency, where we have two kinds of heeler: the Lancashire heeler and the Ormskirk heeler.
We had Scamp, who was a vicious little beast but was loved nevertheless, as well as Pal, Beauty, Becky 1 and, sadly, Becky 2, Tilly, Tiny and Pippin.
Everybody in the family was involved in naming those dogs, and they were very much a part of our family life growing up.
As an adult, I have always had cats.
Unfortunately, we most recently lost Colin to a congenital heart disease.
Research from the World Population Review this year revealed that the United Kingdom is home to about 12 million dogs—the sixth largest population of dogs in the world.
Research from various organisations including the PDSA puts the percentage of UK households home to a dog at between 29% and 31%, which is huge.
As of 2023, the number of cats owned is almost as high as dogs, with 11 million cats across the United Kingdom.
To the many people across this country with a dog, cat or ferret, these animals are not just pets, but valued members of our families.
For others, a dog or cat can offer the much-needed companionship they may not otherwise have.
We saw the social and personal benefit of animal ownership throughout the pandemic, when 3.2 million pets were purchased during the periods of lockdown.
Lacking social interaction and instead facing social isolation, individuals and families alike sought the great companionship that pets can provide.
With this nation’s love and affection for our feline and canine friends in mind, I believe the Bill’s provisions will be welcomed by many of our constituents.
To understand the importance of the Bill, it is essential to understand the current issues around puppy, kitten and ferret smuggling.
Currently, these animals can  enter this country in two primary ways: under the non-commercial rules of the pet travel scheme, or via the commercial importation regime.
Pet travel rules  have made travelling with pets both cheaper and easier for owners.
However, these non-commercial rules have been abused by puppy and kitten smugglers, particularly those who care not for the health and welfare of these animals, but for the financial reward from this exploitative practice.
Traders have fraudulently claimed pet ownership of numerous puppies and kittens to import these animals under the non-commercial rules of the pet travel scheme, yet these puppies and kittens are commercially sold upon importation.
Requirements for owners travelling with a pet are less stringent than those for commercial import, and rightly so—that is perfectly understandable.
Smugglers have therefore sought to abuse the pet travel importation route to circumvent more stringent health regulations for their animals.
It is the health and welfare of puppies, kittens and ferrets that is frequently compromised when these pets are illegally smuggled into the United Kingdom.
As I suggested when I outlined the sheer number of these pets in this country, the demand for cats and dogs is extremely high.
The demand for young puppies and kittens from high-value breeds is similarly high, as is, sadly, the demand for animals with certain mutilations.
Cropped-ear dogs and declawed cats are both in demand, despite the illegality of both mutilations in this country.
The sheer demand for dogs and cats of all types, coupled with the demand for dogs and cats with illegal mutilations under UK law, has encouraged the abuse of our animal importation rules.
With less stringent regulation, pet importation has been feigned, and the health and welfare of imported animals has suffered.
In 2021, almost 1,000 dogs and cats were detained for being non-compliant with existing animal health and welfare legislation, and that is just the number of identified imported animals.
As with any illicit industry, the true figure could well be far higher.
It is with those issues in mind that I welcome the Bill’s provisions, which will offer far greater protection for the health and welfare of dog, cats and ferrets imported into this country.
The measures outlined are eminently sensible.
To address the abuse of non-commercial importation rules, it is my understanding that the Bill will reduce the number of animals that can travel under the non-commercial rules from five per person to five per vehicle, or three per foot passenger or air passenger.
Right now, smugglers are benefiting from non-commercial pet importation rules, so reducing the number that any one person can claim as a pet when travelling will impinge further on the fraudulent use of this importation route and the associated health and welfare costs of puppy smuggling under this system.
More broadly, the Bill’s provisions will put in place higher health and welfare standards for imported puppies and kittens.
Banning the import of puppies and kittens under six months of age seems very reasonable because separating puppies or kittens from their mothers too early carries a risk of illness or even death for those young animals.
We know that the separation of puppies from their mothers is not advisable at all before eight weeks for exactly those reasons.
In the United Kingdom, it is illegal for a licence holder to sell a puppy as a pet or to permanently separate it from its biological mother before eight weeks; and for those who may choose to sell a litter from a family pet, there is a consensus among many welfare and veterinary organisations, such as the Animal Welfare  Foundation, the Blue Cross, the PDSA and Dogs Trust, that puppies should not be separated until this age.
The emotional and physical distress experienced by both the mother and the puppy can be immense, and if not fatal, it can have behavioural consequences for these animals throughout their lives.
Each week a puppy spends with its mother is crucial for its social and behavioural development.
Bite inhibition and gentle play are taught in this environment and are essential before a puppy is rehomed.
The recognition of harm to kittens separated from their mothers at a young age is also already recognised in legislation.
In this country it is illegal for a licensed breeder to sell a kitten under the age of eight weeks of age.
In recent months this place has shown great concern about the possession of dangerous dogs that pose a risk to public health.
Ensuring a suitable age for imported dogs and the welfare of these animals should therefore be an equally high priority in this House.
To prevent the proliferation of a dangerous dog population in the UK, we need to prevent the importation of animals at higher risk of displaying dangerous behavioural traits.
This should include prohibiting young puppies without the behavioural maturity and bite inhibition that they learn from their mothers.
That is why this Bill’s provision to ban the importation of puppies, kittens and ferrets under the age of six months can only be a positive step towards greater animal welfare standards and towards reducing our population of dangerous dogs that may pose a threat to public health.
My hon.
Friend is making an excellent, thoughtful and well-researched speech.
Does she agree that there is a need for greater public information and education, as previously mentioned in the debate, to reduce the risk of young age puppies being sold?
