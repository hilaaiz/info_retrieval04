I thank the hon.
Member for his intervention.
It was unfortunate that, even at that point, we still had not managed to bring anything forward around the importation of pets, and it was disappointing that the kept animals Bill was abandoned.
We were told in the House that the Government expected such measures to come forward through private Members’ Bills, and I wholeheartedly congratulate the hon.
Member for North Devon on her Bill.
I am delighted that what I considered to be something for the birds at the time has come about, and I am delighted on this occasion to have been wrong.
