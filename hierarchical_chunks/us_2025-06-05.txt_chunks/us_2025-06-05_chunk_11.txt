Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from my district, Ahmari Taylor, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles.
This team achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41 win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025.
This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood.
A decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open.
Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Ahmari Taylor played a crucial role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a community invests in its youth and its institutions.
Ahmari Taylor, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating challenges and competing at the highest level.
His hard work and dedication were integral to the team's success, culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his school, family, and the entire community.
I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players' development.
