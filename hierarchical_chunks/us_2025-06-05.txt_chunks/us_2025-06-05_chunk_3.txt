Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life.
Barbara Leonard Hayes of Carrollton, Texas, who peacefully passed away on April 6, 2025.
Barbara was born on July 8, 1937, in Tom, Oklahoma and was adopted by John and Lena Noll Leonard.
She attended Durant High School and graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1958, where she earned her bachelor's degree in education.
Barbara began her career as a Flight Attendant for American Airlines out of Chicago, where she was recognized in the World Book Encyclopedia for her unique, vintage title of ``Airline Stewardess.''
Soon after, she moved to Sherman to begin teaching elementary education at Sherman ISD.
On June 11, 1960, Barbara married the love of her life, Stanley Joe Hayes, in Durant, Oklahoma.
Together, they raised two children and have many more grandchildren.
In addition to her critical work as an educator, Barbara was involved in many community initiatives throughout North Texas.
She served as the PTA President at Wakefield Elementary, Cub Scout leader and Den Mother, and a member of many civic and philanthropic organizations.
Barbara was also very passionate about rescuing animals, traveling, and most importantly, trusting God.
She was a devoted woman of faith and a member of the First Presbyterian Church in Sherman, now the Covenant Presbyterian Church.
The kindness, joy, and warmth that Barbara brought with her presence will always be remembered by her loved ones.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of Barbara's life and contributions to North Texas.
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.
