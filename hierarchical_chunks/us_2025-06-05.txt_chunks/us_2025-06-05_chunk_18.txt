Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize North Carolina native and NASCAR legend, Greg Biffle, for his courageous and selfless contributions to the Hurricane Helene recovery effort.
In the wake of the chaos and destruction brought about by Hurricane Helene, 
Mr. Biffle utilized his personal helicopter and piloting skills to assist in emergency rescue efforts.
Without hesitation, 
Mr. Biffle put himself in harm's way by flying into dangerous and unpredictable areas of North Carolina to evacuate stranded individuals, deliver supplies, and support first responders.
Mr. Biffle's decisive actions directly contributed to relief efforts and brought aid to those in need.
It is my honor to take this opportunity to recognize 
Mr. Greg Biffle for risking his personal safety to help those in need.
In a time of great divide, 
Mr. Biffle's actions are a reminder of the unwavering American spirit that exists throughout the great state of North Carolina, and the country.
