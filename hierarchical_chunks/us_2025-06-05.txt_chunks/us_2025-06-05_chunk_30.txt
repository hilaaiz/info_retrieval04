Mr. VARGAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sorayda Santos as California's 52nd Congressional District Constituent of the Month for January 2025.
Sorayda is the co-chair of the nationally recognized Hermanitas Program at MANA de San Diego, which empowers Latina middle and high school students to reach their highest potential.
This program pairs each student with a dedicated mentor to help guide them, inspire them, and provide them with the support they need to succeed.
During her three years as co-chair of the Hermanitas Program, Sorayda has increased the cohort size, improved seminar offerings, and built lasting partnerships with community organizations.
Sorayda has also led efforts to bring a new project management seminar to the program, giving students a valuable, hands-on learning experience that will benefit them for years to come.
In addition to leading the Hermanitas Program, Sorayda currently mentors an eighth-grade student, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to giving back.
Sorayda is an exceptional leader and mentor who works hard every day to inspire the next generation of Latinas to dream big and achieve greatness.
I can't think of a better person to have recognized during National Mentorship Month.
