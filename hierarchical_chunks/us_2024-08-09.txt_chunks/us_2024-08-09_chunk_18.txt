Mr. CISCOMANI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and sacrifice of Air Force 1st
Lt. Raymond T. Plevyak, who will be honored with a Memorial Headstone Marker Service at Arlington National Cemetery.
Air Force 1st
Lt. Plevyak was a distinguished F-51D Mustang pilot who went missing in action during the Korean War in 1952.
Though he was declared Killed in Action (KIA) in December of 1953, his bravery and commitment to his country remain deeply honored.
Plevyak entered the U.S. Air Force from Pennsylvania and was assigned to the 67th Fighter-Bomber squadron, 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing.
On March 1, 1952, he departed Hoengsong Air Base in Korea, piloting an F-51D Mustang with the call sign ``Topkick Fox Three.''
After completing its primary mission of targeting rail lines, the ``Topkick Fox'' flight of four took fire on its secondary reconnaissance mission, resulting in damage to the lead aircraft.
It was during this mission that 1st
Lt. Plevyak went missing.
Despite extensive searches by his fellow pilots, he was never found and remains unaccounted for.
Plevyak's name is memorialized on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C.
Along with other medals and citations, he is a Purple Heart recipient.
Today, we honor his memory and the extraordinary sacrifice he made in service to our Nation.
We must always recognize and honor the service members that made the ultimate sacrifice, like 1st Lt. Plevyak.
We thank him and his family for his service.
