Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Conrad Shipyard for its delivery of the first new class Yard, Repair, Berthing, and Messing (YRBM) vessel to the U.S. Navy.
Conrad Shipyard has a legacy of quality and safety in providing premier vessels to the U.S. government and commercial enterprise.
The new class of YRBM vessels are needed to modernize the living and housing conditions for thousands of Navy personnel.
These vessels will provide a temporary home for our service men and women whose other vessels are in port for repair and maintenance.
I have had the privilege of touring Conrad Shipyard in Morgan City, Louisiana and seeing firsthand the finished product of a dedicated, skilled workforce.
The work being done at Conrad and shipyards in South Louisiana drives economic growth, brings jobs and prosperity to our community, and provides our Armed Forces with the necessary tools to secure America.
The new class of YRBM barge craft are essential to the modernization effort led by the U.S. Navy.
We should all celebrate Conrad Shipyard's delivery of the first new class YRBM vessel to the U.S. Navy, on track and on schedule, and the work they continue to accomplish for the betterment of the U.S. military.
On behalf of Louisiana's 3rd District, I congratulate Conrad Shipyard on this momentous achievement.
I am grateful to the skilled workforce at Conrad for making this possible and thank them for the vital part they play in bolstering our defense maritime industrial base.
