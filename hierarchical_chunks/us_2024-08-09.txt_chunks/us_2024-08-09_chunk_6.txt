Mr. CISCOMANI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the DEA's Tucson District Office EG-46 for their recognition at the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator Awards.
Strengthening border security and immigration enforcement, while ensuring public safety, is a must for our border communities.
These brave men and women put their lives on the line for us every day, serving on the frontline and ensuring the safety of our communities.
Their hard work and dedication are vital in combating cartels, stopping the flow of drugs, and protecting the citizens of southern Arizona.
In 2023, the Tucson District Office EG-46 conducted 45 drug and drug conspiracy investigations.
One of their major efforts was the DEA Initiative ``Operation Overdrive'' in April 2023, during which this dedicated group arrested approximately 80 percent of their identified targets.
They seized 1.1 million fentanyl pills, 26.4 pounds of fentanyl powder, and 42 pounds of methamphetamine--equating to 4.26 million deadly doses of fentanyl and 78,000 deadly doses of methamphetamine.
I am truly grateful for the relentless efforts and their commitment to protecting our community.
I thank them for their service and dedication to protecting our Arizona's District 6.
