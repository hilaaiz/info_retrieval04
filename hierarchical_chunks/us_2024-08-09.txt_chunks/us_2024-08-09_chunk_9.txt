Mr. CISCOMANI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kimberly Allen, a Sahuarita High School student, who scored a perfect 36 on the ACT exam.
With this achievement, Kimberly joined a select group, as only 0.18 percent of test takers achieved a perfect score in 2023.
This means that, out of nearly two million students, just 2,543 students in the country earned this honor.
Kimberly's achievements go beyond academics.
She serves on the Sahuarita Teen Advisory Board, where she organizes events and programs for local teens.
She also volunteers with the Animal League of Green Valley, sharing her lifelong love of animals.
As for her future, Kimberly aspires to pursue a career that combines her passions for science and art.
I am excited to see what the future holds for Kimberly and congratulate her on this incredible achievement.
I am proud to represent her and so many other bright students in Congress.
