Mr. CISCOMANI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Lupita Murillo on her well-deserved retirement after nearly five decades of dedicated service with KVOA News 4 in Tucson.
During her time at KVOA, Lupita's specialized crime reporting made a significant impact on the Tucson community.
Her remarkable career began in Weslaco, Texas, where she broke barriers as south Texas' first Hispanic female broadcaster.
Beyond her journalistic accomplishments, Lupita has been a tireless advocate and volunteer for organizations such as Las Familias, the People With AIDS Coalition of Tucson, and the Children's Miracle Network Telethon.
Lupita will be missed, but her lasting impact on KVOA will continue to inspire future generations of journalists and community advocates throughout southern Arizona.
I am proud to represent trailblazers like Lupita in my district.
