Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize James W. Thompson for his record-breaking catch.
A native.
Simons, 21year-old James set a new state record for an almaco jack caught on July 28th.
Measuring in at a whopping 27 pounds and 8 ounces, it broke the previous record by 4 pounds.
This is no small feat.
The almaco jack is known for its strength and stamina, humbling anglers who do not take it seriously.
With this catch, James proved that he is a skilled fisherman.
This is the third time in the past year alone that the record for almaco jack has been broken.
It is a reminder that Georgia's coastal waters provide exceptional fishing for anglers of all ages.
It's important that we maintain the health and biodiversity of Georgia's waters, so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy one
