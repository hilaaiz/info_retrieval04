Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and thank Steve Stirling, who is retiring as CEO of Medicine for All People (MAP) International.
MAP International is a Christian, non-profit, global health organization that provides medicine and health supplies to those in need.
This organization is headquartered in Atlanta and does amazing work worldwide.
Steve has successfully led this organization since 2014.
Steve has an impressive leadership background in both the non-profit and corporate spaces, and he brought that valuable experience to MAP for over a decade of loyal service.
