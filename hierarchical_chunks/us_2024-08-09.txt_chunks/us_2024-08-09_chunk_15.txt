Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I use today to honor Sherman L. Jenkins for his exceptional contributions to our community, particularly through his work with the Quad County African American Chamber of Commerce and his extensive service to the City.
As a stalwart advocate for economic development, Sherman has dedicated over 20 years to enhancing the prosperity of the city.
His leadership as the Assistant Director and later as the Executive Director of the Aurora Economic Development Commission was marked by key initiatives, such as the successful opening of the Hollywood Casino and the establishment of the Chicago Premium Outlet Mall.
These milestones not only raised Aurora's profile, but also significantly contributed to the local economy.
In addition to his professional achievements, Sherman's commitment to community engagement is unparalleled.
Even after his retirement in 2012, he remained an active force within the city, serving as an alderman at-large for six years, participating in community events, and driving initiatives that foster collaboration and growth.
Moreover, Sherman's passion for community service extends beyond his professional endeavors.
As a founding member of the Quad County African American Chamber of Commerce, he has played a pivotal role in advocating for the African American business community and ensuring that their voices are heard.
His involvement with various organizations, including the Rotary Club of Aurora, the Aurora Public Library Foundation, the Ely Chapter of Lambda Alpha International, and the Northern Lights Development Corporation, exemplify his commitment to civic duty and community wellbeing.
As he embarks on the next chapter of his life, we celebrate his legacy and the indelible mark he has left on the city.
We look forward to seeing his contributions continue to inspire future generations through his digital media company, SLJ Communications, Inc., through which he produces the ``Tell Me Something Good'' monthly publication that covers African American life outside the City of Chicago, and authored Ted Strong, Jr.:
The Untold Story of an Original Harlem Globetrotter and Negro Leagues All-Star.
