Mr. Speaker, I ask that the entire House of Representatives join me in congratulating and thanking the surviving veterans of Operation Dragoon and the Southern France Campaign on the occasion of the upcoming 80th anniversary of this highly successful operation which liberated Southern France and played a critical role in the Allied victory in Europe in WWII.
