I welcome the support from the Lib Dem spokesperson,  the hon.
Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney) , for the Bill.
She asked about the definition of “significant”, a point also raised by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Walthamstow (Ms Creasy) .
The threshold set out in the draft charter for budget responsibility, which we have on the gov.uk website, is 1% of GDP in any single financial year.
The purpose of the legislation is to prevent large irresponsible fiscal announcements that could undermine economic stability, and that requires a threshold targeted at fiscally significant announcements.
That is why we have chosen that figure in the draft legislation and the draft text published on gov.uk.
