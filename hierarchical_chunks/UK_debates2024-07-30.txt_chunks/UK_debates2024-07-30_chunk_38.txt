The Foreign Secretary will get full support from the Opposition in imposing open registers of beneficial ownership on the overseas territories.
Can I ask the Foreign Secretary to pay special attention to Sudan, which is suffering the largest displacement crisis in the world?
There is clear evidence of ethnic cleansing once again in Darfur, and the human misery that I saw on the border with Chad earlier this year was among the most harrowing that I have ever seen.
I am very grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman.
I was able to raise the issue of Sudan with G7 Foreign Ministers in my first days in office, and I continue to hold discussions with the United States, which, as he will know, has summoned a gathering in Switzerland to try to achieve peace.
Both main parties committed in their manifestos to restoring the 0.7% international development target.
As the Foreign Secretary will have seen, last year we reached nearly 0.6%.
Will he discuss with the Treasury returning to 0.7%, not in one bite, but over the next two years?
That would secure the best value for money for British taxpayers and also help those most in need.
I paid tribute to the right hon.
Gentleman earlier, but this is one area that was left in a mess.
Frankly, £3.4 billion being spent on refugees in hotels is the lion’s share of that amount.
That is a lot for me and   my hon.
Friend the Minister with responsibility for development to deal with, but we will do all we can to get back to that 0.7% as soon as possible.
Next week marks five years since the illegal revocation of articles 370 and 35A took away what little autonomy the Kashmiris had and paved the way for further persecution of the Kashmiris by the Indian armed forces.
Will the Minister make it clear that she is committed to upholding international law?
Will she confirm that the UK will uphold UN resolution 47, which demands the birthright of the Kashmiris—the right to a free and fair plebiscite?
