I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his important question; I am well aware of his interest in this issue over many years.
As a Government, we remain committed to a bizonal, bicommunal federation on the basis of political equality and adherence to United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we will continue to engage with the United Nations envoy and the UN process on this important matter.
