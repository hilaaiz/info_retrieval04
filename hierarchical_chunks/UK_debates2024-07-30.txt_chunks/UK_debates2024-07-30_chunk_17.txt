I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
This Government are determined to increase the pressure on Russia and support Ukraine.
We will keep our Russia sanctions regime under close review, and will go further to reduce Russia’s capacity to wage war.
The Government have already taken further action, including through the European Political Community, by sanctioning an additional 11 ships as part of efforts to disrupt and deter Russia’s shadow fleet.
In my early meetings, I have raised our Russia sanctions consistently with my counterparts, and I will continue to work with our closest allies in Europe and United States.
