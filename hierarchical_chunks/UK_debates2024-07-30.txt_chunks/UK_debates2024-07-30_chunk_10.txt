The Secretary of State will get bored of me continuing to press him on the recognition of the state of Palestine.
I hope not to test his patience, but I know in my heart that it is what Palestinians need to ignite hope.
Two states cannot happen without that hope to unite Palestinians behind a final cause that will stop the killing for good.
War has to stop, but that is not peace.
Peace is two states.
He knows that Netanyahu rejects it, so when he spoke to Netanyahu, did he talk about the two-state solution, and in particular the recognition of Palestine?
Does he accept that if the UK followed the other 140 countries that have done this, that would send a powerful message to both the Palestinian people and Netanyahu?
Let me reassure the hon.
Lady that raising this issue does not test my patience.
She is absolutely right.
I reject and disagree with those in Israel who say that there can be no two-state solution.
If there is no two-state solution, there is either one state or no state at all.
I recognise why this is a pressing issue and why she raises it, but as I have said, we will do it at the appropriate moment, hopefully working with other partners as a road to the two states that we desire.
What steps he is taking to help secure a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
In my second week in the role I travelled to Israel and to the west bank and called for an immediate ceasefire—something that none of my predecessors had done.
In my meetings with both leaders I called for an immediate ceasefire and made the urgent case, as has been described, for a credible and irreversible pathway towards a two-state solution.
