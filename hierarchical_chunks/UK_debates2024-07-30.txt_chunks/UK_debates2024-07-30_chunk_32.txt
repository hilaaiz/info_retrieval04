I thank the right hon.
Member for his question.
This is an extremely complex finding, covering 90 pages.
It was issued after considerable deliberation by the ICJ, and there is a variety of views from the judges.
As we said at the time, it will take us some time to respond to the full judgment.
We will update the House when we are in a position to do so.
In the meantime, sanctions will remain under review, as I mentioned in the previous answer.
