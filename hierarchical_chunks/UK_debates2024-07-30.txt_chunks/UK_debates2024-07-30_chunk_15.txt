I thank the Minister for that response.
If we want to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, it is quite clear what the free world has to do: get rid of Hamas, who are murderers and terrorists.
They hide in schools and hospitals, and they hide among civilians.
They are the people who are bringing death to Palestine.
If we want to give Palestinians the humanitarian aid that we should give them, we have to get rid of Hamas.
