May I start by congratulating the Minister on his appointment?
I know how hard he worked on this brief in opposition.
He will know that the longer those Russian sanctions are in place, the more creative Russia becomes at circumventing them.
What steps do he and the Foreign Secretary plan to take to end the UK’s indirect import of Russian crude oil via the three refineries at Jamnagar, Vadinar and New Mangalore?
Did the Foreign Secretary discuss that issue when he travelled to see our Commonwealth friends in India last week?
It is a pleasure to see the hon.
Lady in her position and to have worked with her many times on these issues in the past, across these Benches and in other formats.
As the Foreign Secretary and I have already outlined, we took robust action against Russia’s shadow fleet, alongside allies at the European Political Community.
We will continue to explore further options to strengthen our sanctions, including in the energy sector, and the Foreign Secretary did indeed raise the issue at his meetings in Mangalore.[Official Report,  3 September 2024 ; Vol. 753, c. 4WC.]
(Correction)
What recent discussions he has had with his Indian counterpart on strengthening UK-India relations.
I met my Indian counterpart, Dr Jaishankar, in Delhi on  24 July .
We discussed how to unlock the potential of the UK-India relationship for economic growth and to develop a stronger, deeper partnership to reinvigorate that relationship.
I was very pleased to launch the tech and security initiative, which brings together businesses across our two countries working in those areas.
