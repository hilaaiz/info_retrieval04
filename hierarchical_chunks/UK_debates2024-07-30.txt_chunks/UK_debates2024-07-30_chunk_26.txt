I thank the hon.
Gentleman and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Plymouth Moor View (Fred Thomas)  for their service.
I gently remind the hon.
Gentleman that the last Government to get to 2.5% of GDP spending on defence was a Labour Government.
We intend to get back there and those plans will be announced at a fiscal event in the future.
