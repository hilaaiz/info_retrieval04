I thank my right hon.
Friend for his reply.
I must press him further on Government recognition of a Palestinian state.
That should have been a starting point 30 years ago.
I believe that recognition would level the playing field and kick-start the peace process, as has been recognised by so many of our European counterparts.
Recognition should not come at the conclusion.
What will the Government do if Israel refuses to entertain any moves towards a two-state solution, which it has persistently and vocally rejected?
