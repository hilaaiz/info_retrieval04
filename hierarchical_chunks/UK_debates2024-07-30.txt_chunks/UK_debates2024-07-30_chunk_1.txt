I thank the hon.
Gentleman for representing the concerns of his constituent’s family.
I recognise that this is a very distressing time for them.
He will that know consular officials are providing support to the family and have remained in regular contact with the authorities in Italy, and the ambassador has raised this case with the Italian authorities.
They have ended the active search, but the investigation is ongoing, and I would be happy to meet the hon.
Gentleman to discuss it further.
