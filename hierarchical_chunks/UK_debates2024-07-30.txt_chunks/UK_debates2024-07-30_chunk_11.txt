I welcome my right hon.
Friend and all the team to their place.
I thank him for calling for a ceasefire when he visited Israel; that has had a profound impact in my constituency.
Does he agree that a permanent ceasefire in Gaza is essential for the future of the people in Gaza, and would help to cool tensions in the middle east, in particular given the attack on the Golan Heights and the escalating tensions between Hezbollah and Israel, and even the Houthis?
