Friend agree that strengthening our country’s trading relationship with the European Union, in respect of goods as well as services, needs to be an essential part of achieving the Government’s ambitions for growing the economy?

He knows that the former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, got the paper-thin deal that he did.
We do not yet have a new Commission in place.
We are absolutely committed to a new veterinary deal and to dealing with the issues of qualifications in particular, but we will take forward discussions with the European Union in good spirit in the coming months, as soon as the Commission is in place.
Ethiopia is on the cusp of recognising the Republic of Somaliland.
Will the Minister look at where British policy is, to make sure that it reflects the new reality?
Might she have time to meet me to discuss how we can strengthen and deepen the relationship between Britain and the Republic of Somaliland?

We have also expressed our full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
I would of course be happy to meet the right hon.
Gentleman to discuss any issue, including that one.
