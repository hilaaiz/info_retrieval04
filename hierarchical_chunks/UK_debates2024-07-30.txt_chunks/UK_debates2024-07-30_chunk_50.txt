I welcome my right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary and his team to their places.
I have discussed with many of them the chronic human rights situation in West Papua over many years.
In 2019, President Widodo  invited the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit West Papua, but that visit has not yet taken place.
What steps are the Government taking to ensure that such a visit takes place, with both the Indonesian Government and the United Nations?
