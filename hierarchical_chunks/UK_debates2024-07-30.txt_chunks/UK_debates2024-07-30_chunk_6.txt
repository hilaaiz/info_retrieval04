I know that my hon.
Friend has pressed these issues, which are of huge importance to her constituents, for many years.
No one has a veto on recognition.
As I said, we want it to be part of a process; it does not deliver a two-state solution in and of itself.
But it is absolutely right that the Palestinians are enabled to have a sovereign state.
It is a just cause, and we will work with other partners to bring that about.
Order.
Can I just say to everybody that Members are meant to speak through the Chair?
Please look towards me or the mics might not pick you up.
I hear what the Secretary of State said, but does he agree that the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine is vital to the UK’s commitment to uphold international law and norms, vital to the processes required to bring about an immediate and just peace, and vital to the notion that diplomatic means and not violence are the way to resolve the conflict?
Does he agree that failure to recognise the state of Palestine has had and continues to have catastrophic implications for the people of Palestine, as they face what the International Criminal Court has described as plausible genocide?
The hon.
Gentleman is right that peace will be achieved through a political solution, not through military means.
But I disagree that recognition itself will bring about peace.
The Biden plan is on the table at the moment, and we would like Hamas and the Israeli leadership to accept it.
That is what will give us a ceasefire and get us to a place where we can achieve that two-state solution.
