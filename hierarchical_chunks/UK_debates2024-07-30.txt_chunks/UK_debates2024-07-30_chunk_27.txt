What his planned timescale is for completing his review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law.
As soon as I came into office, I commissioned new advice on Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law in the context of war in Gaza.
We are obliged to look at that advice under criterion 2C for items exported.
That is an ongoing process.
I pledge to update the House as soon as I can on this very serious matter.
