I thank my hon.
Friend for his interparliamentary work on that important issue.
The UK strongly supports the efforts of the authorities and civil society to address the legitimate concerns of the people of Papua, as my hon.
Friend has highlighted many times in this House.
We continue to monitor the situation in Papua, including the ongoing issue of internal civil displacement caused by clashes between separatists and Indonesian security forces in Papua.
The UK remains supportive of a visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
