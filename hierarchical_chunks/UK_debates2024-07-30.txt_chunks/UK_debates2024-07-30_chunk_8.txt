May I welcome the Foreign Secretary to his new position, since this is the first time that we have met across the Dispatch Box since we swapped sides?
I welcome all his team, especially  the hon.
Member for Lincoln (Hamish Falconer) , who was previously a respected and effective official in both the Ministries in which I served as a Cabinet Minister.
I urge the Foreign Secretary to avoid any suggestion of some sort of international legal-moral equivalence between a terrorist murderer and the elected head of a democratic state.
In any question of an arms embargo, I remind him that just a few weeks ago, British arms and military personnel were defending our ally Israel from missiles launched by Iran.
Let me begin by welcoming the right hon.
Gentleman to his position.
It is great to see him where he is, and not on the Government Benches.
He will know that these are very serious issues, and that the test under criterion 2c is whether there is a “clear risk”.
That is based on very careful assessments of the law.
He would expect me to pursue that with all sobriety and integrity, and that is what I intend to do.
