I know that my hon.
Friend cares deeply about these matters.
The Foreign Secretary visited the region within a week of taking office, and he has also raised those precise issues with the Israeli authorities.
I reiterate that we are strongly opposed to the expansion of illegal settlements and rising settler violence.
More west bank land has been declared state lands by Israel this year than at any time since the Oslo accords.
The British Government already have sanctions against eight people and two groups in relation to settlers in the west bank, and we will look at all options when it comes to tougher action on issues related to the west bank.
Can the Minister be clear about this?
The judgment or opinion given by the ICJ is, quite clearly, that the occupation of Gaza, the west bank and East Jerusalem is illegal.
The settlement policy is illegal.
Do the Government accept that view, and if they do, what actions will they take to ensure that appropriate sanctions are taken against Israel, including ending arms supplies, to ensure that that judgment is carried out, and that the people of Palestine can live in peace, and not under occupation?
