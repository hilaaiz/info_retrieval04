I thank the Foreign Secretary and his team for the £500,000 committed to the Caribbean after the devastation on Grenada and Carriacou as a result of Hurricane Beryl, but can I press him and the team on the fact that the Caribbean is at the sharp end of the climate crisis?
Will he tell the House what plans he has to advocate at COP29 for a replacement of the $100 billion climate finance deal?
