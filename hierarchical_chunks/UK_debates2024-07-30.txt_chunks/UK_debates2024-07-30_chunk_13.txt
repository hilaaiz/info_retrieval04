I thank the Minister for her answer.
Last week, I met the Palestinian ambassador to discuss the heartbreaking crisis in Gaza.
Since April, the volume of aid cargo entering the Gaza strip has decreased by around 50%, at the same time as hospitals remain damaged or, in many cases, destroyed.
That is why I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s commitment to resume United Nations Relief and Works Agency funding and his demands for a ceasefire in the region.
Having resumed that funding, what steps are the Government taking to allow that vital aid into Gaza and help those so desperately in need?
