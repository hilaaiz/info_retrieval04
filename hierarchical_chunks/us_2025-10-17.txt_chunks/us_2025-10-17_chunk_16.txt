Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Aurora Actionaires, a remarkable milestone for an organization that has stood as a beacon of service, leadership, and community empowerment in Aurora, Illinois, for half a century.
Since its founding in 1975, when three friends, Donna Williams, Martha Hickling, and Caroline Johnson, met at Hoi Peng Restaurant in Aurora on New Year's Eve, 1974, and decided to form a social club, the Aurora Actionaires has consistently demonstrated what committed civic engagement can achieve.
What began with a group of eighteen enthusiastic friends wanting a better community quickly evolved into a force for service and empowerment under their guiding motto: We Care...
We Act...
We Serve.
Over these five decades, the Aurora Actionaires have lived that motto through their tireless dedication to education, community development, youth mentorship, and numerous charitable endeavors across the region.
They have awarded more than $200,000 in scholarships to high school seniors and provided assistance to college students in need.
They have hosted workshops for parents and students on completing scholarship and financial aid applications and supported eighth-grade graduates attending the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy's SEAMS Summer Enrichment Program, helping young people pursue academic excellence and opportunity.
On their golden anniversary, we reflect on the many lives touched, the students who would not have pursued higher education without their support, families whose neighborhoods have been strengthened through their volunteerism, and civic institutions that have benefited from their leadership and investment.
The Aurora Actionaires have built bridges across generations, across neighborhoods, and across divides and have always modeled the belief that progress is shared when we lift others.
