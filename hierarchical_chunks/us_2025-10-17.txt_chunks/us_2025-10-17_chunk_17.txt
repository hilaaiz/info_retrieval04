Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have the Aurora Actionaires as part of Illinois' 11th Congressional District.
They have demonstrated what it means to transform compassion into action and service into lasting impact, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on their golden anniversary and thank them for their unwavering dedication to building a stronger, more vibrant community for all.
