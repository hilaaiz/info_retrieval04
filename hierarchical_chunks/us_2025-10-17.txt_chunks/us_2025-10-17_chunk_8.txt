Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Paul Eckstein, a giant in Arizona law and a stalwart public servant, on the remarkable occasion of his 60th work anniversary at Perkins Coie LLP.
Paul worked on many consequential legal disputes in Arizona history that shaped the state's legal and civic landscape.
He brought a rare combination of trial skill, appellate judgment, and moral clarity.
Time and again, he shows Arizonans that the law can correct course and restore trust.
As lead counsel for the Arizona House of Representatives in the 1988 impeachment of Governor Evan Mecham, he tried the case with rigor and restraint--cross-examining the governor, arguing the evidence, and reminding Arizona that no one is above the law.
The Senate's verdict confirmed the point, and renewed public faith that our Constitution has teeth when it must.
Early in Paul's career, he represented Navajo leader Tom Shirley in Shirley v. Superior Court, securing a decision that affirmed Native American citizens living on reservations are fully entitled to hold public office in Arizona.
He defended voter-driven reform by helping ensure Clean Elections reached the ballot.
He stood up for independent redistricting when it mattered most, supporting the reinstatement of the Independent Redistricting Commission's chair.
And he defended Arizona's merit-based judgeship selection, fending off efforts to politicize the bench.
Across these battles runs a common thread: Paul used the law to safeguard the people's voice and the independence of our courts.
What sets Paul apart is not only what he has done, but how he has done it.
He takes the lawyer's oath seriously--so seriously that he chooses principle over convenience, even when it costs him.
He demands candor.
He proves, by example, that zealous advocacy and impeccable ethics go hand in hand.
Paul's extraordinary impact extends well beyond the courtroom.
He taught constitutional law at Arizona State University, and his students now serve across our state.
At his alma mater, Pomona College, he and his wife, Florence ``Flo'' Eckstein, endowed a scholarship for refugee and forcibly displaced students, opening doors for those whose lives were upended by conflict or catastrophe.
Paul served for decades on the board of Phoenix Children's Hospital, including as Board Chair.
At Arizona State University, the Flo Eckstein Endowment supports students focused on children, youth, and families, and the Albert & Liese Eckstein Scholar-in-Residence brings leading voices in Jewish studies to our community each year.
For more than three decades, the Ecksteins stewarded the Jewish
