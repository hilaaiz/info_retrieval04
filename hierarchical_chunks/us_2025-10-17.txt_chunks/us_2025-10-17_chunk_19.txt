Mr. HERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and legacy of a remarkable public servant, Carlos Alberto Lopez Rivera, better known to his beloved community simply as ``Carlitos.''
Born on September 14, 1958, in Dorado, Carlitos grew up with the values of hard work, service, and loyalty instilled in him by his parents, Pedro Lopez Maldonado and Ana Rivera.
After graduating from Jose S. Alegria High School and earning a degree in Business Management from the University of Puerto Rico, he could have chosen many paths.
But his heart was rooted in Dorado, and he devoted himself to serving the very place that had shaped him.
That calling led him to the mayor's office, where on August 3, 1987, he was sworn in as the mayor.
What followed was nothing short of historic.
For 38 years, through 10 consecutive elections, Carlitos was entrusted by his neighbors with the responsibility of guiding their community.
He transformed Dorado into a thriving center of tourism and development while never losing sight of the needs of working families.
He often described Dorado as the ``paradise of Puerto Rico, where life is beautiful,'' and under his leadership, that vision became a reality.
But Carlitos was more than just an astute and skillful politician.
He was a man of loyalty, wit, and heart.
He had a gift for words, painting images and phrases that stuck in the memory of the people he served.
He balanced economic progress with social justice, reminding all who knew him that growth should never leave anyone behind.
And to those who knew him best, he will always be remembered for his loyalty.
In the hardest and loneliest moments, Carlitos was there, steadfast and encouraging, urging us forward ``at full speed and with even greater strength.''
Carlitos made history as one of the longest-serving mayors in Puerto Rican history, second only to his contemporary in Manati, Juan Aubin Cruz Manzano.
Yet beyond the records and accomplishments, his true legacy will live on in the people of Dorado, who saw in him not only a mayor, but a neighbor, a motivator, and a guardian of their community's spirit.
