Mr. DELUZIO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel Raymond L. Hyland, Jr., United States Air Force, a resident of Cranberry Township, PA, who is retiring after 36 years of faithful service to our Nation and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania following his commission from Air Force ROTC at Kent State University.
After graduating from Kent State in 1989, Colonel Hyland began his dedicated service to our nation.
Colonel Hyland served the Air Force in a wide variety of roles over the next thirty-six years, both throughout the country and overseas.
His active-duty years include flying assignments at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma, Castle Air Force Base in California, Plattsburgh Air Force Base in New York, and Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota.
In 1999, Colonel Hyland transferred from active duty to the Pennsylvania Air National Guard where he served in various KC-135 Operations and Maintenance roles at the 171st Air Refueling Wing in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, culminating as the Wing's Commander.
Throughout his career, Colonel Hyland has demonstrated exceptional commitment to the country.
He is a Command Pilot with more than 5,600 flight hours in various aircraft.
His personal awards include the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (four awards), Air Medal, Aerial Achievement Medal (four awards), Air Force Commendation Medal (two awards), and the Air Force Achievement Medal.
I commend Colonel Hyland for his dedication to our country and the sacrifices he and his family have made.
I thank him, his wife Kim, and their two children, Kathleen and Ryan, for their service and wish him blue skies as he concludes a distinguished career.
