Mr. Speaker, on this milestone anniversary, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Blue Water Habitat for Humanity--its leadership, volunteers, donors, and partner families, for three and a half decades of faithful service.
May their example continue to inspire service, personal responsibility, and the belief that stronger homes build stronger communities.
