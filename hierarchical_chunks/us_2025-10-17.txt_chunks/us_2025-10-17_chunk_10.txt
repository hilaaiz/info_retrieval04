Mr. Speaker, Arizona is a better place because.
He has defended our Constitution in court and in public life; he has protected fair elections and independent courts; he has fought for a free press and for equal justice; and he has invested his time, talent, and treasure to care for children, and educate the next generation.
On behalf of the people of Arizona, I congratulate Paul on 60 years of courage and integrity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating a lawyer, teacher, and citizen whose life's work has strengthened our state.
