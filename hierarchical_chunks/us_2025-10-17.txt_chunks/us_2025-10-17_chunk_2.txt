Mr. GIMENEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the people of Spain and millions around the world in celebrating Spain's National Day, known as Fiesta Nacional de Espana (National Day of Spain).
As Co-Chair of the Friends of Spain Caucus, I am proud to honor the deep and enduring bonds between our two nations, bonds rooted in shared history, faith, and friendship.
From the earliest days of our Republic, Spain played a pivotal role in supporting American independence, providing vital aid and recognition to our Founding Fathers in their struggle for liberty.
The names.
Augustine, Pensacola, and San Marcos remind us that Florida's story is inseparable from the Spanish legacy that helped shape our Nation's earliest frontiers.
Spanish influence can be seen in our architecture, our language, our traditions, and the vibrant communities that call South Florida home.
Every day, centuries-old ties continue to inspire cultural exchange, economic partnership, and mutual respect between our peoples.
On this National Day of Spain, we celebrate not only the remarkable history of the Spanish nation, but also the shared values of democracy, freedom, and friendship that unite Spain and the United States.
I look forward to strengthening our transatlantic partnership and ensuring that the friendship between our Nations continues to flourish for generations to come.
