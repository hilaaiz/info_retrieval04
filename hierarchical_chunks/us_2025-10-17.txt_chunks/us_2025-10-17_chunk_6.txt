Mr. Moran's decades of service are truly remarkable.
It is evident that 
Mr. Moran has dedicated his life to serving others and has undoubtedly played an instrumental role in the success of several organizations throughout Brown County and Northeast Wisconsin.
From his time serving as a Cub Scout Leader and Soccer Coach in De Pere to his over 50 years with the De Pere VFW Post 2113, 
Mr. Moran's unwavering support and guidance deserves our highest admiration.
In addition to 
Mr. Moran's community service, his most important role has been a supportive husband to his wife Linda and father to three children, Phillip, Renee, and Nickolas.
Throughout his children's upbringing, Pat was a leader that you could always count on--serving as a Cub Scout Leader, Lost Dauphin 4H leader, Soccer Coach, and member of the MBX Motorcycle Club and the West De Pere Snow Owls Snowmobile Club.
I commend 
Mr. Moran's unwavering commitment to Northeast Wisconsin.
