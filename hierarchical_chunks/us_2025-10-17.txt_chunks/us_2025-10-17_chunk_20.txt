Mr. Speaker, the life of Carlos Alberto `Carlitos' Lopez Rivera reminds us that true leadership is measured not only in years of service, but in the lives uplifted along the way.

As we reflect on his legacy, may we honor him by carrying his spirit forward, always pressing on ``at full speed and with even greater strength.''
