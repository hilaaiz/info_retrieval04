Mr. HURD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Scott W. Hobson of Pueblo, Colorado, as he retires from the Pueblo City Planning & Community Development Department.
Scott's career in public service began in Canon City, where he served as Director of the Fremont County Special District Parks and Recreation.
During that time, he earned two national certifications-- Certified Parks and Recreation Professional and Certified Parks and Recreation Executive.
One of his proudest accomplishments there was helping create the Arkansas River Trail and launching recreational programs that brought the community together.
In 1980, Scott married Janice Chambers, and together they raised three wonderful daughters, Cindi Selvage, Amanda Hobson, and Lauren Snell.
Scott continued his public service in Summit County as an Open Space Manager, focusing on preserving the beauty and open land of the region.
In 1998, he and his family made the move to Pueblo, a place they have called home ever since.
Scott began working with the City of Pueblo, where, for more than two decades, he became a key figure in shaping and strengthening the community.
From the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk to Kayak Park and river restoration efforts, Scott brought energy, vision, and a deep sense of care to every project.
His understanding of Pueblo's history is second to none, and he has always had a heart for building strong, vibrant neighborhoods.
Scott's legacy is one of service, dedication, and a genuine love for Southern Colorado.
We thank him for all he has given, and we wish him the very best in this next chapter.
