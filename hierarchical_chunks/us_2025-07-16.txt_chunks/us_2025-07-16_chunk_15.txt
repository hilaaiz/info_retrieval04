the 118th Congress.
At the time, the Department of Commerce weighed in requesting significant changes to the provision that are unfortunately not included in the Act we will consider today.
As such, this bill merits further vetting and input from the Department.
This bill needs to be changed to address these concerns.
Until that happens I must regretfully oppose this legislation in its current form.
