Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the life and legacy of Lee Clark, a soft-spoken and kind country gentleman, a loving husband, an amazing father, and a true friend.
Lee passed into the arms of our Lord on Friday, June 27, 2025.
His loss is deeply felt by all who had the privilege of knowing him.
A sixth-generation Texan and rancher, Lee exemplified the values of integrity, diligence, and quiet strength that define the best of rural Texas.
Born and raised in Menard, Lee Clark, a steward of the land, devoted his life to the care of his livestock and range.
His tireless work ethic, principled nature, and gift for storytelling earned him the respect and affection of all who knew him.
