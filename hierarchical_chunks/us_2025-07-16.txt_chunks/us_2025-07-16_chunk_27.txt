Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Mrs. Brunette Washington, a beloved wife, mother, grandmother, and community member whose love, compassion, and devotion to her family and Western New York inspired all who knew her.
Mrs. Washington passed away this month at the age of 111, having lived a fulfilling and rewarding life.
