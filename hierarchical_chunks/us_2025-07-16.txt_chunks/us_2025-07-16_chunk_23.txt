Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day, a day dedicated to increasing public knowledge about PTSD, a complex mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event.
Nearly eight million people in the United States are living with PTSD, many suffering and unaware of the resources available.
Living with PTSD can have a significant impact on an individual's daily life, and an awareness of one's emotional wellbeing, including signs and symptoms such as avoidance, flashbacks, and hyper vigilance is essential to fostering healing and accessing support.
Advancements have been made over the years to better understand and treat PTSD.
Through research and lived experience, PTSD has been recognized as a natural response to overwhelming events.
Community awareness, peer support, and destigmatizing mental health care are essential to curating healing spaces.
Education and training have equipped community members throughout the globe to be able to identify and respond to individuals suffering from PTSD with sensitivity and deep understanding.
To day, we recognize National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day and the strides made by countless individuals and those who walk alongside them with love and support.
Let this day serve as a reminder that help is available, not only through treatment but empathy, education and advocacy.
Each year of acknowledgement helps to break down stigma and build caring environments for future generations and we are all the better for it.
