On September 8, 1990, Lee married his best friend and the love of his life, Lisa Price Clark.
Together they built a life centered on faith, family, and hard work.
Lee was a devoted father to his two daughters, Candice and Madelon, and he was endlessly proud of the women they became.
He was dearly loved by his family and inspired those who crossed his path with his encouragement.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Lee Clark--a devoted family man, a true Texas rancher, a pillar of his community, and a man who lived with steadfast purpose.
May God grant comfort and peace to Lisa, Candice, Madelon, and all who mourn his loss.
May Lee's memory be a blessing, and may he rest in eternal peace.
