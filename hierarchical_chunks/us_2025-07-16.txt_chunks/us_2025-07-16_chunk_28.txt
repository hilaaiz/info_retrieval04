Mrs. Washington was born on June 7, 1914, in Forkland, Alabama, and later moved to Lackawanna, New York, where she shared more than seven decades with her husband, 
Mr. James Washington.
Together, the loving couple became parents to Israel, Willie (Lott), Marvis (Washington), and Winona (Kirkland).
She is survived by many who loved her, including five grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, eleven great-great grandchildren, and one great-great-great grandchild.
Her love for her family and community left a lasting impact on all who crossed her path.
Respectfully known as ``Mother Washington'' to her congregation at Macedonia Baptist Church, where she served as a Sunday school teacher, member of the nurses guild, and President of the Mission Society, she is remembered for ministering to the youth, helping those in need, and as a joyful singer for the Lord in the church's choir.
