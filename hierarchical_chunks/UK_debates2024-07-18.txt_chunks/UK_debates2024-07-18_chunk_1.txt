It is an honour to follow  the hon.
Member for Bradford East (Imran Hussain)  and his impassioned words.
If I may address him directly—if you will oblige me, Mr Deputy Speaker—as well as other Members staking their claim to Britain’s best curry, it would be an honour on behalf of the people of Tewkesbury to join them in sampling great curry and determining a champion.
On a more sombre note, I am grateful that during the King’s Speech there was a commitment to a strategic defence review.
I remind the House that in 2016 the Russian President deployed a chemical weapon on the streets of Salisbury.
The lives of Sergei and Yulia Skripal were changed forever, as was the life of a courageous police officer, and a young mother lost her life.
Today, in 2024, the Russian war machine again deploys chemicals on the battlefields of Europe.
I hope that the strategic defence review will give due impetus to countering the renewed chemical threat.
I once held the honour of leading a parade at the Menin Gate ceremony in Ypres, commemorating those who gave their lives in some of the most vicious battles of world war one.
I have had the honour to call the salute at the national Cenotaph here in Westminster.
It is an honour in equal standing to deliver my maiden speech to the House on behalf of the people of Tewkesbury.
I follow a proud lineage of armed forces service, which includes my two brothers and my great-grandfather, Petty Officer Supply Charles Trenchard, who gave his life aboard HMS Illustrious in world war two.
I first moved to Tewkesbury 16 years into my own military career with the Royal Air Force assignment at Imjin barracks, so named after the battle of the Imjin river fought by the Glorious Glosters in 1951 while outnumbered 18:1.
Tewkesbury’s quaint Cotswold villages and towns, crowned by our beautiful abbey, now make for an idyllic environment to raise my darling daughter.
Should any Member of the House wish to don armour and join me at Europe’s largest annual medieval festival, they would be very welcome.
I pay tribute to my predecessor, the honourable Laurence Robertson, a Lancastrian who made north Gloucestershire his home and represented Tewkesbury for 27 years, winning at seven consecutive general elections.
My defeat of that particular Lancastrian, I must say, was not in keeping with the traditions set in 1471 by the Yorkists at  the battle of Tewkesbury; it was an altogether more peaceful affair, and I found Laurence to be dignified and humble as the result became clear.
Indeed, the closest thing to weaponry on show that morning were the daggers being stared at me by one member of his entourage, which I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed.
In defeating my predecessor, I became the first non-Conservative Member of Parliament in Tewkesbury since 1885.
The weight of history bears heavily, yet pales alongside the responsibility.
The only other time I have been elected in any capacity was by my fellow officer cadets on initial officer training course 60 at RAF College Cranwell, to represent them to the College Commandant, a one-star officer.
Immediately following that vote, my squadron leader Craig Gaul brought me to his office, swore that I was his man, but practically force-fed me his Debrett’s guide to etiquette and begged me not to end his career.
Six years on, he is no longer in the RAF, though I am unaware of any connection.
For my own part, I also had to hand in my uniform once it became clear that the changes so desperately needed by our most courageous and selfless public servants must take place within this House.
Our country finds itself at a crossroads.
The climate emergency presents an existential threat to humankind and to the ecosystems that support life on this planet.
We must collectively and decisively turn to face the threat now and export bold leadership to our neighbours across the world.
The future is in the hands of our young people.
We must equip them today so that they can apply their energy to the challenges of tomorrow, but we cannot expect young people to engage in their political future when the curriculum does not enable them to do so and while an imbalanced education system denies so many the opportunities of the privileged few.
Neurodiverse children are let down by a neurotypical education system built by neurotypical people for neurotypical people.
If we are to unlock the challenges of tomorrow with diversity of thought, we must harness the opportunity of neurodiversity.
Finally, trust in politics has never been more fragile.
It is the responsibility of us all to restore public faith in our political institutions.
I invite fellow Members in the Chamber to renew UK politics through respectful discourse, regardless of our differences, and by dedicating this parliamentary term to public service.
Voters will engage with politics only if they feel that their vote has value.
We must transition to an electoral system of proportional representation.
On behalf of the people of Tewkesbury, thank you.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Inverclyde and Renfrewshire West (Martin McCluskey)  on his excellent  maiden speech, which is difficult to follow.
I gently say that it is marred only by the fact that he did not reference two of his most famous constituents: William Kidd, the pirate, and my mother, who was born in Houston.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to take part in this important debate at the dawn of this new Parliament.
I also thank my colleagues for their wise counsel and help as I take my first steps here in the cockpit of democracy.
Defence is the No. 1 task of any Government, as we have heard, and I am proud that my constituency, Dumfries and Galloway, has many fine young men and women currently in our armed forces, and many gallant veterans who have served on air, sea and land.
Of course, like every constituency, Dumfries and Galloway has many people working in the UK’s world-class defence industry, which deserves our support.
I worry about using the expression “punching above our weight” in relation to our armed forces.
A British major general who served with distinction in Afghanistan, and who knows a lot more about conflict and boxing than I do, told me, “That’s a recipe for getting knocked out as soon as the bell rings.”
I pay tribute to my predecessor, Alister Jack.
I make it clear that, although such praise is customary on these occasions, I offer tribute not out of duty but out of genuine respect and admiration.
As a special adviser, I had a front-row seat for Alister’s tour-de-force performance as Secretary of State for Scotland.
Under his leadership, the Scotland Office, small but perfectly formed—not unlike myself—was a bantamweight bazooka, bang on target for the people of Scotland on issues including equality, the independence debate and the benighted A75 and A77 roads that are so crucial to Dumfries and Galloway.
I hope I can apply the lessons learned at the feet of the master for the betterment of Dumfries and Galloway.
I got the finest start possible there
and I want to make sure others get the same chances.
Only through marrying the talent and aspiration that abound in the south-west of Scotland with opportunities can we defeat that blight on all rural areas: depopulation.
We need the three J’s: jobs, jobs, jobs.
We have much work to do to make ours a go-to destination, not a go-through destination.
Blessed with a balmy climate, we are home to some of the country’s finest dairy herds.
Our unspoiled landscape is a tourism dream.
The terrain, for instance around Newton Stewart and Minnigaff, is ideal for cycling.
The Merrick, the Cairnsmore of Fleet and the Galloway hills are a delight for hikers.
Stroll on the beach at Killantringan—I will help Hansard with the spelling later—on the rugged Rhins peninsula, and you will probably have the golden strand all to yourself, and you will see our Northern Irish friends in this great Union just 14 miles distant.
Dumfries itself, astride the mighty Nith, is rightly lauded as the “Queen of the South”.
Erudite Wigtown is Scotland’s national book town, and there I picked up a copy of “If”, arguably the finest work by Rudyard Kipling.
His lines, “If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same”, resonate now on the Government Benches, where Labour Members are having a moment in the sun, but also on  the Opposition Benches, where the blue flame of Conservativism gutters in the storm, burns low, but does not go out.
Many suppose “If” to be about Kipling’s son, John, who was tragically killed serving with the Irish Guards in the great war.
In fact, it was inspired by Leander Starr Jameson, who grew up in my home town of Stranraer, after his father took editorship of the Wigtownshire Free Press.
That venerable newspaper is still in circulation, and I got my first and last journalism jobs there, as a trainee reporter and latterly as editor.
Jameson led a daring raid against the South African Republic in 1896.
Perhaps there is something in the pristine waters of south-west Scotland that instils a resilience and self-reliance in its people, for John Paul Jones, father of the United States navy, was also a native Gallovidian.
Jones unfortunately went pirate on us in the American revolution.
Locked in mortal combat with the Royal Navy off Flamborough Head in 1779, he is reputed to have said: “Surrender?
I have not yet begun to fight!”
I am proud, then, to have been elected to represent the redoubtable people of Dumfries and Galloway, inheritors of Jameson’s alacrity and Jones’s never-say-die attitude, both vital in today’s febrile times.
In conclusion, Bonnie Gallowa’ has a storied past and, I am determined, a bright future.
I shall endeavour, as Kipling didn’t quite put it, to keep the heid.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
It is a great pleasure to follow  the right hon.
Member for Wetherby and Easingwold (Sir Alec Shelbrooke) , and the excellent maiden speeches by my hon.
Friends the Members for Ealing Southall (Deirdre Costigan) and for Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme (Lee Pitcher).
It gives me great delight to address this House as the new Member of Parliament for Kensington and Bayswater.
I doubt that, for any of us, the last seven weeks have been easy.
I know that many hon.
Members will still be catching up on their sleep after the campaign trail, but having our twins born in the first week of the general election campaign took things to another level.
If timing is everything in politics, that is certainly not a combination I would recommend anyone repeat—but my children will obviously have a great story to tell when they are older.
I want to take a moment to thank the team at Queen Charlotte’s hospital and across the Imperial College NHS trust for their incredible care.
Our NHS staff deserve our utmost respect and support, and I hope in the future that Saint Mary’s, Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals will finally get what they need to become the first-class premises that patients and staff in our community deserve, including the delivering of plans for a brand-new St Mary’s hospital.
I pay tribute to my two predecessors in this new constituency.
Felicity Buchan worked hard for the residents of Kensington over the past five years, and I particularly commend her for her work on the Homes for Ukraine programme.
Some issues are central to our national and international security, which transcends party politics, and supporting the struggle for a free Ukraine is one of them.
I am grateful for her work on this issue.
In Kensington and Bayswater, we have a Ukrainian cultural centre, the Ukraine embassy and a substantial Ukrainian population.
Having personally worked to support democracy and anti-corruption in Ukraine for many years, I will make sure that our Ukrainian community continues to have a strong advocate in Parliament.
I was also fortunate enough to inherit part of Dame Karen Buck’s former constituency of Westminster North.
Under previous boundaries, she represented north Kensington for many years.
I know from experience that tens of thousands of residents have been directly assisted by Karen with expertise and empathy.
I hope I can emulate even a small part of her unwavering focus on tackling poverty and our housing crisis, whether that is by holding our social housing landlords to account, by protecting private renters, including by abolishing section 21 no-fault evictions, or by finally ending the outdated feudal leasehold system.
Karen did a monumental amount of work to advance those causes, and I am sure she was absolutely delighted with their inclusion in the King’s Speech.
She has always exemplified public service over self-interest.
I will do my best, along with my other colleagues who are inheriting her constituency, to live up to her legacy.
I know how grateful we are for her 27 years of service in this House.
Kensington and Bayswater is an incredible part of London, as many hon.
Members will already know—indeed, I canvassed many of them during the campaign and have already been picking up casework in the corridors.
We are an amazing community, with fantastic campaigners and organisations, businesses, entrepreneurs, charities, heritage, music, parks and schools.
There is so much going for it, but there is also a deep inequality that has widened in recent years.
There is now a 19-year gap in life expectancy between a woman born in Notting Dale in North Kensington and one born in Holland Park, only a third of a mile away.
That gap that has increased by five years in the past decade alone.
Over 6,000 children are living in poverty and over 3,000 families are on a growing housing waiting list.
We are rightly proud of our contribution to the nation’s economy in terms of growth, talent, innovation and finance in so many different industries, and we celebrate the tourists who come to visit our museums, Portobello Road and our parks, but we must also tackle the underlying causes of the inequality that prevents too many people in my constituency from reaching their full potential, whether they are housing, education or employment opportunities.
I know from the thousands of people I have met across our constituency that far too many feel like government is not working for them.
They see too many politicians putting political party before country and self-interest before community.
I know that trust in government and politicians has plummeted as a result, but it does not have to be this way.
I have spent my career working to make democracy work better in dozens of countries around the world by supporting reformers  in government to work with civil society to be more transparent, more inclusive and more accountable and to deliver for people on the priorities that they care about.
In Kensington and Bayswater, that means, for example, getting a grip on the dirty money in luxury property that still stains our community.
Despite recent progress in legislation, and despite the leadership that Baroness Hodge,  the right hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)  and many others have shown on this topic, we still have in our constituency one of the highest numbers of anonymously owned properties registered in tax havens, with loopholes allowing autocrats and kleptocrats to continue shielding their ownership.
Many of those properties sit empty, hurting our local businesses and schools and hollowing out our sense of community.
I agree that those that are frozen under sanctions should be utilised as soon as possible, so I am determined to build on our Kensington Against Dirty Money campaign and continue advocating for London to end its reputation as the dirty money capital of the world, and instead become the anti-corruption capital of the world.
There is no worse example of what happens when government stops listening to people and when transparency and accountability are discarded than what happened at Grenfell Tower over seven years ago.
Seventy-two people lost their life in an entirely preventable tragedy, yet we still do not have truth, justice and change for the bereaved, survivors and affected community.
These are people whose lives were changed forever on  14 June 2017  and who have had to wait far too long for justice and for those responsible to be held to account.
In the coming weeks, the second phase of the public inquiry will report.
I know that hon.
Members here will join me in looking to those recommendations to ensure that a tragedy like Grenfell can never happen again.
I warmly welcome the inclusion in the King’s Speech of the duty of candour law for public servants.
I applaud the effective campaigning of those affected by Grenfell, Hillsborough, infected blood and Windrush, and of others who have suffered because of an unacceptable defensive culture across many of our public institutions.
I hope we can look at further measures to ensure robust oversight of the implementation of the recommendations from those inquiries.
Kensington and Bayswater is a special place making a huge contribution to our national life in so many ways.
My hope is that, under this Labour Government, we will become a fairer place too, building on our strengths and addressing the inequalities that have held us back.
It will not be easy and it will not happen overnight—as a QPR fan, I have learned over many years to be realistic—but we have an opportunity now to restore faith and trust in government and democracy, and to restore our reputation internationally too.
But may I say how great it is to see you in the Chair for this debate, albeit in a temporary role?
And may I say, through you, that the Foreign Secretary wanted to be here for the debate, but he and the Prime Minister are hosting the leaders of over 40 European countries at the European Political Community meeting at Blenheim palace today—it is an important day for our country.
He will look forward to following the debate as soon as he returns.
I congratulate all 315 re-elected and returning Members of this House, and welcome in particular all Members who were elected for the first time.
Savour that special feeling when you first walk into this Chamber and sit on these green Benches.
Remember it; respect it.
Our constituents have given each of us their confidence; they have given us the mandate to serve them and the country.
Two week ago, I stood at my local constituency election count in a sports hall in Rotherham.
It is the honour of my life to stand at this Dispatch Box today as the Defence Secretary—as part of the new Government at the start of this new era for Britain.
The last time that I spoke at this Dispatch Box was a week before the election in 2010, as a housing Minister dealing with planning reform.
Even then, I warned that “there are fundamental flaws in the Conservatives’ proposed planning regime”.
However, my main argument on that day focused on accountability.
I said: “accountability is a central tenet”—[Official Report,
29 March 2010 ; Vol. 503, c. 611.] of public life, serious decisions and good government.
Having re-entered Government, I feel that just as fiercely as I did 14 years ago.
What we do, what we say and how we conduct ourselves in Government matters.
We must always be accountable in this House, to the public and to Parliament.
By doing that, we will help to regain trust in Government and return politics to public service.
I pay tribute to my predecessors, Grant Shapps and Ben Wallace, whom I shadowed for over four years from the Opposition Benches.
The House will now miss them both in differing ways.
They served as Defence Secretaries during what the Chief of the Defence Staff has described as the most extraordinary time for defence in his career.
That responsibility now passes to me.
I am grateful to have the support of such a stand-out ministerial team: the Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Liverpool Garston (Maria Eagle) ; the Minister for the Armed Forces, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (Luke Pollard) ; the Minister for Veterans and People, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham Selly Oak (Al Carns) ; and Lord Coaker in the other place.
The first duty of any Government is to defend the country and keep our citizens safe.
That is why I pay tribute, on behalf of the House, to the men and women who serve in Britain’s armed forces, many of whom are overseas on deployment right now.
They are rightly respected worldwide for their bravery and their professionalism.
We thank them for what they do to keep us all safe, as we thank those out of uniform in UK defence.
They will have this new Government’s fullest support to do their job in defending this country That is why at the NATO summit in Washington last week, the Prime Minister confirmed the Government’s unshakeable commitment to NATO, and our total commitment to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence.
It is why the Prime Minister launched this week a first-of-its-kind strategic defence review.
And it is why we announced in the King’s Speech legislation to create a new armed forces commissioner to improve service life.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
It is a great pleasure to follow  the right hon.
Member for Wetherby and Easingwold (Sir Alec Shelbrooke) , and the excellent maiden speeches by my hon.
Friends the Members for Ealing Southall (Deirdre Costigan) and for Doncaster East and the Isle of Axholme (Lee Pitcher).

I will look at all proposals, but I think the hon.
Gentleman knows that underground cables cost six to 10 times more; that is why the last Government did not agree to them.
If part of our challenge is to cut bills for people, that is not a sustainable solution for the future.
I am sympathetic to all MPs who raise issues on behalf of their constituents, but I gently say again to him that if we want to avoid a repeat of the cost of living crisis, if we want to tackle the climate crisis, and if we want energy security, we will have to build the grid in our country.
I wish to make it clear that I am once again waiving the provisions of the sub judice resolution in relation to this matter to allow Members to be able to discuss fully these issues of national importance.
(Urgent Question): I congratulate you on your re-election, Mr Speaker, and thank you for granting this urgent question, which is to ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade if he will make a statement on financial redress for sub-postmasters and outstanding issues relating to the Post Office Horizon scandal.
I congratulate the shadow Secretary of State on his new position and on securing the first urgent question of this Parliament.
Members will know that the Government made a key manifesto commitment to ensure that justice and compensation are delivered as swiftly as possible for every postmaster caught up in the Horizon scandal.
The Secretary of State has already met Sir Alan Bates, Kevan Jones and the chair of the Post Office, Nigel Railton, to discuss the progress being made and what more can be done.
The Government intend to make a significant announcement on the new redress scheme before the summer recess.
This scheme will apply to postmasters whose convictions have been overturned by the Post Office (Horizon System)
Offences Act 2024 passed in the last Parliament.
