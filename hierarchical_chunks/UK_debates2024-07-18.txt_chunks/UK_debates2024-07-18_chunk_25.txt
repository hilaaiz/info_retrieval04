Worryingly, last week there was an attack at the Gurdwara Nanak Darbar in my constituency of Gravesham.
Thankfully, nobody was seriously hurt, but I would like to place on record my thanks to the gurdwara first responders and all the emergency services for that.
Although the facts of the case are still unclear, the attack caused understandable anxiety in the local Sikh community.
Would the Leader of the House consider scheduling a debate on the importance of protecting worshippers in their sacred spaces so that they may practise their faith without fear?
My hon.
Friend raises a very important matter in her first question in this House, and I very much welcome her election and her attendance here this morning.
These are very serious matters, and I am concerned to hear about them.
She may be pleased to know that the first Home Office oral questions will take place on  29 July .
If she does not get the response that she wants then, I shall certainly raise this matter for her with the Home Secretary.
Congratulations on your re-election, Mr Speaker.
Will the Leader of the House find time for a statement on flood defences?
The last Parliament was on track to spend £5.2 billion on flood defences, including in communities like Severn Stoke and Tenbury Wells in my  constituency.
There are concerns that the incoming Government may cancel that spending, so will she timetable a statement and reassure us that that is not the case?
