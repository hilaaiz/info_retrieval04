I thank the hon.
Lady for her comments, and I welcome her to her place.
I congratulate the Liberal Democrats on their success and their results in the election.
They have an historic number of new Members of Parliament, although I am surprised that she did not bungee jump her way in this morning or rollerblade her way along from Members Lobby.
She and I have worked together in the past, and I look forward to our working together in the future.
