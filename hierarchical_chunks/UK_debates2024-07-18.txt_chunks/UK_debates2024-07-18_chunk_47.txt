The hon.
Gentleman raises an important matter.
A number of significant pieces of legislation failed to get through wash-up after the then Prime Minister took such an illogical decision to call an early election—one that I am sure Opposition Members are living to regret—but there will be a private Members’
Bills ballot in due course, which may be an opportunity to pursue the matter.
May I congratulate you on your re-election, Mr Speaker, and welcome the new Leader of the House to the Dispatch Box?
My Hastings and Rye constituents have suffered hugely because of the crumbling infrastructure of Southern Water.
People have been left without water for over five days on not just one but two occasions.
Residents and businesses have yet to be properly compensated.
The town centre of Hastings has been flooded twice, and we have seen record levels of sewage dumped in our sea and even appearing in people’s homes.
Will the Leader of the House look into when I can raise the matter in upcoming debates in the House?
