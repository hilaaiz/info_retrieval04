Double child rapist and murderer Colin Pitchfork was due to have his parole hearing last week in public, following my successful application to the chair of the Parole Board, who agreed to have it in public.
The parole hearing has been rescheduled to an unknown date, and only last week the chair of the Parole Board said in public, without writing to me, that she had cancelled her decision to have a public parole hearing for Mr Pitchfork.
I welcome the Leader of the House to her place.
Could we have an urgent statement on this matter or, better still, an urgent meeting with the Minister to discuss why the Parole Board is acting in this way?
As ever, the hon.
Gentleman raises an incredibly important issue.
For new Members who do not know, he has a strong track record in this place of raising such matters.
I will ask the Minister to meet him urgently to discuss this important issue.
Congratulations on your re-election, Mr Speaker.
I warmly welcome my right hon.
Friend the Leader of the House; I know she will do an amazing job.
In February 2022, MPs and peers passed an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to repeal the Vagrancy Act 1824.
However, the last Government failed to set out a commencement date for repeal, while trying to criminalise rough sleepers through the Criminal Justice Bill, which did not pass.
I am aware that many homelessness organisations have written to my right hon.
Friend, so can she give the House clarity on when the Labour Government will commence the section to repeal that Act, since it is already law?
Surely, 200 years on, it is time to consign the Vagrancy Act to the dustbin, where it belongs.
