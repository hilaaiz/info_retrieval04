I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and welcome her back to her place.
She was not here long before she had to face the electorate again, and it is great to see that she has been returned so convincingly.
She raises important matters about flood defence, as others have.
I note that the King’s Speech debate tomorrow will cover rural affairs, so she might want to raise those issues with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who I believe will respond to that debate.
