Mr Speaker, on behalf of the people of Stockport, can I congratulate you on your re-election?
I also congratulate my fellow Greater Manchester Labour MP on her appointment as Leader of the House.
I am certain that she will do a fantastic job.
Public libraries are a vital hub for communities across the nation, providing important spaces for drop-in sessions, internet connectivity, reading books and so much more, yet in my local authority of Stockport borough the local Liberal Democrat council is reducing staffed hours in our libraries—a move that threatens to leave many adults and children isolated and without access to critical services.
As such, will the Leader of the House allow a debate in Government time on our treasured public libraries?
