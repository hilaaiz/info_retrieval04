I thank the hon.
Member for his question, and join him in praising Lord Arbuthnot’s work in this area.
As of  31 May , £222 million has already been paid out in compensation.
There have actually been significant interim payments as well.
We understand that, while this is a very large scheme, it is important that we get early payments, so I assure the hon.
Member that interim payments are a very large part of this programme.
