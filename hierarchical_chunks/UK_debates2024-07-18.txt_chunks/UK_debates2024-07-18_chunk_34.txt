I welcome my hon.
Friend to his place with his election as the Member for West Ham and Beckton.
I am sure that he will be a strong MP for that new constituency.
He raises an important point.
Dealing with apprenticeships and apprenticeship reform, I hope that the announcement yesterday in the King’s Speech of the new Skills England body sends a signal of how important this issue is for the Government in delivering on our mission for growth and delivering opportunity for all.
He will have noticed that we have an education debate timetabled for next week, where he can raise the matter.
