I thank the right hon.
Member for her question.
Those are the principles that we want to address and carry on with from the previous Government: the system should be fair, swift and simple.
We know that postmasters have already gone through an incredibly difficult time.
We do not want to make it even harder by having a convoluted system.
We absolutely agree that justice should be fair, quick, complete and straightforward for people.
