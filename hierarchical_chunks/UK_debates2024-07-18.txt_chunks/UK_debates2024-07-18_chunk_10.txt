I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
He makes an important point.
Justice is one side of the coin, but there is also accountability for what has happened.
A lot of people want to see that: not just those directly affected, but everyone who has been outraged by the years of inertia and obfuscation that we  have seen in this scandal.
The purpose of the inquiry is to get to the heart of who knew what, who did what and who did not do what they should have done, and whether individuals should take some responsibility for their actions.
I have no doubt that, when those recommendations are released, we will want to see some very swift action on the back of that.
