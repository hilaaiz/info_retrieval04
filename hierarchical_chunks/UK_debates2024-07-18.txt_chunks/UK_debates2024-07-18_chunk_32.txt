I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and welcome her back to her rightful place in this House as the new Member for Grimsby.
I know that she will do a fantastic job for the town.
As she knows, one of our big areas of focus during the election campaign was town centre regeneration, and our planning and infrastructure Bill and other measures announced yesterday will focus on just that.
I look forward to working with her on the issue over the coming months.
