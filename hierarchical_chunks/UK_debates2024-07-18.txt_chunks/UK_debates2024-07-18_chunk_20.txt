I thank my hon.
Friend for that fantastic question, and welcome her back to her seat.
She is one of the most redoubtable champions in this place, and I know that she will be really pushing that cause and many others, as she did in the last Parliament.
I join her in congratulating Rhian on winning the primary school teacher of the year award, and thank all teachers across the country for the work that they do.
One of the first things the Education Secretary has done since taking office is look to reset the relationship with teachers, so that we can really tackle the recruitment and retention  crisis facing our schools.
As we come to the end of term, we join together in thanking every single teacher for the great work that they do.
