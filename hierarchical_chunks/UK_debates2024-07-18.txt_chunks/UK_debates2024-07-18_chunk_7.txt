Beyond compensation, one of the most important things that campaigners are looking for is consequences for those people who played a part in the creation of this scandal.
The Prime Minister has made much about the integrity and accountability of his Government.
Presumably that is retrospective.
What consequence does the Minister envisage for those current serving Government Ministers who are deemed by the inquiry to have been negligent in their conduct in ministerial office in the past?
That is a very important question.
It would be premature of us to draw conclusions before the inquiry has been completed but, absolutely, we should be looking very carefully at all those individuals whose behaviour unfortunately led to the scandal happening and to it taking far too long to address.
That is a matter for the inquiry to make recommendations on and, certainly, we will be looking to follow those up.
