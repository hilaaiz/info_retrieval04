Throughout my time in the House, I have campaigned for improved transport connections to serve my constituency, which at that time was Cleethorpes.
One such campaign was the restoration of the train service from Cleethorpes through Grimsby and Lincoln to Kings Cross.
The previous Transport Secretary had approved that service, and I understand that it is now with Network Rail and LNER to complete the necessary arrangements.
May we have a statement from the new Transport Secretary confirming that that service will indeed begin in the winter timetable?
The hon.
Member raises a good point.
He and I have discussed transport issues, and I support his call for greater transport infrastructure investment across our regions, and especially in the north, which I am afraid was distinctly lacking under the previous Government.
I will raise that matter with the Transport Secretary, and I have no doubt that she will come before the House in due course.
As I said in the business statement, she will bring forward a Bill the week after next, and he could raise those issues then if he has not heard from her before.
May I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your re-election?
My constituency has a large number of villages and a rural contingent.
While I welcome the announcements yesterday in the King’s Speech, I wonder whether there is further information about how we will deal with flooding and, in particular, the flood resilience taskforce.
Although we are in the summer, we will fast approach the winter.
