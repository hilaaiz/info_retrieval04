I thank my hon.
Friend for his best wishes and for that important question.
Libraries and access to them play a vital role in our communities, supporting local people and children with their education.
I am afraid that the previous Government hollowed out local government funding over their 14 years in office.
They promised levelling up, but in fact we got years and years of cuts.
I will make sure that the Culture Secretary has heard my hon.
Friend’s question and supplies him with a reply.
