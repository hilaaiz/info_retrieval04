I welcome all new and returning Members to this 59th Parliament.
It is a Parliament to be proud of and one that reflects our country better than ever before.
There are more women than ever, more Members from ethnic minority backgrounds and more Members from the LGBT community.
It has been a real pleasure to see the excitement and possibilities of new Members—over half the House is new—as they find their way around this often baffling maze of a place.
I saw that one had described it as being like freshers’ week meets Hogwarts and Buckingham Palace.
Let us hope that they do not all drop down with freshers’ flu.
