Some 26 postmasters implicated in the scandal in Northern Ireland are worried and concerned.
It is imperative that all postmasters feel that they can have an open and frank discussion with no fear of repercussion in the upcoming investigations, and there can be no further unwarranted delays.
Can the Minister confirm that, as a priority, he will make sure that postmasters have access at every level to ensure that their concerns are addressed and that he will make every effort to take steps in the right direction?
Thank you so much, Mr Speaker.
I do not see why that point should have come last.
[Laughter.]
What a surprise to see the hon.
Member in his place today.
I am sure that this will not be last time that we have an exchange across the Dispatch Box, but he does raise an important point.
We absolutely agree that we need to make it as easy as possible for postmasters to raise their concerns and to get the justice that they have so long waited for.
I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your return to your place, and the Minister on taking up his appointment.
Compensation is one part of this, but what victims of this scandal, such as Betty whom I met, want to see are truth and accountability.
I am referring not just to Ministers, to whom my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North West Hampshire (Kit Malthouse)  referred, but to those involved in the scandal.
What can the Minister say to people in the Post Office and to Betty, who want to see those responsible in the Post Office properly held to account, as well as the compensation for their suffering?
