I welcome the shadow Leader of the House,  the right hon.
Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp) , to his new role.
I know that he has always been keen.
After holding very many ministerial roles, I congratulate him on finally making it as a full member of the Cabinet—albeit with the word “shadow” before his title.
I hope that the role lives up to his ambitions.
Debates about leaking roofs, broken toilets and the price of a bacon butty in the Members’ Dining Room all await his close attention.
I am keen to work with him and we have already had constructive discussions.
I am clear that I want to take the whole House with us on the changes that we need to make.
