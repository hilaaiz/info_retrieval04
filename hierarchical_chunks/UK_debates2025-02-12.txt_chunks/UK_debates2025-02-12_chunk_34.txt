I thank the hon.
Lady for her ongoing work and campaign on that important issue.
The cross-Government bereavement group continues to look at how we can improve access to the support that children and young people need at those difficult times.
Of course I will ensure that she gets the meeting she wants with the Minister to discuss this further.
