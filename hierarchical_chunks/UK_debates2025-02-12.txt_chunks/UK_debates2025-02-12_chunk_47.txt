I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
We have launched the clean industry bonus, which will be crucial in protecting our supply chain.
We are investing through GB Energy and the national wealth fund—I have already mentioned lithium in Cornwall.
Through the global clean power alliance, which we launched at the end of last year, we will bring together our counterparts from other countries, including at the International Energy Agency conference in April, to look at a supply chain mission to deal with these issues.
These issues do not just affect us in this country.
As other countries seek to decarbonise and increase the role of renewables, we will all need to co-operate and deal with the capacity issues across the supply chain.
