I was pleased to hear the Minister confirm the importance of our energy security, in contrast to what we saw under the previous Government.
[Interruption.]
Opposition Members can groan all they want, but that is the reality of what was inherited in July last year.
As we extend energy infrastructure in this country, can my hon.
Friend the Minister confirm how this Government will ensure that we have control of the operation of that infrastructure?
Does she agree it is vital that through the industrial strategy we see a renaissance in our manufacturing and greater resilience in our supply chain, all of which adds to the energy security of this country?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right that dealing with capacity issues in our supply chain is a crucial part of getting this investment into infrastructure.
It is one of the reasons why, through the national wealth fund, we invested in lithium in Cornwall last week.
Through the critical minerals strategy, we want to maximise the natural resources that we have, where we can.
As I have said, we want to make absolutely sure that security concerns are addressed as well when we look at which investors invest in our new economy.
