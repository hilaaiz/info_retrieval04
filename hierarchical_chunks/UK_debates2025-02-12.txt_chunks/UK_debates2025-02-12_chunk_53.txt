Yes, that international co-operation is absolutely crucial.
It means talking to countries with which we share a great deal in common and which are signed up to the same objectives, but it also means talking to other countries to bring them with us.
That is why we are hosting the International Energy Agency summit in London in April, why we have set up the global clean power alliance, and why the Prime Minister went to the COP climate change talks in Baku last  autumn and showed international leadership, which was very much lacking from UK Governments of previous years.
Clearly, national security concerns are being expressed across the House.
Will the Minister ensure that the construction, maintenance and access to software will be carried out by British workers in British shops, and will not be subcontracted to foreign powers?
As I have said, I cannot comment on individual cases, but there are processes to ensure that our national security is protected as we look ahead.
