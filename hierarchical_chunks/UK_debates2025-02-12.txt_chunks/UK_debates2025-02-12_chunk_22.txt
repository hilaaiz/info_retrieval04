I thank my hon.
Friend for raising an issue that is obviously of real concern to businesses in her constituency.
We expect landlords to meet their obligations to make buildings safe, and we support robust enforcement action from the regulators if they fail to do so.
I will ensure that my hon.
Friend secures a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss what steps can be taken in this particular case to support the businesses on which her constituents rely.
