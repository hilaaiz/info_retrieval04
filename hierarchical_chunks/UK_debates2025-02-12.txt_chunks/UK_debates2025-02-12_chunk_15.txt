The Conservatives secured a £450 million investment from AstraZeneca to expand its Merseyside vaccine factory.
When the Chancellor wrecked the deal, AstraZeneca tried to save it by increasing that investment to over £500 million.
Why did Labour still walk away, handing jobs and investment to our competitors?
The deal that the hon.
Gentleman says the Conservatives secured was announced in March.
The general election was in July.
Where was the deal, the funding or the written agreement?
There was nothing.
When Labour negotiates, Britain loses.
AstraZeneca is investing more than £4 billion in Singapore, the US and Canada.
It could have invested in our country too.
What is Labour doing to bring back the deal that it destroyed?
There was a deal by WhatsApp that was never followed up by the Treasury or Ministers.
[Official Report,  12 February 2025 ; Vol.
762, c. 285.] (Correction) There were no meetings between AstraZeneca and the Conservative Government.
Their Government let Britain down every time, which is why the country turned to Labour, and Labour is delivering.
The payment systems regulator found that more than half of bank transfer scams recorded in 2023 originated on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp.
What progress has the Secretary of State made to ensure that tech companies are held to account for fraud originating from their platforms?
My hon.
Friend makes a good point.
We need to look at that specifically at the Committee stage of the Data (Use and Access)
Bill.
Perhaps he will sit on the Bill Committee.
