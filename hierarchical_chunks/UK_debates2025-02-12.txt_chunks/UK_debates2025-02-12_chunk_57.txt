The Minister will be aware that the costly environmental obligations that the Government impose on home-manufactured goods are not adhered to by many other nations, which often prevents UK manufacturers from being able to compete.
Does the Minister agree that those considerations, as well as the routine human rights breaches of Chinese business against the Uyghurs, Falun Gong, Christians and other ethnic minorities, should be equally weighted with costs?
Human rights and Chinese production will never add up; that must inform any contract offered by this nation of ours.
The hon.
Member has frequently raised almost every issue that one could think of, but he and I have taken part in many debates about human rights in countries of concern over the years, and he is absolutely right to flag those concerns.
As I have said, we have the solar taskforce and the supply chain mission with the global clean power alliance.
We are very much alert to those matters.
We do not want to see forced labour or any form of modern slavery in our supply chains.
We are determined to take action on that.
