I thank my hon.
Friend for strongly advocating for her constituency in Medway to become an AI growth zone.
She will well know that the “AI Opportunities Action Plan” outlines the steps we are taking so that the UK can build the cutting-edge computer infrastructure needed to lead in AI development and deployment.
I eagerly look forward to reading expressions of interest from hon.
Members’ constituencies.
I will be more than happy to meet her to discuss this in detail.
