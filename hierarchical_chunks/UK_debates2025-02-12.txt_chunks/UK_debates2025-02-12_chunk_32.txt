I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this really important issue.
Hospital admissions for allergies have risen sharply in the last two decades.
I welcome the work of the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation.
We will respond to the recommendations  of the national allergy strategy group in due course, and I will make sure my hon.
Friend gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss it.
