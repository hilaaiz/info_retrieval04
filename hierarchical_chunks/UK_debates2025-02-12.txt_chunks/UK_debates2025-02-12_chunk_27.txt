The Prime Minister will, I am sure, want to congratulate Newcastle United on reaching the league cup final after Arsenal’s exit.
In National Apprenticeship Week, will he also congratulate the 600 apprentices learning trades, from welding to quantity surveying, as part of the Tyne bridge restoration programme?
While I know that he cannot confirm bridging the funding gap left by the Tories, will he confirm that he is looking forward to seeing the Tyne bridge restored in time for its 100th birthday in 2028?
I am going to struggle to sound delighted with the result of that particular football match, but it will be a special day for Newcastle fans.
The Tyne bridge is an iconic north-east landmark and I congratulate the apprentices who are helping to restore that vital piece of infrastructure.
As usual, the Tories made empty promises that they had no intention of keeping, including £2.9 billion-worth of transport commitments that were never funded.
We will look at the capital projects around the spending review and let my hon.
Friend know as soon as we can.
My  constituents Peter and Maureen have been married for 70 years.
Peter is 93 and for the past few weeks has been  stuck in a hospital ward waiting to go home because a care package has not been arranged.
Peter is missing home and missing Maureen.
Will the Prime Minister reassure my constituents the social care crisis will be tackled this year?
