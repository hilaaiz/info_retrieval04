I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this vital issue.
It is not the first time it has come up.
We are supporting mainstream schools to increase SEND expertise while also establishing dedicated SEN units, because we need to make sure that special schools can also cater for those with the most complex needs.
We are working on this.
It has come up time and again, but we are taking those vital initial steps.
