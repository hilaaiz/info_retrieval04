I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue and the particular case of her constituents.
I also know that this is deeply personal to her and, if I may, I extend my deepest sympathies to her and her family for their loss.
We have taken immediate action on social care.
We have already delivered £3.7 billion of additional investment.
We are working on the first ever fair pay agreement for the sector and, of course, we are boosting carer’s allowance.
I invite her and everybody to work with the House on the longer-term reform that we need.
