The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 12 February.
This week, we progressed our Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill to deliver counter-terrorism style powers to bring vile criminal smuggling gangs to justice.
We announced a further £350 million to get Britain building and deliver 1.5 million new homes that our country desperately needs, including more affordable homes.
We have also slashed the red tape that holds businesses and working people back, creating 10,000 more apprentices.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
I am proud to have played my part in helping to draft what has become the Employment Rights Bill.
A new poll shows that three quarters of the British public back the stronger workers’ rights in the Bill, including better sick pay, yet that lot over there—the Tories and Reform—disgracefully voted against it.
In fact, the Leader of the Opposition does not even believe in maternity pay or the living wage.
Our statutory sick pay is ranked as one of the lowest in Europe; it needs to be brought in line with the living wage.
Will the Prime Minister back my campaign to strengthen the Bill further so that sick pay is at a level that will finally stop punishing workers for being sick?
Our plan for change delivers the biggest upgrade in workers’ rights in a generation through our Employment Rights Bill, ending exploitative zero-hours contracts and the scandal of fire and rehire and expanding statutory sick pay to 1.3 million employees.
Of course, that is on top of the pay rise for 3 million of the lowest paid.
I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition might support the protection of day one employment rights, given where she is going, but she thinks maternity pay is excessive.
Our plan is pro-worker and pro-growth.
