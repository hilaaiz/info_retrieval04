I thank my hon.
Friend for the campaigning work she does on this subject as an MP and as co-chair of the important all-party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation.
The independent pornography review is a wide-ranging and thorough piece of work to assess the effectiveness of pornography legislation, regulation and enforcement, including online and offline regulation.
The review has concluded and the final report will be published in due course.
I put on the record my gratitude to Baroness Bertin for her hard work.
