The Conservative Government established the Ukraine family scheme.
In total, more than 200,000 Ukrainians—mostly women, children and the elderly—have found sanctuary in the UK from Putin’s war.
However, a family of six from Gaza have applied to live in Britain using this scheme, and a judge has now ruled in their favour.
That is not what the scheme was designed to do.
This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand.
Are the Government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?
Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision.
The Leader of the Opposition is right that it is the wrong decision.
She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last Government, according to their legal framework.
However, let me be clear: it should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the Government who make the policy.
That is the principle.
The Home Secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case.
