I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the important role that local communities play in supporting healthy lifestyles.
I am delighted that we are providing almost £4 billion for the local health services that people rely on—things like health visitors, stop smoking services and drug abuse treatments.
I will make sure that she meets the relevant Minister to discuss this issue.
