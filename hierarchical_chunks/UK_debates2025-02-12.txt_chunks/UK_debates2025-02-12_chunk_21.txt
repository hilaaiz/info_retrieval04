The Prime Minister has not read the judgment.
I suggest that he does so.
Very serious questions are now being asked about the Attorney General, the Prime Minister’s personal friend and donor.
Even Labour Ministers are concerned.
One Labour peer, Lord Glasman, has called him “the absolute archetype of an arrogant, progressive fool”.
If we are serious about protecting our borders, we need to make sure that we appoint people who believe in our country and everything we stand for.
It is not clear that the Attorney General does.
The Government are now recruiting a new chief inspector of borders, who lives in Finland and wants to work from home.
This is not serious.
Why should the British public put up with it?
The individual in question was appointed in 2019 by the last Government to a senior position.
He then worked for five years from Finland.
We have changed that, and he will now be working from the United Kingdom full time.
It was Finland under them.
The Leader of the Opposition talks about the Attorney General; she sat round the Cabinet table with an Attorney General who was later sacked for breaching national security.
Long-standing traders in the CPS Centre in Culcheth were devastated to receive eviction notices giving them just 28 days to vacate the premises, entirely out of the blue and on spurious pretexts from the new owner, the shell company Shivat Haminim Capital.
So far, the owner and its legal representatives have failed to hear tenants’ concerns and mine, and to negotiate a way forward.
Does the Prime Minister share my concern about this situation, and will he set out our plans to protect independent businesses that are the heart of our high streets and communities?
