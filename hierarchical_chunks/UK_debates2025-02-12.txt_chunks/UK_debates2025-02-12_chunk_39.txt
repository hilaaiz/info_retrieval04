The protection and security of the energy sector is an absolute priority for this Government.
We have a range of effective measures in place that give the Government powers to balance an open investment environment to facilitate growth with protecting the areas of our economy that are most sensitive to national security.
The Government firmly believe that the biggest risk to our energy system and energy security is remaining dependent on international fossil fuel markets, controlled by petrostates and dictators.
That is why we have a mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower to end that dependence.
We have a world-leading offshore wind industry in the UK and international investment plays a crucial role in supporting jobs across the country.
As part of that mission, my Department engages in discussions with a wide range of investors, including those from other countries.
We are also clear that alongside that, the growth of UK supply chains is critical.
That is why we have set out plans for a clean industry bonus to drive investment in manufacturing, as well as setting up Great British Energy and the national wealth fund.
The Government will not hesitate to use our powers to protect national security whenever we identify concerns, and we will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK’s relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.
The Government will co-operate with China where it can, compete where it needs to and challenge where it must.
