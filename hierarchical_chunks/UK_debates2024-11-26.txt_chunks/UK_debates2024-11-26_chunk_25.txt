It is  nearly eight months since an attack by the Israel Defence Forces on a World Central Kitchen convoy killed seven aid workers, including three Britons: James Henderson, John Chapman and James Kirby.
Does the Foreign Secretary agree that their families deserve to see accountability and justice for their deaths?
It was very important for me to meet the families of those people a few weeks ago.
The killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, including those British nationals, in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza on  1 April  was appalling, and a matter of great concern.
We continue to urge the Military Advocate General in Israel to proceed with a proper investigation and inquiry, and to get on with it as quickly as possible.
