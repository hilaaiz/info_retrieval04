I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He served in Haringey before taking up his place in this House and we have been good friends over many years.
He is right to raise this issue.
We said that illicit finance would be a priority, and it will be.
I hope to make further announcements on the back of the sanctions announcements that I made this week.
