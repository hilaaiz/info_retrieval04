The Secretary of State’s plans to make our energy expensive and unreliable will see jobs fleeing to more polluting countries, because it is cheap energy and innovation that matter in the race for jobs.
We need only ask China, which dominates clean tech supply chains and is the world’s largest polluter.
That is where billions of pounds of our taxpayers’ money will be going to pay for his rushed transition—from our country, with all the investment that it has made in clean power, to a country still 60% powered by coal.
We are talking about low growth, high bills, jobs lost and even blackouts, for more carbon in the atmosphere.
That is the opposite of what he has been promising.
In Baku, while the Secretary of State was signing us up to these targets without talking about what they will do to the lives of British people, he was also signing away billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.
He signed us up to a $300 billion annual climate finance target.
I am afraid that it is not credible to say that taxpayers will not have to pay more.
They will have to pay more, and they deserve to know how much more.
Will he tell us today what that new target will mean for British taxpayers?
Considering the increase in the target, the public will rightly question why countries such as Russia and particularly China, now the world’s largest polluter and second largest by historical standards, will not be obliged to pay a penny—I think he tried to insist that they would, but it is very clear that they will not be obliged at all to pay in—while Britain, which has invested billions in cutting its emissions and accounts for only 1% of global emissions, will have to pay more.
Will the Secretary of State also set out an assessment of the   impact of increased reliance on coal-powered Chinese imports for his 2030 zero carbon plans, and of what that means for global emissions?
