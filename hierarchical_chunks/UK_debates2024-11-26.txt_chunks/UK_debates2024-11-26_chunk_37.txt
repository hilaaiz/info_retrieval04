I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
I echo his comments on Storm Bert and thank the emergency services for all that they have done to help those in need.
I start by passing on my personal condolences to the right hon.
Gentleman on the passing of John Prescott.
I know that he wanted him to lead the Paris accords in 2015, having admired his work in Kyoto, and I believe that, at the time, he described John as good at “bashing heads together”.
I hope that, as the Secretary of State’s opposite number, I can achieve some of that head-bashing that he so clearly valued in John.
