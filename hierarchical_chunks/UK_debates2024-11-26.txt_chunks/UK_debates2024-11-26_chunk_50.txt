I welcome the Secretary of State’s statement today and the agreement reached at COP29 in Baku.
He and I go back a long way on COP, so we know what it is like when it goes wrong.
I particularly welcome the nationally determined contribution to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 81% by 2035.
Does he agree that the fundamental reason we have leadership on the global stage now, as distinct from what we have had for the past 14 years, is  not just because of the target, but because we have a plan?
This COP was supposed to be about implementation, and where we lead on implementation, others will follow.
