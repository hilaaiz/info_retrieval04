Let me pick out a couple of the points she made.
First, the point about the devastating effects of the climate crisis already being apparent is important.
Part of the danger is that those effects will end up being the new normal, and we will just think of them as part of life.
They are part of life in a sense and, as she said, we need the right flood defences in place and so on, but we also need to realise that those effects will get significantly worse if we do not act.
Future generations will, frankly, hold us in infamy, saying, “You knew about the scale of the devastation and had seen a preview of what was to come, and you decided you couldn’t act,” so she is absolutely right.
Secondly, let me gently correct the hon.
Lady on the warm homes plan.
We are getting on with the warm homes plan; indeed, announcements were made last week about actions that will help over 300,000 families benefit from homes upgrades next year.
There were announcements about heat pumps and a whole range of actions to help families do better and lower their energy bills.
I will make one more point, which is part of what the hon.
Lady was saying: this is a climate crisis and a nature crisis.
It is a climate and biodiversity crisis.
It was  a bit disappointing that the nature part of the agenda at COP did not get the attention it deserved, and that will be important for COP30 in Brazil.
