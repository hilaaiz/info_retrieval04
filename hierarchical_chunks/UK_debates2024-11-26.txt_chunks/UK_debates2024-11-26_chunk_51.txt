My hon.
Friend is right.
She was with me at Copenhagen, and I definitely had Copenhagen post-traumatic stress disorder at the talks at various moments in the middle of the night.
Her point about the target and actions is absolutely right, and there is global recognition that this Government have upped the pace in the multiple ways I described in my statement, and that is incredibly important.
That is also important because business sees it happening and thinks that Britain is a country that is clear about its direction and that they will invest there.
I can only speak for North Norfolk, but a green energy future is exciting for our local economy, especially at Bacton.
Just along the coast, villages like Happisburgh are suffering from being part of the fastest eroding coastline in Europe.
The Secretary of State touched on coastal erosion in answer to my hon.
Friend  the Member for South Cotswolds (Dr Savage) , but can I push him specifically on how the outcomes of COP will provide reassurance to my residents who are worried about losing their homes to coastal erosion now?
