I thank my hon.
Friend for his remarks on that important treaty work; I know he takes a keen interest in matters relating to UK-German relations.
We continue to engage with German colleagues from across the spectrum.
We are keen to get this treaty agreed as soon as possible.
For me, it naturally fits with our NATO membership and the new enhanced dialogue we have with the EU on security and defence matters.
