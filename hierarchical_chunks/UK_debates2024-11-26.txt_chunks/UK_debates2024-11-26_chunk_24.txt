I thank the right hon.
Lady for raising the situation in Hong Kong, which formed a substantial part of our conversation.
Of course we raised issues relating to Jimmy Lai—as I have said in the House before—and the security law in Hong Kong.
There are disagreements between us, and we were very clear about that.
The right hon.
Lady can be sure that matters involving both our representation in this country and China’s representation will pass through our system in the usual way without Government interference.
