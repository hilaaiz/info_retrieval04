I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s announcement that the UK will sanction Russia’s so-called shadow fleet, but I understand that the UK has not levied a single fine for breach of the existing sanctions on Russia’s oil.
Will the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor now take more robust action to ensure that UK sanctions are complied with?
