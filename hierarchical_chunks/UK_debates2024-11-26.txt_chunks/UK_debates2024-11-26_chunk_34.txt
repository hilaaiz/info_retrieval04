With permission, Mr Speaker, I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Lord Prescott.
He was a fighter for social justice and a champion of the environment.
He rightfully has global recognition for his role in negotiating the Kyoto protocol, and he showed how politics can change lives for the better.
I send my deepest condolences to Pauline and his family.
