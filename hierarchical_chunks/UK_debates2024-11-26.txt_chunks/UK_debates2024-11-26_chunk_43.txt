May I gently say to the shadow Secretary of State that she really should not believe dodgy headlines in The Daily Telegraph?
In fact, I am not sure whether headlines in The Daily Telegraph are ever not dodgy, based on what she was quoting.
More importantly, though, let me congratulate the Prime Minister on his leadership at the conference of the parties, and the Secretary of State on leading the negotiations, and not least on delivering the £300 billion of climate finance for developing countries.
He set out this country’s achievement since the general election; to what extent will the combination of what this country showed at COP and what we have delivered at home since  4 July  encourage countries around the world to play their part in addressing the climate crisis?
My hon.
Friend asks an important question.
Two truths came out of COP: first, the transition is unstoppable and, secondly, it is not going fast enough.
There is such a difference from a decade ago—my hon.
Friend, who was there with me, is nodding in agreement—because every country knows that the climate crisis is happening and is affecting them.
The testimony I heard was like the testimony that we could provide about what people are seeing.
Every country knows they have to act, and while they all face constraints in acting, they also know—this is the big change from a decade ago—that it is massively in their economic interests.
There is a race on for the good jobs of the future, and the clean energy transition can provide them.
