Given that the UK is the penholder for Yemen, will the Minister explain why the Government continue to support Israel when it has admitted to the killing of Yemen’s Prime Minister and other Ministers and is causing widespread devastation?
What steps have the Government taken to support Yemen in achieving peace, reconstruction and development, and in ending the humanitarian crisis?
Mr Speaker, as there has been a number of different reports on this, let me clarify that we believe that it is the Houthi Prime Minister, rather than the Yemeni Prime Minister, who has recently been struck.
The Houthis, as the House knows, are a threat not just to the people of Yemen and to the region, but to international shipping.
I have engaged closely with the Yemeni Government, including with both the previous Yemeni Prime Minister and the current Yemeni Prime Minister, who I am happy to report is still alive.
