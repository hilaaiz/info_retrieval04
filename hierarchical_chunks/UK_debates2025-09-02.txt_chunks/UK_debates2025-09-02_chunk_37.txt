My right hon.
Friend asked about energy costs.
We are seeking to ensure that there is a viable steel industry into the future and that those companies currently talking to the official receiver about wanting to take over and invest in Liberty can do so in a way that will make them money.
On the charges we are reducing—the 60% to 90% super-charger extension for network charge relief—to give an example, it will mean about £4 to £5 relief per tonne of steel produced.
We know that Liberty is not producing what it can at the moment, but two or three years ago it would have been producing about 300 tonnes of steel per year, so it would have saved up to £1.5 million on its energy costs.
That is a substantial reduction and something that I am sure he will welcome.
On the liabilities, of course we want to be as honest, open and transparent with the House as we possibly can.
A lot of the liabilities are with the creditors at the moment.
We want to come to the House as soon as we can to ensure that we are setting out the costs that we incur.
My right hon.
Friend is right that the steel strategy this year needs to be bold, and we will of course look to the work that his Committee has done to help us in that.
