I thank my hon.
Friend for those remarks; they are gratefully received, and we will continue to do all we can to support the steel industry.
She is absolutely right that a number of apprentices were due to start this week, but the official receiver took the decision that, given that the 12-month continuation of the apprenticeships could not be guaranteed, it was right to try to find them other placements.
I am taking a close personal interest in what happens to those 50 people.
I know the local authority and the Department for Education are trying to ensure that we can find other places for them.
I want to make sure that we can do so, because one of the things this Government are passionate about is ensuring that our young people have the apprenticeships to give them support for the jobs that we know we need into the future.
