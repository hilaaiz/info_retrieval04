I thank my hon.
Friend for her sustained engagement in these issues.
As the Foreign Secretary has said, we talk regularly to hostage families in Israel and to participants in Israeli politics right across the spectrum, and we will continue to do so.
We make our disagreements with the Israeli Government clear, both in private and in public, and we will continue to do that, too.
