Of course, I speak to officials and other Ministers, and to the steel industry, about these issues all the time.
We are lucky to have the Steel Council that we put together—trade unions, industry and others who are helping us to develop what we think will be an ambitious steel strategy that will ensure that the steel industry will not decline.
The strategy will ensure that we will not be in the position we are currently in, where only 30% of the steel we use in this country is made in this country, and that we will be in a position where we can protect those good, experienced jobs and those good people who we want to support and make sure the industry grows.
You will be aware, Mr Speaker, that as long as I have been an MP, I have been coming to this Chamber arguing for support for Speciality Steel in my constituency.
I politely say to the shadow Minister that the difference in response from this Government is night and day from what I had under the Conservatives.
I personally thank the Minister, and the Secretary of State, for having such an open-door policy to me and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Dr Tidball) .
I know the Minister is doing everything she can to save this speciality business.
One of the first actions of the official receiver was to release approximately 30 apprentices who were due to start their training in the next few weeks.
Can the Minister reassure the House that the Government will not only commit to the business but acknowledge that it can survive only with its highly skilled, committed, professional staff and that she is as committed to them as she is to the business?
