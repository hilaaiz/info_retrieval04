I thank the hon.
Lady for her remarks.
She is right to ask about how we ensure that this nationally strategic asset is protected, and we are doing that.
I have just set out the reduction in energy prices that the steel industry as a whole will benefit from—extending the super-charger from 60% to 90% to give network charge relief, which will bring significantly lower costs for energy prices for our steel industry.
We are prioritising the procurement of British steel where the Government are spending money, because we believe that that is the right thing to do.
We have already introduced protections for steel trading, and we are ensuring that we do everything we can, talking to our US counterparts all the time, about reaching a conclusion on the negotiations on the steel tariffs.
I am optimistic about those conversations.
