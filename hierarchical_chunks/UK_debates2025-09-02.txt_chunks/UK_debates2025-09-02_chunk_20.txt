The Business Secretary is due to travel to China next week to restart trade talks.
His trip will fall 50 days after Beijing announced its latest round of extraterritorial bounties, targeting 19 pro-democracy Hongkongers, including several more UK-based activists.
In an earlier answer, the Minister laid out the many steps to sanction the Georgian Government for their assault on democracy.
Will the Foreign Secretary implore the Business Secretary to cancel his trip and press for a block on all UK ministerial visits to China until Beijing rescinds those bounties?
In June, the Minister for Security, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Barnsley North (Dan Jarvis) , and I met the UK activists targeted by the Hong Kong arrest warrants and bounties.
We have raised concerns regarding the arrest warrants and bounties directly with the Chinese ambassador here in London, reaffirming that the safety and security of Hongkongers in the UK is of the utmost importance to the Government.
The matter is being raised at all levels—by Ministers and by the Foreign Secretary, and will indeed be raised, if there is such an occasion in the future, leader to leader.
I share the anguish and profound distress of my constituents over the conflict in Gaza.
Many of them have friends and family in the region; they are living with that torment every day.
The Minister will have seen hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens marching for a release of the hostages and for a ceasefire.
What are the UK Government doing to support those citizens and the Opposition parties in Israel, who are being so let down?
