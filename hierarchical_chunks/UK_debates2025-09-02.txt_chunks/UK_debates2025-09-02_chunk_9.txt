Given that the Foreign Office has not agreed with Mauritius a defined financial allocation for the Chagos marine protected area; given that no additional money has been secured or ringfenced for environmental protection; given that no one who would be involved in the administration of the marine protected area has so much as visited the archipelago; given the very little communication between the Mauritius Government and the British scientific community, who currently protect the area; given that the capacity of Mauritius to patrol the archipelago for poachers is unknown; and given that it is not clear whether the dispute mechanism set out in the treaty can even be used if the UK deems that Mauritius is in breach of its marine protection commitments, what are the Minister’s hopes for this absolutely unique and priceless marine protected area?
Can that all be fixed by the memorandum of understanding?
Order.
Sorry, but I have a lot of Members to get in.
I have given the Chair of the Select Committee a lot of leeway.
It might be worth her putting in for an Adjournment debate, if there is so much to say on the subject; I would be more than happy with that.
