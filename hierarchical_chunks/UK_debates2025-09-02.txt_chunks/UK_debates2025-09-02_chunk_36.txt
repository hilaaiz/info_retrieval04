I thank my right hon.
Friend for those helpful questions.
He reminded me that the shadow Minister had asked about the US.
Of course, we are in a position where the world has tariffs of 50% on steel and aluminium; we have 25%.
We are working with our US counterparts to reach a conclusion to those negotiations.
My right hon.
Friend will know that the President is due to come to the UK and, of course, we will be doing all we can to get that negotiation concluded at pace.
