The Secretary of State reiterated the issue of the conditional recognition of the state of Palestine.
If the Government want to do that, would it not be better equally to make it a condition that any future state of Palestine does not threaten the right of the state of Israel to exist, and that  if anyone carries out terrorist actions from any future state, they will be handed over to the international authorities?
There have been important commitments about the future nature of any Palestinian state, including from President Abbas, who said that any such state would be demilitarised.
There was absolute clarity in New York—where we made the announcement about the recognition decision—that Hamas can have no future role in Gaza and that a future Palestinian state must pose no threat to an Israeli state.
Two states requires two states living in safety and security and posing no threat to each other.
