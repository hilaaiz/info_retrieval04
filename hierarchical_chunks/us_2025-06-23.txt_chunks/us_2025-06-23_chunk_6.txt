Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to recognize and honor Culver Police Chief Wayne Bean for more than four decades of dedicated service to the Town of Culver and the broader law enforcement community as he enters retirement.
Chief Bean, a lifelong resident of Culver and Union Township, graduated from Culver Community Schools and began his law enforcement career as a reserve deputy marshal in 1980 for the Culver Police Department, becoming a full-time deputy in 1982.
His leadership quickly stood out as he was promoted to deputy chief in 1991 and chief of the Culver Police Department just a few years later, a role he has held with distinction for more than two decades.
Throughout his career, Chief Bean has served with professionalism, bravery, and compassion.
He supported law enforcement efforts beyond Culver, including service as a reserve officer with the Argos Police Department in the 1990's and again from 2007 to 2012.
Chief Bean has been involved in numerous complex and critical investigations.
In one particularly heroic incident, he assisted in defusing a dangerous standoff, disarming an armed individual who was threatening family members, thereby preventing serious harm or loss of life.
Chief Bean also championed traffic safety and enforcement, recording over 60 DUI arrests in a single year, and worked tirelessly to modernize the department's equipment and operations to better serve the community.
Beyond his law enforcement duties, Chief Bean has remained active in civic life.
He is a long-standing member of the local Fraternal Order of Police, having served as president and currently serving as vice president.
