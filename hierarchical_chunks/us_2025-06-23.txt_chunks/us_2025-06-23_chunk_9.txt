Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an Altoona native, Penn State graduate, and newest Captain of D.C. Fire and EMS, Jordan Wiley.
Jordan studied Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh before receiving his Master of Public Administration from Penn State University.
In October of 2014, Jordan joined the D.C. Fire and EMS Department as a Firefighter and Paramedic.
In nearly eleven years of service, Jordan was awarded the department's `Paramedic of the Year' award in 2019 and earned promotions to Sergeant in 2020, Lieutenant in 2022, and Captain in 2024.
However, the most important milestone for Jordan was when he met his wife Catelyn and started a family with their two children, Russell and Madison.
Jordan has dedicated so much of his time, in and out of the firehouse, to serving his fellow community members.
As a cancer survivor himself, Jordan is instrumental in efforts to promote cancer awareness and prevention within the department.
Cancer-related deaths are rising among firefighters, and Jordan's advocacy will help save lives.
Jordan is also an advocate for the National Marrow Donor Program, working to save lives by connecting bone marrow donors with patients who have life-threatening blood disorders such as leukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell.
Jordan has faithfully served his community and fellow Americans for more than a decade, both as a paramedic and as an advocate for cancer patients, and I know his parents, Frank Wiley and Dr. Mary O'Leary Wiley, are incredibly proud of the man and father he has become.
Along with everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I want to congratulate Captain Wiley on his selection to lead the D.C. Fire and EMS Department and thank him for his continued dedication to our fellow Americans.
