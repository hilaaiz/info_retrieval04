Mr. BEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I seek to recognize the English Empowerment Center (EEC) in Falls Church, Virginia and to congratulate the volunteers, instructors, students, community partners, and many others who will be recognized at the 63rd EEC Recognition Ceremony.
The mission of the English Empowerment Center is to teach adults the basic skills of reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English so they can access employment and education opportunities and more fully and equitably participate in the community.
EEC provides the crucial first steps of language and literacy proficiency for workplace, citizenship, and community integration to help adults make measurable improvements in their lives.
Last year, they served more than 2,000 adult learners, with the help of over 500 volunteers who gave 24,000 plus hours of service.
Each year the EEC recognizes students and members of the community who have contributed their time, energy, and resources to achieving the organization's mission.
EEC will also award the prestigious Patricia M. Donnelly Merit Scholarship, the Mid Allen Ries Award, and they will also announce the inaugural Gerry E. Connolly Empowerment Award.
I include in the Record the following recipients:
