Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure to honor the life of 
Ms. Alfonsina Diaz--a World War II survivor; lifelong educator; a woman of God; mother, grandmother, and great grandmother to her family and community; and most importantly, her legacy of 100 years of life that demonstrate the values of spiritual strength and the significance Known to her family and friends as Ancin, she is the eldest of six children born to Maria Santos Tanaka Diaz and Joaquin Flores Diaz.
Despite her childhood and much of her youth remembering the painful occupation of the Japanese during World War II, she intentionally lives and chooses to carry her life with the spirit of resilience and joy.
A fond memory of her youth includes working alongside her sister Cecilia Tanaka Diaz Reyes, first cousin Matilde Cruz Baron, and aunt Asuncion Tanaka Santos at Tommy's Soda Fountain.
Owned by her uncle Tom Santos Tanaka, Sr. and father Joaquin Flores Diaz, it was a popular spot for the teenagers during the 1950's.
She always had fun when she worked.
After graduating from high school, she worked at C.L. (previously Sinajana) Elementary as an elementary school teacher for the 1st to 3rd grades.
She met her husband and they've stayed together since marrying in June of 1950.
When they moved to Agana Heights, they've welcomed their seven children: Carmelita, Robert, Marie, Joaquin, Martha, Daniel, and Nora.
As she raised her family, she continued to be a fulltime teacher.
The love she had for her job can be felt through her previous and present students--
