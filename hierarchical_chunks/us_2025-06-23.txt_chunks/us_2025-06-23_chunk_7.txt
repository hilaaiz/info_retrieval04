Mr. Speaker, Chief Wayne Bean's legacy is one of steadfast dedication, courage, and unwavering commitment to public safety.
As he retires, I join the residents of Culver and law enforcement professionals across the Hoosier state in thanking him for his outstanding service and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.
