Education continues to be one of life's most essential tools and as we've seen in our own community, literacy is the foundation for unlocking education, career paths, and personal growth at any age.
As a lifelong learner and a current student at George Mason University, I know firsthand the power of education.
I am deeply grateful to the Center and it's remarkable, participants, volunteers, and staff for championing literacy as a lifelong and life-changing skill.
I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the English Empowerment Center and congratulating each of the honorees of the 63rd EEC Recognition Ceremony.
I wish all of them great success in their future endeavors.
