Mr. EVANS.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor The Philadelphia Tribune, the Nation's oldest continuously published newspaper serving the African American community, as it proudly celebrates its 140th anniversary.
Since its founding in 1884 by Christopher James Perry Sr., The Philadelphia Tribune has been a steadfast voice, uplifting and amplifying the stories, struggles, and triumphs of African Americans in Philadelphia and beyond.
From its humble beginnings as The Weekly Tribune, a one-page publication, the newspaper has grown into an esteemed institution, documenting pivotal moments in our Nation's history and reflecting the rich tapestry of African American life and culture.
Under the visionary leadership of figures such as Eugene Washington Rhodes, who championed civil rights and community empowerment, and Robert W. Bogle, its current President and CEO, the Tribune has expanded its reach and impact.
Through its publications, special editions, and community events, The Philadelphia Tribune has celebrated Black history, fostered civic engagement, and highlighted the achievements of African Americans in the Greater Philadelphia region.
Over its 140 years, the Tribune has garnered numerous accolades for its excellence in journalism and public service, including the A. Philip Randolph Messenger Award for Outstanding Journalism and the ``Russward Award'' for Best Newspaper in America.
These honors underscore the Tribune's commitment to truth, equity, and advocacy.
The legacy of The Philadelphia Tribune is not just about chronicling the past; it is about empowering the present and shaping the future.
As it continues to serve as a vital platform for African American voices, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating The Philadelphia Tribune on this historic milestone and in celebrating its enduring contributions to our society.
