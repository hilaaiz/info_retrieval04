Mr. BEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Wesley Housing as they mark 50 years of service to our community.
I am incredibly appreciative of the vision, dedication, and tireless work that the team at Wesley Housing does to address the critical need for affordable housing in Northern Virginia.
Wesley Housing was established by Virginia Peters in 1974 in response to a community-led poverty study that revealed the lack of viable housing solutions for many families.
Since its inception it has cemented itself as an independent nonprofit committed to changing lives through access to safe and affordable rental housing units.
From its groundbreaking in 1979 with the first property in Fairfax County, Wesley Housing has grown into one of the mid-Atlantic region's largest and most respected providers of affordable housing.
To date, the organization has developed or acquired 2,915 units across 40 properties, positively impacting the lives of over 25,000 individuals and families.
But Wesley Housing's influence extends far beyond the walls of its buildings.
Through collaborative partnerships and a holistic approach to resident support, the organization empowers families to build better lives, break the cycle of poverty, and overcome deep-seated racial inequities.
Wesley Housing's commitment to excellence and its transformative work in the region have earned the organization numerous accolades over the years.
In 2022, the Housing Association of Nonprofit Developers (HAND) named Wesley Housing ``Nonprofit Developer of the Year'' for the third time, recognizing the organization's ongoing contributions to affordable housing.
Other prestigious honors include the SatisFacts' Resident Superior Award, which Wesley Housing has won seven consecutive years due to exceptional ratings from residents, and recognition from Affordable Housing Finance, which ranked Wesley Housing among the ``Top 50 Affordable Housing Developers'' in 2021.
I am honored to celebrate Wesley Housing's important milestone and want to express my deepest gratitude to the entire team, its partners, and the countless individuals who have benefited from its life-changing work.
Wesley Housing's continued success is a testament to the power of community-driven solutions and its unwavering commitment to improving the lives of those who need it most.
