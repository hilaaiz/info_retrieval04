Mr. MULLIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Councilmember Alvin L. Royse, fondly known as ``Al,'' for his decades of exemplary service to his community, his profession, and his family.
As Councilmember Royse completes his third term on the Hillsborough City Council, it is appropriate to reflect on his remarkable legacy of leadership and dedication.
Al was born in 1950 in the Peace Garden State of North Dakota as one the public by serving two terms in the North Dakota Legislative Assembly, where he championed key issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment.
He was later inducted into the University of North Dakota School of Accounting Hall of Fame and was awarded the University of North Dakota Sioux Award for Distinguished Achievement and Leadership.
He served as Mayor of Hillsborough in 2021 and 2022, bringing his deep expertise and collaborative spirit to the role.
Al has served as Public Works Commissioner since 2021, after serving as Finance Commissioner from 2013 to 2020.
His tenure on the Council has been marked by his steadfast advocacy for fiscal responsibility and sustainable infrastructure development.
Beyond his contributions to local government, Al's impact extends to national service.
A retired Senior Partner with Deloitte & Touche LLP, he distinguished himself as Global and U.S. National Managing Partner for Tax Industries, among other leadership roles.
A Certified Public Accountant and attorney, Al has also lent his expertise as a consultant to businesses and a lecturer on global economics, corporate ethics, and leadership development.
Al's contributions to nonprofit organizations are equally significant.
He is a past National Chairman of both the American Heart Association and Voices for Healthy Kids.
His work for these organizations earned him numerous accolades, including the 2021 Gold Heart Award and the 2024 Morgan Stark Memorial Award from the American Heart Association.
Locally, he has supported education, youth sports, and civic organizations, serving as a leader for groups such as the Hillsborough Schools Foundation, Boy Scouts, and Peninsula Family Service.
A proud resident of Hillsborough since 1985, Al raised his children, Matthew and Jennifer, in the community.
Al's role as a father, grandfather, and active participant in his children's lives has been a source of immense pride.
An avid skier, tennis player, and history enthusiast, Al is looking forward to spending more time with his grandchildren, traveling, and pursuing his-love of reading following his time on the Hillsborough City Council.
Al's tenure is a testament to his unwavering commitment to public service.
