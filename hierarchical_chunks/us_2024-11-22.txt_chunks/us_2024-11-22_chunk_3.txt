Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday Winifred was born on December 10, 1924, to Thomas and Frances Marsh at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, California.
Born the middle child between her two sisters, Wilma and Georgia, Winifred attended Emerson Junior High School followed by Kern County Union High School, which is known today as Bakersfield High School.
Even back in those early years, Winifred recalls the societal and technological milestones she felt in her life and the community around her, like when her family discarded their ice box to buy their first refrigerator after her father quit the Union Ice Company.
With her sisters, Winifred brought life to the emerging Bakersfield community, attending performances, ice skating, and enjoying ice cream sodas at Dewar's Candy Shop.
Following her graduation from high school, Winifred attended summer school at a junior college in the Pasadena area, where she found a lifelong passion for bookkeeping.
She soon met her first husband, Jim Bolin, with whom they had a daughter, Marcia.
Winifred later met Vince Bittleston, an Air Force officer stationed at Minter Field, and the couple would soon be engaged.
They would bring a son into the world in 1946--Lawrence Thomas Bittleston--and a second son in 1947--Allan Lee Bittleston.
Vince flew planes in World War II and the couple would share a love of aviation and travel for their entire lives.
In 1947, the couple launched a crop-dusting business where Winifred managed the bookkeeping, bills, and inventory, and Vince handled sales and flew the planes.
Two years later, with the crop-dusting business growing, the couple built a three-bedroom house together and owned their first washer and dryer.
To spend more time as a family, Winifred and Vince later moved to a home in Buttonwillow and bought their three children a horse.
Finding herself in a new town, Winifred became involved nearly in every local community
