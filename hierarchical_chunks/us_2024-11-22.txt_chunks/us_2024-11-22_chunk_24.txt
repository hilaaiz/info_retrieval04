Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the life.
Glen Tate.
He passed away this year after a long life spent advocating for the Independent Cattlemen's Association.
Born in February 1948 in Corpus Christi, Texas, Dr. Tate's childhood was spent on a small farm near Victoria, and quickly moved to Devine.
Here, his love for all animals, but especially horses and cattle, was born.
Dr. Tate took this love and turned it into a career.
In 1973, after graduating from Texas A&M, Tate received his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and opened two practices, with one in Alberta, Canada, and the other in Lytle, Texas.
Beyond his business successes, Dr. Tate was also renowned for his heifers.
His Brangus heifers were frequently the highest selling in many special replacement female sales.
An avid rodeo fan, Dr. Tate traveled across this continent to watch the sport and spend time with his treasured friends in team roping.
Dr. Tate was especially dedicated to the Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, where he served on the ICA Board of Directors and chaired the committee on animal health and safety.
He was also an active member of the South Central Texas ICA chapter and served on their board.
In 2019, he was awarded the South Central Texas Independent Cattlemen's Association Trailblazer Award at the annual ICA convention.
Dr. Tate is survived by his wife of 55 years Diana and 3 children, Justin, Jennifer and Gaylyn.
Glen especially loved family time with his 6 grandchildren--Lane, Bradley, Tyler, Taryn, Dalton and Josie, as well as 3 great grandchildren--Cohen, Stevie Lynn and Lottie Jane.
