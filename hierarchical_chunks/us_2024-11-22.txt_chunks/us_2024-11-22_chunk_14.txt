Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Juliana Burns, an esteemed member of our Napa community, as she retires from 37 years of service with the United States Postal Service.
Postmaster Burns began her career as a letter carrier in Vallejo and Napa before advancing to serve as a postal customer service supervisor in multiple cities.
She also worked as a postal instructor in Oakland, Maryland, and Oklahoma.
Postmaster Burns later managed Consumer and Industry Affairs at the Postal Headquarters in Washington, D.C.
During this period of her career, she participated in a national roundtable on the development of new postal vehicles.
Postmaster Burns was also instrumental in establishing postal customer call centers in New Jersey, Michigan, and Los Angeles.
Additionally, she demonstrated her commitment to accountability by conducting financial audits under the direction of the Office of the Inspector General.
As Postmaster in St. Helena, Napa, and now Oakville, Postmaster Burns exhibited strong leadership.
Following the Napa earthquake and devastating wildfires, she ensured uninterrupted mail service and introduced free P.O. Box delivery for residents who lost their homes, a lifeline to many rebuilding their lives.
The role of a postmaster requires meticulous organization, clear communication, and the ability to adapt under pressure.
Postmaster Burns has consistently embodied these traits, guiding her teams with grace, and fostering trust and reliability among postal employees and the community she served.
Her ability to lead through challenges while prioritizing the needs of others is a hallmark of her career.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Postmaster Burns has been a beacon of inspiration within our community.
In 1983, she proudly held the title of Miss Napa County, a testament to her grace and charisma.
She is affectionately known by many as their ``Favorite Postmaster,'' a reflection of the respect and admiration she has earned in our community.
Postmaster Burns resides in Oakville with her husband, Steve.
She is the proud mother of three adult children, Jordan, Samuel, and Addison, and is the loving grandmother of five grandchildren.
