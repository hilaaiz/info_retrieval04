I appreciate the importance of aviation to the Northern Ireland economy and thank the hon.
Gentleman for his interest in this matter.
As the Minister responsible for aviation, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)  said in answer to substantive questions, airports are currently seeing their busiest times ever.
This Government feel that our approach to APD is proportionate given the fantastic demand we are seeing.
Reliable bus services are not just a privilege; they are the backbone of communities across my constituency, and connect individuals to schools, jobs, financial services and social interactions with family and friends.
Rural communities in Northumberland deserve the same opportunities as our more urban regions.
Does the Minister agree that as the Government’s better buses Bill proceeds to its further stages, we must not overlook rural voices on the services that they need?
Improving bus connectivity in rural areas is vital for kick-starting growth.
Our Bus Services (No. 2) Bill will give local leaders the powers they need for their communities, including in Northumberland, which as part of the North East combined authority was allocated £23 million in 2025-26 to improve services.
