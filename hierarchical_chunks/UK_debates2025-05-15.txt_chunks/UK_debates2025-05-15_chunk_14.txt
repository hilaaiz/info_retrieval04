I welcome my hon.
Friend’s question.
The previous Government failed to act and, like her, I am determined to tackle pavement parking.
That is why I have met representatives of Guide Dogs, Living Streets, Sustrans and Transport for All to discuss this very important issue, which is absolutely fundamental to the safety and accessibility of our public realm.
I can assure my hon.
Friend that I am on the case, and I look forward to setting out the way forward very soon.
