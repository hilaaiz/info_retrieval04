I thank the Minister for her efforts towards improving access to driving tests.
However, in my constituency of Broxtowe, I continually get emails saying that people are struggling to book tests due to a shortage of examiners.
Will she provide us with an update following the instruction made last year to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency to double the number of examiners being trained?
