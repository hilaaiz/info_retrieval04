I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
This year, we are providing local authorities in England with £1.6 billion of funding for roads maintenance, including more than £75 million for the East Midlands combined authority, of which over £4.3 million is for Derbyshire.
Those councils can now get on with the job.
We have also introduced new reporting requirements, meaning that from next month people will be able to see exactly what their councils are doing with that money.
We will end Britain’s pothole plague.
