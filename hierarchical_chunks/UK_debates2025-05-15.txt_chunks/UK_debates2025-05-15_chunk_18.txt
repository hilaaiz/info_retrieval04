I thank the Minister for her answers and for all she did on this issue in her previous role as Chair of the Transport Committee.
Regulations prohibiting pavement parking already exist in London, but that alone will not solve the problem.
At All Saints’ primary school in south Wimbledon, for example, pavement parking is a long-running issue, forcing parents and children into the road and obvious danger, and it is proving very difficult to solve.
Has the Minister considered how the public can be better educated and restrictions enforced?
Are the Government planning to create a new offence of obstructive parking, as the Minister recommended in her previous role?
