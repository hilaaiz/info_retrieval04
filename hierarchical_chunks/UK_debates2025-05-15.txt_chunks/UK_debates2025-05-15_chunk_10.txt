As we approach the summer holidays, we know that many families are looking forward to the opportunity to get away.
However, in what may come as concerning news, Labour’s Employment Rights Bill could threaten passengers’ ability to travel without disruption or additional costs.
This is because in existing passenger rights legislation, under article 5(1)(c)(i) of Regulation 261, passengers are entitled to compensation if they are informed of cancellations less than two weeks before their flight.
The Employment Rights Bill reduces the required notice period for strike action in any industry from 14 days to 10 days, increasing the risk of last-minute cancellations.
That could in theory cost airlines tens of millions of pounds, which could in turn lead to higher costs for passengers as airlines pass the expenses on to the travelling public.
Does the Minister agree that the Government should maintain the 14-day notice period in aviation, putting the interests of passengers ahead of those of their union friends?
The shadow Secretary of State will forgive me if I have not read that sub-paragraph that trips off the tongue.
This Government will always put passengers first.
That is why more passengers than ever are flying in our skies and leaving our airports.
The Department is fully engaged with the aviation sector at all stages, including on this issue.
What steps she is taking to reduce the backlog for driving tests.
Last month, the Secretary of State announced further measures to tackle the unacceptable  driving test backlog, including doubling training capacity for driving test examiners and offering overtime pay incentives to provide extra tests.
That will create up to 10,000 extra tests a month.
We are determined to get Britain’s drivers moving.
