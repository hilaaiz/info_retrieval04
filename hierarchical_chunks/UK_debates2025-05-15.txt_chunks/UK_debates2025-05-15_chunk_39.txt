We should never forget that the crisis in our prisons that the current Lord Chancellor is seeking to resolve was created over 14 years by the irresponsible mismanagement of the previous Government.
Although today’s announcement makes sense in the short term, subject to safeguards, we must consider the whole way in which recall has developed, from 100 cases 30 years ago to more than 13,000 today—over 15% of the prison population—with less than 30% of recalls being for further offences.
Will the Government consider the way in which recall operates?
Without the freeing up of space in prisons, rehabilitation is impossible, overcrowding reaches ridiculous levels and we run out of space altogether.
My hon.
Friend is right: the recall population has doubled in just seven years and we need to address that.
The independent sentencing review will report shortly, and I hope that there will be recommendations to which we can respond in that report.
