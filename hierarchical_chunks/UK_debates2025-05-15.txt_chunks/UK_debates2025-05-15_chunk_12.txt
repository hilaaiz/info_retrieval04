My hon.
Friend is right to raise this issue.
We are holding the DVSA to account for successfully implementing the measures in last December’s seven-point plan.
Some 165 new driving examiners have already passed their training and are working in driving test centres, and last year the DVSA provided 1.95 million tests.
This month, it will launch an accelerated consultation on improvements to the test booking system to end the reselling of tests and the exploitation of learners, which is completely unacceptable.
Does the Minister acknowledge that part of what has happened as a result of the pressure tests has been a displacement of learner drivers to test centres in rural areas, where they perceive that there might be less waiting time?
That is prejudicing against local applicants.
Will she do everything she can to ensure that local applicants for tests get priority?
The right hon.
Gentleman raises an important point.
We know that people are booking tests in parts of the country where they have no intention of taking a test, because they can swap that for a test in another driving test centre.
That is one of the issues addressed in the call for evidence that was launched in December.
We have heard that evidence, and we will consult on further changes to the booking system that might address the issue that he raises.
