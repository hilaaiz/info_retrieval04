At the last transport questions, on  27 March , in the context of the Secretary of State saying on television that some strikes are  “necessary”, I pointed out that the trade unions have welcomed her rail reform plans and said that “a just transition to nationalisation would mean the levelling up of pay and conditions for rail workers.”
The cost of that to the taxpayer would be considerable.
When I asked the Secretary of State whether she would “consider a strike over harmonising pay and conditions to be a necessary strike”,—[Official Report,  27 March 2025 ; Vol. 764, c. 1099.]
she avoided answering the question, which was uncharacteristic of her.
I will give her another chance now: would that be a necessary strike?
The answer I gave to the shadow Secretary of State’s previous question was that if, as an operator of the railway, we felt it was necessary to take a strike on grounds of safety, we would, of course, put the safety of the travelling public first—that will always be the case.
On the harmonisation of terms and conditions, we need to bring legislation forward to establish Great British Railways.
We will have many discussions with our trade union colleagues in a constructive way while ensuring that we provide value for money for the taxpayer.
Project Willow supports the potential of sustainable aviation fuel to bring jobs to Grangemouth, if the right policies are in place such as flexibility on the cap on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, and expediency on the revenue certainty mechanism.
What is the Department doing urgently to assess, integrate and implement the recommendations of Project Willow and to support accelerated investment at Grangemouth?
My hon.
Friend is a doughty champion for the Grangemouth refinery.
He asks what we are doing: yesterday, we introduced the SAF Bill to bring forward the revenue certainty mechanism, and we continue to consider the Project Willow report and its recommendations.
