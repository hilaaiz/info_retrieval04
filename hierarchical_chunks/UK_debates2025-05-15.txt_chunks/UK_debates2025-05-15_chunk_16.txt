I thank the hon.
Lady for her support in acting to tackle what is a nuisance not just for disabled people, but for children walking on the pavement and for parents pushing buggies and prams.
It is really important that we get this right.
I am working speedily with my officials to do so, and I look forward to being able to announce the outcome of the consultation and our next steps shortly.
