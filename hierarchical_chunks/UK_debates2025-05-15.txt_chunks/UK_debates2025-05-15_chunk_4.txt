The Secretary of State was asked— What steps she is taking to help ensure the transport system supports economic growth.
What steps she is taking to help ensure the transport system supports economic growth.
Economic growth is this Government’s top priority, and a reliable, well-connected transport network is critical to driving prosperity.
That means delivering local priorities in places such as Huddersfield and Hyndburn, including through West Yorkshire’s £830 million city region sustainable transport settlement and the local transport grant for Lancashire combined county authority.
The Government have rightly prioritised rail as a key factor in the future viability of our transport infrastructure.
There exists in Hyndburn an outstanding opportunity to create a freight rail terminal that would fit with the Department for Transport’s targets for increasing rail freight capacity by 75%.
The proposal also adds value in increasing east-west rail freight capacity, which must currently pass through Manchester.
Sadly, no progress was made on this under the last Government.
Does the Secretary of State agree that a north-west freight strategy should be a priority, and will she meet me to explore the potential of this as a priority project in the north-west?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight the importance of rail freight, and I am clear that with a reformed railway, we must do more to shift freight from the roads to rail.
I am keen that Network Rail works collaboratively with industry to develop terminals where there is either current demand or the potential for future growth.
If there is viable interest in developing this land, my officials and Network Rail would be happy to engage with interested parties.
