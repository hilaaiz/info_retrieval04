I thank the Minister for her response, and I am really pleased to see that she is committed to addressing pavement parking.
It is absolutely essential  that it is addressed for my constituents in Redhill, where it is a real problem.
As the Minister will know, Guide Dogs has been running a campaign for many years on addressing pavement parking, given the impact it has on those who are visually impaired.
Given the Minister’s enthusiasm for solving this problem, can she please give us an idea of the timescale for delivering a solution—not the recommendations, but a solution—so that those with visual impairments and my constituents can navigate pavements safely?
