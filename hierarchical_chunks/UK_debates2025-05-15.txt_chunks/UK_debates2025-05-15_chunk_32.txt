At yesterday’s Transport Committee hearing, the Minister for Local Transport outlined the measures that the Government are taking to reverse the 15-year decline in bus services.
The measures will protect many at-risk bus routes and may deliver a few more, but as they deliver growth and reduce congestion, do the Government have a wider ambition to ensure that all rural and non-city areas in England have at least a basic level of bus service so that everyone can get to school, work and the shops, and use public services without needing to drive a car?
I have to say, I really enjoyed my appearance at the Select Committee yesterday.
Ultimately, we want people to choose to take the bus because it provides better connections in every part of the country to get people where they need be.
It is a more reliable, more affordable, faster and more integrated form of transport, and I hope to see that in debates with Members across the House as the buses Bill proceeds.
Farnborough airport’s noise and emission pollution affects a significant part of my constituency.
The airport has announced that it will be launching its consultation to expand in August.
This has obviously brought a lot of concern from residents groups and campaigners, who are worried that people will be away at this time.
What can the Minister do to ensure that there is maximum engagement with the public and therefore a proper consultation?
