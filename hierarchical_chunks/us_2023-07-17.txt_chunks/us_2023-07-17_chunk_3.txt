Mr. Speaker, the story of Confluence is uniquely American and important to our commonwealth's rich history.
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I congratulate Confluence on this remarkable milestone and look forward to building on this storied history over the next 150 years.
