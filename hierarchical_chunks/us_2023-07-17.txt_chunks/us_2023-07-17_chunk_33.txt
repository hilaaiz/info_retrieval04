Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER.
Mr. Speaker, I was present in the House chamber and attempted to vote on an amendment, but the vote was not recorded.
This was the Blumenauer Amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.
Had the vote been recorded, it would show that I had voted Nay on Roll Call No. 298.
