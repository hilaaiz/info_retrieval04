Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Columbia Independent's Scholar Bowl Team on their victory in Missouri's Scholar Bowl State Championship.
Asher, Sophie, Elijah, Emily, and Graham conquered the tournament, averaging an impressive 150 points higher than their opponents in each round.
As winners of the first team state championship in their school's history, the Lions should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championship to their school and community.
