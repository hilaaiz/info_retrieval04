Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Columbia's Rock Bridge Track and Field Team on their victory in the Class 5 Track and Field Team State Championship.
Rock Bridge claimed the Class 5 title in 2021, 2022, and now in 2023.
The Bruins fought through an intensely close state championship.
They worked incredibly hard, entered the final event up 15.5 points, and finished strong to win the title.
The Bruins should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championship to their school and community.
