Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I congratulate the Washington County Agricultural Fair on its 225th anniversary.
I thank the staff, volunteers, and exhibitors for the important services they provide to southwestern Pennsylvania communities and hope for their continued success over the next 225 years.
