Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Aneira Banwar for her volunteerism, service, and acts of kindness.
Aneira started volunteering at the age of 5.
As she began this journey, she realized that there are limited opportunities for children to donate their time.
This gap led her to create the ``12K plan''--12 months of kindness.
This plan consists of 12 monthly kindness projects that kids can do at home.
Recently, Aneira assembled and donated more than 500 ``boredom buster kits'' for patients at a local children's hospital.
She accomplished this project by inspiring others in her community to join her in making the kits.
Now 7 years old, Aneira has logged more than 100 hours of community service.
Her hope is to encourage other children to volunteer in their community, because she believes that kids ``hold the power to shape and change the future in a positive way by performing random acts of kindness 1 month at a time.''
