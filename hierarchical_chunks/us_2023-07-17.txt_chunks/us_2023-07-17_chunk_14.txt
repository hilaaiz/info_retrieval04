Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Father Tolton's Olivia Andrews on her victory in Missouri's Class 2 3200 Meter Run State Championship.
Olivia claimed the Class 2 title with the impressive time of 11:02:24, achieving a school record and Class 2's fastest time of the season in the 3200-meter run.
She ended her high school career with a bang as she dominated her last race before she heads off to college next year.
Olivia should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championship to her school and community.
