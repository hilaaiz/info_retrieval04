Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Eldon High School's Zoe Martonfi on her victories in Missouri's Class 3 1600 Meter Run, 800 Meter Run, and 300 Meter Hurdles State Championships.
Zoe claimed her first ever state titles at the Class 3 championships.
Not only did she win one race but conquered her next two events as well.
Zoe led the pack in the girls 1600-meter run, then won the 800meter run less than two hours later in addition to the 300-meter hurdles.
Zoe should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championships to her school and community.
