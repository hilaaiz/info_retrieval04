Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Russellville's Trinity Riggs on her victory in Missouri's Class 2 Shot Put State Championship.
Trinity claimed the Class 2 title for the Indians, ending her high school career with an incredible throw of 11.93 meters.
She should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championship to her school and community.
