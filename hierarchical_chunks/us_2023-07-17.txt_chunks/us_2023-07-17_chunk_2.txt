Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Confluence, Pennsylvania, and its important contributions to southwestern Pennsylvania.
In 1870, the Confluence Land Company purchased an area in the Turkeyfoot Valley and laid out the town.
Named for its location as the meeting point of Laurel Hill Creek and the Casselman and Youghiogheny Rivers, the town grew quickly and was incorporated as a borough just 3 years later, in 1873.
By 1883, the town was already home to 450 people.
Shipping and commerce were critical to the town's early prosperity because of its easy access to both water and railroads.
Today, Confluence is a hub of outdoor recreation.
Visitors to Confluence can enjoy many miles of adventurous hiking at nearby Ohiopyle State Park, scale the tallest Pennsylvania mountain at Mount Davis, bike through the Great Allegheny Passage, and enjoy some of the best boating our Nation has to offer.
The region's incredible fall foliage adds even more appeal to Confluence's already amazing natural scenery.
