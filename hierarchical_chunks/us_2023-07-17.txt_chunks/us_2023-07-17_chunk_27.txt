Senators, Representatives, State Legislators, Mayors, and nongovernmental organizations across the Division's seven-state regional footprint of New Mexico, Arizona, California, Texas, Nevada, Oklahoma, and Arkansas.
Further, as a Congressional Legislative Liaison Officer, he is responsible for legislative actions with professional organizations, defense industry partners, and veterans service organizations that includes informing, advising, and representing senior Army Reserve leadership on congressional activities, and for telling the Army Reserve Story in the 7-state region.
In his last post, Col. Brown also provided support to the 7-state region as a board member for the 2022 Service Academy.
He supports all local leaders of Nevada by providing them with information regarding the Army Reserve and the economic impact to states and cities.
He has also supported the Army Reserve Ambassador Program, which supports students with full-ride scholarships to any ROTC program in the Nation with the hope that they will one day return to the Southwest as tomorrow's leaders.
In his over 30-year military career, including 10 different assignments and 2 different services, Col. Brown has shared his knowledge and experience with hundreds of officers and enlisted Soldiers, helping them to develop as leaders and enhance their careers.
Col. Brown is an exceptional leader who will be greatly missed by the U.S. military when he moves into retirement, while his service will be long remembered by those he worked with.
There is no doubt that the soldiers he helped train and mentor over his 30 years will continue to build on his legacy of service and working to make our Nation stronger.
