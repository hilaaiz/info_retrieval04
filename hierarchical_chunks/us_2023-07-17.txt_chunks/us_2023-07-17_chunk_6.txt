Mr. Speaker, Colonel Adam J. Czekanski's diligent service to his brothers at arms, our communities, and our entire nation is evidence of a life well-lived and a retirement well-earned.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I congratulate him on his retirement and many impressive accomplishments throughout a successful military career.
