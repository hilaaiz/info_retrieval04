Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Washington County on the 225th anniversary of its agricultural fair and celebrate its importance to southwestern Pennsylvania's agricultural industry over the years.
The Washington County Agricultural Fair is the oldest in Pennsylvania, having started in 1798.
Since its creation, the annual fair has promoted our community's achievements in agriculture, horticulture, homemaking subjects, arts, and sciences.
It is also an opportunity for 4-H clubs, FFA chapters, and many other community organizations to share their work with friends, neighbors, and visitors.
Today, the 8-day event attracts over 65,000 attendees each year.
Thc fair is an important part of Washington County's history and heritage.
Over 1,700 individual farms operate in the region, making agriculture the largest industry in the county.
