Mr. Kain was a leader in his community and was recognized as Woodford County Chamber of Commerce's Businessman of the Year in 1992.
A generous man, he supported education, medical care and research, and many other charitable efforts to make the community and the nation a better place.
More importantly than his business and community successes, Mr Kain kept his family at the forefront of his life.
He had nine children, twenty-two grandchildren, and eighteen great-grandchildren.
He is survived by his wife Alice Stewart Kain and children Vickie Fister, Patrick Kain, David Kain, Steve Kain, Bob Kain, and Bill Kain.
He was preceded in death by his daughters Becky Grimes and Suzanne Hockensmith and his son Jack Kain, Jr. Jack Kain was a great man who loved his family, his community, his country, and his God.
He was respected by his community and his colleagues in the automobile industry throughout America.
It is my honor to call him my friend and to recognize his life before the United States House.
