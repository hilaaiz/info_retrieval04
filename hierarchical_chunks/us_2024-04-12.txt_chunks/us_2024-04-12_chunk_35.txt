Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pauline Biedka, a remarkable constituent from my district, and to pay tribute to her on the celebration of her 100th Birthday on April 13, 2024.
The daughter of Philomena and Luke Della Vella, Pauline was born on April 13, 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--one of nine children Pauline married her husband Peter, a World War II Veteran in 1942.
They moved to Bristol, Bucks County and built their forever home.
They had a daughter and two sons.
Pauline was a ``Rosie the Riveter'' during World War II and the Korean War.
During that time, she worked at Fleetwings and Kaiser Metal in Bristol, Pennsylvania.
In addition, Pauline was a Neshaminy School District crossing guard for twenty-five years.
Pauline was and still is a devoted wife, remains an amazing mother, grandmother of six, and great-grandmother of twelve.
