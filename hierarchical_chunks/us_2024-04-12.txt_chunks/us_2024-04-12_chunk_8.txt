Ms. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the lives of the six construction workers who passed away as a result of the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.
Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, Dorian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Miguel Luna, Jose Mynor Lopez, and Carlos Hernandez.
These men who lost their lives while working on the Bridge were everyday heroes.
These men could've been our fathers, brothers, grandsons, or nephews.
That evening, they arrived at work proudly as immigrants, ready to help build this country with their own two hands by undertaking hazardous and challenging tasks that others refused.
Their dedication reminds us that immigrants should be celebrated and acknowledged for contributing to this country--not vilified and attacked for where they come from, the color of their skin, or their accent.
They deserve to be praised and remembered.
We should be inspired by their tenacity and dedication to pursuing the American Dream for themselves and their loved ones.
We will continue to work on behalf of our immigrant community in honor of these brave souls.
We will rebuild the Bridge and help build an immigration infrastructure that celebrates our workers.
