Mr. CISCOMANI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Chiricahua National Monument on the centennial anniversary of its designation as a national monument.
Recently, I visited the Chiricahua National Monument and explored parts of the 12,000 acres of hiking trails, campgrounds, and scenic views.
Chiricahua National Monument is one of the most treasured landmarks in Arizona.
This ``Wonderland of Rocks'' features unique, boulderbalancing rock pillars formed by volcanic eruptions.
These abstract formations draw visitors from across the nation and around the world to the Southeast corner of our state.
It is a privilege to have this incredible landscape in our own backyard.
Not only does it provide great recreational opportunity and natural habitat, it is also a major driver for southern Arizona's economy.
The monument annually supports over 40 jobs and produces $4.4 million of economic output, with 60,000 visitors that come each year generating $4.1 million in spending.
Last year, I proudly introduced a bipartisan bill, the Chiricahua National Park Act (H.R. 1479), aiming to update the national monument to the status of a national park.
