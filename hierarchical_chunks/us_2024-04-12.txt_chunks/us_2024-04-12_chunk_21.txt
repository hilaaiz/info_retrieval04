Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of an outstanding New Yorker and educator, President of Genesee Community College, Dr. James M. Sunser.
Dr. Sunser has spent over a decade as President of Genesee Community College and has been an invaluable leader and partner in education, fostering collaboration and strengthening the ties between Genesee Community College and the citizens of Genesee County, New York.
Under Dr. Sunser's leadership, the college saw the development of the Richard C. Call Arena and the Student Success Center, capital projects that represented the largest fundraising efforts ever undertaken by the College.
Dr. Sunser has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the success and well-being of students, faculty, and staff at Genesee Community College, making significant strides in advancing educational opportunities for all.
The 24th Congressional District of New York extends its heartfelt appreciation for Dr. Sunser's role in enhancing the educational experience and contributing to the overall prosperity I am pleased to extend my best wishes to Dr. Sunser for a fulfilling and well-deserved retirement, filled with joy, accomplishments, and continued success in all his future endeavors.
