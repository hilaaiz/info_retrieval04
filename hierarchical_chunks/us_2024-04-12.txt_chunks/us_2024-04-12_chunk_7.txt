Director Mark Scott has worked tirelessly to make the MSU VBOC a place where Veterans are served well.
Natalie Rhode, the program director, has also played a key role in the center's success.
The Veterans Business Outreach Center is focused on small business development for Veterans and their spouses.
The center was founded in 2015 and covers Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
The Small Business Administration selected the MSU VBOC this year for its successes and unique contributions to the local community.
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.
The MSU VBOC is committed to excellence while supporting many local Veterans as they invest in their communities.
This award is a testament to the hard work by the outstanding team on the front lines at the VBOC.
I am thankful to have the opportunity to congratulate the Mississippi State University Veterans Business Outreach Center on the occasion of this award, and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress on behalf of our Veterans.
