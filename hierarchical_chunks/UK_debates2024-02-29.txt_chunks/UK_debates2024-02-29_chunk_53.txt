I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the characteristically amusing way in which he has raised an important question.
He knows I have taken the matter of conspiracy theories very seriously as Leader of the House.
We have stood up new services in the Library so that hon.
Members can swiftly reassure their constituents on not just the facts of a particular matter but the origin of whatever they might have seen on social media, and very shortly, with the Speaker’s help, we will be launching some training for Members on dealing with this issue.
Those are the sorts of things we should all be focusing on.
