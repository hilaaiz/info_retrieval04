I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
It is because this relies on the trust and confidence that Members have in other Members in this place, but also in the House authorities.
The hon.
Lady will know that I am part of the Commission.
We have brought forward and tabled these proposals, but we also have a duty to listen to hon.
and right hon.
Members in this place, otherwise such motions will fail.
I have to say that there is a very small set of circumstances—I cannot actually think of a set—where this would ever be used, because what would happen, if the House authorities were notified of any issues of concern, is that bail conditions would be applied to that individual, and therefore the process would not be triggered.
We are talking about a set of circumstances where there would be some other kind of risk.
