Like other Members, I have constituents and friends who have been profoundly affected by the scandal, through both hepatitis and HIV.
I recognise that my right hon.
Friend is working extremely hard to come up with a solution to move the conversation forward, but can he update the House on any conversations he has had with the Treasury on delivering compensation as swiftly as possible once it is available?
Conversation about this is taking place all the time across Whitehall.
That will continue at pace as we move towards the  20 May  publication.
My determination is to bring forward as substantive a response as possible on the compensation issue as soon as possible after that.
Obviously, those conversations happen over time, but I undertake to update the House at the next opportunity when there is something substantive to say.
