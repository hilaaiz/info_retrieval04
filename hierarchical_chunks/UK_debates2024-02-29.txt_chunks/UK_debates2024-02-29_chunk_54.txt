Does the Leader of the House agree that far from being a major cause of climate change, Welsh farmers, such as Richard Jones from Brynsiencyn, are the guardians and protectors of the Welsh countryside?
Because of their dedication and hard work, Wales is as beautiful as it is and able to feed us.
May I thank my hon.
Friend for getting that on record?
The Welsh farming community have conducted themselves brilliantly in these difficult and uncertain times for their community and their futures.
We know they do an amazing job, and they should be proud of that.
Everyone in this place should be proud of that.
The plans of Labour’s Welsh Government are appalling and should be objected to in the strongest terms.
The Welsh farming community have been doing just that.
They have been standing up and fighting, and they deserve our support in doing so.
