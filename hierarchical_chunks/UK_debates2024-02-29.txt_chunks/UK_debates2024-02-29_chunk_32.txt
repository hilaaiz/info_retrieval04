May I let the Leader of the House know that I have now received a letter from the Procedure Committee regarding the proposal to change the timings of debates in Westminster Hall?
I am hopeful that she will have that imminently.
May I add my penn’orth in memory of my friend, Ronnie Campbell?
I have been a Member of this House for only 14 years, but I knew Ronnie for more than 40 years.
I will be at his funeral in Blyth tomorrow and will certainly pass on the best wishes of the Members of this House to his wife, Deirdre, and sons when I see them.
