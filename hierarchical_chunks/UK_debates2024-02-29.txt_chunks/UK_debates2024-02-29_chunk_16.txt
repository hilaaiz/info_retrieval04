My hon.
Friend is entirely right to raise that risk.
We live in a more dangerous and hostile world.
I am particularly mindful of the risks posed by hostile foreign states such as Iran.
We rely heavily on the National Cyber Security Centre, with which we work closely to ensure the security of Government, this House and the private sector.
In addition, I chair a ministerial cyber board, where we constantly challenge Departments to improve their cyber-security—which we are improving, but the risks continue to arise.
