I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his kind invitation.
I would love to come, and I was in Northern Ireland a couple of weeks ago.
Health is clearly devolved, but I made it very clear that I want the same standard in Northern Ireland that we have achieved with Op Courage in England: a single, dedicated mental healthcare pathway for veterans, with 19,000 referrals in its first year.
Where were all these people going before that?
It is an incredible story.
I want to see that standard achieved in Northern Ireland, and we will keep working at it until we do.
