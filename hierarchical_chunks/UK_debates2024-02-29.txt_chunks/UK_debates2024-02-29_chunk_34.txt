Thank you, Mr Speaker, for hosting a dinner for OnSide in your apartments this week.
That made me think that it is high time that we had a debate in this House about the contribution that youth zones make to east Lancashire.
The centre of that debate, Mr Speaker, will be not the Chorley youth zone, as fine as it is, but the brand-new youth zone that is about to be built in Darwen.
The £3.3 million project to help all our young people is supported by this Government as part of our £120 million town deal to transform Darwen.
May I congratulate my right hon.
Friend on another success that he has had with his wish list for his constituents?
I congratulate everyone involved in that project.
These are vital community facilities, and we all send our congratulations and good wishes for this latest project in this area.
