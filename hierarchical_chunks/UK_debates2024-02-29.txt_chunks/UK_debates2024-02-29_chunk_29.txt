On the hon.
Lady’s final, very important point, we have just heard from the Paymaster General, who is leading on the issue of infected blood on behalf of the Government.
She is right that I have very strong views about this, but they are shared by the Paymaster General and all those on the Government Benches.
That is why we set up the inquiry, and why we set up the compensation study to run concurrently with it, so that we would not have to wait any longer before people got proper redress.
I know that the Paymaster General is working on this very swiftly.
He updates me on a regular basis, and we will keep the House informed.
On the first anniversary of the coming into force of the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022, I am very concerned to learn that child marriages are still taking place, and that those with safeguarding responsibilities are failing to prosecute.
It is my understanding that the relevant authorities are failing to interpret the law correctly,  particularly in relation to marriages taking place overseas.
Can we have a statement on what further education is required as a matter of urgency, so that all those with safeguarding responsibilities have the necessary knowledge and skills to protect children?
