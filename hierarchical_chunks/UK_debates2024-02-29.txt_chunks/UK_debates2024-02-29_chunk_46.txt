Last week, the Government-funded organisation Tell MAMA published its latest data on anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia incidents.
That data showed that there had been 2,000-plus incidents in four months—an  increase of over 300%.
Between that time and now, there has been no statement from the Government on tackling Islamophobia.
Last week, there was a statement from the Government on tackling antisemitism; can the Leader of the House clarify to me when the Government will make a statement on tackling Islamophobia, noting those latest data?
I am sure she agrees with me, and with every Member of this House, that we should do everything we can to ensure that all our faith communities are treated fairly and equally.
I agree with my hon.
Friend’s comments —that is a duty on us all.
He may wish to know that I have also asked for a meeting with the Government’s envoy for freedom of religion or belief, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) , and the Minister responsible to look at what more we parliamentarians can do to ensure that all communities and faith groups feel properly supported in these times.
I will make sure that the relevant Department hears what my hon.
Friend has said today.
I had no intention of coming to ask the Leader of the House a question, but earlier she mentioned the exclusion of Members of Parliament.
Just to be clear about the language, what we are talking about is people who have been arrested for sexual crimes being excluded from this estate.
She said that we cannot have that debate, and that Members need to trust the process—well, staff also need to trust what happens here.
She said that we cannot have the debate because of what happened last week.
I have absolutely no idea how what happened last week has anything to do with keeping this building safe; could the Leader of the House elaborate on why what happened last week has got anything to do with something we have been fighting for for five years?
