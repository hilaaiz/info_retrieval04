I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that question, and I thank all the directly affected people, and those supporting them and the various campaign groups, who took the time to visit Parliament  yesterday.
I think that we have done the right thing in gripping this issue through the inquiries that we have set up and the compensation study.
The hon.
Gentleman will know of my interest in this area.
I assure him that I get regular updates from the Paymaster General, and I do not think it will be too long before he will be able to come to the House to make further announcements—he is making progress.
This is the final stage of the process; it is the most difficult.
I know that the Paymaster General is determined to deliver the right outcome for all those infected and affected by that appalling scandal.
