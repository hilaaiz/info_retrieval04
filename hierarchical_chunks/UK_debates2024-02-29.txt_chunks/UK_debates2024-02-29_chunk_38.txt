My right hon.
Friend will, like me, have constituents whose water is supplied by Southern Water.
After two weeks of obfuscation, reassurance and denial by the company that there has been any pollution incident at Fullerton wastewater works in my constituency, we heard from the Environment Agency yesterday that there has been a significant pollution incident of a level that would be hazardous to human health.
Will she help me by providing Government time for a debate about whether Southern Water remains a fit and proper company to be managing water resources in our region?
She will know as well as I do that it is not simply wastewater that it cannot cope with; it is not any good at supplying drinking water either.
