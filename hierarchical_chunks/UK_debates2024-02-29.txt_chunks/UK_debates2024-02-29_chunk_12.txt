I welcome the hon.
Lady to what I think are her first Cabinet Office questions.
She is right to draw attention to the fantastic textile manufacturing that exists in the region in which her constituency sits.
She will have heard me talk about the Procurement  Act 2023, which was passed last year and will make sure that small and medium-sized enterprises, which by their nature are often local enterprises, will have a bigger share of public procurement.
