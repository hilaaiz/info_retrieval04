I thank my right hon.
Friend for leaving the House in no doubt about her frustration and disappointment about the situation with Southern Water.
I have experienced similar feelings towards that company.
What is particularly disappointing in this episode affecting her constituents is that although massive progress has been made in monitoring storm overflows—we have gone from just 6% being monitored to almost 100%—the quality of that monitoring is critical, and the assurances that she had been given about what was happening and about the type of water being expelled into a river have turned out not to be correct.
There are questions for Southern Water and the Environment Agency.
I will ensure that the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has heard what she has said, and will ask his officials to get in contact with her office.
