I thank the hon.
Lady for her work in that area.
She will know that if such matters came to the Floor of the House, it would be on a free vote basis—they are matters of conscience.
I very much understand the head of steam that is building behind both sides of the argument.
It has been a little while since we have had a debate on that matter.
She will know what options are open to her to secure a debate, be it an Adjournment debate or one secured through the Backbench Business Committee, but I will ensure that all relevant Departments have heard what she and other hon.
Members have said.
