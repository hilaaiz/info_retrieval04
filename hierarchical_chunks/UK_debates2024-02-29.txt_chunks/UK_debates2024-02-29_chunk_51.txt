I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the question and all who have enabled this school to be stood up.
I know he will want to get on record how important this is to diaspora communities.
He is an experienced parliamentarian and will know how to apply for a debate and the various options open to him.
I thank him for getting his praise for all involved on the record today.
