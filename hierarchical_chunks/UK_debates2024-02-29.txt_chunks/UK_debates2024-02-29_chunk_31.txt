I thank the Leader of the House for our meeting yesterday and for the business statement confirming the timing of the estimates debates for  Thursday 14 March .
Let me inform the House that applications for those debates must be with the Clerk of the Committee by lunch time on Monday, so we do not have much time to sort this out—so, that is this coming  Monday, 4 March , at lunch time.
The applications will be before the Committee on Tuesday afternoon at our normal meeting.
