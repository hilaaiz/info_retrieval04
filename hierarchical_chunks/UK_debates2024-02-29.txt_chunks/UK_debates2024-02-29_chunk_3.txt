I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The appointment of Sir Jonathan Montgomery was compliant with all the processes, similar to those used for the appointment of Sir Robert Francis and others.
I recognise the concern expressed around Jonathan’s involvement with Bayer.
That ceased at the end of October last year.
He was part of an independent advisory group—not  making executive decisions—for the pharmaceutical company.
In the other place, the noble Baroness Brinton described Sir Jonathan as a “well-respected ethicist”.
He has been asked not for further recommendations, but to advise the Government on the implementation of the recommendations made in the report.
I hope that is helpful.
