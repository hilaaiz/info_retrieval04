On  18 January , I raised the case of Pilsworth South landfill in my constituency, which has been giving off an awful smell due to the operator breaching its licence.
I asked the Leader of the House whether we could have a debate in Government time about giving the Environment Agency more teeth in relation to matters like this, and I appreciate her writing to the Environment Secretary on my behalf.
However, can we have a statement from the Secretary of State on potential prosecutions of operators that breach their licence, so that our constituents no longer suffer from this stench and we can stop the stink?
