Following the comments made by the shadow Leader of the House about risk-based exclusion, I am glad that motion is not coming forward next week, as there should be more consideration.
It is a matter of record that two major newspapers made sex-based accusations against me, but I was not investigated by the police or as a result referred.
It is only arrest that makes a difference.
It is absurd and naive to think that were someone to be suspended and get a proxy vote, their anonymity could in any sense be guaranteed in this country or not reported in other countries.
This is a serious problem.
I am not certain we have found exactly the right way of dealing with it.
Will the Government make a statement next week on revisionism and who is the lead designer of the national Holocaust memorial and proposed learning centre?
One of the Government’s nominees as chair of the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation was quoted in the Jewish News yesterday saying that Ron Arad is the person responsible.
Every Government comment, from 2016 onwards, has acknowledged quite rightly that the main designer is Sir David Adjaye OM—a name that cannot normally be mentioned because of problems I do not want to go into on the Floor of the House.
Could Ministers refer Lord Pickles to the press notices that went out in the UK Holocaust Memorial Foundation’s name in 2016, 2018 and every year since, because we must get the facts right and not change them?
I reassure my hon.
Friend that we are listening to the House.
Risk-based exclusion and other such schemes are a matter for the House and all Members need to have confidence in those processes.
He has successfully put on record his concerns about that aspect of the Holocaust memorial.
I will ensure the Secretary of State has heard what he has said, and he can raise it directly with him on  4 March .
