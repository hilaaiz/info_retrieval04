I thank the hon.
Member for delivering our messages at Ronnie’s funeral tomorrow.
I also thank him for the helpful advert for the work of his Committee.
He will know that we are keen to ensure that the new innovation in the sitting hours of Westminster Hall can be brought into effect and he has my commitment to that.
I will also ensure that we are giving him good notice on future timings for his Committee.
I am very conscious, as we discussed yesterday, that debates have been moved for understandable reasons—for example the debate on coalmining communities was moved because of important matters relating to Northern Ireland—and we want to ensure that there is time for those matters to be heard.
