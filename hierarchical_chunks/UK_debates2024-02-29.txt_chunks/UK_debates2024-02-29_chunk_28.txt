I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, and I understand why people will have to wait for normal combat to be resumed between us.
I disagree with one thing that she, and other hon.
Members, have said: that this Chamber, and Westminster collectively, did not cover itself in glory last week.
I think that the issue has been about the actions of particular individuals and what they have done.
Many Members of this House did a good thing last week by standing up to protect the rights, the foundation and the rulebook that we operate on.
With regard to those who were caught up in something else, many Members have recognised that that was the wrong thing to do, and that we need to address that.
The Government will give the SNP more time to have the debates that it ought to have.
I understand that you, Mr Speaker, have commissioned the Procedure Committee to look at the particular procedural issues that happened last week.
I understand that the scope of that work is narrow, so it should be done swiftly.
I hope that it will be concluded before the SNP has its next debate, so that it can have confidence in how that debate will run.
