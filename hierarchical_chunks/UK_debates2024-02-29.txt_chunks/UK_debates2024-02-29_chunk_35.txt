I thank the Leader of the House for an opportunity to raise this question on freedom of religion or belief.
The all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief, which I chair, visited Tunisia last May to highlight some of the issues that are relevant to our all-party group.
On Sunday past, a mob in Tunisia burned a synagogue in the city of Sfax.
Thankfully no one was injured.
Will the Leader of the House join me and others in denouncing this attack and calling for closer monitoring of the issues relating to freedom of religion or belief?
