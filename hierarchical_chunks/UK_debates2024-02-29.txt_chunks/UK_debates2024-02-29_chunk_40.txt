We need a fresh statement on the infected blood scandal.
My constituent Sue Sparkes was in the House yesterday.
She was widowed at the age of 31 when her husband, Les, passed away in 1991 having contracted hepatitis C and HIV from infected blood.
The Leader of the House mentioned a “moral compass” in her statement.
May I remind her that Members from across this House showed their moral compass when, for the only time in this Parliament, they defeated the Government on this issue?
That is why the Government have made the statements that they have—but they are still not paying the full and fair compensation that has been called for by Sir Brian Langstaff.
When will the Government make a statement on the compensation, and will the Budget indicate that it will happen immediately?
