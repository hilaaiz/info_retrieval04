I welcome the new funding and protocols that have been announced to enhance MPs’ security and defend our democracy.
We have seen a huge rise in antisemitism, Islamophobia, hate and the intimidation of elected representatives, especially since Hamas’s barbaric attack on Israel on  7 October .
I put on record my thanks to you, Mr Speaker, and the security services for your leadership.
I asked last week, as I have before, for a new cross-party taskforce to address these issues.
Can the Leader of the House help to make sure that happens?
