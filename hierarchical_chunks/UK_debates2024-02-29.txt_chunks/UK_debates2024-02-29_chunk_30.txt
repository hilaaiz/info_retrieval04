I thank my hon.
Friend for all her work in this area.
She has been an absolute force for good.
We would not have brought forward that legislation without her great efforts.
She is right that we want to ensure that people—particularly those with safeguarding responsibilities—are taking this issue seriously.
She will also know that a private Member’s Bill is looking at the responsibilities of statutory authorities in this regard.
I will make sure that the Department has heard the hon.
Lady’s concerns on this matter, and I am sure that, given her reputation, they will be listened to.
