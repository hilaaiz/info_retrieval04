I thank my right hon.
Friend for all the work she is doing on this issue.
I have witnessed that work at first hand, having visited her constituency and met with one set of those parents she mentions—I praise them for all the work they are doing to turn the tragedy that befell them into some positive action.
As she has kindly mentioned, the Home Secretary is committed to this issue, and is continually looking at what more can be done.
The particular statutory instrument to which my right hon.
Friend refers, which was laid before Parliament on  25 January , is currently on remaining orders and is yet to be debated in both Houses, but I think that will happen extremely soon.
As she knows, we are making progress on that.
