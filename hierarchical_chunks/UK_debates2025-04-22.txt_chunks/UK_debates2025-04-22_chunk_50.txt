I thank the Minister for his efforts to keep Birmingham MPs informed on a cross-party basis during this dispute.
I would also like to associate myself with the condemnation of the publication of photographs of the houses of some of the parties to the dispute.
My residents in Birmingham Northfield want to see a service that is not the same as before the strike; it must be better, and I know the Minister shares that ambition.
