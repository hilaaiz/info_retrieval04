I thank the hon.
Member for raising this important issue from her constituency.
We know that more needs to be done in this area, and that is why this Government have started to roll out our domestic abuse protection orders to help victims of domestic abuse in selected areas.
We are seeing how that goes.
We are developing policy in this area to protect victims, and women and girls in particular.
I would be more than happy to meet her to discuss what more we can do.
