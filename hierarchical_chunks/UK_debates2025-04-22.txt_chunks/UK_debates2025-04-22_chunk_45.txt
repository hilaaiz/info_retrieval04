I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for that question, which in a way goes to the heart of the fragile situation that we inherited as a Government.
After 14 years, Birmingham, and in fact many councils of all political stripes, had been sent to the wall by the previous Government.
The number of bankruptcy notices that were issued is testament to that.
We have been able to stabilise the sector through the recovery grant—the first time ever that that grant was issued, and Birmingham was the largest beneficiary.
We have given that city the support it needs, but we want to ensure that the progress we have seen over the past couple of weeks is maintained.
I completely appreciate that there were unacceptable scenes where waste has built up on people’s streets.
That is not okay in normal times, and it is certainly not okay in half term, when children are playing in their local parks and on their streets.
That is why we moved quickly to ensure that that waste was removed.
The fact that 26,000 tonnes has been removed shows the dedication of those frontline workers.
