I thank the Chair of the Justice Committee for raising an important issue for his own constituents that also has wider significance.
I will publish the full terms of reference and place them in the Libraries of both Houses very soon.
Regardless of whether the review goes into the specifics of every other type of case, I am sure that it will make findings on how such cases, particularly involving people with mental health conditions, are properly managed.
I am sure that those findings will be of interest not just to our Department but to others, and will be implemented by the Government in due course.
