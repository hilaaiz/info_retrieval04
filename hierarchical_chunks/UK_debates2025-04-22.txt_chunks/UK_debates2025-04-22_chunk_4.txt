I thank the Minister for his response.
In my constituency, Hope Street is doing incredible work to offer residential alternatives to custody for women.
We know that this model reduces the number of women being sent to prison, preventing separation from their children, who are likely to be taken into care, which we all know has a hugely detrimental impact.
Can the Minister share any plans to replicate and scale up the Hope Street model?
