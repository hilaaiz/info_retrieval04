Cornwall is a big rural legal aid desert.
We have many volunteers who would be prepared to help and Citizens Advice could act as an umbrella organisation.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss how we can get some of that funding for access to legal aid in rural areas into Cornwall?
My hon.
Friend is right to raise the importance of early legal support and legal aid.
That is why we are investing in online provision.
As I have said, remote technology can make a real difference in areas such as hers.
Before I came to this place, I volunteered in a free legal advice centre, so I know just how much of a difference such institutions can make.
What recent assessment she has made of the adequacy of policies applying to bail conditions in domestic violence cases.
This Government have committed to halving violence against women and girls in a decade.
A broad range of bail conditions can be imposed to protect victims, including electronic monitoring for those who meet the remand threshold, exclusion zones and non-contact orders.
Suspects can also be remanded in prison.
I raise this issue following a meeting with a constituent whose case raises deep concerns that are more widely relevant.
First, bail conditions—sometimes weak, sometimes poorly enforced—do not always protect victims of domestic violence from further harassment by their abuser.
Secondly, despite the increase in the time limit to two years under the 2022 regulations, the six-month limit for prosecutions means that some cases time out.
Will the Minister meet me and my constituent to discuss what more can be done to ensure that victims of domestic abuse are fully protected from their abusers?
