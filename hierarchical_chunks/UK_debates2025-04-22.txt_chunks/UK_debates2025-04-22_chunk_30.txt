Key agents of reform in our prisons are prison officers.
Unlocked Graduates is an amazing scheme that supports the production of prison officers with new innovations, but it has had the rug pulled from underneath its feet, beyond its current cohort.
There are mixed accounts of what has happened from different civil servants and other individuals in government.
Will the Minister explain exactly what has happened?
Why has the contract not worked?
Will he sit down with me and Unlocked Graduates to see if we can find a way forward?
I very much praise the work that Unlocked Graduates has done over many years.
Unfortunately, when the contract was let previously, Unlocked Graduates was unhappy to progress with the contract.
That is the situation.
Obviously, these things are very difficult, but I am very happy to meet the hon.
Member to discuss matters further.
What steps she is taking to increase the provision of legal aid services.
On prisons, the inheritance was dire; on Crown court backlogs, the inheritance was dire; and on legal aid services, once again the inheritance has been  absolutely dire.
This Government are rebuilding the legal aid system for those it serves and those who serve in it.
That is why, in December, we announced up to £92 million more a year for criminal legal aid solicitors, on top of £24 million already announced for duty solicitors in police stations.
We are also consulting on uplifts, as I said, in housing and immigration legal aid fees, worth an additional £20 million a year—the first increase in civil legal aid fees since 1996.
The Conservatives left legal aid in a mess, like so many other things, so I welcome the sums the Minister is announcing, but can she assure me that the money will reach Ealing?
We have never even had a citizens advice bureau—not in the 10 years I have been the MP, and not in the 50 years I have been on the planet—to refer constituents to.
Can she assure us that my constituents can get the access to justice they deserve?
