I thank the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for their support in addressing the public health concerns in Birmingham.
As the Minister says, 26,000 tonnes of waste has now been cleared, and weekly collections will resume.
I put on record my thanks to everyone involved in the clean-up, including many volunteers—they are the best of Birmingham.
Does the Minister agree that it is right that the council resolves equal pay issues, with over 7,000 women now due compensation?
That is precisely what the deal on offer does, while ensuring that no worker has to lose pay.
