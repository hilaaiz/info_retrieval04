It has been six days since the Supreme Court handed down its landmark judgment in the case brought by For Women Scotland—a judgment that confirms basic biological reality and protects women and girls.
It was a Conservative Government who brought in the policy to stop male offenders, however they identify, being held in the women’s estate, especially those convicted of violence or sexual offences.

Judges can sentence outside the guideline range if they believe that is in the interests of justice.
The guidelines set only a starting point, not an end point, which remains in the purview of judges sitting in their independent capacity in our courts.
We are not seeking to overturn the immigration guidelines.
In case there are hon.
Members who are labouring under misinformation, I should say that it is an important point of fact that foreign national offenders and immigration offenders who receive sentences of less than 12 months can still be deported, and under this Government they will be.
