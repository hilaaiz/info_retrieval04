One of the dying acts of the last Conservative Government was to shake hands with Serco on an electronic tagging contract that Channel 4’s “Dispatches” found was completely inadequate.
People with serious convictions were left without tags for days and weeks.
Victims and survivors were failed, including survivors of those released early under the SDS40 scheme.
What will the Secretary of State do to hold Serco to account for these failures, and to clear up the mess that was fundamentally created by the failures of the last Government?
The hon.
Member is right: this is one of the many difficult inheritances left for us by the previous Conservative Government.
The contract with Serco was agreed by the previous Conservative Administration.
We acknowledge that the performance of Serco has been unacceptable.
We have already been closely monitoring—day by day—its performance and delivery under the contract, and we have imposed fines for poor performance.
Some of the issues relating to the SDS40 emergency releases were ultimately dealt with after close oversight by officials and Ministers, and we continue to monitor the contract very closely.
As I have said, should further fines or other measures be required, all options are on the table.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle intimate image abuse.
We are introducing new offences of taking intimate images without consent and installing equipment with intent to commit such offences.
We are also criminalising creating deepfake intimate images without consent.
I proudly co-chair the violence against women and girls ministerial group, which oversees a cross-Government approach to tackling VAWG, including online abuse.
