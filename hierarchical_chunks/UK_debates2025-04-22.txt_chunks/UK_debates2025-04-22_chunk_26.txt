Personal protective equipment is now worn in all kinds of jobs where people may have to deal with dangerous situations.

Unions have called for this measure, and I can assure the Minister that they have the full support of those on the Opposition side of the House.
Will he act—not in two months or six months, but now—to protect prison officers before it is too late?
That is part of the review that has been announced.
My right hon.
Friend the Lord Chancellor is meeting the Prison Officers Association tomorrow.
These things need to be done rightly and properly, and that is what will happen with this Government.
