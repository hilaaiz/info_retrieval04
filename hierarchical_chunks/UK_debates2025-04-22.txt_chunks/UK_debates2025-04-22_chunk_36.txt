I thank my hon.
Friend for her comments, for her support and for assiduously representing the needs of her constituents.
As I said, the inquiry will be chaired by Her Honour Deborah Taylor, who is an experienced, senior retired judge.
I have every confidence in her.
She is already meeting the families of the victims and the survivors, and she has undertaken to ensure that the inquiry works at pace and makes its findings as quickly as possible.
