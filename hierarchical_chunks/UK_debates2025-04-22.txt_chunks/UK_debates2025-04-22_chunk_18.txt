I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
Tackling violence against women and girls is not just a Ministry of Justice problem to fix, but a problem for every Government Department to fix.
That is why I have met with my counterparts across the Departments, including in MHCLG, to discuss housing needs.
We will be publishing our violence against women and girls strategy later this year, and I look forward to discussing it with him in due course.
