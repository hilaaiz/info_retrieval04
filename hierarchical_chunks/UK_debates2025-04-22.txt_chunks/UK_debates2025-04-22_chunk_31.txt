Friend’s question.
The Legal Aid Agency keeps contracts under review to ensure that there is provision right across the country, including in Ealing.
As I said earlier, the additional money going into legal support, which includes advice services, such as citizens advice bureaux, law centres and other advice providers, will reach constituents just like hers, both remotely and face to face.
