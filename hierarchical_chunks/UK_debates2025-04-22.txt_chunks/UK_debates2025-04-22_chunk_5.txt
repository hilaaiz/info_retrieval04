I agree with my hon.
Friend that for some women supported accommodation is very valuable.
Existing provision includes His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service-led community accommodation services and third sector residential women’s centres, including Hope Street, which she rightly praises for its excellent work.
The Women’s Justice Board is exploring options to increase use of robust community alternatives to custody, including residential options where appropriate.
Project SHE in Somerset, run by the Nelson Trust, allows some women who have been arrested for the first time for low-level crime an alternative to court, working with offenders on rehabilitation and reducing the impact on the community and the criminal justice system.
What support is the Department providing for such schemes?
These schemes are very important.
The hon.
Member highlights a very good one, and the Department continues to support those sorts of schemes.
Does the Minister agree that counselling services are crucial in supporting female offenders as they address trauma, addiction and mental health challenges?
Furthermore, will she join me in commending the charity uHub in my constituency for its exceptional counselling services for young women?
The hon.
Member mentions an excellent counselling service in his constituency, which I praise.
These counselling services are crucial and a very important part of the system.
