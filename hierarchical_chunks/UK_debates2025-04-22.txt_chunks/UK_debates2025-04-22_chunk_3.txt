The Secretary of State was asked— What steps her Department is taking to support female offenders.
What steps her Department is taking to support female offenders.
This Government’s plan to support women is clear and ambitious.
The aim is to reduce the number of women going to prison, and our Women’s Justice Board will lead on this.
Following Susannah Hancock’s review, which was published in March, this Government have acted to prevent girls from being held in young offenders institutions.
I have been very concerned to hear first-hand reports of female prisoners being handcuffed during childbirth, sometimes to male officers.
Does the Minister agree that there should be an independent investigation into the use of birth cuffing in women’s prisons across the country that consults all women who have been or may be affected?
My hon.
Friend refers to a shocking situation.
Our policy is clear that pregnant women should not be restrained during hospital appointments, except in the most exceptional circumstances.
There is an ongoing deep-dive review taking place into matters at HMP Bronzefield, commissioned by the prisons Minister in the other place.
