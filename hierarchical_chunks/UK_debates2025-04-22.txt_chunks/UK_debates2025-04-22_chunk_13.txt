The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right that all those issues contribute to circumstances that might create offending, but it is really good that we have the turnaround programme in place.
Only 5% of children who completed their turnaround interventions received convictions in their first year of the programme.
That is an example of the sort of programme we need to be engaging in to turn young people away from crime.
What steps she is taking to increase access to legal aid in rural areas.
Wherever they are in England and Wales, people should benefit from equal access to legal support and legal aid.
Remote technology and provision of online advice present the opportunity both to democratise legal advice and to deliver it to all who need to access it.
We are investing an additional £92 million to support the sustainability of the criminal legal aid sector, and we are consulting on fee increases totalling £20 million for housing and immigration to increase access to civil legal aid.
All of this will support legal aid across the country, including in rural areas.
North Norfolk is a legal aid desert.
My residents have precious little access to family, criminal and housing legal assistance, despite the best efforts of local organisations such as the Norfolk Community Law Service.
We face huge barriers to recruitment and retention in rural areas, such as the cost of housing, poor public transport and fees that, despite the uprating, are still too low.
Things need to change.
Will the Minister meet me and those working in the legal aid sector in North Norfolk to discuss what we can do to support those in need in areas such as mine?
