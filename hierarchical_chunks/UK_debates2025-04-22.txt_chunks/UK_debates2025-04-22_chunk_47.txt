I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
It is unacceptable that this dispute has dragged on into a ninth week.
Even more disgraceful, the people of Birmingham are now forced to clean up their own streets.
I thank those who gave up their Easter holidays to pick up rubbish for their neighbours but, let us be honest, they should never have had to do it.
This goes way beyond Birmingham.
It started with an equal pay claim that bankrupted the council, and with widespread local government reorganisation ahead of us all, what will stop it from happening again?
As councils merge, staff will sit side by side doing the same jobs but on completely different pay from each other.
That is unjust, unsustainable and a ticking timebomb.
Six years after the reorganisation of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, which I led, pay harmonisation is still going on.
We could not afford to  meet everyone’s expectations, and neither can most councils, which teeter on the edge.
What is the Minister doing to stop this from spiralling elsewhere and to protect residents from eye-watering tax hikes or devastating service cuts?
I want to be careful not to stray too far from Birmingham, which is not affected by local government reorganisation.
However, it is completely usual, when looking at the transfer of the workforce, for negotiations to take place with workers and trade unions to harmonise terms and conditions and pay.
That will take place in the usual way.
We need to be careful not to set hares running unnecessarily.
The issue in Birmingham—the foundational issue, in a way—is equal pay.
For far too long, women workers were paid far less than their male counterparts for comparable roles—that went on for decades.
The council has to resolve that, as other councils did many years earlier.
Women cannot continue to be paid less than their male counterparts.
In the end, this is about harmonisation done in the right way.
