I thank my right hon.
Friend the Justice Secretary for the announcement she made today and the Government for listening to bereaved families and surviving victims.
It is only right that the inquiry is statutory to ensure that it has the power to compel witnesses and hold those responsible for failings to account.
What assurances can she give that the inquiry will be conducted in a timely manner and that the lessons it uncovers will be implemented swiftly to help ensure that similar attacks do not take place?
