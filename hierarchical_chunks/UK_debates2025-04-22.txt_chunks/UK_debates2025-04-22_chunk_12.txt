I thank the Minister very much for that answer.
Quite clearly, those who reoffend do so because they go back to where the peer pressure is, where the unemployment is, and where poverty levels are high.
Those are things that must be addressed in order to help these young people not to reoffend.
They are big issues; what can be done to ensure those three things in the localities where those young people live do not overtake them, with the problems they have?
