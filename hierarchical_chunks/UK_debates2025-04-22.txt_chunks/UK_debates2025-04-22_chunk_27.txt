I thank the Minister for his answer, but I suggest that this is something we should just get on with—it is common sense.
There is a more fundamental issue.
Perhaps I can invite the Minister to provide his assessment of the relative threats provided by different ideological extremists in prisons, which may be fuelling such violence.
Islamist terror suspects make up the vast majority of MI5’s caseload.
Do they also make up the majority of radicalising criminals in our prison estate?
