I thank the hon.
Member for raising the issue of legal aid deserts, and I welcome his suggestion that he write to me about these things.
I regularly meet legal aid providers, and that is why we are investing an additional £6 million in legal support, which provides that early advice that can make a real difference in areas such as his.
