The Minister outlined some of the concerns around the funding pressures that councils of all political parties have faced over the past few years.
He will know that he and the Government have handed out exceptional financial support for a number of councils, and a number of councils continue to face challenges with their finances.
Can he assure the House that in discussions with Birmingham council and others, we will continue to support hard-working local government officers, ensuring that their finances are again fit and proper, so that we do not face situations such as the one we see in Birmingham?
