Mr. CASTRO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Public Health Week and the UT School.
It is an honor to shed light onto a mission devoted to strengthening our communities, improving quality of life, and ensuring that everyone has equal access to quality health and wellness services.
Health extends beyond clinics and hospitals.
It is the cornerstone of a strong nation.
By engaging our communities, public health workers address health care disparities and implement competent wellness programs that provide essential services to diverse communities.
The opening of the UT School of Public Health San Antonio--the newest addition to the UT Health San Antonio system--underscores the dedication to implementing tools that lead to a healthier life.
The institution is a step forward in addressing the challenges faced by communities in San Antonio and South Texas.
Through cutting edgeresearch, the new generation of public health workers will drive our nation forward.
