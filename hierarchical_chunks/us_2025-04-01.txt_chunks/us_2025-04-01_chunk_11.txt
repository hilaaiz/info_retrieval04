Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the late Congressman Raul Grijalva.
Raul was one of was one of my dear friends in Congress and someone who I looked up to as a model for what real progressive leadership looked like.
He was a legend for the Chicano activism of his youth, and a trailblazer who started his career in public service as a community organizer and activist.
From his time on the school board to the County Board of Supervisors to the halls of Congress--Raul was always a voice for the voiceless.
He left such a profound legacy on Tucson's school board that an elementary school was named after him years before he ever got elected to Congress.
He was a fighter for working families his entire life and used every ounce of grit to deliver for his beloved community every day he was in office.
He was a fighter for working families his entire life and used every ounce of grit to deliver for his beloved community every day he was in office.
He was an uncompromising champion of the environment, of bilingual education, of the rights of immigrants, and of the rights of Native Americans.
He was also a genuine human being to the very last, committed to what he believed in, who never let the petty politics of the day make him cynical, or hard, or mean.
I am grateful for his commitment and unwavering courage that he used to make our country better.
I will miss him greatly.
I am sending love and light to his family, Ramona, Adelita, Marisa, and Raquel, his staff, and all who loved him.
