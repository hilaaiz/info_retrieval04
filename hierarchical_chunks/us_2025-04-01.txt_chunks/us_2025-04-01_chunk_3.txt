Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Texas A&M University at Kingsville on their 100-year anniversary.
As we celebrate Texas A&M University-Kingsville's 100-year legacy, we must look back at their history and achievements and continue to build upon the university's legacy of Care, Integrity, Pride, Innovation, and Excellence.
On February 24, 1917, the State of Texas passed Bill No. 72, to establish a teacher training institution in South Texas.
This institution would go on to be called the South Texas Teachers College.
Eventually, in 1929, the school would once again change its name to the Texas School of Art and Industries.
The Texas School of Art and Industries would later grow and expand to provide courses in agriculture and engineering.
In 1941, the school briefly transitioned to a wartime curriculum, teaching national defense courses to support with the war effort.
Two decades later it would become officially known as Texas A&I University.
In March of 1972, Texas A&I was selected as one of the first schools in the country to offer ROTC for women, to eventually be commissioned into the U.S. Army as Second Lieutenants.
In 1975, Texas A&I would be the first university to offer a doctoral degree in bilingual studies.
In 1989, Texas A&I University joined Texas A&M University System, one The list of achievements is endless, from the establishment of a groundbreaking serpentarium and the National Natural Toxins Center to the Opening of the Music Education Complex.
Throughout its entire history, one thing remains certain, since its inception in 1917, Texas A&M-Kingsville (TAMUK) has played a vital role in shaping the minds of some of our region's leading academics and professionals.
Through their dedication to higher education, they have provided South Texas with an exceptional opportunity to succeed.
Thereby, not only nurturing academic success but also molding the minds of the next generation.
