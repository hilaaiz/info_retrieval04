streets of Calexico to the halls of power in Mexico, where he fearlessly worked to dismantle the Guadalajara Cartel.
His groundbreaking work led to the discovery of massive drug plantations and the arrest of high-ranking cartel members.
Tragically, Kiki's life was ended by the very criminals he sought to bring to justice.
His brutal murder in 1985 shocked our Nation and sparked a renewed commitment to the battle against the Mexican drug cartels.
The recent capture of Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the masterminds behind Kiki's murder, is a testament to the tireless efforts of our great men and women in law enforcement.
It's a reminder that justice may be delayed, but it will not be denied.
Not to the United States of America.
As we honor Kiki's memory, we also reaffirm our commitment to continuing his vital work.
We will not rest until our communities are safe from the greatest drug threat our country has ever faced, fentanyl, which is killing our young people at unprecedented rates.
I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Kiki Camarena, a true patriot who gave his life in service to our Nation.
May his sacrifice never be forgotten, and may his legacy inspire future generations to carry on his courageous work.
