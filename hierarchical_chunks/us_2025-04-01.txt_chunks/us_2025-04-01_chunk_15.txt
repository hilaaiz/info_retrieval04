Mr. FLEISCHMANN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable milestone in the history of Hoskins Drug Store & Soda Fountain, a cherished community institution in Clinton, TN.
For nearly a century, Hoskins Drugstore has been a cornerstone of the community, providing not only essential services but also a deep sense of connection and tradition.
On April 4, 2025, Hoskins Drug Store will celebrate 95 years of service.
Founded by R.C. Hoskins in 1930, Hoskins Drug Store quickly became more than just a place to fill prescriptions; it became a trusted destination where people could count on personalized service, quality products, and a warm, welcoming environment.
R.C. Hoskins built a legacy that has endured for generations, one founded on integrity, commitment, and community care.
As the years passed, the legacy of Hoskins Drug Store was carried forward by R.C. Hoskins' daughters, Dudley Hoskins Bostic and Molly Hoskins Scarbrough, who continue to lead the business today with the same dedication and vision that their father demonstrated nearly a century ago.
Their hard work and dedication have ensured that Hoskins Drug Store remains a beloved part of the community, staying true to its principles while adapting to the changing needs of the times.
Today, we celebrate the achievements of Hoskins Drug Store, 
Mr. and
