Mr. NEHLS.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Cecilia Pope, a constituent of mine who turns 100 years old on August 26, 2024.
Her journey began in 1924 as Cecilia Lujan Baca, in Clayton, New Mexico, where she spent her early years.
She ventured to Denver, Colorado for high school, carving out a path of independence and growth.
In October of 1947, fate introduced Cecilia to her first husband, Master Sargent Alfred Hill of the U.S. Air Force.
They had two children together, John in 1950 and Lisa in 1955.
However, tragedy struck as they embarked on their move to Biloxi, Mississippi, in July 1957.
Alfred, at the young age of 34, left this world due to a fatal heart attack, leaving Cecilia and their two children.
Undeterred by the hardships, Cecilia moved to Amarillo, Texas, with her children.
In 1960, she married Alex Pope, and welcomed a daughter, Alexis in 1963.
As life unfolded, they traversed through various cities due to Alex's profession, ultimately settling in Houston in 1966, where they rooted themselves in the Sharpstown area.
Tragedy struck once more when Alex passed away in 1987, yet Cecilia's spirit remained unbroken.
In 2004, she made the decision to move to Katy, Texas, to be near her two daughters.
Her resilience and enthusiasm for life is inspiring.
Despite the challenges she has faced, Cecilia remains active, independent, and devotes her time to her passions.
She's an avid reader, immerses herself in the world of literature, and finds solace in her prayer and family.
Cecilia treasures the moments spent with her friends, children, eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
Her dedication to family and her unwavering spirit is a testament to her strength.
Moreover, her faith has been an anchor throughout her life, and is an active member of the Epiphany of the Lord Catholic Church in Katy, Texas.
Cecilia's story is not just one of resilience in the face of adversity, but also a celebration of a life richly lived--a life that continues to inspire those around her.
To that end, I want to once again honor her on behalf of the people in the 22nd Congressional District.
I wish Cecilia a happy birthday.
May God continue to bless her and her family every single day.
