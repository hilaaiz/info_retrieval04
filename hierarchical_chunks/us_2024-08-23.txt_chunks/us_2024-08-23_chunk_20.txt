Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Mark Myers, who served as the Vice President of the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC)
Branch 79 Seattle.
Mark served as NALC's legislative liaison to my office for many years.
He was a constant advocate for the voices and needs of his union's members.
He was a very effective advocate and all that were ]ucky enough to know Mark know that he was both sincere and kind in all that he did.
Throughout his life, Mark embodied what it truly means to serve.
Mark served his union through his work with my office, but a]so through his work at the Martin Luther King, Jr. County Labor Council and the Washington State Labor Council.
Not only was Mark the current Vice President of the NALC Branch 79 Seattle, but he had also served as Secretary-Treasurer and made history as the only retiree re-elected for three consecutive terms.
Mark spent his time outside of work continuing to serve his community.
He was a former member of the Highline Community Council and a devout member of his local church, the Saint Francis of Assisi Parish in Burien.
Mark is a shining example of true leadership and commitment.
I appreciate his many years of service working with my office, as well as all of his service to our community.
He will be deeply missed.
