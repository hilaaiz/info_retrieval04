their families, has been unwavering.
During her tenure, Joyce has successfully worked in various capacities in nearly every department of the Fund and has a well-earned reputation both inside and outside of the organization for her institutional knowledge and her unwavering work ethic.
Indeed, most developments at the Central Pension Fund--both big and small--have likely involved Joyce's input and advice.
As Director of Human Resources and Administration, Joyce has effectively served as the face of the organization for the Fund's employees, having spearheaded the Fund's recruitment and hiring efforts, while also playing an integral role in strategic planning.
In addition, by all accounts, Joyce has always gone above and beyond her technical job duties and has prioritized the professional development and personal well-being of her colleagues by creating and fostering a positive and enjoyable work culture.
In that regard, Joyce is notorious for hosting and facilitating costume-themed events and ice cream socials, and for placing personal notes and small gifts on her colleagues' desks in the pre-dawn hours before work.
In summary, Joyce's well-deserved retirement marks the end of an illustrious career, and while the Central Pension Fund will undoubtedly miss her deep institutional knowledge, dedication, and guidance, I am confident that the Fund will continue to thrive for decades to come as a result of her efforts.
