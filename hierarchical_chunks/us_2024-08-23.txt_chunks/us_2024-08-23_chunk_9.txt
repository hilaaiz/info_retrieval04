Mrs. Whitaker has the unique honor of being the first woman to be named North Carolina Farmer of the Year.
Mrs. Whitaker started Whitaker Farms with her late husband Richard in 1975, who she has surely honored with this award.
Together, they purchased 36 acres of land in Randolph County and as a result of their hard work, Whitaker Farms has now grown to 1,000 acres and includes a variety of different crops.
The Whitakers use innovative and sustainable farming practices to ensure high crop yields, healthy soil, drip irrigation and devote a majority of the land to organic production.
Our state has a long and proud tradition of agricultural excellence.
Many people don't even realize where the food they eat every day comes from, but the Whitakers could tell you they worked around the clock, 24 hours a day when they first started, to ensure they could pay back their first bank loan while overcoming weather conditions that make farming nearly impossible.
I know I speak for our region and entire state when I say thank you to our hard-working farmers and the Whitakers for their dedication to putting food on the table in North Carolina.
From peanuts to sweet potatoes, North Carolina farmers generate some of the highest quality produce in the world.
We are thrilled to recognize 
Mrs. Whitaker for her continuation of that tradition.
Again, congratulations to 
Mrs. Whitaker for winning this prestigious award.
