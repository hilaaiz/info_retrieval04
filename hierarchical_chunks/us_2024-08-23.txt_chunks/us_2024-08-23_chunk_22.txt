Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life.
Aldo Javier Garcia, who tragically passed away on June 24, 2024, at the age of 25.
Mr. Garcia was born in Hanford, California to Javier Pelagio Garcia and Araceli Navarro Garcia.
He had one brother, Orlando Navarro Garcia.
Mr. Garcia grew up in the Central Valley and was the proud son of farmworkers, from whom he learned the values of hard work and perseverance from a young age.
After graduating from Corcoran High School, 
Mr. Garcia went on to attend the University of California, Berkeley.
Mr. Garcia was an exceptional student and dedicated his time to the university community, having served as the Student Director of the UC Berkeley Public Service Center.
In 2021, 
Mr. Garcia received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in Political Science and was accepted to the prestigious Jess M. Unruh Assembly Fellowship.
After being selected by the fellowship program, 
Mr. Garcia served as a Fellow for California State Assemblymember Lori Wilson.
Last year, 
Mr. Garcia began his dream job as a legislative staffer for Assemblymember Juan Carrillo.
As Assemblymember Carillo's Legislative Aide, he worked hard on legislation to help improve the lives.
Mr. Garcia was a valuable asset and a strong leader on both Assemblymember Wilson's and Carrillo's teams, and he was at the beginning of an impactful career in California politics.
Mr. Garcia will be remembered by his family, friends, and colleagues as a kind and compassionate young man who always put the needs of others before his own.
His passion for politics, dedication to his community, and service to the State of California will never be forgotten.
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life of 
Mr. Aldo Javier Garcia.
My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
