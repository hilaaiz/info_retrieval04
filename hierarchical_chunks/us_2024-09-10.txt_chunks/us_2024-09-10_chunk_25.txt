Mr. D'ESPOSITO.
Mr. Speaker, due to official business regarding the upcoming anniversary of the September 11th attacks in my state, I was unable to participate in voting on the passage of H.R. 8333 and H.R. 1157.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 410, and YEA on Roll Call No. 402.
