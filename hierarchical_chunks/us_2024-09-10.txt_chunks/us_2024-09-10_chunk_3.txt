Mr. CARTWRIGHT.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize a remarkable and historic milestone for a cherished institution in the Eighth Congressional District of Pennsylvania: the 75th Anniversary of Congregation Beth Israel.
Located in Honesdale, a picturesque borough nestled in the hills of Northeastern Pennsylvania, Congregation Beth Israel holds the esteemed title of being the oldest continually operating synagogue in America still in its original building.
In September of 1849, amidst the backdrop of thousands moving westward in search of new opportunities, eleven pioneering men gathered in a modest home on Main Street in Honesdale.
In the flickering light of kerosene lamps, they made a commitment that would profoundly shape our community.
They pledged to form a Jewish congregation to serve the members of the Jewish faith, laying the foundation for what would become a beacon of faith and perseverance.
By 1856, these visionaries celebrated the first services held in their new building on Court Street.
This structure has withstood the test of time, continuing to serve as a spiritual home for generations.
It truly is a testament to the resilience and dedication of the Jewish community in Honesdale.
Today, Congregation Beth Israel remains a living symbol of Northeastern Pennsylvania's rich heritage and bright future.
Exemplifying this fact are the descendants of three of the congregation's original eleven families, who continue to play an active role in the synagogue's life and mission.
As we mark this 175th Anniversary, we celebrate not just a historical milestone but the vibrant, enduring spirit.
The synagogue is not only a cornerstone of our community's religious life but also a living testament to the dedication and faith of its members.
The echoes of prayers and songs that fill the pews today are a reminder of the deep roots and unwavering commitment of this congregation.
