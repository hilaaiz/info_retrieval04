Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Genrietta Churbanova, a Little Rock native.
Genrietta was named Princeton's 2024 valedictorian, not solely for ranking the top of her class, but embodying the absolute best Princeton has to offer.
Joao Biehl, Chairman of Princeton's anthropology department, agrees that she is the most exceptional student that has come through his department in the last two decades.
Genrietta was also named as Schwarzman Scholar for 2024, which is awarded to those who want to deepen their understanding about China's political, business, and technological impact on the rest of the world.
Genrietta stated that growing up in Arkansas kept her grounded and helped enable her to go far and achieve her goals.
I am proud to call Genrietta an Arkansan.
Her accomplishments and drive have made her more than deserving of this honor, and I am eager to watch her journey in the years to come.
