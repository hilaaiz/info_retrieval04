Mr. CAREY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Congressman Bill Pascrell, who passed away last month after serving nearly three decades in Congress.
It was a privilege to serve alongside Bill on the Ways & Means Committee.
Though we sat on different sides of the aisle, Bill's warmth, humor and dedication to his constituents can be a source of inspiration for all of us.
Bill was born in Paterson, New Jersey.
America's first industrial city.
Through the years he saw his community grow and change, but like the city's great falls, he remained a steadfast engine for progress.
I got to know Bill during events with the Italian American caucus, where we could talk about our shared heritage over glasses of Primitivo and Montepulciano.
In the spirit of those days, I would like to share a message in memory of this great man and his legacy: ``My friend, you will not be forgotten.
(Amico mio, non sarai dimenticato).''
