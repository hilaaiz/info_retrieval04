Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary.
Established in 1949, under the leadership of its first principal, Mr. J.M. Whitaker.
Jefferson High School has been the institution that has provided an excellent education to generations of students from the South-Central community.
Better known as the `Silver Foxes,' students and alumni proudly represent Jefferson all throughout El Paso, the country, and the world.
From Ricardo Samaniego, our El Paso County Judge, Alberto Almanza, an Olympian who competed in 1960 and 1964, and numerous of veterans and servicemembers who have served in all branches saying `once a fox, always a fox'--and Jefferson students and alumni are always proud of their community and where they come from.
