Mr. BUCHANAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize fire, rescue and EMS personnel who have provided distinguished service to the people of Florida's 16th Congressional District.
First responders, fIre departments and emergency medical service teams are summoned on short notice to serve their respective communities.
Often, they arrive at scenes of great adversity and trauma, to which they reliably bring strength and composure.
These brave men and women spend hundreds of hours in training so that they are prepared when they get ``the call.''
Twelve years ago, I established the 16th District Congressional Fire and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and units for outstanding achievement.
On behalf of the people of Florida's 16th District, it is my privilege to congratulate the following honorees, who were selected this year by an independent committee comprised of a cross section of current and retired fire and rescue personnel living in the district: Associate Service Award: Private Citizen Jake O'Brien of Hillsborough County Dedication and Professionalism Award: Senior Telecommunicator Lisa Kalmbach of the Manatee County Emergency Communications Center, Deputy Chief Jose Prado, Captain David Raasch, Company Fire Captain Andrew Capeletti, Fire Captain Nico DiNova, Fire Inspector Ryan Gould, Battalion Chief Jeffrey Landis and Captain Scott VanDeBoe of Hillsborough County Fire Rescue Unit Citation Award: Captain Rondalfo Rodriguez and Driver/Engineer
