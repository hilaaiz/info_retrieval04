Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize Bentley High School, Livonia's first public high school.
While the building no longer exists in its physical form, its space holds many special memories for many of the 12th Congressional District residents and alumni.
Livonia Township experienced population growth in the 1940s, which drove home the need for its own public high school.
Before then, its school-aged population was served by seven small school districts without a high school.
With the people's approval, construction of the new high school began on November 8, 1946.
The school was named for school board president George N. Bentley, and it hosted its first classes on September 15, 1947, in spite of ongoing construction.
Ninety-five students comprised the school's first graduating class on June 15, 1950, just a few weeks after Livonia was incorporated as a city.
Over the ensuing years, Bentley High School was expanded multiple times to accommodate the changing needs of a growing student body.
The school proudly boasted an extensive library, wood shop, auto shop, swimming pool, and music rooms.
Due to declining population, Bentley High School was closed in 1984, though it lived on a community center until 1999.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in recognizing Bentley High School, as the community of Livonia and alumni celebrate the legacy and memories of this historic place.
