Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Geraldine Grammer for her outstanding dedication, compassion and advocacy in her community.
Her selfless service to her community, surrounding areas in the MS Delta, and the Alcorn State University Bolivar County Alumni Chapter are commended.
