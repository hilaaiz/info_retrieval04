I would also like to recognize all the teachers, faculty, and staff of students, empower them to become productive citizens, and leaders in their communities.
It takes a village to educate and raise children and without their work, Jefferson High School would not be able to operate.
I ask all Members to join me today in honoring Jefferson High School for their 75 years of educational excellence and its profound impact on the lives of countless students, families, and the broader community.
Long live Jeff (Viva la Jeff).
