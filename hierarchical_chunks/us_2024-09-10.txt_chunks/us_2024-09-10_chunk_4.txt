It is with great pride and admiration that I recognize Congregation Beth Israel's 175 years of contributing to our community and to the broader American tapestry of religious and cultural diversity.
The history and ongoing vitality of this institution serve as a powerful reminder of the strength and unity found in faith and community.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Congregation Beth Israel on this historic anniversary.
I thank them for all they have done and continue to do for the Jewish community of Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District.
May their congregation continue to thrive and inspire for many years to come.
