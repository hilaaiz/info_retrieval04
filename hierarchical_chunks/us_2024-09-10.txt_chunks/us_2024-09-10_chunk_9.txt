Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable servant, Dr. Marie Davis.
Dr. Marie Davis was born in Natchez, MS, 68 years ago and she currently resides in Chesapeake, Virginia.
Her reflection of all the beautiful smiles of her hometown people prompt her to be a change in her hometown people lives.
Dr. Davis presided over many community projects such as being a sponsor for the drive thru turkey and trimmings, donation of household supplies, hygiene products, and the ham and eggs Easter giveaways.
During the year 2023, a storm swept through Natchez and Dr. Davis was informed that some homes were without electricity for days, homes had busted pipes, and inoperable hot water heaters.
Dr. Davis sent a generous donation to the Salvation Army and AJFC agency.
Dr. Davis' love for the seniors continues to radiate her heart so she connected with a longtime friend and ex coworker Alfredia Knight, together they made plans to take the elderly out to eat numerous times.
Dr. Davis sponsored haircuts, shaves, and other requested needs.
During a holiday visit to Natchez in December, she met with her friend Diane Good, the owner of a Performing Arts Center.
During this visit, Dr. Davis purchased all the string and wind instruments, equipment, and decor for the center.
Inspired by a vision, she connected with Jacqueline Marsaw and her group of grieving mothers and fathers, treating them to dinner and providing donations and gift cards to the members.
