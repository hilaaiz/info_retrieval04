speech, yearbook, and newspaper.
She was such a positive force that she was twice recognized as teacher of the year.
Melinda would later leave teaching to spend more time with her family, which now includes her husband Ken and their three children, nine grandchildren, and great-grandchild.
Melinda soon continued her community service as Executive Director of the Tuolumne County Alliance for Resources and Environment (TuCARE), a non-profit promoting good stewardship of public lands.
By hosting educational lands tours with regional leaders and annual conferences on forest health, Melinda has had an incalculable impact not only on local forestry, but on informing long-term policies needed to save our forests, communities, and local economies for posterity.
Due to her twenty years of service, TuCARE has been recognized as a non-profit of the year, a testament to her influence and dedication.
