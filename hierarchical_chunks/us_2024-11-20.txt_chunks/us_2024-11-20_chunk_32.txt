It is also worth noting that the next generation of Bells, including great-grandchildren, continue to take part in the farm's daily operations.
Whether helping with the animals, or assisting with planting and harvesting, their involvement in the farm ensures that this important piece of Michigan history will continue to thrive for many years to come.
On behalf of my colleagues, I extend heartfelt congratulations to David and Phyllis Bell and their family for being named the Farm of the Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association.
Their dedication to preserving Michigan's agricultural heritage and fostering a sense of community through farming serves as an inspiration to us all.
