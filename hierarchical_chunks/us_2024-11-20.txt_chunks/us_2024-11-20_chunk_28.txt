Each year, GSH manages the needs of over 1,000 families and individuals, helping them overcome obstacles and build a better future.
With a small but dedicated team--just 9 full-time staff, 3 part-time staff, and over 40 volunteers--Good Shepherd Housing has managed to accomplish extraordinary things.
The work they do, however, is made possible not only by their staff but by the unwavering commitment of their board members, volunteers, and the community that supports them.
As we celebrate Good Shepherd Housing's remarkable 50-year legacy, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has played a part in this incredible work--past and present board members, staff, volunteers, and all the partners who have worked hand-in-hand with GSH to strengthen our community.
I would also like to recognize the outstanding leadership of Executive Director Genee Hayes and Deputy Executive Director Candice Bennett.
Their dedication and vision have been integral to the organization's growth and success, earning well deserved recognition from the Washington Post, Leadership Fairfax, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Their collective impact serves as a reminder that when we invest in affordable housing and support services, we unlock the potential for families to thrive, not just survive.
Good Shepherd Housing is a true example of how innovative approaches and community partnerships can make a tangible difference in the lives works individually with residents to set personal goals, pursue education, and improve financial literacy, helping to break the cycle As we look to the future, I have no doubt that Good Shepherd Housing will continue to be a leader in providing affordable housing solutions and support services in our community.
Their work is a testament to the power of compassion, collaboration, and commitment to social justice.
