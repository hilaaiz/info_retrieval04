Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Mayor Dale Archer of East Greenwich Township, who has dedicated many years of service to our community, including 11 years as mayor.
Under his leadership, East Greenwich has flourished with strong fiscal management and innovative solutions for local governance.
He improved the township's finances by implementing a five-year plan with policies that allowed him to manage the community effectively, resulting in the second-lowest tax rate in Gloucester County.
Because of his guidance, East Greenwich received the Innovative Government Award from the League of Municipalities for its shared fire department service with Paulsboro.
The remarkable progress East Greenwich has made since Mayor Archer took office led to the town being recognized as the Best Small Town in New Jersey by South Jersey Magazine.
In addition to his commitment to his community, Mayor Archer served the world's finest fighting force, the United States Marine Corps, and has been a long-time member of both the Veteran of Foreign Wars and the Marine Corps League.
I thank Mayor Dale Archer, for his dedicated service to East Greenwich and our country, and I look forward to seeing all that he will accomplish in the future.
God bless Mayor Dale Archer, and God bless the United States.
