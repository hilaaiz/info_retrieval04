Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mannsdale Upper Elementary School for its National Blue Ribbon School distinction.
Since 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has recognized schools for academic achievements and efforts to close the educational gap within communities.
The program aims to showcase schools that demonstrate the importance of ensuring all students can achieve high academic standards.
This award is among the highest national honors given to schools across the United States.
This year, only 256 schools received recognition, and Mannsdale Upper Elementary is among the top schools, not only in Mississippi but also nationwide.
I am proud to see Mannsdale Upper Elementary honored with this prestigious award.
I want to thank Dr. Nicole Cockrell, Principal of Mannsdale Upper Elementary, Assistant Principal 
Mrs. Holly Jones, and Madison County School District Superintendent Ted Poore for their dedicated work in fostering such a high-achieving learning environment.
I extend my gratitude to the teachers and leaders in Madison County and across Mississippi for their unwavering and selfless dedication to helping students learn, grow, and strive for continuous improvement.
