Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and applaud Nolan Keating of Golden, Colorado for winning Best in Show in the 2024 Congressional App Challenge.
Nolan built an interactive app called The Swelling Dark, which is an immersive 3D survivor horror game with advanced graphics that serves as a metaphor for dealing with mental health.
Nolan spent countless hours and used many tools to develop his app and advance his STEM education.
I congratulate Nolan Keating for his success in the Congressional App Challenge.
I am certain he will exhibit the same dedication and character in his future accomplishments.
I am excited to see all he will accomplish.
