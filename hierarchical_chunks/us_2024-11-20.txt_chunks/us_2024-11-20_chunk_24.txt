Mr. Hodge has taken on many important roles at Tulare Western, including physical education teacher and head coach of the Varsity Boys Water Polo and Swim teams.
In 2020, he was appointed Department Chair of the Physical Education Department.
For over thirty years, 
Mr. Hodge has had a profound impact on students at Tulare Western High School.
As both a teacher and a coach, he has dedicated himself to developing the character and leadership skills of all his students.
He is known by colleagues as a strong leader and mentor who always puts his students first.
Mr. Hodge has received numerous awards throughout his career, including Visalia Times Delta Swim Coach of the Year in 2015 and California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Central Section Division 3 Swim and Water Polo Coach of the Year in 2019.
This year, he is nominated for the CIF State Model Coach Award, which recognizes coaches who demonstrate a longstanding commitment to fostering students' potential.
One of his greatest accomplishments is the success of his sons, Austin and Daven, both of whom attended Tulare Western and played key roles in the water polo team's championship victory during their time as students.
It is because of the commitment of educators like Mr. Hodge that students in the Central Valley community thrive, and I want to thank 
Mr. Hodge for creating an environment that helps our youth become the best they can be.
His dedication to the students at Tulare Western High School is a true testament to his character, and I am confident that his leadership will have a lasting impact on the Tulare Western community for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking 
Mr. David Hodge for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy and well-deserved retirement.
