Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to honor Jack Mazzeo from Hammonton, who owns and operates Mazzeo Studio, the oldest photography studio in New Jersey.
Since 1946, this family business has built a legacy of excellence in photography.
Jack has continued on his father's tradition, creating beautiful portraits, while also training his daughter, Deanna, to carry on the tradition.
He has taught his daughter well, as she specializes in capturing images of babies and children.
Jack's work has been recognized worldwide, competing with other professionals from around the globe, and earning him the prestigious title of Master.
Many of his award-winning photographs have been showcased at Professional Photographers Conventions in New York, Chicago, New Orleans, and even as far away as South Korea.
Jack is one of the world's finest photographers, and I am proud to say he is from my district.
God bless Jack, and God bless our United States.
