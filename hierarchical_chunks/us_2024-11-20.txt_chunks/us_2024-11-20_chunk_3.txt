Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize David Zimmerman for his decades of service to the Central Illinois community.
Zimmerman served on the Tazewell County Board for 27 years and was the chairman of the board for the last 16 years.
Zimmerman graduated from Illinois State University with a degree in Political Science and began his service to the Tazewell County Board in 1997.
Before becoming chairman, Zimmerman held many responsibilities as a board member including Finance, HR, Insurance Review, and Land Use Chair.
During his tenure on the Board, Zimmerman positively influenced the lives of his constituents by improving the well-being of Tazewell County.
Outside of his work on the Tazewell County Board, Zimmerman has served the people of Central Illinois through different public service roles.
Examples include the Greater Peoria Economic Development Commission Executive Board, United Counties Council of Illinois VicePresident, Tazewell County and Peoria Salvation Army Board Member, and Berean Prison Ministry Board Member, among others.
A strong leader within the Central Illinois community, Zimmerman was also recognized in the Peoria Magazine through their ``40 Leaders Under 40'' award.
David Zimmerman's decades long efforts have left a lasting impact on the Greater Peoria community and the state.
His commitment to our community is truly inspiring and I wish him the best in all future endeavors.
