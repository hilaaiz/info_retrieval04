Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Browne, an extraordinary individual from Mountainside, New Jersey, as he celebrates his 50th anniversary as a volunteer firefighter with the Mountainside Fire Department.
Since joining the department in February 1974, John has responded to no less than 60 percent of fire calls each year during his 50-year tenure--more than any other volunteer firefighter in the history of the department.
He has been described as the type of first responder you can always count on to be there, serving in every capacity, including line officer, lieutenant, captain, deputy chief, assistant chief, and even as fire chief on three separate occasions.
In his free time, John continues to educate and serve his community by volunteering to help lead free public tours of the John J. Harvey Fireboat Museum and Education Center in New York Harbor.
John's dedication and commitment to the community of Mountainside have been immeasurable, and I thank him for his incredible contributions to New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.
