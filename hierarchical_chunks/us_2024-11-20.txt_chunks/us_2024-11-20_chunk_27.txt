Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Good Shepherd Housing (GSH) on their 50th anniversary of dedicated service to Fairfax County, Virginia, and to the thousands of individuals and families whose lives have been transformed by their efforts.
For half a century, Good Shepherd has been a cornerstone in our community, providing safe, stable housing and vital support services to those at risk of homelessness or struggling to remain in their homes due to rising housing costs.
Their work has unlocked doors to brighter futures for countless individuals and families, and they remain a beacon of hope for those facing housing insecurity.
Good Shepherd is more than just a provider of affordable housing--it is a catalyst for self-sufficiency and community resilience.
Through a unique approach that focuses on the purchase and transformation of properties into affordable housing, GSH has not only provided shelter but has built a foundation for personal growth and long-term success.
By offering a comprehensive suite of support services--including case management, financial education, and referrals to specialized assistance--GSH helps families and individuals chart a path to stability, independence, and empowerment.
