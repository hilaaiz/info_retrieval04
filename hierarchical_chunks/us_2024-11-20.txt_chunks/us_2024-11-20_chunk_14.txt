Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our profound gratitude to New Hope Mayor Kathi Hemken for her hard work and dedication.
She has led the City Council, City staff, board and commission members, and most importantly, the New Hope community through unprecedented challenges and reshaped the city.
There is no question that New Hope will benefit from her thoughtful stewardship for generatIons to come.
