Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Leonard and Sarah Bell Farm in Unionville, Michigan, which has been named the Farm of the Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association for 2024.
This prestigious recognition honors farms that exemplify exceptional qualities in five key areas: longevity, stewardship, historic preservation, community involvement, and organizational membership and promotional activity.
The Bell family's 76-acre farm, now owned and operated by David and Phyllis Bell, is an enduring testament to Michigan's agricultural heritage.
The farm's origins trace back to 1919, when Leonard and Sarah Bell established the farm as part of their contribution to the agricultural development.
Leonard, a descendant of some of the county's earliest families, cultivated a variety of crops, including wheat, corn, navy beans, oats, and hay, supporting both his livestock and the local economy.
In the decades since its founding, the farm has remained in the Bell family for six generations, with David and Phyllis continuing the proud legacy of sustainable farming.
Under their stewardship, the farm grows a diverse range of crops--sugar beets, corn, navy beans, soybeans, and wheat--carefully rotated each year to maintain soil health and productivity.
The Bell farm has also earned several prestigious environmental and historical designations, including a federal Certificate of Farm War Service during World War II, a National Wildlife Federation Certified Wildlife Habitat, a Monarch Waystation, and a Certified Butterfly Garden.
These efforts not only preserve Michigan's natural beauty but also demonstrate the Bell family's deep commitment to environmental stewardship and biodiversity.
Beyond their agricultural achievements, the Bell family has been active in their local community, participating in farm organizations and sharing their story to promote the importance of preserving Michigan's farming history.
Their farm is a living example of the values that the Michigan Centennial Farm Association seeks to honor each year.
