Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Specialist Joshua Smith, a distinguished veteran of the Michigan Army National Guard.
Raised in Caro, Michigan, he graduated from Caro High School.
Josh demonstrated his commitment to service by joining the Army National Guard in 2018.
He underwent rigorous training, completing Basic Training at Fort Benning and Advanced Individual Training at Fort Leonard Wood, specializing as an 88M Motor Transport Operator.
He was assigned to the 237th Brigade Support Battalion in Bay City.
Josh deployed to Syria from 2022 to 2023, where he served with honor and distinction.
During his deployment, his duties included operating a 10k SkyTrak, loading C-130 aircraft, and recovering essential equipment and supplies from airdrops.
His efforts were vital to the logistical support of his unit and other forces stationed in the region.
In the challenging environment of an active combat zone, Josh excelled as a member of the fuel crew, ensuring that every generator on the base was fully fueled through dedicated shifts.
His contributions were crucial to maintaining operational readiness and supporting his fellow service members.
Notably, Josh was present during a rocket attack on March 23, 2023, when 15 122mm rockets were fired from Iraq at Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria.
Thanks to his leadership and quick response, there were no injuries or damage to equipment during this hostile incident.
Josh's actions during this time earned him the Combat Action Badge, a testament to his bravery and professionalism.
Additionally, Josh had the unique opportunity to train with special forces during his premobilization at Fort Bliss, further enhancing his skills and readiness.
Specialist Josh Smith exemplifies the dedication, resilience, and selflessness that we honor in our armed forces.
I commend him for his service and commitment to our Nation.
