Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elbert Henry ``Toughegg'' Knox, a courageous American who gave his life in service to our country during World War II.
Elbert Knox first served as an Army cook from 1919 to 1920.
In September 1941, at the age of 40, he answered the call again, leaving his home to work as a civilian contract worker on Wake Island in the Pacific Ocean.
There, Knox and other civilians built essential facilities for the military, helping to defend the island during a fierce Japanese attack on December 8, 1941.
Despite their valiant efforts, Wake Island fell to Japanese forces after a 15-day battle, and Knox became a prisoner of war.
Transferred to Japan in September 1942, he faced brutal conditions--enduring abuse, starvation, solitary confinement, and exposure.
Knox's resilience was unwavering, but tragically, he died in captivity.
After the war, his remains were laid to rest in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.
In 1981, Knox and his fellow civilian contractors on Wake Island were granted veteran status.
Today, I am proud to report that 
Mr. Knox has been posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War (POW) Medal and the Purple Heart.
These medals will be presented to his family, who have waited decades to see his heroism formally recognized.
His story is a powerful reminder of the price of liberty and the strength of the American spirit.
I urge my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to 
Mr. Elbert Knox and extending our deepest gratitude to his family.
May his legacy continue to inspire us all to serve our Nation with honor and dedication, and may we never forget his sacrifice.
