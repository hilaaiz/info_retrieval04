Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate Olympic Gold Medalist and wrestling champion Sarah Hildebrandt, who brought home the gold in the women's wrestling freestyle 50-kilograms event at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.
Growing up in Granger, Indiana, and a proud 2011 graduate of Penn High School where she wrestled all four years, Sarah's achievements in the sport of wrestling are almost too numerous to list.
Prior to coming to Paris this summer, Sarah could claim being a two-time world bronze medalist, a two-time world silver medalist, and an Olympic bronze medalist from the Tokyo Summer Games as just a few of her many accolades.
With her win over Cuba's Yusneylis Guzman Lopez in the 50kilogram weight class women's freestyle final on August 7, 2024, Sarah is now also just the fourth woman to win gold in wrestling for Team USA in history.
Upon winning the gold this summer, Sarah reflected, ``this gold medal is for everyone who has ever faced a setback or felt like giving up.
It's proof that with hard work, determination, and a little bit of faith, anything is possible.''
Sarah's determination and persistence have inspired so many around the world, especially but not limited to those in the sport of wrestling.
I have always found it fitting that the Summer Olympics take place in the same year as our U.S. presidential elections.
While Americans are often divided politically, every four years the Summer Olympics afford us an opportunity to unite around our love of country and be united in pride and admiration for athletes like Sarah who represent our Nation on the world stage so well.
I thank Sarah for bringing a healthy dose of Hoosier pride to Paris this summer.
I congratulate her on her incredible athletic achievements, both at this summer's Olympics and throughout her impressive, decorated career.
I and so many others look forward to seeing what she will continue to accomplish going forward.
May God bless.
