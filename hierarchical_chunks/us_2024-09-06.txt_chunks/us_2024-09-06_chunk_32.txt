Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my first Congressional Chief of Staff, an early activist in the Civil Rights Movement, a life-long public servant, and my friend, Shirley Cooks, who passed on January 19, 2024.
A celebration of life will be held for Shirley on Capitol Hill on September 12 with her family, friends and former co-workers gathering to honor a woman of substance, skill and humor who they considered a mentor and hero.
Shirley ran my D.C. office with outstanding skill and loyalty, helping me, a first-term congressman, navigate a world she had known and managed relationships in for years.
Her sage advice, deep knowledge, and constant grace were invaluable to me.
A dedicated public servant all her life, Shirley was an ardent advocate of civil rights and had the achievements and life history to advance them.
Shirley was born on August 27, 1944, to Melvine and William Wright in New York City.
Her early education was divided between New York and Aboukir, St. Ann, Jamaica.
Shirley graduated from St. Paul's School in Los Angeles in 1958.
She became acquainted with leaders and staff members of both the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) when she moved from Los Angeles to New York to live with her brother and sister-in-law, entertainer and political activist Harry and his wife Julie Belafonte, and
