Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the exceptional bravery, skill, and determination of the United States Coast Guard units stationed along the Gulf Coast.
These dedicated men and women came together in a large-scale Search and Rescue operation, resulting in the safe recovery of two scuba divers who had been separated from their dive vessel and lost at sea for nearly two days.
On the morning of July 24th, the Sector Corpus Christi Command Center received a distress call reporting two divers missing more than 30 miles offshore from Matagorda Texas and the Coast Guard immediately mobilized multiple assets.
Leading this Search and Rescue effort was Lieutenant Commander Nina McDonald whose knowledge and experience helped coordinate the safe return of the divers.
During the search, the Coast Guard faced severe weather and a vast search area.
After hours without any luck, the aircrew of Coast Guard 2306 took over the search efforts.
Despite daunting conditions, including reduced visibility, overcast skies, and hazardous flying through numerous cloud layers, this crew pressed on.
After hours in the air, Petty Officer Nathan Cyrus, serving as a visual observer, spotted a faint flash of light on the water and the aircrew quickly maneuvered to the location where Petty Officer James Welzig, the dropmaster, prepared the aircraft for an aerial delivery of rescue equipment.
Under the command of Lieutenant Brian Holcombe and Lieutenant Junior Grade Jake Pritchett, the aircrew helped guide the Coast Guard Cutter to the scene where the crew successfully located and rescued the two divers, who had endured 38 harrowing hours at sea.
