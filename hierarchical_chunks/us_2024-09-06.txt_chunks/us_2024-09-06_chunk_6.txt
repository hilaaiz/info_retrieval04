Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and privilege to recognize and celebrate the centennial anniversary of the City of Belle Isle in Central Florida.
Once a Native American oasis, Belle Isle was founded by Central Floridians in 1924 to resist Orange County's attempts to drain Lake Conway and its chain of lakes, which span approximately 1,800 acres.
Belle Isle's first citizens and interim Mayor C.H. Hoffner unanimously voted on the city's name, which resembles the French phrase for ``beautiful island.''
Today, it reflects the city's peaceful, lakefront living that provides an escape from the nearby metros.
In 1928, Belle Isle was annexed back into Orange County, and records of the City of Belle Isle ceased to exist.
However, residents once again rallied against another attempt by the County to use the lakes for drainage in 1954, and the local government was reinstated.
The State of Florida later recognized the City of Belle Isle's charter in 1972.
The city's government ran continuously until the early 2000s when a council-manager form of government was adopted to better serve Belle Isle residents.
Since that time, the city has flourished.
Annexations, the establishment of a Belle Isle Police Department, and an agreement to open Cornerstone Charter Academy mark Belle Isle's largest achievements in recent years.
In celebration of Belle Isle's centennial, the city will be hosting a Tree Recognition Ceremony to honor two of its beautiful trees.
One tree will be recognized as a centennial tree, symbolizing 100 years of Belle Isle history.
A second plaque will acknowledge a newly planted tree that will stand for the next 100 years.
We wish good fortune to the City of Belle Isle and its residents and hope for another 100 years of history.
