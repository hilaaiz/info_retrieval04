Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, last week, I was sad to learn about the passing of retired Deputy Sheriff Robert T. Wilson of the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office.
Deputy Wilson dedicated his life serving his community and country.
A veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Bob served at the Eastern Correctional Institute before retiring from the Wicomico County Sheriff's Office in June of 2021.
Deputy Wilson dedicated his life to helping others, putting his own life on the line to protect and serve the community he so much loved.
A devoted member of the Fraternal Order of Police, Bob believed in service, sacrifice and honor.
Robert T. Wilson passed away at the age of 71 years old.
I would like to express my sincere condolences to his wife Esther, the Wilson family and the entire Wicomico County Sheriff's Office.
The Eastern Shore is forever grateful for DFC Robert T. Wilson.
