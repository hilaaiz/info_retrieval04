Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service of Colonel Constance C. Johnson-Cage, the Individual Mobilization Augmentee to the Director of Personnel in the Office of the Air Force Reserve.
Colonel Johnson-Cage, a Kansas City resident, is retiring from the United States Air Force after more than 38 years of service.
Colonel Johnson-Cage's career has been marked by a distinguished commitment to our nation's defense and security.
This commitment began in 1985, when Colonel Johnson-Cage enlisted in the United States Air Force as an air cargo specialist.
Since then, Colonel Johnson-Cage has held an impressive portfolio of leadership positions, including serving at the Secretary of the Air Force level and Headquarters Air Force level, and as a commander in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve.
In her current position, Colonel Johnson-Cage assists in the oversight of Total Force policy development and guidance, prepares input for legislative initiatives and congressional testimony, and facilitates the integration of personnel policies across the Department resources impacting a budget of nearly $450 million for accessions, recruiting, retention, education, training, force structure, compensation, and benefits impacting 360,000 reservists and their dependents worldwide.
Her contributions have been recognized with an array of honors.
Most notably, Colonel Johnson-Cage received a Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Meritorious Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, and an Air and Space Longevity Service Award with two oak leaf clusters.
The Kansas City area is proud to have Colonel Johnson-Cage as a part of our community.
As Colonel Johnson-Cage enters into her next chapter, I have no doubt she will continue to spread the spirit of dedication and service to country.
I thank Colonel Johnson-Cage for her lifetime
