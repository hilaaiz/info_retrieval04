The working group reports, mandated by Congress, represent a true landmark in their far-reaching coverage of the persistent symptoms and persistent illness suffered by Lyme disease patients and the need for enhanced understanding of Lyme disease-associated chronic illness.
And the reports referenced many published studies of chronic Lyme disease.
The groundbreaking content of the working group's reports and their positive impact on Lyme patients and Lyme study are due in no small part to two term working group member Pat Smith.
Under Pat's leadership, LDA provided 127 research grants that have been acknowledged in 62 scientific journals.
Working with author Amy Tan, she created LymeAid 4 Kids, a program that offers critical support to children with Lyme who come from families that face financial challenges.
To date, this amazing initiative has provided more than $475,000 for diagnosis and treatment for children in need.
Naturally inquisitive and loaded with ``street smarts,'' Pat also continued to study and probe the origins of Lyme and the impact defense bioweapons experiments on ticks may or may not have had on Lyme's epidemic growth in the U.S. Pat Smith's unyielding commitment to improving the Federal response to Lyme disease has made a huge difference and has offered so much hope for Lyme patients across the country.
She demanded fairness and honesty and never asked anybody to give more or do more than she and her husband, Rich, gave and did for the cause of conquering Lyme.
I will greatly miss my good friend, Pat Smith, a trailblazer for Lyme disease patients.
Pat and I share a birthday, a last name, and a thirst for justice for patients with Lyme.
For Pat, and in her honor, our fight will continue.
