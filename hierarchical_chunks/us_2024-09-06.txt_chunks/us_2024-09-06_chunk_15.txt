Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of my constituents who has been a valued member of our community here on Capitol Hill for the past quarter century: Mark Fritter from Anne Arundel County, Maryland.
He is retiring after providing crucial technical support to numerous congressional offices over the past 25 years.
We ought to give thanks for his many contributions to his community, his Congress, and his country.
Mark is a bit of a kindred spirit.
Like me, Mark was raised in Prince George's County.
He is also a fellow Terp, having earned his degree in marketing from the University of Maryland, College Park.
He kicked off his career on Capitol Hill in 1999 as a consultant helping congressional staff use the customer relationship management (CRM) software ``Capitol Letters.''
Following a merger, he pivoted to consulting staff on how to use Intranet Quorum (IQ).
Back then, computers were still a relatively new technology.
Mark played a vital role in helping staff harness the power of these new tools and integrate these innovations into Congress' day-today work.
In the past 25 years, Mark provided invaluable support to hundreds of legislative coordinators, communications directors, and other top staff.
He has taught communications professionals how to use IQ's newsletter software to keep constituents informed and to expand Member offices' subscriber base and digital reach.
His work has helped Members engage more closely with the people they represent.
Mark has been particularly adept at helping set up new Member offices on these technologies and has helped facilitate more than a dozen congressional transitions during his tenure on the Hill.
