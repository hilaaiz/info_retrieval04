Mr. Speaker, Mark is one of the thousands of people who work tirelessly behind the scenes to help this Congress fulfill its responsibilities For the People.
His commitment to service goes beyond his professional career, however.
From supporting his local church to serving as Assistant Scoutmaster for Boy Scout Troop 403 based out of Bowie, Maryland.
Mark has devoted much of his free time to giving back to his community.
He has also been a tremendous husband to his wife, Rhonda, and father to their son, Ben.
Crucially, I hear Mark has been an excellent owner to their dog, Pepper, and their two cats, Lilly and Zoe-Zoe.
I know that many here on Capitol Hill and back in Maryland appreciate Mark's warmth, good humor, and willingness to lend a hand.
Mark may be moving to Indiana to be closer to family, but he'll always be a Marylander at heart.
It is a privilege to represent kind, generous, and hardworking people like Mark from Maryland's Fifth District.
I ask that all my colleagues join me in congratulating Mark on this milestone and in wishing him and his family all the best.
