Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Huron County Community Foundation.
Since 1994, this organization has been a cornerstone of meaningful change and community development throughout Huron County, which I am proud to represent in Congress.
For three decades, the Huron County Community Foundation has made good on their mission to ``Invest FOR GOOD... FOR EVER.''
This motto has, without a doubt, fostered legacies that will shape Huron County's future for years to come.
The foundation's impact covers a wide array of needs throughout our community, from healthcare to education and beyond.
Through grants and other donations, the foundation has empowered countless families and organizations to succeed in their charitable goals.
It goes without saying, but the amount of work that goes into an organization like this should be inspiring to us all.
As we honor this milestone, it is important to recognize how the foundation--and all its beneficiaries-- have played a central role in nurturing Huron County.
The very spirit of the foundation, coupled with their dedication to their community, has been central in guaranteeing a bright future.
