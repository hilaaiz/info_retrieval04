Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent such committed constituents like Richard Baron.
Richard is an institution unto himself whose retirement leaves shoes that will not easily be filled.
However, we can take solace in the knowledge that Richard's legacy lives on in the countless firefighters he mentored and, despite his retirement, that he will remain close to the Woodstock firefighting community.
Having positioned the town of Woodstock for greater success, Richard has earned this retirement and will appreciate time with his wife of 30 years, Beth, and their family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing Richard Baron's community-oriented contributions to the town of Woodstock and congratulating him on his well-earned retirement.
