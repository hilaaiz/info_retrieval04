Mrs. Riley moved to South Carolina in 1982.
That same year, Mrs. Riley began attending community meetings, getting involved in local campaigns, and was appointed President of the Spartanburg County Republican Women, where she has served ever since.
More than politics, 
Mrs. Riley is a major contributor to her local pregnancy center, she has volunteered her time with the mental health divisions, the foster care community, and supports Upstate veterans undergoing hospice care.
She is also active in her church and other organizations that work to assist our fellow South Carolinians every single day.
She has served the South Carolina GOP in many roles and has attended local, state, and national meetings and conventions.
She is the recipient of numerous awards including the ``Woman of Achievement Award'' from the South Carolina Legislative Republican Women Caucus, ``Woman of the Year'' from Spartanburg County Republican Women and has received the honor of ``Catholic Woman of the Year'' twice.
A former teacher, her life's work has been to make the world a better place for her students, her neighbors, and future generations.
