Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Richard Baron of Woodstock, Connecticut who retires from his work with the Woodstock Fire Marshal's office on November 30, 2023.
Richard's retirement concludes 50 years of exemplary service to the Town of Woodstock, the last 27 of which were as Fire Marshal.
His outstanding dedication to his community and expertise will be sorely missed.
From his earliest days in northeastern Connecticut, Richard was destined to be an exceptional member of the Woodstock community.
He attended the Woodstock Academy and Ellis Technical School in Woodstock and Danielson respectively and was drawn to helping others by following a special calling to the challenging work of public safety.
At a very young age, Richard began his journey at the Muddy Brook Fire Department as a volunteer, which gave him a chance to apply his technical knowledge and caring disposition to the tasks of a firefighter.
