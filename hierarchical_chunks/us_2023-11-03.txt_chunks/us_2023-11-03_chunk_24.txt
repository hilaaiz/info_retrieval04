Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 2023 Fairfax's Finest Valor Awards Recipients, and thank all of the men and women who keep our community safe.
Their efforts, made on behalf of the citizens of our community, are selfless acts of heroism and truly merit our highest praise.
I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding this group of remarkable citizens.
