Ms. TOKUDA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of one of my favorite Republicans, my former colleague, my friend, the late Hawaii State Senator, Sam Slom.
For 20 years, Sam represented East Honolulu's 9th Senatorial District.
and for almost half that time, he was the sole Republican member of the Hawaii Senate earning him the self-imposed nickname.
``The Lone Ranger.''
As one of a handful.
or the only, member of the minority party, Sam read every bill, every resolution, and defied time and space to try and get to every committee and vote.
I had the honor and privilege of serving many years side by side Sam.
Yes.
we disagreed on many things, but more than not, we saw eye to eye, especially on our commitment to lowering the cost of living for middle class working families and being good fiscal stewards with taxpayer dollars.
Prior to his service in the State Senate.
Sam served as the chief economist for the Bank of Hawaii, and for over 30 years he was the President and Executive Director.
There is much that could be said about the boy from Allentown, Pennsylvania, who found his way to Hawaii in the sixties and made Hawaii his home.
What I can personally share is that he was often the member I could count on to be there.
When I needed his vote, even if he disagreed, he'd help me get it to the floor and was open and honest with me on why he disagreed.
He was a statesman till the very end, and given the partisan times we find ourselves in, I truly miss my friend.
Mahalo to Sam for blessing us with his wisdom, his advocacy.
and his friendship.
There are more Hawaiian hoary bats in our islands because challenged our minds and won our hearts.
