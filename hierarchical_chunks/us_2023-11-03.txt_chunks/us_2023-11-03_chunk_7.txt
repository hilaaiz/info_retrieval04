Mrs. Riley is a true public servant who has made a significant and lasting impact on Spartanburg County, the South Carolina GOP, and the lives of countless South Carolinians.
We will never be able to fully thank her for over 30 years of service to the people of Spartanburg County and the Upstate as a whole.
She has left an indelible mark on the Palmetto State.
I thank Mary Ann Riley for her years of service and friendship.
May God continue to bless her.
