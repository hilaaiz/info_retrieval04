Ms. Evelyn Rice-Peebles for her career in public service to Missouri's First District over the last 30 years.
Throughout her career, she has been an inspiration to many.
Evelyn was the first Black woman appointed as a Commissioner in the City.
Louis.
She has served under several Mayors, most recently as the Commissioner of Recreation for the City.
Louis, ensuring that all St. Louisans have an opportunity to enjoy recreational activities such as swimming, aerobics, basketball and more.
Her charitable contributions have ranged from providing science and conservation education at the Saint Louis Science Center and Missouri Department of Conservation, to promoting learning opportunities with the National Society.
She has further dedicated her time with BJC HealthCare's School Outreach and Youth Development, St. Louis Transitional Hope House, and the Women's Society of Washington University.
She is a proud mother who is passionate about her faith and is committed to making St. Louis a better place for all, especially our youth.
Ms. Evelyn Rice-Peebles has received multiple awards including the Harambee Institute Youth Service Award, the Jodie Bailey and Friends Recreational and Sports Social Inc.
Role Model Award, the Hope House Creative Support Award, and the Young Women Christian Association's 2016 Leader.
She is also an inductee for Excellence in Office and Service by the St. Louis City Board of Aldermen.
On behalf of Missouri's First District and the St. Louis community, we thank 
Ms. Evelyn Rice-Peebles for everything she has done for our region.
I personally wish her a joyous retirement filled with family, creative writing, spoken word, and the final publication of her collection of short stories.
