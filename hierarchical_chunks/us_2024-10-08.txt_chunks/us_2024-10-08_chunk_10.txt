Longworth Davis, and their four daughters, Charlotte, LaTonia and her husband Brian, Karin and her husband Ron, and Amber and her husband William.
He is also survived by his eight grandchildren, Trimonte, LaRon, Jordan, Charles, Avery, Ja'lyn, Jayden, Charli and six greatgrandchildren.
His memory will also live on through his godchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, friends, and the College Hill COGIC community.
Pastor Davis always had a twinkle in his eye, a kind word and made our community more gracious.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my Tampa Bay area neighbors and all Floridians, I am proud to honor Superintendent Charles Davis for his lifelong dedication to others, and his kind, loving service to all.
We are eternally grateful for his immense contributions.
