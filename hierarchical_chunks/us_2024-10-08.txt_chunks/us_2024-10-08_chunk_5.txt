Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and humbled to posthumously honor Fire Lieutenant (Lt.)
Brian Peek, who tragically passed away in the Line of Duty while serving as a member of the Goldsboro Fire Company.
Lt. Peek was a gift and blessing to our community throughout his more than 50 years of service as a Firefighter, who was dedicated to mentoring new members, and was tirelessly committed to the Station and to the Citizens it serves.
He will be greatly missed by all who knew him or were blessed to share his life even in a small way.
Lt. Peek served as Fire Lt. 68-3, Fire Police Lt. 68, and Fire Police 28-4 in his myriad years of service.
Lt. Peek leaves behind his beloved family--two sons, two stepsons, his brother, and 18 grandchildren--who will carry his legacy.
