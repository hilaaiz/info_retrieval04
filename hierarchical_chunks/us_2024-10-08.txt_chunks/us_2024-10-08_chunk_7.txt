Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, I, along with the people.
Louis, rise to celebrate and honor the life and legacy of Theodore Raymond Drewes, Jr.
The name Ted Drewes is synonymous with summer in St. Louis.
For generations, Ted Drewes Frozen Custard has brought joy and sweet memories to Missouri's First District.
In 1930, tennis star Ted Drewes, Sr. debuted his first St. Louis Frozen Custard stand on Natural Bridge Road, later opening two locations that still serve St. Louisans and visitors alike on South Grand Boulevard and Chippewa Street.
As a child, Ted Drewes Jr. often appeared in the family's custard stands advertisements with the tagline ``It really is good guys, and gals!''
Ted Drewes, Jr. fully embraced the family business working 80 hours a week between stands and making it the beloved St. Louis institution we crave.
Like many across St. Louis, on a hot summer day, I have cooled down with my two favorite Ted Drewes staples: The Christy or a Strawberry Concrete.
Ted not only loved frozen custard, but he was also an accomplished rifleman, speed roller skater, and table tennis player.
He valued using philanthropy to further customer service and community service, particularly through supporting his church, Historic Trinity Lutheran Church in Soulard, and the St. Louis Area Foodbank.
I offer my deepest condolences on behalf of Missouri's First District to his wife Dorothy Jane Drewes, daughters Christy Dillon and Cynthia Verseman, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and the many people and community members who loved him.
