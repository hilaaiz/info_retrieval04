When factories and plants closed in San Antonio, they created jobtraining programs and worked with businesses to bring more high-paying jobs to the City.
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the COPS/ Metro Alliance founded an unprecedented education and job placement program called ``SA Ready to Work'', offering over 28,000 San Antonio residents job placement, support, and retention services, and tuition for high school equivalency, college degrees, and industry-recognized certifications: the first of its kind in the Nation.
While great strides have been made in the last few decades to make San Antonio a more equitable city, there is still more work to be done.
As the 
Representative for Texas's 35th Congressional District, I know that the COPS/Metro Alliance will continue its incredible legacy of uplifting the most disadvantaged among us, and work to create an even greater San Antonio.
