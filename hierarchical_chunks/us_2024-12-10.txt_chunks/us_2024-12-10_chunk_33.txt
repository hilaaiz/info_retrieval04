Mrs. McIVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of the Honorable Mildred C. Crump, a visionary leader and trailblazer from my beloved city of Newark, New Jersey.
Mildred was a woman of many ``firsts'' and her wisdom, guidance, and unwavering belief in justice helped shape my life and career--and transformed the lives of so many others.
As the first African American woman elected to the Newark City Council and as the council's first woman president, Mildred broke barriers and demonstrated a steadfast commitment to equity, justice, and community empowerment.
Her dedication to improving the lives of others--whether through her pioneering work as New Jersey's first African American Braille teacher or her tireless advocacy for housing, education, and civil rights--has left an everlasting mark on our city, state, and Nation.
Council President Crump was more than a role model.
She was a relentless advocate and champion for people, and a brilliant community strategist.
She blazed a path for so many and was always a source of unwavering support for those of us who had the honor of learning from her.
Mildred's leadership, compassion, and vision will be profoundly missed.
All Newarkers mourn the loss of this exceptional woman.
I send my deepest condolences to her children, Larry and Sheri, and all her loved ones.
I know Mildred's legacy and impact will live on.
It lives on in me and many others.
I thank Mildred C. Crump, on behalf of all the little Black and brown girls she has inspired and provided a light to shine.
We love you forever.
