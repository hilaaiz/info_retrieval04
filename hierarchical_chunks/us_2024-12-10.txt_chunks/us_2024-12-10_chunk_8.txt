Mr. Gambaryan is an American citizen, a resident of Georgia, and a dedicated former public servant.
While on a business trip to Nigeria in February, he was arrested and charged with false accusations of tax evasion and money laundering.
Tigran was detained in the notorious Kuje Prison for months, repeatedly denied access to medical care as his health deteriorated, denied basic due process rights, and otherwise treated inhumanely.
Despite these severe hardships, 
Mr. Gambaryan displayed remarkable resilience and an unwavering determination to return home.
Finally, on October 23, 2024, Nigeria dropped all fraudulent charges against 
Mr. Gambaryan, and he was able to return safely to the United States.
I want to thank the hard work and dedication of the Department home.
I also want to extend my deepest gratitude to my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee for their unwavering support and advocacy in urging the Nigerian government to secure his release.
Most importantly, I want to commend 
Mr. Gambaryan for his courage and for never losing hope during this tumultuous situation.
It is an honor to represent brave individuals like Tigran Gambaryan in Congress, and I celebrate his return home to his wife Yuki and their two young children.
God bless their family.
