Mr. BURLISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Karen Matthews, the Christian County, Missouri, Treasurer, on her retirement.
Christian County is home to nearly 90,000 citizens in the southwest part of Missouri, and 
Ms. Matthews has served as an elected official there for 22 years.
During her tenure, 
Ms. Matthews has achieved many accomplishments.
She manages nearly $50 million annually in county revenue and transitioned the county's operations from a third-class county to a first-class county due to the area's population growth.
She initiated online banking for the county, direct deposit payroll for county employees and implemented premier financial software.
She also saved the county thousands of dollars by implementing a more efficient time and attendance software.
Finally, despite the millions of annual transactions, the county has successfully passed all of its dozens of audits with 100-percent compliance.
