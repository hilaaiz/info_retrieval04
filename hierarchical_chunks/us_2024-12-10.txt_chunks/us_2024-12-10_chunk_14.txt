Representatives after a 20-year career representing the folks of Washington's 5th congressional district.
I've had the pleasure of working closely with Cathy on the Energy and Commerce Committee for a long time and together we've been able to accomplish some amazing things for the American people.
I've admired her determination and strength to get our priorities across the finish line and she has never stopped working tirelessly on behalf of the people she was elected to serve.
What I most admire about Cathy is her dedication to her family and the Down Syndrome community.
Over the years I've had the privilege of becoming friends with her son Cole, who has inspired me and is one of the reasons I'm so passionate about supporting Cathy's work on behalf of the Down Syndrome community.
She has been a tireless champion for the community and left a lasting legacy with her accomplishments on behalf of the people who are differently-abled, so they can live their lives to their full potential with no barriers or bias or obstacles standing in their way.
While her colleagues will miss her dearly, we wish Cathy and her family all the best as she begins this next chapter of her life.
