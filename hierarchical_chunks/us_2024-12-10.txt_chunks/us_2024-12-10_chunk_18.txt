Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my friend, Russell D. Smoldon, CEO of B3 Strategies.
I first met Russell while serving in the Arizona State Legislature in 2009.
At the time, Russell was the manager of government relations for Salt River Project (SRP), a major utility and water company in Arizona.
Russell now runs his own company and has over 35 years of public policy experience focused on energy, water, environmental, taxation, healthcare, and economic development issues.
Russell is a respected leader in Arizona and I believe just about everyone knows him and likes him.
He serves on the board of the Arizona Tax Research Association (ATRA) and on the board of CrossRoads.
Russell has also served in leadership positions with the Western Business Roundtable, the Greater Phoenix Urban League, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the National Conference of State Legislators' Advisory Council on Energy, and the National Tax Partnership.
He also served as a member of the Arizona Supreme Court's Child Support Guidelines and Domestic Relations Committees and the Arizona Highway Users' Association, and has assisted numerous non-profit organizations, including the Arizona Trails Association.
Russell is caring, fun-loving, funny, and knowledgeable.
I have called on him for input on Arizona issues for many years.
I thank Russell for his years of support and for all of the times he has provided me with valuable information and advice.
Please know that I appreciate him.
May God continue to Bless him and his family for years to come.
