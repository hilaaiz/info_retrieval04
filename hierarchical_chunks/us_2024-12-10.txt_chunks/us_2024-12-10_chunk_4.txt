Mr. CASAR.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to call the attention of the House in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Communities Organized for Public Service/Metro Alliance.
Since 1974, the COPS/Metro Alliance has invested billions of dollars into San Antonio families and have fought to make the City a place where everyone's voices are heard.
Led by a West-Side native organizer named Ernesto Cortes Jr., church leaders across the City began to organize and work with one another to secure more opportunities for working class residents.
They used their newfound voices to fight for housing for seniors, environmental protections, and safer streets.
Members of COPS/Metro Alliance even began running for office, and successfully secured funding for libraries, parks, and public services.
