Ms. Matthews was honored by her peers by being elected as the treasurer for the Missouri County Treasurer's Association, a position she has held since 2012.
She also is the treasurer for Mt. Zion Baptist Church, serves on the Missouri County Treasurer's Association legislative board and is a member of several area chambers of commerce.
In addition to her public service, she has been the co-owner of several small businesses in the construction and home design fields.
I'd like to congratulate 
Ms. Matthews on her well-deserved retirement.
She has faithfully executed her responsilities as county treasurer and she will be missed.
I wish her the very best in the next phase of her life.
