Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Maricopa County Supervisor for District 4, Clint Hickman.
Clint, a 4th-generation Arizonan, has served on the Board of Supervisors since March 21, 2013.
He also is the Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Hickman's Family Farms, the largest egg producer in the southwest United States.
Supervisor Hickman's experience running a business and his deep roots in the West Valley have guided his actions on the Board of Supervisors, leading the Counties' approach to fiscal responsibility and effective governance.
He has been a valuable resource to his constituents and small businesses, and helped lead the county through the challenging COVID-19 pandemic.
I sincerely appreciate Clint's service to the 8th Congressional District, Maricopa County, and Arizona.
