Gentleman for his intervention.
I would say merely that he has been party to the negotiations, and he must surely have realised that the company was not negotiating in good faith and expected his officials to prepare legislation, if required, to deal with the situation that we are now in.

I assume and hope that Defence Ministers have been lobbying the Secretary of State to make their concerns clear.
