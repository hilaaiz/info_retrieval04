I believe that that is on the record.
I hope to convince all colleagues today to support this action, which is in the national interest.
When the blast furnaces in Port Talbot closed down last September, this Government could have taken exactly the same legislative action as they have chosen to take today.
We will endeavour to amend the Bill to include Wales, because there is still the opportunity for this Government to make a real difference to the community of Port Talbot and the 2,800 jobs that have been lost there.
I do not want to embarrass the right hon.
Lady, but the blast furnaces have already closed at Port Talbot.
They are not available to be saved —that situation has moved on.
Let me stress again: Port Talbot is in a stronger position because it has that long-term future in place and the potential additional investments through the green steel fund.
rose— I think I must progress, Mr Speaker.
I can see your indication to do so.
Will my right hon.
Friend give way?
I will take one more intervention.
