I thank the Secretary of State for giving way.
Once he has the powers in this Bill, I urge him to use them decisively and swiftly, but then, as he has said, we need to look to the future.
Once we have secured Scunthorpe’s future, we need to discuss what happens next, which is clean energy, and investing in the global clean energy that the UK really could succeed in.
Does he agree that the people of Scunthorpe have upheld their end of the bargain for decades, and now it is time that we in this House make sure we uphold our end too?
