The hon.
Member puts it extremely well, if I may say so.
The people who have upheld steel as the backbone of construction in the UK for decades deserve better treatment than they would have had if Parliament had not been recalled today to take this action, and we should all bear that in mind.
Whether it is at Port Talbot, via our upcoming steel strategy, via our work to improve public procurement, or in the introduction of our industrial strategy to tackle the most thorny issues of industrial competitiveness, where others have shied away, this Government have stepped up.
Let me conclude by saying that steel is fundamental to Britain’s industrial strength, our security and our identity as a primary global power.
Today’s legislation will help ensure that we can retain that steelmaking capability here in the UK both now and for years to come.
For British workers’ security, for British industries’ future and—without hesitation—in our national interest, and for the workers of British Steel and their families, this action is essential, and I commend this Bill to the House.
