I was pleased to have been told late last year that Haughley and Ely north junctions would be funded, but I have since become frustrated by the slow progress.
I hear all the right noises from the Department, but when I talk to Greater Anglia and Network Rail, all I hear is frustration at the slow progress.
Will the Secretary of State promise me that we will get on with these projects, which are crucial to Ipswich, Suffolk and East Anglia in general?
I can give that assurance to my hon.
Friend.
I think his Labour opponent stated that the Conservatives had not promised to deliver this project.
In October, the Prime Minister set out that we would deliver the rail junction at Ely and Haughley.
It is a project that the Department is keen on, as it is good for freight, and for our freight growth target.
I will meet my hon.
Friend and his colleagues who support the project to show them the steps that we are taking to get this vital project under way.
