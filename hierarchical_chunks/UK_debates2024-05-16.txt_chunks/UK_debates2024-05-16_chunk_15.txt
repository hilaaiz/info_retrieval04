The Minister might know that I am the chair of a manufacturing group for Members of Parliament.
Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Boeing are amazing manufacturers at the heart of our manufacturing economy, but does he agree that we must sort out the problems that seem to have occurred in the manufacture of Boeing’s 737 MAX?
Does he agree that the faster our regulators work with American regulators to sort this out, the better for British jobs and British innovation?
I absolutely agree with the hon.
Member that they are amazing companies with huge operations in the UK and enviable safety records.
Not one of the 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9s operating globally operates in the UK or from the UK, so there was no need to ground them.
The Department for Transport liaises closely with American authorities.
The CAA follows very closely the work of the US Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that safety standards remain as high as possible.
What recent discussions he has had with helicopter search and rescue operators on the adequacy of response times.
The right hon.
Member will be aware that the Maritime and Coastguard Agency is conducting an analysis of recent incident data to examine whether the demand for the search and rescue helicopter service has changed since the launch of the UK’s second generation search and rescue aviation procurement.
It is expected to be published by the end of 2024.
I have had no recent discussions on this point, as the review is ongoing.
