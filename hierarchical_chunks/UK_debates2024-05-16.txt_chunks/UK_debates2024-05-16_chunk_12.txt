The UK has a proud bus manufacturing history, from London’s iconic original Routemasters to Alexander Dennis’ next  generation of hydrogen double-deckers used today in the Liverpool city region.
As operators and local authorities decarbonise their fleets, UK manufacturers are ready to power that green revolution, but our bus makers are at risk from cheap models imported from overseas.
This week, a major UK operator is preparing to procure Chinese-built buses for tens of millions of pounds due to cost pressures and because this Government have not set out a full industrial strategy since 2017.
Will the Secretary of State tell the House what he will do to back British bus manufacturers and secure their role in this green revolution?
The hon.
Gentleman will know that it is not possible, given our international commitments under the World Trade Organisation, to specify that people have to buy British buses.
He will also know that British bus manufacturers are very competitive.
The Government have made support available to businesses through our Advanced Propulsion Centre and UK Export Finance.
As I said to  the hon.
Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Alan Brown) , if the shadow Minister thinks that there is any unfair competition with subsidised imports, the Trade Remedies Authority has all the tools at its disposal to deal with that.
We back British buses.
We have fantastic manufacturers, and I have confidence in them.
In a fair competition, our bus manufacturers can take on the world.
Wrightbus has had £76 million of support from UK Export Finance to support its ambitious exports.
It is a shame that he does not have the same faith in British industry that we do.
