The Secretary of State will be aware that the courts yesterday awarded £25 million of compensation to 1.4 million passengers who were overcharged for rail fares between 2015 and 2017 by Stagecoach South Western Trains, the predecessor franchise to South Western Railway.
Will he ensure that affected passengers are not left out of pocket, and get automatic redress, rather than having to make an historical claim?
I have been meeting the operators to discuss the matter.
I am happy to write to her, setting out the exact conclusion of those conversations.
I am always keen to ensure that passenger and consumer interests are protected and preserved, so I will write to her.
