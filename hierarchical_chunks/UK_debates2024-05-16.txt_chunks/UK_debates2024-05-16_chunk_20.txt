I welcome the phased introduction of the bi-mode Class 810 Aurora trains on the midland main line through Kettering next year.
Can my hon.
Friend the Rail Minister confirm that the new trains will be faster, quieter and more environmentally friendly than the current inter-city fleet, and that they will have more seats and luggage space, and better mobile phone signal reception?
