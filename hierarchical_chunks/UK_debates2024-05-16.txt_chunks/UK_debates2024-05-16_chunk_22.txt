I thank the Minister for his announcement of the funding for a makeover of Gallows Corner flyover, but I fear that we must do better.
This is a major junction connecting the eastern side of Greater London with Essex, and it is where the A12 and the A127 join together.
My constituents in Romford, and those of the wider Essex region, will be disappointed that we are not getting a fundamental restructuring of the junction to address the safety and congestion issues that I have highlighted for decades.
Will he speak to Transport for London, go back to the drawing board, and come back with something better and more permanent that will put the safety of road users first?
