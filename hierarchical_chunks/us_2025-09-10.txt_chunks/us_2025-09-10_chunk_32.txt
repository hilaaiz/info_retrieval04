Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of William E. ``Bill'' Ballou.
Bill was dedicated to sharing the Gospel and will be remembered for his love of family and his service to his ``Heavenly Father.''
Bill was born April 8, 1939, in Sterling, Texas, and he later attended Baylor University where he met his wife, Avonnell Bolton.
God blessed Bill and Avonnell with 52 years of marriage--a marriage that was focused on Christ and their family of two children, four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
Bill was a devoted Baylor alumni and sought to give back to the University that not only gave him an education but also brought Avonnell into his life.
Bill served as a lifetime member of the Baylor Alumni Association, was a former member of the Baylor Development Council, and endowed a scholarship in a memory of Avonnell at the School.
Bill will always be remembered for his dedication to sharing the message of salvation through Christ.
Bill served Christ passionately with his lifetime of service in churches in Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia.
Bill also served in leadership positions in multiple Baptist Associations and led revivals as far away as New Zealand.
One of Bill's favorite passages to use when sharing the gospel was John 14:6: I am the way and the truth and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.
Bill left a strong, Godly heritage to those who will walk this Earth after him.
I am honored to remember his lifetime of service, and I am thankful for the incredible family he leaves to carry on his legacy.
