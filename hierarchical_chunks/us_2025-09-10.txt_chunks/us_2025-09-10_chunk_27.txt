The team's historic 15-0 season record not only affirmed St. Aug could excel, but it could dominate in the face of adversity.
The team's performance both uplifted the high school and the entire Black community in New Orleans and around the state.
The team was ranked No. 1 all season, was first in LHSAA to achieve 15-0 record, and first to play in the Louisiana Superdome.
For the season, the team outscored opponents 409 points to 64 points and held opponents scoreless in 7 games.
That year, eleven (11) team members received football scholarships to Division 1 Universities.
Currently, over 30 athletes have advanced to the National Football League, the largest total than any high school in the United States.
Law and Hope are the names of the streets between which St. Augustine High School has been located for 74 years.
More appropriate symbols would be difficult to find as so much of this school speaks of Divine Providence.
I congratulate the St. Augustine High School Purple Knights, the 1975 Championship Football Team, and those that continue the mission of the Josephite Fathers and Brothers.
Rise Sons of the Gold and Purple.
