Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Moddie's life is a testament to courage, sacrifice, and patriotism.
Let us honor him for his extraordinary service to our Nation, his devotion to his fellow servicemembers, and his steadfast commitment to family and community.
On behalf of Michigan's 1st Congressional District, I wish him a joyous 100th birthday and extend the gratitude of a Nation, he so bravely served.
