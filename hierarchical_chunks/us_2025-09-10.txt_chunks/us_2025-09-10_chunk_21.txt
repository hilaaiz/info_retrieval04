Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to humbly honor and celebrate the heroic accomplishment of the Saint Augustine High School 1975 Football Team, proudly located in Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District, of which I represent in Louisiana.
From 1951, its first year as a Catholic high school in New Orleans, through the mid-1960s, St. Augustine excelled in three major varsity sports: football, basketball and track and field.
But the school, opened under the administration of New Orleans Archbishop Joseph Francis Rummel, was relegated to competing in the Louisiana Interscholastic Athletic and Literary Organization (LIALO) during the closing era of segregation.
Its principal, Josephite Father Robert Grant, wanted more for his athletes.
He wanted them to compete against the city's other Catholic schools, who were members of the Louisiana High School Athletic Association.
His first attempt came in 1962 when Father Grant wrote to the principals of the five schools--Jesuit, St. Aloysius, Holy Cross, De La Salle and Redemptorist--asking them to compete against St. Aug on an interscholastic sports level.
He thought that would be possible because the Archdiocese of New Orleans had already desegregated its elementary schools.
No one accepted the invitation.
But there was one reply, by De La Salle principal, Christian Brother Cassian.
It was painfully blunt: ``Father, personally, I am not one to rush into situations which may not be to my advantage and to those associated with me.
For years, I have refused to play certain high school teams on the basis that there was nothing to gain by such competition.
This is how I feel about your request to play De La Salle.
Time may change my attitude.''
