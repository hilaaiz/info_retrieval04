Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2025.
the Rotary Club of Orange Park Sunrise will once again raise ``Flags for Heroes,'' a moving sea of hundreds of American flags honoring the men and women who lift our communities every day.
In Clay County and across Northeast Florida, we remember the lives lost on September 11, 2001, and we salute the heroes who still answer the call: first responders, service members, veterans, teachers, nurses, and the quiet volunteers who serve without fanfare.
Each flag carries a name, a story, and a promise that we will never forget.
I commend the Rotarians, sponsors, and families who make this commemoration possible, and I invite neighbors to walk among the flags, reflect, and thank a hero in their life.
America is strongest when service is celebrated, and sacrifice is honored.
I thank the Rotary Club of Orange Park Sunrise for reminding us of who we are.
Let's go get them.
