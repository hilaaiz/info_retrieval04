Mr. Phillips has helped thousands of individuals and families navigate the tax system--even during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when many other sites were forced to close.
Thanks to his dedication, and that of fellow volunteers, the program has completed over 17,900 tax returns, returned more than $3.3 million to the community, and saved taxpayers an estimated $300,000 in fees.
