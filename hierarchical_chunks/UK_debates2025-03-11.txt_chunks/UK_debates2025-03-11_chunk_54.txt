I have been in communication with Liberal Democrat councillors in the East Riding of Yorkshire and also the Liberal Democrat administration in Hull.
Yesterday, the leader of the council, Mike Ross, raised the call for a rapid response from Government, and I really push the Minister to provide clarity on what exactly we should be seeing from a tactical co-ordination group and whether there is Government commitment to cover any environmental or economic impact.
Moreover, what more support will we see down the line if there are long-term consequences as a result of the pollution?
It is standard procedure to bring on board local resilience forums in any situation such as this.
That has been done: the forum is up and running.
I am grateful to all elected Members across the parties and hard-working councillors who will be involved in making sure that the best interests of the people of the Humber region are protected.
We have currently deployed on site all the resources that are needed to contain the fire and to assess the environmental damage of any spillage.
We will continue to make decisions in conjunction with the local resilience forum through the day and, I believe, for the rest of the week.
I wish to add my voice to the call made by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Alison Hume)  given the very perilous position of the Teesside and North Yorkshire marine ecosystem following the environmental disaster we suffered in 2021.
I ask the Minister to ensure that the response is not only around the Humber estuary, but that he reviews the environmental impact for the entire east coast as well.
As I have said, the MCA’s counter-pollution assets are being deployed at the scene.
The RNLI, search and rescue and aviation have all been on site, although search and rescue has been stood down.
Both vessels were also carrying marine heavy fuel oil.
That is a present pollution risk should either vessel sink or break apart.
