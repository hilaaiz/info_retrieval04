I thank my hon.
Friend for that very important question.
As part of our manifesto, we committed to fast-tracking rape cases through the system.
We are carefully considering the best way to do so, and we will be able to say more about our plans shortly.
We are also creating independent legal advisers for adult rape victims, who will be able to access that support at any point from report to trial, so that they know their rights and their rights are protected.
