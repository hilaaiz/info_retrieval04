I thank my hon.
Friend for keeping in contact with me throughout the night and this morning.
Just before the election, we both visited the command and control centre in her constituency to see the excellent facilities in place.
I pay tribute to the Humberside local resilience forum, which is made up of the police, the fire and rescue team, local authorities, the Red Cross, the NHS, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the clinical commissioning group, the Royal Navy, police and crime commissioners, the ambulance service, Border Force, environmental agencies, the Ministry of Defence, ABP Humber Ports, the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency.
Those teams are all working at pace to assess any risks to local people that may occur.
