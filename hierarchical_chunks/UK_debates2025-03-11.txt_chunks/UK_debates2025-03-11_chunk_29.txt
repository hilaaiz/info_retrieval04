I have already set out exactly what I am going to do.
I have written to the Sentencing Council, using the powers that I have to do so, and I will be meeting it later this week.
I have made it very clear that I will consider its role and powers, and if I need to legislate, I will not hesitate to do so.
One of my constituents has endured prolonged financial abuse due to drawn-out divorce financial order proceedings, which largely ignore domestic abuse except in rare cases.
Will the Minister commit to reviewing financial settlement proceedings guidance to ensure that the impact of domestic abuse is properly considered, and to prevent the legal system from being used as a tool of continued coercion and control?
