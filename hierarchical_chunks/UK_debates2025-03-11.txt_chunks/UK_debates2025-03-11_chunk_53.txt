I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Yes, I know that Members on the north-east coast from both sides of this House have been worried over a number of years about the crustacean die-off.
There is a concern that jet oil could well be leaking into the sea, but every resource is being deployed by the MCA and other agencies to assess the extent of the pollution, and every resource will be deployed to clean up that pollution.
I happen to be meeting fishermen organisations later in the week for separate reasons, so I hope to be able to update them with further information about their valuable trade at that time.
