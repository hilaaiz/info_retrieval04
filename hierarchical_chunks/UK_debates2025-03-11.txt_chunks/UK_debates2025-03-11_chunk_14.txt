I welcome the efforts to help prison leavers to reintegrate, but I am concerned that this Government will soon be keeping people out of prison who should be there as part of their proper punishment for offending.
The Government commissioned a sentencing review running on that very premise, and that review recently released its interim report.
Can the Minister point to anywhere in that entire 65-page report that has anything to say about the evidence of what victims want?
