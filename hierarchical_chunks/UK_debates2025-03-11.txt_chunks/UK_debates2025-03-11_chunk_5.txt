I thank my hon.
Friend for that really important question.
As a Member of Parliament representing a devolved nation, I wholly agree.
It is important that we work across the board to tackle this issue, which is not solely about England; all of us must do better.
The Government are taking firm action and putting in place stronger consequences for carrying a knife.
They are also cracking down on the sale of dangerous knives, and have announced Ronan’s law, a range of measures that will include stricter rules for online retailers selling knives.
