I thank the Chair of the Transport Committee for that question.
It is an incredibly busy sea highway, as we all know.
I had the great honour of visiting the command and control post of the Humber estuary on what was almost my last visit as shadow Maritime Minister just before the general election, and I pay tribute to the workers there for their hard work in dealing with this situation.
I want to assure the Chair of the Transport Committee that the Immaculate was anchored; it is the Solong that is drifting.
There is a 1,000-metre exclusion zone around both vessels.
Other assets are currently allowed to traverse the Humber estuary.
If that changes, I will make that information available during the day.
