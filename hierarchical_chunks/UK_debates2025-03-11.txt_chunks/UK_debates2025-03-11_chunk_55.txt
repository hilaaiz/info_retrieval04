I thank the Minister for his statement today and echo his comments about the missing sailor.
I also add my thanks to all those who have been involved in the rescue operation, particularly those at the RNLI station in Bridlington.
My constituents are rightly concerned about the potential environmental and ecological impact, not least because we have the biggest bird colony in mainland Britain, Bempton and Flamborough in Bridlington have the largest shellfish landing port in the UK, and we have around 5 million visitors to the area every year, enjoying the beaches from Bridlington down to Hornsea.
Has the Minister yet had any assessment of the direction of any potential pollution and the role that currents and wind direction will play in where that pollution might eventually end up?
