I thank my hon.
Friend for that important and timely question.
We take all forms of homicide extremely seriously, and our strategy, which will be published later this week, looking at tackling violence against women and girls will cover all forms of  violence and abuse that disproportionately impact women, including femicide.
We will of course prioritise tackling violence against women and girls, which is why we have funded record numbers of Crown court sitting days.
We are extending the powers of the Victims’ Commissioner and strengthening the victims code.
We have protected funding for victims services looking at domestic abuse, rape and sexual offences to ensure that victims are listened to and are put at the heart of the criminal justice system.
