The two-tier sentencing guidelines take effect on  1 April .
If the Lord Chancellor is sincere about having a justice system that treats everyone equally, will she not support our Bill to block the guidelines?
I have already made my position clear.
I have written to the Sentencing Council, and I will be meeting it later this week.
I am reviewing the roles and powers of the council, and I will not hesitate to legislate if I need to do so.
