Last month, the Justice Committee heard evidence from governors of prisons with some of the highest drug use rates in the country.
From detecting drones to body scanners and physical barriers, they all felt under-resourced in technology and investment.
What is the Secretary of State doing to better equip prison staff to keep drugs out of prisons?
We have already pressed ahead with further measures on X-ray and baggage scanners, and we are taking action to deal with the problem of drones.
My hon.
Friend will be aware that, for security considerations, I am not going to give the detail of some of those mitigations and of our proposals for tackling drones, because they are used by those involved in serious organised crime.
However, I can assure him that I, Ministers and all officials, including those working across the prison estate, are seized of this matter, and we are determined to crack down on drones bringing drugs into our prisons.
