Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Officer Karl Haugen, who passed away recently while off-duty.
As early as high school, Karl expressed an interest in becoming a first responder.
After attending the Law Enforcement Program at Alexandria Technical College and earning his Bachelor's Degree from Mankato State University, he began his public service career, working at the Minnesota Forensic Hospital in St. Peter.
He later worked at the MN Correctional Facility--Faribault and served for two years as Henderson Chief.
In 2008, he became an officer with the Le Sueur Police Department.
Officer Haugen was well-known in the community for his humor, generosity, and compassionate approach to law enforcement.
Despite the challenges and sacrifices of rural policing, he remained dedicated to public service and demonstrated a talent for seeing the good in people.
I offer my deepest condolences to Officer Haugen's family--his wife, Morgan, and his young children, Griffin, Aurora, and Teddy, and I thank him and the entire Le Sueur Police Department for their service to our community.
