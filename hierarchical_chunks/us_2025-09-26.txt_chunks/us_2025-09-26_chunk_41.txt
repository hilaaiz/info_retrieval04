Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Semicentennial of the Wood County Committee on Aging.
For five decades, the Committee has been dedicated to service, community, and care for all seniors in Wood County.
The hard work and spirit shown by staff at the Committee have made it possible for countless older adults to remain independent and improve their quality of life.
Founded in 1975, the Wood County Committee on Aging was established to provide comprehensive services to the county's seniors.
These services have grown over the decades to include programs for homedelivered meals, medical transportation, health and wellness initiatives, caregiver support, and much more.
With senior centers across the county, the Committee has been able to help elderly adults and their families navigate the challenges that can arise while aging.
