Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 35th Anniversary of Recovery Options Made Easy, a peer-run behavioral health organization that serves ten counties across Western New York and the Finger Lakes.
Recovery Options Made Easy is dedicated to helping individuals build independence through healing and community connection.
Recovery Options Made Easy is more than just a health organization, it is a community-centered company that has remained committed to serving regional clients for three and a half decades.
The organization proudly supplies a wide array of services, including supportive housing, recovery services, and community-based support that empower individuals through lived experiences and guidance.
