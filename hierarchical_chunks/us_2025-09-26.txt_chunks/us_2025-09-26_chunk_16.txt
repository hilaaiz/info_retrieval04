Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matt Yeakley, and his wife Morgan, for their extraordinary service and leadership during the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Marshall, North Carolina.
When Hurricane Helene struck, downtown Marshall was left heavily damaged, with streets blocked, buildings impacted, and the community in urgent need of coordination and support.
From the very first morning after the storm, Matt and Morgan stepped forward without hesitation to organize and lead the town's volunteer cleanup efforts.
Matt focused on heavy equipment and debris cleanup, while Morgan coordinated volunteers and addressed medical needs.
Drawing on their leadership skills and deep knowledge of the community, Matt and Morgan quickly established a volunteer coordination hub in front of the courthouse.
They identified critical areas needing attention, organized volunteers into specialized teams, and ensured every person, local or visiting, had a meaningful role to play in the recovery.
Their calm demeanor and logistical efficiency transformed a chaotic and uncertain situation into a coordinated, effective response.
The safety and productivity of every cleanup crew were always a priority.
Volunteers from across the region praised Matt and his wife for their clarity, professionalism, and kindness.
Thanks to their tireless efforts, downtown Marshall was cleared and stabilized within days, allowing businesses owners and residents to access their properties and begin their own recovery efforts.
