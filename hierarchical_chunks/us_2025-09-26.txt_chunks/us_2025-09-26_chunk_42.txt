Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Wood County Committee on Aging, the county can recognize the outstanding achievements of the staff and pride the patrons have for their senior centers.
I congratulate the Committee on Aging on this momentous milestone.
I thank them for all they do for our county's seniors.
