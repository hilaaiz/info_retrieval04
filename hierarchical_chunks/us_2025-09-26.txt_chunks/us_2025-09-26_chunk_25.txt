Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary service and leadership of Madison County's 
Ms. Deanna Ponder in the immediate aftermath.
When Hurricane Helene devastated our communities, access to fuel was critical to sustaining emergency operations.
Without hesitation, Ms. Ponder stepped forward to operate the Madison County School Bus Garage fueling station, ensuring that first responders could continue their vital work.
For 17 days following the storm, 
Ms. Ponder personally managed the fueling of essential vehicles and equipment including firetrucks, ambulances, county maintenance vehicles, law enforcement fleets, and mobile command centers.
She gave tireless effort to her community, delivering more than 20,000 gallons of fuel to power generators supporting light towers, shower camps established by Samaritan's Purse, law enforcement operations, and other critical services.
Her dedication kept recovery efforts moving day and night, under challenging conditions, and provided a lifeline for the community when it was needed most.
