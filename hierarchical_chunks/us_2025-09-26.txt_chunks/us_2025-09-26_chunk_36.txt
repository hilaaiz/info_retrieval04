Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Ms. Fina Bazan of Rio Grande City, who, after 48 years of service at the local Dairy Queen, has retired.
For nearly half a century, Fina has been a familiar and welcoming face to countless families and neighbors.
Though she may not always recall every name, she has always remembered the faces of those she served, treating each with warmth and kindness.
Her dedication to her work and her community is an inspiration, and her story is one I hold close.
My very first job as a young man was also at a Dairy Queen.
I know firsthand the hard work and commitment it takes, and I deeply admire Fina's devotion over these many decades.
