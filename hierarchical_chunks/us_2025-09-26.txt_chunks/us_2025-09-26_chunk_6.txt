Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 90th birthday of 
Mrs. Lessie Sylveen Poindexter Crosby, a beacon of light in the City.
Mrs. Poindexter Crosby's life story is a beautiful tapestry woven with love and resilience.
Born September 7, 1935, in Buffalo, New York, to Issac Costello and Fannie Sue Poindexter Johnson.
Mrs. Poindexter Crosby was raised to inspire everyone she met with her selflessness and compassion.
Over the years, she has witnessed many changes in her life and community, yet her love for those around her has remained a constant source of strength.
Mrs. Poindexter Crosby has consistently demonstrated Christian principles as a community member and spiritual leader in the Women's Ministry at First Shiloh Baptist Church.
