Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Colonel Chrysler's career reflects a lifetime of commitment to service, leadership, and excellence.
She has dedicated herself to strengthening our national defense, advancing Indiana's role in critical policy areas, and ensuring that the National Guard remains prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Lieutenant Colonel Danielle Chrysler for her outstanding service to Indiana and to the United States.
