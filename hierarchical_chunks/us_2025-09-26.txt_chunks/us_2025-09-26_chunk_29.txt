Ms. VELAZQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt birthday wishes to 
Ms. Hattie White as she celebrates her remarkable 100th birthday.
Born in 1925, she lived in the vibrant Bedford Stuyvesant community in Brooklyn, New York.
A community known for its rich African American heritage, social activism, and brownstone homes that reflected the pride of homeownership among neighbors.
In fact, at a time when homeownership was not easily attainable, 
Ms. White owned a home where she provided her seven children with a stable and nurturing environment.
