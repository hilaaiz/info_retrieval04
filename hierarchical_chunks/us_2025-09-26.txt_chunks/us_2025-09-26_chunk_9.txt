Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to join the people of Ukraine and Ukrainian communities around the world in celebrating Ukrainian Independence Day, observed annually on August 24th.
It acknowledges a day of triumph and persistence through the courage and unity of the Ukrainian people.
On August 24, 1991, members of the Ukrainian Parliament replaced the red and blue flag of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic with the current blue and yellow Ukrainian flag following a failed coup in the Soviet Union.
In response, pro-democracy leaders chose to push for Ukraine's Independence despite the risks--truly living up to their historic motto ``Come what may.''
Ukrainian Independence Day is celebrated with a national address and flag-raising ceremony in Kyiv by the President of Ukraine, followed by military parades, cultural performances, and patriotic songs.
The blue and yellow Ukrainian flag is proudly displayed across the country and in Ukrainian communities around the world.
It is a day of national pride and reflection, where citizens honor the struggles of their ancestors, celebrate their sovereignty, and express solidarity with Ukrainians everywhere.
As we celebrate Ukrainian Independence Day, let us acknowledge and celebrate the sacrifices made by the countless brave souls and citizens who fought for a future of liberty and independence.
Let us also take this moment to recognize the vibrant Ukrainian-American community throughout our country.
Their cultural contributions enrich our nation, and we are all the better for it.
