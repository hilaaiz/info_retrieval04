I thank the hon.
Lady both for her interest and for the sentiment behind her question.
A huge amount is happening, including meetings galore with all the political parties in Northern Ireland, and especially the Democratic Unionist party, because it is the DUP that I need to get on board so that the Executive can be restored.
The hon.
Lady says “at pace”, and we will happily work at whatever pace we can, but it is slightly determined by our interlocutors.
