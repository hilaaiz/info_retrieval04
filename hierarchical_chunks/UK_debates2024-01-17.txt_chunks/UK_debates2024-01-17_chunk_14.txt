The Secretary of State will know that Northern Ireland can benefit from power sharing arrangements only when those institutions enjoy the support and confidence of both the nationalist and Unionist communities.
I think I have previously heard him accept that the Northern Ireland protocol does not enjoy the support of any Unionist in Northern Ireland.
Despite references to talks having concluded in December, the Secretary of State helpfully indicated on Monday this week that further progress had been made.
Does he accept that the restoration of institutions will be secured only when that confidence within the Unionist community is put where it needs to be?
