I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question and for the many, many hours of work that he personally has put into the talks we have been having.
They are detailed talks and it is a complex situation.
I have said before, because it is absolutely obvious, that the Unionists in Northern Ireland are deeply unhappy with the existing Northern Ireland protocol.
I believe we have made excellent progress.
I hope that in the coming days and weeks, we can get to a point where his party can come to a conclusion on those talks that leads us to reform the Executive, because I know that he is a democrat and wants it reformed.
