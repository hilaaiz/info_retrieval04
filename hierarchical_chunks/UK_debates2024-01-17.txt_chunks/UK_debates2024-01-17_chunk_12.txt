I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question and for his affirmation of the work done on the Windsor framework.
Obviously, I will be doing everything I can to ensure that it is not a Labour Government who come in to do any of this in the future.
However, he is right to say that as of midnight on Thursday—tomorrow night—I will need to bring in primary legislation, because a duty falls on me to call an election for the Northern Ireland Assembly.
I have a number of weeks—I believe it is 12—in which to do that, and I intend to bring in legislation on these matters next week.
