Yesterday, the Conservative candidate for the Wellingborough by-election revealed that the Conservative party had offered her a deal to be the candidate if the previous Member—her partner—stood down without a fuss.
Just last week, the Prime Minister said that “Candidate selection is done locally” in his party, so would he like to deny that this secret deal was offered?
As I said last week, in our party candidate selection is done locally.
Does my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister agree that a remote rural hotel is the wrong place to house asylum seekers or refugees from their point of view?
Will he therefore join me in thanking the Home Secretary for announcing yesterday that the Wiltshire Hotel outside Royal Wootton Bassett is to be returned to its proper purpose in April?
