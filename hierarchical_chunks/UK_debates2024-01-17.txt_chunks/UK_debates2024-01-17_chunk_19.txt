I recently met the Melted Parents campaign group in Belfast.
It speaks for so many parents across Northern Ireland, where the cost of living crisis is far harder for families because there is no funding for a free childcare scheme, or the 15 or 30 hours of pre-school, just eye-watering and unaffordable Bills.
But there is a cross-party childcare strategy proposal.
Will the Minister say for all the employers and parents watching, if there is a new temporary Budget for Northern Ireland, whether it will include childcare funding provision?
I am grateful to the hon.
Lady for raising this issue.
It is of the highest importance in Northern Ireland, and it is impressed upon me frequently.
The Budget will be debated in this House, of course, and I am confident that we will return to it.
As we have said before, this is one of those issues that underscores the importance of the Executive returning, and I am grateful that we agree on that point.
She is absolutely right to raise the issue.
