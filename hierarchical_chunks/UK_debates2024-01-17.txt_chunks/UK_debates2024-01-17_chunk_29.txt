I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
I know that the whole House will want to convey its sympathies to Jessica’s family.
I am pleased that the reforms we are making will make a difference to women across the country in the future.
We are committed to our women’s health strategy, and I am grateful for her support and, again, her advice and ideas so that we can ensure that it delivers the care that we want it to across the country.
