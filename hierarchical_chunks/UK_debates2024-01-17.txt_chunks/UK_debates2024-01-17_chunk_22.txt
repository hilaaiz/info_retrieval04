I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I wish to reassure him that the UK Government are fully committed to protecting and upholding Northern Ireland’s place in the Union.
I regularly discuss matters of the Union, and the importance of Northern Ireland within it, with Cabinet colleagues and frequently meet the Secretaries of State for Wales and for Scotland.
