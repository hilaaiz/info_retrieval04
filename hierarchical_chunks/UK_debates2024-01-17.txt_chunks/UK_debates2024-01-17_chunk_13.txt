I am grateful for that clarification.
The absence of the Executive and the failure to sort out the urgent question of public sector pay is going to result in the biggest strike in Northern Ireland for many years  tomorrow.
Some workers have not had a pay rise for almost three years—that is not sustainable.
As we await the restoration of the institutions, the party leaders and indeed the head of the civil service in Northern Ireland have all called on the Secretary of State to release the money for pay, which he has said is available.
Will he now do so, so that public sector workers in Northern Ireland can get the pay increase they deserve?
I am acutely aware of the industrial action scheduled for tomorrow and the detrimental impact it will have on public services.
I hear the call from the right hon.
Gentleman and others to step in, but let me put this into a slightly different context.
Public sector pay is devolved to Northern Ireland, and he will know that, as I mentioned earlier, this Parliament set the budget for Northern Ireland this year, with primary legislation.
He will also know that decisions on matters such as this are obviously ones that locally elected Ministers should take, as they involve big and fundamental choices; every penny spent on pay is a penny not spent on services.
Choices on this are therefore eminently political—indeed, they are as close as we would get to the choices made in the period of direct rule.
Direct rule is absolutely not the way forward; these decisions are for the Executive, and a restored Executive have a generous financial package available to them to do exactly as the right hon.
Gentleman wishes.
