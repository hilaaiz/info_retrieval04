I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for his question and welcome his election as Chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, probably more than some other Members will—I look to a certain Member on the Benches opposite.
He is absolutely right in what he says; there is no way this Government want to go down the route of direct rule, which would need primary legislation.
We do not want to go down the route of joint authority either and we will not do so.
We need to find an appropriate form to allow the Executive to reform, which is what we are working unbelievably hard on with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.
