I appreciate the Secretary of State’s remarks.
He will have heard the concerns around the general strike, which will be called tomorrow.
He will know that his Government dismissed our calls when we said that there simply was not sufficient money.
He knows we had to battle for sufficient money and that in the run-up to Christmas he personally secured the availability of that money.
The release of the funds is called for by the DUP, every political party in Northern Ireland, the head of the Northern Ireland civil service and, this morning, 50 chief executives of public sector  agencies across Northern Ireland.
I do not believe there is a lack of will on the Secretary of State’s part, but this is a choice—a political choice that the Government can make.
Will the Secretary of State use today to encourage his Government colleagues, the Treasury and anyone else who believes that using public sector workers as blackmail or political pawns is beneficial in any way?
