I commend my right hon.
Friend for his efforts to try to restore the Assembly and the Executive with a big offer.
Is it not right that, were direct rule to be contemplated, we would now need primary legislation following the St Andrews agreement?
The political reality is that it would mean huge political pressure on all of us here, not only from within our United Kingdom but from outside.
Does he agree that the best way to preserve our  great United Kingdom is for everyone to get back around the table and to govern Northern Ireland from Stormont?
