I thank my hon.
Friend for sharing his story, and I know the whole House will be delighted to hear that he has made a swift recovery.
We all wish him good health for the future, as he resumes his excellent campaigning on behalf of his constituents in Watford.
I also join him in thanking our fantastic  NHS staff for the life-saving work that they do up and down the country.
We are backing them with record resources—from our doctors to our ambulance service—and we are all in this House truly grateful for what they do.
