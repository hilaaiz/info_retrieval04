I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question and, indeed, for the way in which he and his party have conducted themselves in the talks to try to restore the Executive.
The UK Government put an extremely fair and generous package for a restored Executive, worth £3.3 billion, on the table before Christmas.
The money that Northern Ireland civil servants and I have available is from the budget passed in this place in the last year.
