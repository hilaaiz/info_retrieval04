According to a Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report, Northern Ireland received proportionately less than Scotland, Wales and England in the first round of levelling-up funding.
In the latest round of funding in November, not a penny was allocated to Northern Ireland, and the Government said this was because the Executive were not sitting.
Is there good news for the people of Northern Ireland today?
Now that power sharing has been restored, will the Secretary of State update the House on any discussions he has had about ensuing that a fair share of levelling-up funding goes to Northern Ireland?
The hon.
Lady raises a very important point, and I will be glad to continue such conversations with the Executive.
As she knows, we have made available a generous package of £3.3 billion overall.
We are having conversations on the detail of those areas of funding that have been repurposed, and those conversations will continue.
When we can update the House in fuller detail, we will of course be glad to do so.
What discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on the proposed east-west business council.
The Government are working to establish an east-west business council, as set out in the Command Paper, fulfilling our pledge to establish a unique forum—for key representatives across the United Kingdom from Government, business and the education sector—to identify opportunities for deepening connections between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK in important areas such as trade, transport, education and culture.
I shall be in regular contact with other Ministers across Government to ensure the timely delivery of this commitment.
