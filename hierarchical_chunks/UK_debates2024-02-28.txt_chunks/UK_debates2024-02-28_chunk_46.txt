I thank the hon.
Lady for her question and for representing her constituents so effectively.
I am keen to have continued conversation with her.
All the schemes that have been established thus far require a contractual relationship between the Post Office and the individual, and I know that was not the case for her constituent.
A number of Members of this House have addressed the issue, and we will continue to look at it.
