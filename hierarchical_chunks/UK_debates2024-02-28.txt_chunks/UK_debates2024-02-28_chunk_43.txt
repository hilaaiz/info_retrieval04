I thank the Minister for his work in this area.
He has been assiduous in his attention to detail—I cannot say the same of the Secretary of State.
Nevertheless, yesterday was unedifying, and we are sick to death of the “He said, she said” business—we are not interested, except that two witnesses yesterday took the oath and spoke to the same issue: as to whether Mr Read had ever tendered his resignation or threatened to.
It was totally conflicting evidence from the two people; they both cannot be right, so I suggest that one might have been a little economical with the truth.
From Dr Neil Hudgell, though, the message came loud and clear: these schemes are way too “over-engineered” and far too “bureaucratic”, and that has led to the delay in getting the money out of the door.
I have to correct the Minister—only 20% of the fund is out of the door as yet.
We have to speed it up.
