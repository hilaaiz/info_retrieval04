This morning’s High Court ruling confirms what every fair observer knows: that the Government’s legacy legislation is not compatible with human rights.
It puts the needs of perpetrators ahead of the needs of victims, and it is not supported by any party in Northern Ireland or across the island of Ireland.
The Secretary of State cannot truly believe that it serves the rule of law or our shared future in any constitutional arrangement.
When will the Government repeal that completely unacceptable legislation?
