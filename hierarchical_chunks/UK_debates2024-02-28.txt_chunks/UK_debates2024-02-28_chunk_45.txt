I thank the Minister for his work on the Horizon scandal, and for answering my letter concerning a constituent.
In that answer, he confirmed that former post office clerks and those working for a franchise who lost money, jobs and reputation through the Horizon scandal are not eligible for compensation under the current scheme.
Will he look into ways to include them in a compensation scheme?
