I thank the Prime Minister sincerely for the extra £244 million announced this week for transport investment in Shropshire, which comes on top of £300 million for the modernisation of our local accident and emergency services, levelling-up funds to modernise Shrewsbury town centre, and full funding for the north-west relief road, the ring road around Shrewsbury.
These infrastructure projects will have a major benefit in Shropshire, and not just for us but for those who follow us.
There is, however, one issue that I would like to raise with the Prime Minister: how Shropshire Council is funded to deal with adult social care costs.
We have a disproportionately ageing population in Shropshire, and the council is struggling to meet those additional costs.
What more can be done to help such councils deal with rising adult social care costs?
