I thank the hon.
Lady once again from this Dispatch Box for all that she does on behalf of postmasters.
Interestingly, in his evidence yesterday, Mr Staunton said that he had no concerns over the speed of compensation, which I think astounded both the hon.
Lady and me.
We have been fighting for years to try to  improve the speed of compensation.
That is just one more concern that people might have with Mr Staunton’s evidence, but it was clearly stated in one of his responses.
