I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and for her work on the Select Committee.
It is one thing to criticise Ministers, but entirely another to sully the good name of a civil servant.
Sarah Munby has been very clear in her letter that she published on this matter that Mr Staunton is wrong.
She has also been very clear that she has contemporaneous notes of that meeting, and we will be publishing those notes that will clarify and back up the fact that Henry Staunton is wrong and that Sarah Munby is right.
