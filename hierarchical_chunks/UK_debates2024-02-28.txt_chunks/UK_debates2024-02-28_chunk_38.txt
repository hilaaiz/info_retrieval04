I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his work on the Select Committee.
He is a doughty champion in this area and many others relating to the Committee’s work.
There are some lessons we need to learn; the Post Office certainly requires the right kind of skills and the right kind of person to turn it around.
That is clearly a work in progress and I do not think people will be confident that that is happening until it has actually happened.
Words are no longer enough; we need actions, be it on the turnaround of the Post Office or on the compensation schemes.
