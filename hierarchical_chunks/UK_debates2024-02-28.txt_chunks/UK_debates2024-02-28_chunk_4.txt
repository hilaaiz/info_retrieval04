I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and I absolutely, 100% agree with his sentiment.
It is a real pleasure to see the devolved institutions at Stormont up and running.
You, Mr Speaker, have a new colleague there: the former Speaker was desperate to retire for two years—tributes were paid to Speaker Maskey at the time—but Speaker Poots is now in place.
It has been wonderful, too, to see the new First Minister and Deputy First Minister working together to achieve good solutions, on public services and a whole host of other things, for the people of Northern Ireland.
The Union is best served by devolved institutions working.
I very much welcome everyone’s commitment to that cause.
