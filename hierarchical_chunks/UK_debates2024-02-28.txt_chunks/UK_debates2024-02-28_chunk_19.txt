The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 28 February.
I know the thoughts of the whole House will be with the friends and families of Lord Cormack and Ronnie Campbell.
They were dedicated parliamentarians.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I will have further such meetings later today.
