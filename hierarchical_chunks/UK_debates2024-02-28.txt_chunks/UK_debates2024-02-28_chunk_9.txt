One thing of great importance to this place is our education system, including the trips that people make to Parliament.
We want to safeguard the Union, so what steps are being taken to ensure that students in Northern Ireland have equal access to educational tours of Westminster?
Bearing in mind that students in Northern Ireland should have the same access to them as those in England, but that the cost of flying over can be prohibitive, will consideration be given to additional funding to allow some sort of subsidisation?
Northern Ireland, being across the Irish sea, is in a geographic location that makes travel difficult to other areas of the United Kingdom.
I understand the hon.
Gentleman’s keenness to help Northern Ireland students benefit from learning across the Union.
We put in place a £3.3 billion financial package for the incoming Executive that helps us to achieve some of those objectives by providing support for Northern Ireland, given its unique challenges.
However, if he has individual cases in mind, I would be interested to hear about them, and will consider what we might do in future.
