The Secretary of State referred earlier to the financial package that the Treasury has put in place to support our public services in Northern Ireland, but our commitments on public sector pay mean that there remains a significant gap in the next two financial years.
Will he work with us to seek further support from the Treasury, so that we can ensure that the Executive lives within its budget and that we can pay our public sector workers a decent wage for the vital work they do?
Again, I pay tribute to the right hon.
Gentleman for all his work to ensure that the devolved institutions—the Executive and Stormont—can come back together.
He has achieved an amazingly good, historic piece of work.
It is good to see the Executive back up and running, making choices and opening negotiations with the unions to get the public sector in Northern Ireland back on track, on pay and work.
I believe that there is a meeting today between the Finance Minister and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
I will always happily work with the right hon.
Gentleman on all those agendas.

The Government are committed to the economic growth of Northern Ireland, working closely with other UK Departments, the newly formed Executive and NI businesses.
Our plan includes boosting trade and investment, building on the success of the Northern Ireland investment summit last year; levelling up Northern Ireland’s economy, including through our city and growth deals worth £617 million; and implementing the key deliverables of the “Safeguarding the Union” Command Paper.
Only last night, I attended Retail NI’s supplier showcase, and I am very grateful to have made it back first thing this morning.
