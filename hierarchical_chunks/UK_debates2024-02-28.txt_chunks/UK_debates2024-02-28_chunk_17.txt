Does my right hon.
Friend agree that the Northern Ireland Members of the UK-EU Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, including  the right hon.
Member for Lagan Valley (Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson) , play a very important role in improving understanding between the EU and the UK about the way in which the trade and co-operation agreement should work, and in easing the way for a better relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union?
I do agree with my right hon.
and learned Friend.
I pay tribute to him for the leading role he plays in that forum, and I am most grateful to him.
A large number of colleagues, whatever their view on exiting the European Union, have put a great deal of effort into building up the bonds of friendship that are so important as we go forward under the trade and co-operation agreement.
I am most grateful to him for highlighting the important work of that forum, and I again pay tribute to him for his leading role.
