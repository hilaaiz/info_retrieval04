I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, but I am afraid that she will have to refer to the answer I gave earlier.
The Court judgment was handed down only earlier this morning; it is a complex case and we have more than 200 pages of judgment to consider.
I do not even believe that the Government KC has gone through the ruling yet in any great detail.
We were not given any notice beforehand of what might be in it, but obviously I pledge that we will consider Mr Justice Colton’s findings carefully.
As I will continue to say, we remain committed to implementing the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023, including delivery of the ICRIR.
