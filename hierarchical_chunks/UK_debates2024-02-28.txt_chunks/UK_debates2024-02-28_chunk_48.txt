I thank the hon.
Lady for making that point and for representing her constituents so well.
Yes, absolutely, we understand that this is distracting, or could distract, from work to ensure not just that we  make right the wrongs of the past, but that the Post Office has a strong future, as she put it.
I totally agree.
We think that the Post Office does have a strong future.
Revenue streams have been affected by changes in how and where people acquire certain things or access certain services, but the banking framework—we encourage the Post Office to be more ambitious in its negotiations with the banks on the remuneration that flows from the framework to postmasters—and the parcel hubs are an opportunity for the future.
We believe that the Post Office has a strong brand and strong future.
We are keen to support its efforts to ensure that the future is bright for all postmasters.
