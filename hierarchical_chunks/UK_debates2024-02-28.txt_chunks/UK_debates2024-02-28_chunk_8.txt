I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
First, getting the devolved institutions in strand 1 of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement running is of vital importance, because it means that the strand 2 institutions can work properly for everyone in all communities, and it also allows the strand 3 institutions to work in a better way, because they can include  representatives such as the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and bodies such as the British-Irish Council, so there is a whole host of things involved.
The constitutional status of Northern Ireland obviously requires the consent of a simple majority of its people.
All the provisions of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement still stand.
