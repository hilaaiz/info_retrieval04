I thank my hon.
Friend for his excellent and continued campaigning on health provision for his constituents.
On his specific point, integrated care boards have the power to increase their primary care annual capital management budget, so long as they keep within the overall budget.
I understand that he met a Health Minister earlier this week to discuss this further, and I will make sure that his proposals are very carefully considered.
