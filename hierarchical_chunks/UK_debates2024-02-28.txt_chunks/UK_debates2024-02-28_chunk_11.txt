Further to the question from my hon.
Friend  the Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) , will the Secretary of State join me in welcoming the fact that the new UK East-West Council will have its first meeting next month in Belfast?
One of its key objectives is to encourage greater educational co-operation across the United Kingdom, as well as binding Northern Ireland more closely into the wider economy and the UK internal market.
I am happy to join the right hon.
Gentleman in welcoming the new East-West Council and its situation, and I also look forward to seeing the North South Ministerial Council functioning.
The UK East-West Council will bring together a wealth of experience and knowledge from representatives of the United Kingdom Government, the devolved Administrations, business and the culture sector, and educational leaders.
We are committed to getting it working in March and doing good things.
