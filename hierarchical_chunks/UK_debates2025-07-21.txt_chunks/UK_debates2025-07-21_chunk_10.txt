I thank my hon.
Friend for the tireless work she has done on these important issues in this place.
We are grateful for the contribution of 3 Dads Walking in developing the new RSHE guidance and we pay tribute to their inspirational determination and the courage shown in their work to raise awareness.
The guidance contains new content about coping strategies for dealing with issues such as anxiety, but also covers issues such as loneliness and bereavement.
It says that schools should “consider carefully” how to address suicide prevention safely.
