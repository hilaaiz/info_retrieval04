I thank the Minister for joining me at Curwen primary school in Plaistow recently to see its excellent early years education work.
He heard from parents about the struggles they often face as a result of serious economic and housing hardship.
Will he assure my constituents that the Government will look at communities like mine, where housing and poverty create serious challenges for families, to ensure that all children, no matter their circumstances, get the best possible educational start in life?
