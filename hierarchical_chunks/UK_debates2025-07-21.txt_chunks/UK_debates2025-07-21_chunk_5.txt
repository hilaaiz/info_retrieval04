I thank the Secretary of State for her response and for the Government’s commitment to recruiting 6,500 new teachers.
However, as we know,  dyslexic children tend to leave school or education with disproportionately lower attainment levels.
They are also over-represented in the criminal justice system and often have low self-esteem, with much of that coming from their experience in educational settings.
Will the Secretary of State outline how she will ensure that the recruitment of new teachers will bring in those who can meet the education needs of dyslexic and neurodiverse children?
