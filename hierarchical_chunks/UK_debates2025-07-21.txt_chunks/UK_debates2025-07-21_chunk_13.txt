We know that timely access to mental health support is crucial.
Earlier this month, the Education Committee released its report on children’s social care, which recommended that the Government establish mental health teams that are co-located between child and adolescent mental health services —CAMHS—and children’s social care, so that looked-after children can access specialist mental health support more easily.
Will the Minister share any assessment that the Department has made of this recommendation?
