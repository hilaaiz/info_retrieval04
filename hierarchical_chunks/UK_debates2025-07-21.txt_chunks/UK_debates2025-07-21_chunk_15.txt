Good mental health at school is sometimes bolstered by out-of-school support, especially for the most vulnerable children.
Last week, I met Vicky and her team at Jigsaw Occupational Therapy in Burgess Hill, and I spoke to the families they help.
Roughly a quarter of their work involved supporting kinship and adopted children and helping them to regulate following profound trauma.
Vicky described the impact on their children of the Government’s cuts to the adoption and special guardianship support fund as “heartbreaking”.
Can the Minister offer any words of comfort to Vicky and the families she helps?
We are maintaining the support available to children to ensure that there is reasonable support in place, and providing more funding to local authorities.
This Government are committed to breaking down the barriers to opportunity so that every child can succeed and thrive, and that is what we are getting on and delivering.
What steps her Department is taking to help ensure that post-16 education provides the skills necessary to support the economy.
I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate the great gains that the Labour Government have made through our plan for change.
Since entering power, we have cut red tape, tilted the system towards young people and committed unprecedented investment for our school system.
We are going further and faster with our post-16 education and skills strategy.
The apprenticeship levy is collected equally across the United Kingdom, but unfortunately it comes back to Northern Ireland under the Barnett consequential.
Will the Minister look at an option for a system in which those employers who contribute to the apprenticeship levy can draw it back directly to support apprentices employed in their companies?
