Sure Start, which was created by the previous Labour Government, boosted attainment, improved health outcomes and increased long-term earnings.
However, under the Conservatives, more than 30 children’s centres in Derbyshire were closed, and Derbyshire now does not have a single family hub.
What action will the Government take to ensure that more young children in Derbyshire can once again access support during their early years?
It was a pleasure to visit my hon.
Friend’s constituency recently, too.
He is a real champion for children and young people.
We will fund Best Start family hubs in every local authority, including in Derbyshire.
We estimate that the expansion could reach half a million children across the country.
Best Start family hubs will be open to all and based in disadvantaged communities, where they are needed most.
