Before the election, Labour said that it would allow employers to take 50% of their apprenticeship levy money and spend it on other things, but since the a while election, different Ministers have said different things about whether that is still happening.
The Skills Minister said it would all depend on the spending review, but of course, the spending review was back.
Will businesses be able to take out 50% as Labour promised or not?
