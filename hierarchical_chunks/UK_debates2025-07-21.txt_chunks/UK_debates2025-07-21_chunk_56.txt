I am the Policing Minister, but I know that work is already under way on that issue.
The Immigration Minister has had a number of conversations, particularly with employers, as I have just said, about where work should not be taking place  because of individuals’ immigration status.
There has been investment in the National Crime Agency—additional officers are working on this issue—and work is under way on smashing the gangs who were behind bringing people across in the small boats.
There are also our international arrangements and treaties that we are signing with various countries, which the previous Government were unable to do.
