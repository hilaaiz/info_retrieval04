The scenes of violent unrest at the Bell hotel this weekend are deeply concerning.
Liberal Democrats will always defend the right to peaceful protest, but what we saw went far beyond that.
There is no place for that sort of violence and thuggery in our society.
I thank the police and the emergency services for their brave and professional response, and my thoughts go out to anyone who is feeling frightened as a result of those unacceptable scenes.
It is completely understandable that people are concerned about criminal activity, not least after the former Conservative Government’s chaotic approach to immigration shattered public trust.
That is why we need an efficient asylum system that swiftly returns those without a genuine right to stay.
I would welcome details from the Minister on what steps the Government are taking to deliver that.
Clear rules that are properly enforced will be key to rebuilding public trust in the system after it was broken by the Conservatives.
