I was recently lucky enough to visit Brigg infant school in South Normanton.
It is a gorgeous school full of talented pupils and dedicated staff, but it has a problem: four and five-year-olds are being taught in a prefab building that is not fit for purpose.
I love to see the way that we invest in education, but these children have been let down by the previous Government.
Does the Minister agree that they deserve a classroom that is fit to be taught in, and will she look at this case?
