I thank the Minister for his reply and for last week’s publication of the new relationships, sex and health education—RSHE—curriculum guidance.
I was pleased to see that secondary schools are now being asked to talk about suicide prevention in an age-appropriate way.
Andy, Mike and Tim, the 3 Dads Walking, have campaigned hard for this change over a number of years, and I am pleased that the Government have worked with them to make this happen.
Will the Minister join me in thanking the three dads, and can he say how this will be implemented in schools so that we can help save young lives?
