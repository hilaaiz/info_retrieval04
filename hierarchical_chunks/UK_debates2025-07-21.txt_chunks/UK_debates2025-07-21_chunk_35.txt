I thank the hon.
Member for her thought-provoking question.
She really advocates for care leavers and for ensuring that they have the durability they need  at school to ensure they have a seamless experience.
I reassure her that care leavers who start an apprenticeship are entitled to £3,000 bursaries, and local authorities must provide a £2,000 bursary for care leavers who go on to university.
Let me just say that this Government are extremely concerned with education not being broken for care leavers and ensuring that we support them in every which way we can.
