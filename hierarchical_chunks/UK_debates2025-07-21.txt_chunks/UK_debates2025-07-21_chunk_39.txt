I thank the Minister for his answer.
Can he clarify whether the Magna Carta school will have a full rebuild, due to the presence of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, or is it just the science and arts block that will be rebuilt?
Will he meet me to discuss this issue and the work that will take place on such a fantastic local school?
