I thank my hon.
Friend for mentioning his fantastic City of Stoke-on-Trent sixth-form college.
I reassure him and other Members that this Government are committed to ensuring that there is a place in education or training for every 16 to 18-year-old who wants one.
Details of the £375 million of capital investment to accommodate additional learners entering the system will be announced in due course.
