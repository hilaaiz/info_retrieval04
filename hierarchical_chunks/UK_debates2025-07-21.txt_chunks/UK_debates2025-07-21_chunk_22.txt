I thank the Minister very much for his answers, as always.
The hon.
Member for Derby North (Catherine Atkinson)  referred to the construction sector.
Is it time perhaps to think outside the circle of what we usually do, through deals and partnerships with construction companies?
That would give us the opportunity to improve the education and college estate while making people available and knowledgeable for jobs in their future life, whether in construction or otherwise.
It is time for partnerships—let us do something perhaps a wee bit different.
