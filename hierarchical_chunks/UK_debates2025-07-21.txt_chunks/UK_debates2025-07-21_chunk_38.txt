We have yet to decide on the future of education, health and care plans, but we are extremely focused on strengthening the support system so that every child can receive timely, high-quality help.
We will set out further details about our approach to special educational needs in this autumn’s White Paper.
In the meantime, obviously, children should be getting the support they need, and we are putting in the groundwork so that more children can have that.
We know that early intervention is most effective for children with SEN, but too many children in my constituency of Morecambe and Lunesdale have been let down in that respect.
However, Lancashire is, for the first time, receiving funding for Best Start hubs.
Can the Minister tell me how that will improve early support for those children?
As I said, we are already investing in supporting children and their families, including through Best Start family hubs, as my hon.

We want to ensure that all children have access to a family service professional who is trained to support inclusion, can identify where children have additional needs ahead of starting school, and can support parents to navigate services.
If she will provide a timeline for the completion of construction works at the Magna Carta school in Egham.
Ensuring that schools and colleges have the resources and buildings they need is a key part of our mission to break down the barriers to opportunity and give every child the best start in life.
For this project, I can confirm that the Department is in the process of finalising the feasibility study, and we expect to procure the works later this year.
Until that process is complete, we will be unable to advise on the length of the construction programme.
However, positive progress continues to be made in collaboration with the trust.
