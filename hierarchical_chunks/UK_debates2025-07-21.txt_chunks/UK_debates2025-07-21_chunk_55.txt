I welcome the surge in returns that we have seen and the raids on companies with illegal working practices.
As we have spoken about many times in this House, those companies are incentivising the boat crossings and ultimately undermining our national security.
Can the Minister set out what further enforcement there can be?
Is it possible that conversations could be had with the Treasury about further measures that could be taken to bring some of these companies to heel?
