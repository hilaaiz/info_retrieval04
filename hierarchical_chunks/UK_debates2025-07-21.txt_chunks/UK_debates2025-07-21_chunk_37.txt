I thank the Minister for that answer.
On Friday, I had the opportunity to visit the outstanding Springfield primary school in my constituency.
It has 500 pupils, 30 of whom have education, health and care plans, with six applications in currently.
Can the Minister reassure the parents of those six children and the many, many parents across the country that, while this review into EHCPs is going on, local education authorities will not slow-roll existing applications or fail them as a default in order for them to go to tribunal and try to beat the clock?
