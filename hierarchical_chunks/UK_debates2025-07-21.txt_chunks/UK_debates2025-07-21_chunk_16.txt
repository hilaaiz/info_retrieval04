I thank the hon.
Member for his question and his thoughtfulness regarding the levy and its operation.
As he is fully aware, skills are a devolved matter and funding in the devolved Administration remains the responsibility of that Government.
We will continue to engage with the devolved Administrations as we develop the levy-funded growth and skills offer for England.
