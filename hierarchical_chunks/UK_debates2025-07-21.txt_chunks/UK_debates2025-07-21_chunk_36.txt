What steps she is taking to improve support for children with SEND.
We are engaging extensively with families and experts as we seek to improve support for children with special educational needs and disabilities.
We have invested £1 billion into high-needs budgets and £740 million into creating more specialist places.
We are rolling out schemes, from the partnerships for inclusion of neurodiversity in schools—the PINS programme—to Inclusion 2028, which are laying the groundwork for long-term reform.
We are building a system in which every child can achieve and thrive.
