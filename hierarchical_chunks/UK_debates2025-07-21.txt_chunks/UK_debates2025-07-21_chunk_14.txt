I thank my hon.
Friend for the hard work she has undertaken on the Select Committee.
She will know that we will deliver on our commitment on mental health support teams in the course of the next few months and years.
By 2026, we estimate that 60% of  pupils in schools and learners will have access to national health service tests—NHSTs—and I will take her suggestion back to the Department.
