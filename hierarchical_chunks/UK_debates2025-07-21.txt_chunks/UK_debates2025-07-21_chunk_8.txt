The Secretary of State just said that the Government were turning around declines in teacher numbers.
Under the last Government the number of teachers went up by 27,000; under this Government it is down by 400.
That is the opposite of the truth.
One thing that drives people out of teaching is poor discipline, yet the Government have abolished behaviour hubs, despite the evidence that they were working.
The Government said they would put in place new behaviour ambassadors, who were supposed to be in place on  4 July , but the contract has now lapsed and the position is vacant.
Why the delay on this vital issue?
That was very shouty from the shadow Minister, and as per usual very negative about what we are seeing across education.
We are turning around the problems that the Conservatives left behind on teacher recruitment and retention.
We are increasing attendance in our schools and improving behaviour—a challenge that I completely agree schools need support to deal with—putting more money back into parents’ pockets and tackling child poverty.
The Conservatives have only one policy, and that is to give a tax break to private schools.
What steps she is taking to improve mental health support in schools.
This Government are committed to improving mental health support for all children and young people.
That is why we are providing access to specialist mental health professionals in every school by expanding mental health support teams so that every child and young person has access to early support to address problems before they escalate.
