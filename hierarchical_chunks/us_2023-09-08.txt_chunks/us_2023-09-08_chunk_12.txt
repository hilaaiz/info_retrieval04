Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the El Segundo Little League All-Stars, a baseball team from the City of El Segundo, who won the 2023 Little League Baseball World Series on the 27th.
El Segundo defeated the Pabao Little League of Willemstad, Curacao in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
This year's championship win is the first for a team from Los Angeles County since 1993 and is the first for a team from the City of El Segundo.
The El Segundo Little League All-Stars--Lennon Salazar, Finley Green, Quinn Boehle, Lucas Keldorf, Colby Lee, Max Baker, Brody Brooks, Declan McRoberts, Ollie Parks, Louis Lappe, Crew O'Connor, and Jaxon Kalish-- should be proud of their accomplishment, as they have secured the 8th total title for the State of California, the most of any State in the union.
The El Segundo Little League team won 5 consecutive elimination games to compete in the championship and took home the win in a 6-5 game.
Louis Lappe hit a legendary walk-off home run to win the game in the sixth inning.
The team was led by Manager Danny Boehle and Coaches Tim Abrams and Eddie Lee.
I am happy to know that this team had the full support of their city behind them, and residents gathered across the city and Southern California to cheer them on in a wonderful display of community.
Their achievements are made all the more special by the hard work and the team effort made by every player, coach and supporter along the way.
On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I would like to sincerely congratulate the El Segundo Little League All-Stars team on winning the Little League World Series and wish them best of luck in their future efforts.
Their performance was a sight to behold, and they have made us all proud.
Go Gundo.
