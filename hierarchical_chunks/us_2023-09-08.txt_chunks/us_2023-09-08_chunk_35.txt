Assistant Fire Chief Densmore got his start in public service in 1996.
After only 1 year of service, he received the first of many Meritorious Company Commendations.
In addition, he has been recognized numerous times for valor and lifesaving.
Over the course of his public service career, Assistant Chief Densmore has committed himself to continuous professional development, completing numerous certification programs in various rescue operations techniques and other technical programming.
Assistant Chief Densmore has been an outstanding public servant to the communities served by the Dearborn Fire Department.
