Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th anniversary of the unofficial formation of the Palos Verdes Peninsula community.
One hundred years ago, a small real estate rally took place that is credited with the inception of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Today, the Palos Verdes Peninsula is comprised of 4 beautiful cities.
The first city to be incorporated on the peninsula was Palos Verdes Estates in 1939, followed by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates in 1957, and most recently Rancho Palos Verdes in 1973.
On June 17, 1923, real estate developers hosted a rally to encourage individuals to buy property on the peninsula.
This event invited people to hear about the development plan for the Peninsula and led to one of Nation's first planned communities.
The original site of the rally is where the offices of the Palos Verdes Unified District now stands.
What was once empty land with rolling hills and scenic views has transformed into a beautiful community with an amazing school district, businesses, and homes.
Today, the Peninsula is home to roughly 80,000 residents-- all of whom are my constituents.
The illustrious history of the Palos Verdes Peninsula was celebrated on June 17, 2023, with Doors Open Peninsula 2023:
Celebrating 100 Years of History on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Community leaders, residents, elected officials, and business owners worked in conjunction to honor the Peninsula's history.
On behalf of the residents of California's 36th Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the Palos Verdes Peninsula community on their 100-year anniversary and wish the cities a prosperous future.
