Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero of the week, Keller High School student, Maximus Williamson.
At 14 years old, Maximus set a new National Age Group record for the boys 13-14 age group at the 2021 Texas Age Group Swimming Championships, becoming the fastest American male in the event's history for his age range.
