Mr. Butler never owned a vehicle, yet this never deterred him from reaching his destinations.
He relied on his own two feet or the kindness of others who gave him rides, demonstrating his determination and resourcefulness.
One cannot speak of 
Mr. Butler without mentioning his famous saying, which encapsulates his unwavering spirit: ``If you cannot run, then walk.
If you cannot walk, then crawl, as long as you keep it moving.''
These words reflect his enduring commitment to progress, no matter the obstacles in his path.
As we remember Sidney Butler today, let us be inspired by his example.
Let us continue the work he started, championing justice, community improvement, and school safety.
In honoring his memory, we ensure that his legacy lives on, motivating us all to ``keep it moving'' towards a better future for our county.
