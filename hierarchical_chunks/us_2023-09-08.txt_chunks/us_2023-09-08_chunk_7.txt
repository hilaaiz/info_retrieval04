Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the city of Chowchilla's Centennial Celebration being held on September 23rd.
Since its incorporation 100 years ago on February 7, 1923, Chowchilla has distinguished itself as a vibrant agricultural city, idyllically nestled between the cities of Fresno and Merced, with close access to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Pacific Coastline, and Yosemite National Park.
Chowchilla hosts a rich culture that traces its roots back to the Chowchilla tribe who inhabited the area; the name `Chowchilla' being a byword for bravery to the southernmost end of the Yokuts territory in the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.
At the heart of its celebratory traditions is the Western Stampede Cattle Drive which arrives in Chowchilla every year with great fanfare and excitement, showcasing the city's rich history.
And Downtown Chowchilla displays the city's historical buildings and storefronts.
While home to only about 19,000 people, it's the birthplace of Ronald D. Moore, best known for his work on Star Trek, and Cameron Worrell, former NFL player of the Chicago Bears.
Chowchilla is now a part of a unique collective history--along with other small communities such as Kerman and Patterson--that emerged from the foresight of a real estate promoter O.A. Robertson who envisioned the productive and agricultural significance of the area to California's Central Valley.
