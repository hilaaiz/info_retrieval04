Mr. Speaker, once again, I am pleased to honor the life and legacy of Joe Siff, and I am grateful to share his story with the rest of our Nation.
I cherish our memories while admiring his significant, personal contributions.
He worked tirelessly to make our state and the world a better place.
May he Rest in Peace.
