Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the Savannah Fire Department for its unwavering service towards our community.
Throughout my time in government at the local, state, and federal levels, I have always known them to be a reliable force for good in the Savannah area.
For example, in early March the Savannah Fire Department saved the life of a young girl at a swim meet.
An 11-year old girl was swimming at the Chatham County Aquatic Center when she began to drown.
Savannah Fire responded to the call and found the young girl unable to breathe and in cardiac arrest.
The Firefighters quickly began CPR, and they continued until she regained breathing and a pulse.
Thanks to the quick actions of Savannah Fire, she is still with us today.
I would like to personally thank Advanced Firefighter Phil Haag, Captain Brian Smith, and Advanced Firefighter Mario Smith for their actions in saving this young girl.
This is just one of the many ways they keep our community safe every single day.
