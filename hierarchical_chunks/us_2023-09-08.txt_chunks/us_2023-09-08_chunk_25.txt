Ms. SEWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of an educator, administrator, and all-around phenomenal woman, Ina Yvonne Whisenhunt Tillman, who passed away on August 8, 2023, at the age of 85.
Ina was born in Vredenburgh, Alabama, to the late Martha Packer Whisenhunt and Walter Carver Whisenhunt, Sr. Upon graduating high school, Ina followed her passion for education at Alabama State University where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Education in 1960.
Returning home from Montgomery as a teacher, Ina spent the next decade teaching in the Selma City School System.
As a college student, Ina was inspired to get involved in the fight for civil rights by influential activists like Thelma M. Glass and Attorney E.D. Nixon, who served as her professors and frequent speakers.
When she returned to Selma, she continued to stay involved in the Movement, participating in numerous marches and demonstrations.
She was a proud member of the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, where she heard Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speak, solidifying her commitment to fighting for liberty, equality, and justice for all, especially the African-American community.
Bringing her activism to her classroom, Ina bravely
