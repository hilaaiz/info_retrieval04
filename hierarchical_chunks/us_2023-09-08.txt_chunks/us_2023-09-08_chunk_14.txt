Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Honeywell on 100 years of operations and doing business in South Bend, Indiana.
For a full century now, Honeywell has been a staple in the South Bend community as well as a source of stability and economic opportunity for hardworking Hoosiers in our area.
I often say that Hoosier manufacturing is second to none.
Honeywell's South Bend facility proves this point every single day.
By manufacturing aircraft wheel and brake systems, Honeywell Aerospace helps to keep people in the skies and American aviation safe and constantly on the move.
I had the pleasure of touring their South Bend facility and meeting members of Honeywell's team last month.
There, I was able to see firsthand the quality, professional work Honeywell employees do day in and day out and why Honeywell has chosen a home in South Bend for the past 100 years.
Congratulations again on reaching this impressive milestone.
I thank them for their many contributions to the city of South Bend and Indiana's Second Congressional District.
I wish them continued success and many more years in business and anniversaries to celebrate going forward.
