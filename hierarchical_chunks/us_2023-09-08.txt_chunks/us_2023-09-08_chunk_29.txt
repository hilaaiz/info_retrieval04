He has continued to excel, recently breaking more records, and taking home the gold in the 200 meters individual medley course at the World Junior Championships.
As if Maximus taking home gold wasn't impressive enough, his performance at the championships is matched by only 1 other American teenager, a man who went on to win 4 consecutive Olympic gold medals in the race.
His time compares to what the great Michael Phelps accomplished at that age.
I congratulate Maximus on his win and thank him for representing North Texas well.
I wish him all the best in his future competitions and will be rooting for him.
