150th birthday.
One hundred fifty years ago in August 1873, Battle Creek was founded.
Sitting along the Elkorn River Valley in Madison County, Battle Creek has grown through the years, welcoming new families, businesses, and visitors.
With a population of a few more than 1,000 people, they exhibit the best of what small town Nebraska has to offer: A great quality of life, family-owned businesses, and great recreation.
They're one of the first stops on the Cowboy Trail.
And Battle Creek is proud of its community members--both new and old.
One outstanding example is Rose O'Neill, the cartoonist who imagined the Kewpie Doll, which has gained fame around the world.
As Battle Creek reaches this sesquicentennial birthday, there is much to celebrate.
