I thank my hon.
Friend for his efforts in this area, and indeed for highlighting the excellent work that some businesses are already doing, going further than the statutory minimum.
As we know, when it comes to supporting working parents, every little helps.
This review will be evidence based.
It will reflect and consider the views and experiences of those who engage with the parental leave and pay system.
I encourage all businesses to contribute to the call for evidence, which was launched earlier this month.
I can assure my hon.
Friend that I plan to engage constructively with businesses, including Tesco and business representatives, throughout the period of the review.
