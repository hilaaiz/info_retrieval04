I thank the Minister for her statement, but I have not heard her say anything about the work of the boundary commissions for local government and constituencies.
I think they should form part of this discussion, particularly to ensure that constituencies can be made up of genuine communities by getting rid of the pointless rule that a constituency cannot go beyond a certain region.
Areas of Essex near my constituency, for instance, cannot be included within Romford, which only goes into London.
Similarly, local council wards would surely be better if they were one-member wards, whereby they could be like mini-constituencies looking after a particular community.
Would that not be a better way forward, and would the Minister consider it as part of the review?
