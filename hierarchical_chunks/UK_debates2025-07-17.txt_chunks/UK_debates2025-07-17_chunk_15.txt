I welcome the establishment of Bababing in the hon.
Member’s constituency.
I recognise that difficult decisions had to be taken in the Budget.
I am sure he has pointed out to the owners of Bababing that those difficult decisions were taken as a direct result of the £22 billion black hole that his party left us to tackle.
Our small business strategy will set out a range of measures we are taking to support businesses, which I hope will help Bababing and other businesses in his constituency.
