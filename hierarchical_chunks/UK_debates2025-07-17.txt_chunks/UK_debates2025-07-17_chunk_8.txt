I thank the Minister for his answer.
He will be aware of a Northumberland constituent of mine who was a victim of the faulty Horizon system, leading to her losing her job and her business and becoming a victim of abuse in her own community.
Despite my assistance, my constituent remains without an outcome to her claim.
Will the Minister please look into this case and ensure that her claim is progressed as quickly as possible, so that she can receive justice?
