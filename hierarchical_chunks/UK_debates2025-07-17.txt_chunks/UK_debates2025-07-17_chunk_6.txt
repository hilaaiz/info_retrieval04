I thank my hon.
Friend warmly for his question.
I am excited about this.
The strategic sites accelerator will prepare and accelerate sites for development by using Government tools, such as land acquisition, planning certainty and infrastructure support, to overcome existing barriers to investment on sites.
It is designed to create jobs, to attract investment and to support our industrial and net zero priorities.
It will work alongside other initiatives such as the connections accelerator service, which will streamline grid connections for major investment projects.
It is about going faster, being bigger and being more ambitious for new investments, such as those that could come to my hon.
Friend’s area.
I can tell him that the Office for Investment is working jointly with the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and Ofgem to take this vital work forward.
I expect capital to be deployed initially under this programme in 2026-27.
