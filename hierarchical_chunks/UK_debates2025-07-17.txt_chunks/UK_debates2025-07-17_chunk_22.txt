SME manufacturers are a key part of the planned renaissance in manufacturing in this country.
Some of them are raising concerns about a lack of involvement in the Industrial Strategy Advisory Council.
Will the Minister confirm that they are very much involved and have an important role to play in developing the SME strategy that he referred to?
Absolutely.
We want to hear from businesses up and down the UK, across different sectors, about the practical measures that we can take to support them and their plans to grow and develop.
If my hon.
Friend has particular examples of businesses that want to make representations, I am sure that we as a ministerial team would want to hear from them.
