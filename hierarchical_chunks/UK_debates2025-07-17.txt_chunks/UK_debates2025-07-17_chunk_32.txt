I thank my hon.
Friend for her questions; she does important work in her Committee.
The changes we are introducing will ensure that elected representatives,  candidates, campaigners and electoral staff, who play a unique role in our democracy, are properly protected.
We will give courts the power to increase sentences for those who are hostile to candidates.
An aggravated factor for intimidatory offence will be introduced, allowing courts to pass tougher sentences.
We will also remove the requirement to publish candidates’ addresses.
We will consult with the Crown Prosecution Service, the Sentencing Council and other judicial bodies.
