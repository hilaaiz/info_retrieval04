I thank the Minister and the Government for all they are doing in this area.
The frustration is that those who deserve compensation, having been traumatised physically, emotionally and financially, have waited many years for the redress that they should be getting.
There seems to be a delay for some who should be receiving the moneys now.
Indeed, they are now being told that it could be another three years before they will receive any money.
I genuinely urge the Minister and Government to make sure that people get the money ASAP—in other words, let us get it done this year.
