I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
In the 15 years I have been a Member of Parliament, we have seen a rise in hatred and hostility towards candidates and elected officials, and have sadly faced the loss of our dear colleagues, Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.
This Government are determined to ensure that elected representatives,  candidates and election officials are protected, because this trend is having a devastating chilling effect on our democracy.
We need to work together to protect our democracy while protecting freedom of speech.
I would be happy to speak to my hon.
Friend on the specific proposals as we proceed with their implementation.
