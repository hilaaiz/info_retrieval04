The SNP welcomes that the UK Government are catching up to Scotland, where we have had votes for 16-year-olds for the last nine years.
However, it is clear that real change also requires looking at this Parliament’s electoral system.
Recent polls have shown that the leading party currently would win a majority of seats in the next election on less than 30% of the vote.
Is it not long overdue that this Government reformed the UK Parliament’s broken electoral system and introduced proportional representation, as Welsh Labour is doing in the Senedd?
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to my previous answer.
The Government have no plans to change the electoral system for UK parliamentary or local elections.
