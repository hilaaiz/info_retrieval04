Before we begin, I am sure that the House will wish to join me in sending our best wishes to Robert Gibbs, catering operations manager, who will be leaving the House of Commons service tomorrow after 25 years.
Robert was instrumental in setting up the catering operation in Portcullis House when it opened more than 20 years ago, and he has since been dedicated to his role in supporting the management of catering across the estate.
He recently stepped up as acting director of catering services, leading and supporting the whole team for the past two years.
I take this opportunity to thank Robert, on behalf of the whole House, for his 25 years of service, and to wish him well in the future.
Robert is a good man and we will miss him.
