I welcome this announcement, and I can only speculate about why the Conservatives did not decide to clean up party funding when they were in Government.
I want to echo some of the comments about proportional representation.
Personally, I feel that it is at the heart of many of the problems the country has faced in recent times.
I absolutely accept that proportional representation is not part of the Government’s proposals, but will the Minister keep an open mind and look at how other strong democracies around the world have been able to use PR to both strengthen their democracy and create a more collaborative political culture?
