I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend for his work in this area through his Committee and for raising these issues.
There are already a number of rules  in place on political donations and they must be abided by, regardless of the type of donations made—including cryptocurrency donations.
Our reforms of political finance to further strengthen our democracy will also apply to all donations, including those in cryptocurrency.
Democracy is fragile and, here in the United Kingdom, our democracy is strongly in the crosshairs of nefarious states including Russia and China, which do not share our values.
We are seeing increasing activity online, particularly to distort the outcome of elections, via platforms including TikTok, which have links to communist regimes in China.
Can the Minister update the House on what steps are being taken in particular to protect our democracy from misinformation that vehemently seeks to distort the outcome of elections?
