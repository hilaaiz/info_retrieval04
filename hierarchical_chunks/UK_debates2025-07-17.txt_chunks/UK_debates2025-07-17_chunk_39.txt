I welcome the measures to take out dark money from our politics, but they will mean nothing unless we move forward aggressively to ban cryptocurrency donations in British politics.
They are used for money laundering and to disguise dark money.
They have no role in British politics.
Will the Minister confirm that the elections Bill will ban cryptocurrency donations?
