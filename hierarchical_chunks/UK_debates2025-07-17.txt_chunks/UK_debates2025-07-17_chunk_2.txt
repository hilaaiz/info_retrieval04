The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support small and medium cycle manufacturers.
Small and medium-sized bicycle manufacturers are important for our green growth ambitions.
Through the Government’s industrial and trade strategies, we are backing innovation, sustainability and skills development to help businesses, including cycle manufacturers, to scale up so that they can compete globally and continue driving forward the UK’s cycling economy.
I, too, wish Robert a happy next new adventure, Mr Speaker, and I wish Her Majesty the Queen a happy birthday.
The removal of anti-dumping duties on e-bikes from China has raised serious concerns for UK cycle manufacturers, which are mainly small and medium-sized businesses.
With similar duties on standard bikes and parts now under review, many UK manufacturers are worried about navigating the complex trade investigation process.
Will the Minister meet industry representatives to ensure that the voices of our small and medium-sized British cycling manufacturers are heard?
I associate myself with your statement, Mr Speaker, and with the comments of the hon.
Lady.
I recognise that there is concern about this issue among cycle manufacturers.
The hon.
Lady may be aware that some anti-dumping measures have been extended until 2029, but some have been lifted as a result of the work of the Trade Remedies Authority.
We are always happy to meet cycle manufacturers to discuss their concerns—whether it is with the hon.
Lady or directly with industry, I am very happy to ensure that such a meeting takes place.
