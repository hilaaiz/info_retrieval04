I thank my hon.
Friend for her work to support young people to participate in our democracy.
Young people can work at 16, pay taxes and join the Army.
There is no reason that they should not have the right to a say in who represents them and the right to shape their future.
They are passionate about the issues affecting their communities and country; I know that at first hand from the work I have done over the years to support young people in their leadership journeys and in participating in our elections.
