I welcome the Government’s commitment in this area.
Since 1999, there have been only six years when the regular forces have grown in size, and all three armed forces are currently below target.
Does the Minister believe there will be any year between now and 2030 when there will be a net increase in numbers?
Does he have a target for the overall increase in those years?
Or is it a bit like 2.5% of GDP, and we will just have to wait and see—“Make me good, but not yet”?
