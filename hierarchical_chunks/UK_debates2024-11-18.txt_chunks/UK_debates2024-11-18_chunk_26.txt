Our first step was to ensure that veterans who face homelessness have a more advantaged place in social housing provision—that was announced by the Prime Minister in his Labour party conference speech and will be followed up by the Deputy Prime Minister in changes to the arrangements for local authority guidance.
On the eve of Remembrance weekend, we also made a pledge of £3.5 million to help homeless veterans.
