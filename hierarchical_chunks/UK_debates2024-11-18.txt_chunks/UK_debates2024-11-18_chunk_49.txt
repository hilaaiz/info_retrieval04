My hon.
Friend has long championed this cause and brings considerable expertise to the role that she now undertakes as Chair of the Select Committee.
I look forward to discussing these issues with her and her Committee in due course.
She is right to identify that child poverty is a significant issue in this area.
That is why we got the work of the child poverty taskforce under way in August; we know that that work is crucial.
What she has set out today is something that I have heard from parents the length and breadth of the country as part of the work that we are undertaking.
It is important that, alongside tackling child poverty, we ensure that all families have early support and early intervention to ensure that they can thrive, and that, as she says, problems do not escalate in the way that they currently do.
