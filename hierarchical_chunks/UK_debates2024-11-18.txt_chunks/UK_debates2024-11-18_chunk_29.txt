The Secretary of State says it is true that it is not normal practice for the UK to reveal the value of payments for military bases, but there have actually been several written answers, under this Government and previous ones, giving the costs of overseas bases.
For example, in November 2015 the then Minister for the Armed Forces—Penny Mordaunt, no less—revealed in a written answer the cost of 10 overseas bases, including Diego Garcia and the cost of leases.
The reason for withholding the cost does not stack up.
What does the Secretary of State have to hide from Parliament?
Absolutely nothing, nor will we.
It is a matter of course to confirm running costs for bases.
What we are talking about here is an agreement leading to a treaty that will be put before this House.
I have said to the House and to the shadow Secretary of State that we will set out the costs and the details of that treaty in due course when the House comes to consider it.
In Doncaster, we are proud to have an armed forces covenant co-ordinator, the fantastic Teresa Hodgson, and a Doncaster armed forces covenant board, which is a coalition of groups and organisations committed to supporting the armed forces community in Doncaster.
Will the Minister visit my constituency to speak to the board and discuss the action that the Government are taking to support veterans facing homelessness?
I would love to come and visit my hon.
Friend’s constituency to talk through that and reaffirm that the covenant will go into law in the next two to three years.
That work is progressing as I speak.
