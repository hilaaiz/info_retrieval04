I thank the Minister for his response to the questions.
In Northern Ireland recruitment is at record levels—there has never needed to be conscription because there were always volunteers.
Ever mindful of that, and of the need to ensure that the independent Armed Forces Commissioner has the same responsibility and power in every place in Northern Ireland, will the Minister please indicate strongly, if he can, that every council will be involved, and every person who needs help in Northern Ireland will get it?
