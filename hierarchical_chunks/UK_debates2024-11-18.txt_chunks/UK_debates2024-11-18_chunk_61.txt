As we take forward further proposals both for legislation and for wider change and reform across the sector, we look forward to working not only  with family rights organisations, charities and others to make sure that they are involved in the design of services, but with our brilliant and often unsung workforce—as my hon.
Friend identifies—who often do their work behind the scenes and without the recognition they deserve.
Our social work workforce and others play a crucial role, and we are determined to do more to support them in their vital endeavours.
I warmly welcome today’s statement from the Secretary of State.
As a county councillor in Oxfordshire, the number of children in our care who are living in unregistered children’s homes is of grave concern to me.
Those homes are often overpriced and always suboptimal for vulnerable children, as well as being strictly illegal.
I heard what the Secretary of State had to say about the local authority settlement next month.
Will she undertake to work with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor to allocate some of the capital investment announced in the Budget, so that local authorities can open new registered children’s homes and provide safer and more affordable accommodation closer to home for vulnerable young people?
I agree, and I will be working very closely with the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister in this area.
The hon.
Gentleman is right to highlight the increase in unsafe unregistered placements.
That is why we are giving Ofsted further powers to act and why I set out in the Command Paper that we will make sure that councils and others have the powers they need to deliver more placements for children.
I encourage him to look closely at that work; I think he will find much that he can welcome in it.
