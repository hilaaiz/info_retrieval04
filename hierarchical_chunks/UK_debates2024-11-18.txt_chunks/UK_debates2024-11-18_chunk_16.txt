I thank my hon.
Friend for her interest in this area and for championing the work of that organisation in her constituency.
As we get to the point of implementing the Armed Forces Commissioner, I expect that they will have new relationships with service charities and organisations for serving members of our forces and the wider armed forces family.
I would be very happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss that, and I look forward to visiting her constituency to meet that organisation in person if I can.
