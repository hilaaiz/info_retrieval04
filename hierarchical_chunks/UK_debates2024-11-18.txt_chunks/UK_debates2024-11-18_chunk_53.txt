I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend, who has consistently shared his personal experience, and who has demonstrated to so many young people what can be achieved, even when there are barriers to overcome.
He knows as well as I do that far too many care-experienced young people in our country lack the support and backing that they deserve, and we are determined to change that.
He is also right to point to the excellent work of my hon.
Friend  the Member for Whitehaven and Workington (Josh MacAlister) .
I am delighted to have been able to set out many developments arising from that crucial work.
There is so much more that we need to do together to put the rights and needs of vulnerable children at the heart of our policymaking.
