I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman’s passion for recruitment.
The recruitment target was missed in every single year of the last Conservative Government.
It will take us time to fix the process, but we have already made announcements about improving retention and recruitment.
We will make further such announcements in the months ahead to ensure that we are dealing with the gaps in our capabilities and improving morale, and that we have forces that are able to deter and defeat aggressors, if necessary.
