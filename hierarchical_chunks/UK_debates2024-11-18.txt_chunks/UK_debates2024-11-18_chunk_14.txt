I thank the Minister for all he is doing to improve the lives of our armed forces communities.
He will be aware of the deeply distressing accounts of rape and sexual assault from the Defence Committee’s report on women in the armed forces.
Will he please revisit our recommendations and those of the Lyons review, so that those serious cases can be heard in civilian, not service courts?
