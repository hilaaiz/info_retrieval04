I welcome the Secretary of State’s broad commitment to reducing the number of children who need to go into care.
Building on the comments of  the hon.
Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Gareth Snell) , I want to emphasise the work that Pause does with West Sussex county council and 24 other authorities.
Pause has a vision of ensuring that no one goes through having a child taken into care more than once.
However, more than half of areas have no support available for parents after a child is removed from their care, which leads to many being trapped in a cycle of pregnancies, care proceedings and repeat removals.
What assurances can the Secretary of State give that this valuable work will be more widely rolled out across the country, and will she meet me and Pause to discuss how that work can be taken forward?
