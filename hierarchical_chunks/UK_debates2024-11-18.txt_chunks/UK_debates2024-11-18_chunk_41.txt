Small and medium-sized enterprises in my constituency tell me that research and development funding has dried up since last December.
What hope can the Minister offer to ensure that SMEs continue their vital innovation to keep the UK safe, and to help them turn their swords into ploughshares?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to highlight the importance of SMEs in improving our industrial base and bringing agility and new ideas to our defence industrial production.
He can be assured that there will be SME involvement in our industrial strategy to the extent that it is possible.
We intend to make sure that SMEs, not just the primes, get a better in at the MOD and are able to get the work.
Will the Minister join me in congratulating the Royal British Legion for another highly successful poppy appeal, and the Redditch and Astwood Bank Royal British Legion for another record-breaking year?
I completely concur.
I am sure the whole House will agree that the Royal British Legion did a fantastic job in this year’s remembrance parade.
I had the privilege of marching with the veterans for the first time since I left the armed forces.
It was a fantastic show of respect to all those who have served.
Between 1978 and 1990, in what was an illegal act, 5,700 women were dismissed and discharged from the armed forces on family grounds—for falling pregnant while in service.
This is not a question of compensation; they want their berets and cap badges returned to them.
Will the Minister please work with me to right an injustice done to all those women who just wanted to keep serving their country, and now want that service recognised?
That is a really important question.
We have the utmost respect for all those who have served.
I would be delighted to work with the hon.
Lady to move that forward.
