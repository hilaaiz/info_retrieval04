I am grateful to the hon.
Lady, and I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Lewisham East (Janet Daby)  would be happy to meet her to discuss the issue further.
She is right to identify the need for ongoing support for families when a child or children has been removed.
Before coming to this House, I worked with many families who were in that situation.
I saw directly not just how much of a difference could be made to the lives of those children and families, but how, when mothers were going through subsequent pregnancies, that intervention and support could often be crucial in making sure that the children were able to stay with the mother.
That is sadly not always possible, but much more can be achieved with the right level of support.
I certainly saw some amazing examples where it was possible to break what had sadly felt like a cycle.
