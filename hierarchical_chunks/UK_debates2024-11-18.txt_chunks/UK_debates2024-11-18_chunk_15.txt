My hon.
Friend is exactly right to raise this very serious issue.
In opposition we made a commitment that murder, manslaughter and rape cases would be tried in civilian, rather than military courts.
I encourage her to keep asking questions as we get closer to the armed forces Bill, which will be an opportunity to put that right.
The Listening Out Loud Foundation in my constituency is run by Jill and Andy Dolman and works with those who have recently left the forces, often with complex problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder.
They can provide an excellent insight into how we can better support current and future armed forces personnel.
How does the Minister foresee the Armed Forces Commissioner working with small charities such as the Listening Out Loud Foundation, and will he join me in visiting the organisation in the near future?
