In relation to the cost of renting back our own military base on the Chagos islands, last week the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office,  the hon.
Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty) , said that the reason the Government refused to tell us what the cost will be is that “it is not normal practice for the UK to reveal the value of payments for military bases anywhere across the globe”.—[Official Report,  13 November 2024 ; Vol. 756, c. 793.]

That is why the US Defence Secretary welcomed the agreement, which he said would “safeguard the strategic security interests of the United Kingdom…and the United States…into the next century”.
