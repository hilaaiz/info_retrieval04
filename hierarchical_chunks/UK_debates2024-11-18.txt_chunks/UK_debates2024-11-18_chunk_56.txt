I thank my hon.
Friend for speaking about his experiences.
He will know that until quite recently this area was perhaps little understood.
It is so important that people like him are able to speak openly; it demonstrates bravery and will encourage others to do the same.
I will happily look at the report and the work that he mentions, and ensure that routes back into family care, for those children for whom that is possible, are considered in our ongoing work.
