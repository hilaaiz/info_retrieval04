Thank you, Mr Speaker—it is nice to be back.
On recruitment, many who join the armed forces began their military journey as cadets.
The previous Conservative Government’s cadet expansion programme successfully established hundreds of new cadet units in state schools.
However, this Labour Government have recently withdrawn  a critical £1 million-plus grant that supports cadet instructors in many of the very same state schools.
Will the Government as a whole urgently review that very unwelcome decision?
