In the London borough of Sutton, we started to in-house some children’s care home provision back in 2020, and we now care for six children with complex needs.
What assessment has the Department made of the potential scale of local authorities taking on services directly, if given the right support by the Government?
Like the hon.
Gentleman, I have seen good examples of councils across the country that have started to take such action, but they have done so by going against the grain of Government policy.
This time, councils will have the backing of the Government in making those changes.
We will also ensure that they can take action on a regional basis, work together and collaborate, so that they can manage placements more effectively.
That way, we will not just bring down costs to the taxpayer, which are spiralling out of control, but ensure that children can stay closer to family support networks, which is crucial to their long-term future.
Having spent 14 years watching children’s services struggle in the way the Secretary of State outlines, with serious case reviews often being the moment of intervention, I heartily welcome the emphasis on early intervention, and what she says about the responsibility that we all have.
She will know that there has been much discussion about the concept of corporate parenting.
What is her thinking on that, and what role does she see for us as Members of Parliament?
At the moment, relationships across the country are clearly too inconsistent.
That is to the detriment of safeguarding, and indeed of our young people.
My hon.
Friend is right that there are many long-standing challenges in this area.
On corporate parenting, today’s Command Paper sets out the steps that we intend to take to bring forward further plans in this area.
I look forward to working with her on the shape and scale of those plans, because it is essential that we all take our responsibilities incredibly seriously, as I know she does.
