Will the Secretary of State investigate those claims urgently and report to the House?
I can assure the hon.

Friend the Minister for Veterans and People has met nuclear test veterans to establish a new relationship to ensure that we have consistent and productive dialogue.
I know that he is committed to exploring the concerns raised about access to medical records, and I am sure that progress will be made in that context.
If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
This Government are delivering for defence.
Last month, the UK and Germany signed the landmark Trinity House agreement, marking a new era of co-operation between our armed forces and our defence industries.
With threats increasing, we must strengthen European security.
Tomorrow marks the bloody milestone of 1,000 days since Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine began.
The UK continues to be united for Ukraine, and the Government continue to step up support for Ukraine.
As part of that, I can confirm today that 50,000 Ukrainian troops have now been trained through Operation Interflex —the UK-led multinational training programme—which I have now extended to run throughout 2025.
