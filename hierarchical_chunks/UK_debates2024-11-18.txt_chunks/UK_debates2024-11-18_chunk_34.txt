I thank my hon.
Friend for his really important question.
For the past 14 years, we have kicked the can down the road on housing, and I will take it upon myself to put in place a medium and long-term plan that will solve those housing problems as we move forward.
There are over 47,000 MOD properties, and we will make sure people get the deal they deserve.
