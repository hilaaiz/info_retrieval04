The Secretary of State said a moment ago that the UK is working on a potential UK-EU security agreement.
Might that include involvement in the European Peace Facility, which procures ammunition jointly?
Discussions are at an early stage.
At present, I am more concerned about the action we can take immediately, which is why I have given my first priority to building relations with key European allies.
When I can, I will consolidate those relations in formal agreements, which we already have with Germany.
As the MP for Sandhurst as well as Bracknell, I am delighted that the first intake of recruits to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst since the general election has hit 101% of its target, despite the wider retention and recruitment crisis.
Will the Minister join me in welcoming all the 2024 recruits to my constituency?
I congratulate all those starting their military careers at Sandhurst and across our defence training estate.
A career in the armed forces is a good career that supports our national defence, and I encourage more people to look at a good career in the armed forces—whether joining for the first time or rejoining.
