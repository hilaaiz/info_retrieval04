I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of her statement.
I welcome the Government’s focus today on children’s social care, and on the profiteering issues that we identified and set up the market intervention advisory group to look at when we were in government.
However, at the heart of the problem is a lack of high-quality places for looked-after children.
That is what is causing the high cost of placements, as demand is outstripping supply.
