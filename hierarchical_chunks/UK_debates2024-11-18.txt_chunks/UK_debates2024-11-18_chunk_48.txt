I welcome the action that the Government have announced today to improve children’s social care.
The Secretary of State will know that families from the poorest neighbourhoods are 14 times more likely to be referred to children’s social care than those from the richest areas,  and that there is a growing body of evidence linking child poverty to the rise in children entering the care system.
How will she ensure that the upcoming child poverty strategy delivers more stability and safety for children and ensures that fewer families enter the kind of crises that result in their children being removed from their care?
