I also thank the Secretary of State for the decisive action she has taken to address the causes of HS2’s cost overruns.
We look forward to having Mark Wild and the Rail Minister at our Committee very shortly.
I actually want to celebrate something that HS2’s leadership should be proud of: the work they have done on skills and workforce innovation.
They have provided best-practice work that the construction industry and transport projects can learn from, and in fact are learning from.
However, I urge the Secretary of State to get her Department to learn from countries such as France and Spain, which have managed to deliver extensive high-speed rail projects to time and at a fraction of the cost of HS2 here in the UK.
