I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his response, and indeed for the tone with which he made his comments.
I was pleased to hear him acknowledge that mistakes had been made on HS2 by the previous Government.
I think he described the path as not having been perfect—I would go so far as to say that it has been a shambolic mess.
He struck a sombre note in his remarks, and I would ask him to consider going further, once he has had the opportunity to read the full James Stewart report, because an apology on the part of the Conservative party for the mess in which it left this infrastructure scheme is undoubtedly warranted.
I also thank him for his comments on the action that HS2 is taking with regard to alleged fraud within the supply chain.
I can assure him that I will provide appropriate updates to the House on the progress of the HMRC investigation that is now under way.
