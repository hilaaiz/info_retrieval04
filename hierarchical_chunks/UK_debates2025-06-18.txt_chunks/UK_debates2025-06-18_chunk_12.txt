Women are waiting up to 10 years for a diagnosis of endometriosis or adenomyosis.
Our Women and Equalities Committee report recommended a maximum wait of two years, which is still a long time to live with intense pain and fertility decline, but it would be an improvement.
Given that reproductive health issues cost the UK economy £11 billion a year, the sooner conditions are treated, the sooner women can get on with their lives.
Does the Minister agree that investing in women’s health is essential, and how is she raising the importance of the women’s health strategy with her colleagues, including the Health Secretary?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to say that we need a focus on women’s health.
Our priority is turning the commitments in the women’s health strategy into tangible actions, such as by setting out how we will eliminate cervical cancer by 2040 through the new cervical cancer plan.
We have taken urgent action, through our elective reform plan, to support the nearly 600,000 women who are on gynaecology waiting lists.
One in 10 women in Northern Ireland is thought to have endometriosis, and the average wait time for diagnosis is an unacceptable nine and a half years.
Does the Minister agree that there needs to be a UK-wide strategy  that equips our NHS with endo-experienced surgeons, fertility experts, mental health support and pain specialists in order to aid those women, who are on the most horrifically painful journey?
