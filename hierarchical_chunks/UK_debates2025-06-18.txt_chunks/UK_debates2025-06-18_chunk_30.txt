I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue, and I know that the fire Minister—the Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham North and Kimberley (Alex Norris) —will be happy to discuss it further.
I am committed to ensuring that fire and rescue services across the country have the resources they need to keep communities safe.
The deployment of fire engines, though, is decided locally, so this really is a question for Warwickshire county council, which is now led by Reform.
The hon.
Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage)  should have a word with his county councillors in Nuneaton and get them to explain why Reform is cutting fire services.
