The hon.
Gentleman asked me to set out our plans for investment in transport in the midlands and the north.
The Conservative party took the decision to cancel HS2 north of Birmingham, and made wild promises about what it would do with the money it claimed it was saving.
He is kidding himself if he thinks that that money ever existed.
In last week’s spending review, this Government set out £15.6 billion to be invested in local transport schemes across the country, whether in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds or Newcastle.
The hon.
Gentleman’s approach was a fantasy—he promised the moon on a stick and had absolutely no means to deliver.
He asked me to set out the Government’s plans for further enhancing rail connectivity in the midlands and the north.
I can assure him that further announcements will be made, both as part of the Government’s 10-year national infrastructure strategy and beyond that in the weeks and months ahead.
The hon.
Gentleman also asked me to opine on the extent to which litigation has caused delays in the delivery of infrastructure projects.
He will know that, through this Government’s Planning and Infrastructure Bill, we are tackling this issue by limiting the number of judicial reviews and legal challenges that can be brought.
Unlike his party, this Government are serious about delivering infrastructure, and about providing the stable leadership that this country needs when it comes to infrastructure.
Before coming to the Chamber today, I looked up the number of Rail Ministers in the Department under his Government—it was 18 in 12 years.
It is no wonder that projects such as HS2 were left in such a state of disarray.
Just as this Government have returned stability to the nation’s economy, so will we return common sense and stable leadership to the delivery of the nation’s infrastructure.
