I thank the Secretary of State for her statement and the candidness with which she has delivered it.
The villages I represent in north Buckinghamshire, be they Turweston, Westbury, Quainton or North Marston—I know  the hon.
Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith)  will be familiar with those communities—have for too long faced chaos and disruption from HS2 and its contractors.
News that there will be yet more delay will cause them significant distress.
Will the Secretary of State update the House and explain what additional practical support, financial or otherwise, her Department plans to give rural communities such as mine over the years ahead?
