I thank the Secretary of State for her statement and for advance sight of it.
What we have heard today is clearly a damning indictment of Conservative mismanagement.
Connecting our largest cities with high-speed rail was meant to help boost economic growth and spread opportunity.
The original idea—a high-speed rail network connecting London to Manchester and Leeds—was clearly the right one, but what we have ended up with is years of delay and billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money being poured down the drain, with no end in sight.
The litany of errors that the Secretary of State has outlined is truly shocking and shows that the Conservatives were comatose at the wheel.
A lack of oversight, trust and planning has left us with a high-speed railway drastically reduced in scale and inflated in price.
The shocking allegations of fraud by a subcontractor are emblematic of the Tories’ lack of oversight and interest in properly safeguarding the public interest and public money, as we saw with the scandal of personal protective equipment procurement during covid.
We must now make sure that any money lost to fraud is clawed back as soon as possible.
