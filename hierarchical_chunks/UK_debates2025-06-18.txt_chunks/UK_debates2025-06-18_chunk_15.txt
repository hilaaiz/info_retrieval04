I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
She is absolutely right: everyone should feel safe while on public transport.
That is why we have developed an ambitious programme to help make the transport network safe for women and girls.
The British Transport police use overt and covert policing techniques to target offenders who are using the network, promote the reporting of sexual offences, and have committed to tackling violence against women and girls in their 2025-to-27 policing plan, which, with her experience in this area, she may be interested to discuss with them.
