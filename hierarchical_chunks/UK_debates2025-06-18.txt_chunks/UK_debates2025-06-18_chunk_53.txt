The Secretary of State knows that HS2 runs through my constituency, and she will accept that what makes my constituents particularly angry about what she has described is that HS2 has pinched every penny in compensating someone unfortunate enough to find themselves in the path of this railway, yet wasted millions elsewhere.
Can she assure us that as part of the reset, line-drawing or page-turning—however she describes it—she will look at how people are compensated when affected by such major infrastructure projects?
Does she accept that it would be sensible to consider how Parliament could look again at this project, whose budget and timescale have ballooned, and decide whether we still think it is a worthwhile use of taxpayers’ money?
The right hon.
and learned Gentleman is right to point out that we have some form as a country in seeking to gold-plate infrastructure projects.
The last Government talked about this railway being  the fastest and the best in the world.
Frankly, I would like this country to do things well and properly.
The point he raises about compensation is one that any Government should keep under review, while bearing in mind the need to provide value for money to the taxpayer.
I can assure him that I will make sure on any infrastructure project I oversee in this role that the House is appropriately updated and that we proceed with transparency on the costs and benefits of the schemes.
