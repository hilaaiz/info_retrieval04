I thank my hon.
Friend for his comments.
I am flanked by the two ladies—the Chancellor and the Home Secretary—who have ensured that those things happen.
The Chancellor has guaranteed funding to accelerate projects like Peterborough’s new sports quarter, which will include a new Olympic-sized  swimming pool.
I can also confirm today that, subject to the business case approval, we will provide nearly £48 million of funding for a new city centre quarter and a refurbished eastern station building.
