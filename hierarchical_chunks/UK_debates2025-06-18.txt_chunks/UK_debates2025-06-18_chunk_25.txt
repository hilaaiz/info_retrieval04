I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, for the work that she has done with campaigners such as Margaret in their fight for justice, and for mentioning Grenfell, the eighth anniversary of which was not so long ago.
We remain fully committed to bringing in a Hillsborough law.
The state has failed victims and their families too many times in the past, which is precisely why our focus is now on getting the legislation right.
I can assure her that measures will be brought forward as soon as we are confident that they will deliver the justice that victims deserve, and we want to do this at pace.
