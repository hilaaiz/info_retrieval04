I welcome the Government’s announcement on grooming gangs.
I am sorry for stumbling; I have been floored by the point scoring going on around them—on all sides.
I wonder whether the Deputy Prime Minister is aware that the victims and survivors of grooming gangs are being denied compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority on bizarre technicalities, as are all children who have been victims of online abuse.
For me, that is a grave injustice.
The authority thinks it is better than a judge and jury.
I wonder what the Deputy Prime Minister plans to do.
Personally, I think it should be abolished.
