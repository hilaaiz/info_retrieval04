I thank the Father of the House for his important question.
Settler violence and expansion in the west bank is appalling and completely unacceptable.
Alongside our allies, we have sanctioned individuals responsible for inciting this extremist action, but a two-state solution is the only way to bring the  peace that the Israelis and the Palestinians deserve.
That is only achievable if the hostages are released, aid is surged into Gaza and the ceasefire is restored.
We will do everything we can to make that happen.
