I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue.
She is right: it is unacceptable that women can wait up to 10 years for an endometriosis diagnosis.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence’s updated guidelines on endometriosis make firmer recommendations on referral and investigations, which will help women receive a diagnosis and effective treatment faster.
It is important that we continue to work as closely we can on this issue across the whole UK.
