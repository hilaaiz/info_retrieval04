On Friday, my private Member’s Bill is due for Second Reading.
It calls for the Government to publish a strategy to tackle interpersonal abuse and violence against men and boys.
The strategy would ensure that male survivors of crimes considered to be violence against women and girls, such as rape, sexual assault, domestic abuse, forced marriage and honour-based violence, are given dedicated support, and also prevent male survivors from having to be in spaces that should be for women.
Currently, male survivors are to be included in the strategy for women and girls, due to be published this summer.
Can the Minister reassure me, and male survivors in desperate need of support, that the Government will introduce a dedicated strategy for men and boys, and if they will not, why not?
