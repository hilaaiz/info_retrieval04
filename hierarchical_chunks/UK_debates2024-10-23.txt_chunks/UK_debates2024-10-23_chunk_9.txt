We look forward to a positive conclusion to those discussions next week.
As the Minister knows, both representatives from the Mid South West region growth deal and the Causeway Coast and Glens growth deal are in Westminster today.
Will the Minister acknowledge that, in working with businesses and in trying to encourage greater trade within our own country, the appointment of a chair of Intertrade UK was an important first step, but work needs to start, the terms of reference need to be set and businesses need to be able to engage with that body established to support trade within our country?
I agree with the right hon.
Member that Intertrade UK needs to get going with its work to encourage investment between all of the regions and nations of the UK.
It is very important to set the terms of reference, and we are working with the organisation as fast as we can now that the chair is in their place
