I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his comments.
He is absolutely right to point out that last year we saw the highest levels of sewage ever recorded in our rivers, lakes and seas.
No wonder the public are so angry, including in his constituency.
Tragically, Lake Windermere, an iconic and beautiful site, has been polluted with sewage and agricultural run-off because of the failures of the previous Government.
