I thank my hon.
Friend for her comments.
Unfortunately, customers have been left to pay the price of 14 years of Conservative failure to secure investment in our water infrastructure, so it has collapsed to such an extent that Ofwat now recommends eye-watering bill increases.
Every penny of that is down to the failure of the Conservative party.
Our reset will ensure that that kind of catastrophic failure can never happen again.
