It is very generous of you to call me again, Mr Speaker.
The Executive’s draft programme for government acknowledges that policing numbers in Northern Ireland are at an all-time low, a situation that the chief constable has described as dangerous.
The draft programme commits to increasing numbers in line with New Decade, New Approach.
Is the Secretary of State convinced that the budget sustainability plan is sufficient to achieve that aim?
The hon.
Gentleman raises an important point, as we discussed just a moment ago.
I recognise the pressures on the PSNI, but it falls to the Executive to decide how much to allocate, from the funds available to them, to policing and other public services in Northern Ireland.
If they wish to allocate more, they are in a position to do so, but it involves making a choice.
