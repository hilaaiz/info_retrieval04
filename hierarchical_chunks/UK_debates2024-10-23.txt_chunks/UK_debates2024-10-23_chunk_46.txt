I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
As a biased former care worker, I will always champion carers and the complex quality and professional work that they do.
I absolutely agree that care workers deserve the pay and conditions to match their enormous contribution to our community.
I am proud to say that we are delivering that fair pay agreement that will give carers the recognition that they deserve, and I will ensure that those carers are able to deliver the best possible care to our loved ones.
