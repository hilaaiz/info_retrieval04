I thank my hon.
Friend for raising what is an emotive subject for Members on both sides of the House.
From my work in this area   before I was in this place, I know what incredible work this is, and what an honour it is to be there for somebody at the end of their life.
Discussions have begun on how to improve access to palliative and end-of-life care, and I will ensure that my hon.
Friend gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss this issue.
