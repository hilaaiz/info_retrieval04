I thank my hon.
Friend and welcome him, and his expertise in the National Crime Agency, to this place.
He knows that we inherited an asylum system in chaos.
As he rightly says, these are people—women and children.
We are putting in place a credible plan to protect our borders and remove those with no right to be here by setting up our border security command, backed by £75 million of investment.
We are working with our international partners to target and disrupt the criminal smuggling gangs.
