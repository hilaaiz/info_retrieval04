The use of storm overflows in places such as Skegby in Ashfield is absolutely disgusting and it pollutes my rivers, so will the Secretary of State commit to giving the water companies a deadline for ending their use?
It will be for the commission to look at what we need to do to improve infrastructure and fix the broken system that we have at the moment.
We are making sure that every overflow has monitoring on it, so that we know exactly what is coming out of it.
We can therefore take action against the water companies that might be responsible.
In my constituency this week, as well as having sewage in our bathing waters, we have had sewage on the streets in Penryn.
The Conservative party cut funding to the regulator in 2015.
Will the Secretary of State please confirm that the review will completely reset the role of the regulator?
