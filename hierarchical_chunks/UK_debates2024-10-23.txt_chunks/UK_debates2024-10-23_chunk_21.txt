The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 23 October.
I have been asked to reply, as my right hon.
and learned Friend the Prime Minister is in Samoa to discuss shared opportunities in the Commonwealth, including how we work together to deliver economic growth.
With increasing threats facing Britain, it is vital that we also strengthen defence, security and co-operation with our allies.
That is why today, this Government signed a landmark defence agreement with Germany that will help keep us safe and create hundreds of jobs.
I know the whole House will join me in sending our best wishes to Sir Chris Hoy and his wife Sarra.
He is a true sporting legend, and the courage and positivity they have shown will inspire many others.
I also send our condolences to those affected by the train crash in Powys.
This morning, I have had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
For 14 years, my constituents in Newcastle-under-Lyme had to suffer flatlining wages, in-work poverty, and a bust economy that served nobody.
Can I urge the Deputy Prime Minister to use the Employment Rights Bill to turn the page on the last 14 years, give our businesses the support they need, and finally restore dignity, prosperity and opportunity to the good people of Newcastle-under-Lyme?
