Zoe’s Place, in the West Derby area of Liverpool, is a hospice that provides support to sick children and their families.
It has been threatened with closure and has to find £5 million by the end of the year.
Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that such hospices need to be on a statutory footing and not reliant on charitable funding?
The hospice situation in this country has faced significant challenges because of the 14 years of devastation under the Conservatives.
The Health Secretary has already raised these issues and knows that this is of importance; I will make sure that my hon.
Friend gets to meet him.
The Deputy Prime Minister will know that my constituency, and Lincolnshire as a whole, is the breadbasket of Britain, producing 12% of the food consumed across the entire nation, including 30% of the vegetables and 20% of the sugar beet.
That is because of the grade 1 and 2 land in Lincolnshire, yet Lincolnshire faces an invasion of giant pylons down the east coast and huge solar developments.
Will she meet a delegation of colleagues from Lincolnshire and nearby, including my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins) , my hon.
Friend  the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Dr Johnson)  and the Father of the House, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) , so that we can establish that energy security must never be a competitor with food security?
