I welcome the hon.
Member to his place.
We recognise the devastating impact that flooding can have.
I know that the flooding Minister visited Bedfordshire in September to meet volunteers and residents.
We inherited flood defences in disrepair and behind schedule.
We have launched the floods resilience taskforce, and when it comes to the planning reforms needed to deliver the 1.5 million homes this country needs, we will ensure that the right infrastructure is in place and that communities are resilient.
