I welcome the commission announced by my right hon.
Friend.
Last week, six beaches in my constituency were affected by raw sewage dumping, with two of them—Joss Bay and Stone Bay—experiencing a bad effect on their bathing water quality, but the verdict was that they were still within Environment Agency permitted limits.
Will my right hon.
Friend confirm that the commission will investigate regulatory standards, so that when raw sewage is dumped, there is actually a fine and a punishment for the water companies?
I must also make a declaration as a customer of Southern Water and a sea water swimmer.
