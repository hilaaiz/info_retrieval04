The Secretary of State and I are in constant talks about such deals and with the deal providers.
I know the value of these deals not just to the regions affected, but across Northern Ireland.
However, the Government face a £22 billion black hole, and it is right that the Treasury considers all options on the table to address that.
We will find out more in the Budget next week.
The Mid South West and the Causeway Coast and Glens growth deals are being considered as part of  the spending review, and the Government will continue to work closely with the deals’ partners and the Executive.
The Secretary of State and I will continue to underline the importance of these deals to my ministerial colleagues in the Treasury.
