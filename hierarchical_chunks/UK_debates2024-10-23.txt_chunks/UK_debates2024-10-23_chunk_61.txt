The Secretary of State said that the review would have no impact on the price review ’24 process.
Will he outline exactly when the positive impacts will come?
By my calculations, it will not be until 2029 at the earliest.
Will he also outline the impact of the review on the measures proposed in the Water (Special Measures) Bill?
What will be done if the recommendations do not sit comfortably with the current proposals?
One cannot help concluding that the Secretary of State is out of depth on this issue, cannot deliver on the tough language that he promised in the run-up to the general election and is now doing nothing more than attempting to kick the tough decisions down the road and into the long grass.
This Secretary of State seems to be all bark and no bite.
Well, that was all a little bit embarrassing, wasn’t it?
The previous Government had 14 years in power, our rivers, lakes and seas are awash with record levels of pollution, and that is all the Conservatives have to say.
I took action seven days after the general election: I brought the water chief execs into my office, and we agreed that money earmarked for investment will be ringfenced so that it cannot be diverted to pay multimillion-pound bonuses to water chief execs who oversee failure in the water sector, as happened on the shadow Minister’s watch.
The commission will reset the sector that the Conservatives broke, and clean up the water that they polluted.
It will report to the Government in June and inform subsequent legislation.
At the weekend, I went swimming in the North sea —probably for the last time this year—having first checked on the Surfers Against Sewage website that there had not been any legal or illegal spills.
It is disgraceful that the last Conservative Government left our seas and waterways in such as state, and it is notable that Water UK continuously blames the regulator for not allowing it to raise prices in order to invest further in our system.
Will the Secretary of State make sure that we assess the value extracted by the water companies?
They have taken billions of pounds in profits and hundreds of millions in bonuses.
We need to make sure that future investment adds value and does not take it away.
