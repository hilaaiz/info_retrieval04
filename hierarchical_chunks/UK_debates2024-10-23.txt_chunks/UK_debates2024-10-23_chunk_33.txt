I welcome my hon.
Friend to his place.
He has been a champion for workers at Newton Aycliffe from day one.
I know he has met the Transport Secretary, and I can assure him that we are in close contact with Hitachi on operations to secure a sustainable future for Newton Aycliffe.
We are committed to a long-term industrial strategy for rolling stock, seeking to support British manufacturing and end the volatility of recent years.
