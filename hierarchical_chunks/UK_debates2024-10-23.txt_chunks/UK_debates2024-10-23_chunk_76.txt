I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I had the pleasure of visiting Truro and Falmouth during the election, and I saw for myself the problems there.
It is disgusting to see sewage bubbling up into the streets and even into some people’s back gardens because the sewage infrastructure is so broken after the previous Government failed for 14 years to bring in the investment necessary to upgrade it.
The commission will look at how we secure funding and get that infrastructure rebuilt at pace, so that we can improve the situation we are hearing about.
It will also look at regulation and the role of the regulator and make proposals as to how we can improve those, so that we have regulation that is fit for purpose.
