I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
To a large degree, I welcome it—or at least the intention behind it—but water companies dumped 54% more sewage into our lakes, rivers and coastal areas in 2023 than in the previous year.
That amounts to 464,000 spills, including many in the lakes and rivers  of Westmorland.
My constituency is the most beautiful part of England and also the wettest, so water is deeply personal to us.
Does the Secretary of State understand my worry that we might have gone from having a Conservative Government who would not face up to this outrage or tackle it, to having a new Labour Administration who have acknowledged this outrage and decisively resolved to have a jolly good think about it?
While Thames Water crumbles as we speak and water companies seek bill increases of 40%, despite such poor performance across the country, does he really think that having a commission is necessary, given the urgent need for action?
We have a fragmented, under-resourced and under-powered regulatory system, which allows powerful water companies to play regulators off against each other while our constituents pay the price.
Is the solution not obvious?
As the Liberal Democrats propose, we should create a new, unified and far more powerful clean water authority.
Does the Secretary of State share my deep concern that the current regulator has to give 25 years’ notice in order to strip a water company of its licence for environmental failure?
Will he ensure that this ludicrous protection for failing companies should be replaced by a six-month period of notice instead?
We are already more than 5% of the way through this Parliament, and this issue is one of our constituents’ most pressing concerns.
Do we have to drag our heels like this?
