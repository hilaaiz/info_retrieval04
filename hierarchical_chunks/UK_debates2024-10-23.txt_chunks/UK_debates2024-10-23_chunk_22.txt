I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and welcome him to his place.
When this Government took office, we promised the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation—a new deal for working people.
We said that we would introduce a Bill within the first 100 days, and we have kept that promise.
This is a Labour Government led by working people for working people.
