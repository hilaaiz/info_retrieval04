Friend is right to raise the issue of the skills gap and economic inactivity in Northern Ireland.
I have met wonderful skills providers across Northern Ireland, such as the Rural Women’s Network, Bolster Community, the Superstars Club, Disability Action Northern Ireland, Ulster University and the King’s Trust.

A reliable, bespoke skills offering is essential to futureproof Northern Ireland’s key growth sectors.
