Shropshire’s farmers have been suffering from flooding following 18 months of incredibly wet weather, topped off last Wednesday by a month’s worth of rain in 24 hours.
They were not eligible for the farming recovery fund, and a freedom of information request by  found that only £2.1 million of that £50 million has been handed out to farmers.
Will the Government consider extending the eligibility of that scheme so that we can keep farmers going when they are deluged by floodwater?
I am really sorry to  hear the plight of Shropshire farmers.
We inherited the flood defence programme in disrepair, and thanks to  14 years of mismanagement and failure, communities are unprotected and families and businesses are  forced to pay the price.
We launched a flood defence taskforce to turbocharge the delivery and co-ordination of flood defences, and we are investing £1.5 billion  this year to scale up flooding national resilience.
I  will ensure that the hon.
Lady gets a meeting with  the Minister.[Official Report,  21 November 2024 ; Vol. 757, c. 4WC.]
(Correction)
The Government have delivered on their manifesto commitment to introduce the Employment Rights Bill.
It includes a historic fair pay agreement for care workers, which will benefit all those who care for older and disabled adults such as those in my constituency.
Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that care workers deserve pay and conditions that match the amazing work they do to support our loved ones to have a fulfilling life?
