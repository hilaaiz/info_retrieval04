I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for her answer.
We stand ready, as a party of constructive opposition, to work with the Government to fix our social care system.
However, a measure that could make it harder for us to keep the carers that we so desperately need would be an increase in employers’ national insurance contributions.
Were that measure to go ahead, it would affect millions of small businesses, including 18,000 small care providers.
Will the Deputy Prime Minister assure the House that nothing in the Budget will make it harder for vulnerable people to access the care workers and the care that they desperately need?
