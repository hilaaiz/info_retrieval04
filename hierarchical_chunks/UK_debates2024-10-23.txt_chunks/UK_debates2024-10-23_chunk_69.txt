The Secretary of State is quite right to point to the role of the payment of bonuses and dividends in bringing us to this point, but he must surely acknowledge that that is far from being the whole story.
There are a number of business and accounting practices in companies such as Thames Water that have brought us to the stage we are at today.
If he is serious about having a water system that is fit for the future, he has to understand properly what has gone on before.
Will he therefore confirm that the commission will be properly resourced with the necessary forensic accounting resource, so that those who have been responsible for the most egregious practices in the past and who now seem to be appearing in other water companies around the country will not be allowed to do the same thing there?
