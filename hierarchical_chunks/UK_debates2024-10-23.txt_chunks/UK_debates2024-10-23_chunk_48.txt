I welcome the hon.
Member to his place.
He is right to advocate for small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy.
This Government are turning the page on the relationship with Europe, reinvigorating alliances and forging new partnerships rather than reopening the divisions of the past.
We will improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade.
That will not involve rejoining the single market and customs union or introducing freedom of movement, but we will make that relationship better.
