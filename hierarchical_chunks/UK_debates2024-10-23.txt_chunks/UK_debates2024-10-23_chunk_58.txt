Fourteen years in opposition—and this is what the Labour party has to offer.
Labour Members have had more than a decade to craft a clear package of policies, listen to campaigners and prepare to govern, yet what they have brought to the House today illustrates no sign of any ambition.
This is a sign of hesitation.
It is a way to delay the difficult decisions and buy themselves more time.
It is part of a growing trend that unfortunately we are seeing consistently from this new Labour Government, across all Departments: announce a review, a taskforce and yet another commission, and hope the public do not notice that really they never had much of a plan at all.
That approach is simply not going to wash with the bill payers.
Before the election, the Secretary of State toured the country with campaigners like Feargal Sharkey, promising radical change to the sector.
He is now in power, and what has he actually achieved so far?
He spent the entire election campaign telling voters that he wanted to put water company bosses in the dock, but we can see from the Government’s announcements on the Water (Special Measures)
Bill that it will achieve no such thing, as campaigners and industry experts have already pointed out.
Nor will the Bill provide any reassurance whatever for investors.
Rather marvellously, the Secretary of State has managed not only to frustrate campaigners, but to disenfranchise investors from any long-term aspirations to invest in the sector.
