This Labour Government were elected—[Interruption.]
Order.
Dr Evans, you have got a sore neck; I wish a little that it was your throat.
Tory Members do not like to hear it, but this Labour Government were elected to end the Tory chaos, and that is exactly what we are doing, with £600 more in the pockets of insecure workers, 30,000 new dads given paternity leave and 10 million working people better off.
