The Secretary of State acknowledges that the announced review will make no recommendations that affect the current price review ’24 process, meaning that there will be no chance of the Government considering making any significant change until 2029 at the earliest.
Will he provide an outline of the timeframe associated with actual recommendations from the review being implemented and put in place?
When is any real benefit from this further review, taskforce or commission likely to be experienced, not only for the water industry, in terms of infrastructure improvements, but for the bill payer and the environment?
It seems to me that the Secretary of  State is just kicking the can down the road with another review, another taskforce and another commission, and removing himself from any of the tough decisions.
