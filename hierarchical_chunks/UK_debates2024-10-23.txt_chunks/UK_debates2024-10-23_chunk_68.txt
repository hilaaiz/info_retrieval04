My hon.
Friend alludes to an important point.
Rivers and water catchments are no respecters of boundaries, and it is important that we have a model that works within catchments, including where they cross boundaries, as they do in some cases between  England and Wales.
The review has been jointly commissioned by the UK and Welsh Governments, and it will jointly report to both Governments.
It will seek a better model for structuring and supporting our water sector, so that we can ensure that we clean up all our rivers, all our lakes and all our seas; so that the public can get back to enjoying them; and so that we can bring in the investment to support the infrastructure, which will be delivered at pace, to drive economic growth in every single part of the United Kingdom.
We come to the Chair of the Select Committee.
