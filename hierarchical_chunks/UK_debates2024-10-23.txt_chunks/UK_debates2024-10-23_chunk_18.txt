The Secretary of State is of course right that policing in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter, but national security is not.
If we look at policing numbers right now, which are at an all-time low, we are reminded that his party’s manifesto made explicit commitments to improving public services in Northern Ireland.
Will the Government commit to ensuring that policing in Northern Ireland is sufficient to keep the people of Northern Ireland safe and maintain national security, and to protecting the additional security funding of £32 million a year that comes direct from His Majesty’s Treasury?
On the latter point, the hon.
Gentleman just has to wait a week to see what the Budget produces.
I simply say to him that the PSNI, the security services   and others do an outstanding job in protecting the people of Northern Ireland from terrorist threats, and we should all support them in that endeavour.
