The Minister talks about growth, but the Mid South West region growth deal, which was paused by this Government, now lies inactive with no direction, and there are reports that much-needed private sector business involvement is now withdrawing.
Will the Minister accept that this Government’s handling and pausing of these growth deals was haphazard?
Will she apologise to the people affected and enter urgent direct talks with businesses to get this deal back off the ground?
