I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this serious and important issue.
The humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is dire.
We need an immediate ceasefire, much more aid allowed to flow in and an immediate release of all the hostages.
We have suspended UK export licences to Israel for items that might be used in the current conflict.
The Government have concluded that there is a clear risk that items exported to Israel might be used in serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza.
That does not change our position of steadfast support for Israel’s security, but we will always do so in a manner consistent with our obligations under domestic and international law.
