Ms. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the outstanding service of Mia Rodriguez, my intern who served with distinction in my office and dedicated her time to serving the people of Florida's 24th Congressional District.
Mia is currently a student at Florida International University where her focus is on International Relations and Political Science.
She also has served with distinction on FIU's Student Government Association as Chief Justice.
I am proud to say that Mia has shown great dedication and has devoted her time in my office to diving deep into the legislative process, particularly when it comes to foreign affairs and trade policy.
Mia's eagerness to learn and excel will always be remembered.
I wish Mia all the best as she continues her academic journey of which I am certain will be filled with much success.
On behalf of Florida's 24th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mia Rodriguez for her commitment and service.
