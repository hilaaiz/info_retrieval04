Whereas Commissioner Williams accomplished the approval of digital libraries in District 2, which in turn brought more support to the Summer Youth Employment Program that he started.

These funds support every aspect of the effort to combat addiction, from early intervention to recovery support services and the treatment Whereas the commissioners' progress on public service infrastructure, from the Northern Wayne County Library, to Fremont Elementary school, adds to the quality of life in Wayne County and contributes to the delivery of essential support for all constituents.
Whereas the increased allocation for public schools in this year's budget, including expansion of the School Resource Officer program is critical to ensuring safe and accessible public education.
