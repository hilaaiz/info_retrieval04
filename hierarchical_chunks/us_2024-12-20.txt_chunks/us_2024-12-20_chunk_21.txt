car crash and then providing critical medical care.
Of equal importance, this program also pays tribute to those ambulance service personnel whose heroic acts or community service activities may not have made the news, but were just as meaningful to the people they aided.
They are truly America's health care safety net.
I am especially proud of the five Stars of Life from Oregon being recognized this year who serve Oregonians with pride.
They are Aubree Arneson, Jorge Garcia, Jason Hodges, Don Marr and Joe Scott.
I had the opportunity to meet with Jorge Garcia with Umpqua Valley Ambulance from Roseburg, Oregon today and can tell you he is a fIrst-class EMS professional who deeply cares about his community and his patients.
