Ms. CLARKE.
Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the Mo Better Jaguars of Brownsville, Brooklyn, who capped off an undefeated season by overcoming their opponent 13-7 in the national Pop Warner Super Bowl in Orlando.
Truly, these exceptional young men have defied all the odds and proven precisely what Brooklyn is capable of.
While the team's skill, cohesion, and passion were never in question throughout their sensational season, when challenges brought upon by high travel costs arose that would have prevented the Jaguars from competing for the D2 Title, their community stepped in.
Through their support, the team succeeded in raising the funds they needed to reach the championship game, where they ultimately prevailed.
I extend my sincerest congratulations to every player, coach, family, and fan whose collective efforts led the Mo Better Jaguars to their well-deserved victory.
Our community is incredibly proud of their achievements and their dedication, and we look forward to watching their athletic careers continue as they reach new and exciting triumphs.
