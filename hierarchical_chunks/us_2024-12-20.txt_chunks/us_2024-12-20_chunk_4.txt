without cell service, power, or any way to contact the outside world as trees fell and landslides washed away their houses, neighbors, and family members.
Tony's community of Fairview saw historic levels of flooding and suffered from catastrophic damage.
During the confusion, Tony did what he was trained to do and what he spent his life doing--helping save others.
While Tony worked with his nephew Brandon Ruppe to rescue neighbors during a landslide, a second landslide occurred and both Tony and Brandon tragically passed away from their injuries.
I offer my deepest condolences to the Garrison family.
I will continue to keep them and their loved ones in my thoughts and prayers.
Tony is a hero and will be remembered for his lifetime of service.
