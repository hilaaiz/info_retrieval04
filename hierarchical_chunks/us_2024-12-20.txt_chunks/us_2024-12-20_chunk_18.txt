Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small business in my district that is an important part of the Sugar Hill community: Polly's Pancake Parlor.
Since it was opened in 1938 by Willfred and Pauline ``Polly'' Taylor, Polly's pancakes has served up some of the lightest, fluffiest pancakes in New England, attracting visitors from across the Nation.
Beyond serving excellent food, Polly's helped popularize maple syrup as a sweetener, contributing to the success of New Hampshire's worldrenowned maple syrup industry.
What truly makes Polly's standout is the generous hospitality.
When you visit Polly's, you're treated like a member of the family.
That is why I have relished the opportunity to bring my family and friends to Polly's both before and during my time in Congress.
Polly's is an important part of the fabric of the White Mountains community, and I am proud to recognize this outstanding business.
