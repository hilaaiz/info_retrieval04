Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor Battalion Chief Tony R. Garrison who was killed in the line of duty on September 27 when Tropical Storm Helene hit Western North Carolina.
Tony was a native of Western North Carolina and by every account, Tony was a great man.
Known for his outgoing personality and compassionate nature, Tony enjoyed woodworking, fishing, and most of all, spending time with his family.
Tony leaves behind the love of his life and wife of 28 years, Mary Chantelle Garrison, his daughter Hannah, and his son Dylan.
I would like to extend my appreciation for the work he accomplished during his time with the U.S. Forest Service, as a volunteer with the Garren Creek Fire Department, member of the Buncombe County Task Force, and as an instructor at A-B Tech in Asheville.
Tony dedicated his life to serving others and protecting his neighbors.
As a Battalion Chief with the Fairview Volunteer Fire Department, Tony was used to running towards danger when others would run away.
Friday, September 27 was a day of confusion and destruction in Western North Carolina.
Helene made landfall Thursday night and by Friday morning millions of people were left
