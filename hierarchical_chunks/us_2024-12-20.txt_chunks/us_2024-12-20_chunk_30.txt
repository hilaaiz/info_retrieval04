Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Council President Jay Dunham, who will retire at the end of this month after an extraordinary 14 years of faithful and dedicated service as a councilman in Jefferson Township.
Council President Dunham's commitment to public service is rooted in a distinguished career that spans multiple industries and an unwavering dedication to his community.
For 33 years, he worked for Verizon, and he later served as the manager of the Mount Paul Retreat Center in Jefferson prior to its sale, where he was in charge of a complex that included a 68-room main building, a large lake, a dam, and a cemetery.
A veteran of the Vietnam War, Council President Dunham has continued to advocate tirelessly for his fellow servicemembers.
He is a past commander and current quartermaster for VFW Post 564, as well as a past commander and current chaplain of American Legion Post 423.
His leadership in these roles reflects his enduring dedication to his fellow servicemembers who answered our Nation's call to service.
He has been an active member of the Milton First Aid Squad, the Jefferson Township Historical Society, and the St. Thomas Church finance committee.
Additionally, he is a founding member of the Jefferson Township Veterans' Memorial Committee and has contributed his time to civic organizations such as Jefferson Highlights and the Jefferson Arts Committee.
Council President Dunham's lifelong dedication to service and his leadership, vision, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of our community has left an indelible mark on Jefferson Township.
I want to express my gratitude to Council President Dunham for his decades of service and for the countless ways he has enriched the lives of others, and I wish him the best for a well-earned and restful retirement.
