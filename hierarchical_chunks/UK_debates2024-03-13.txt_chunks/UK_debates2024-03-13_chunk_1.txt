The Secretary of State was asked— What recent discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on the cost of living in Wales.
What recent discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer on supporting rural areas in Wales with the cost of living.
What recent assessment he has made of the impact of increases in the cost of living on people in Wales.
The UK Government fully recognise the challenges posed by cost of living pressures as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which is why we have provided £96 billion since 2022 to support households and individuals across the United Kingdom —an average of about £3,400 per household.
