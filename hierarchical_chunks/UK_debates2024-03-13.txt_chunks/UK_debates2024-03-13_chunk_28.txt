I welcome the announcement today.
It is pure common sense.
When the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, we need security of supply.
Although we need to deal with climate change in the medium to long term, we must also deal with security of supply in the short term, so I welcome the announcement.
Does the Minister agree that for medium and longer-term security of supply, we must upscale what we are doing in the hydrogen sector, with more hydrogen production and usage, and be a world leader in hydrogen?
For the moment, we are slipping behind a bit.
