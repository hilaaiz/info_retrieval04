I do agree with my hon.
Friend.
The point is to have a wide range of back-up capacity, but not to use it very much with fossil fuels, and, as I think has long been the case, to ensure that any new gas generation should be carbon capture-ready.
We look forward to it being hydrogen-ready, too.
We are in a very similar position to Germany and other countries that are looking at exactly that.
For instance, I think both Germany and Ireland, as part of their growth in renewables, recognise the need for gas, albeit used less and less, to ensure that the lights stay on and there is appropriate insurance in place.
