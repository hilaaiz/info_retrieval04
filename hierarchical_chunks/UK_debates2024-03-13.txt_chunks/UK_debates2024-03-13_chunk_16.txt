I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the improvement in maternity services at the Royal Cornwall.
She is a tireless campaigner on reducing baby loss, and I commend her for her recent work on the introduction of baby loss certificates.
As she knows, we are committed to a new women and children’s hospital for her local trust in 2030, as part of the new hospital programme.
