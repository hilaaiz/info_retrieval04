My constituents in Somerton and Frome, working together with the Langport Transport Group, submitted a robust  strategic business case to the Government in July 2022 for the reopening of a train station in the Somerton and Langport area.
Such a train station would connect over 50,000 people to the rail network, boost the local economy and support local people to reduce their reliance on cars.
Almost two years on, they are still waiting for a response.
Does the Prime Minister support this project, and can he provide confidence to my constituents that their hard work to drive this vital project forward has not been futile?
Conservatives in the south-west are rightly championing the reopening of local stations.
Cullompton and Wellington will be among the places that receive funding as a result of our decision on HS2.
It is because of that decision that we have now freed up billions of pounds of funding to invest in local transport across the country, and local leaders will be put in charge of that money to prioritise their local needs.

Prime Minister, in the 1930s, one of your less illustrious predecessors, Neville Chamberlain, so denuded the British armed forces of funding, until it was too late, that we failed to deter Adolf Hitler, and 50 million people tragically died in the second world war.
Russia has invaded Ukraine, China is threatening Taiwan, and British shipping is being attacked by Houthis in the Red sea.
Could you please assure me, as the son of a D-day veteran, and the House of Commons that we are not going to forget the lessons of history and make the same mistake again?
