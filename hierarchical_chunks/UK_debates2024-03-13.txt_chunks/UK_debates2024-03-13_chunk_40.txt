I thank the Business and Trade Committee,  which recently published a report that includes some recommendations for the Government regarding Horizon redress.
We will respond to them in the usual way, but today I would like to address two of the Committee’s recommendations.
The first is that responsibility for redress should not lie with the Post Office, as it should be subject to independent oversight—something that has also been recommended to us by the Horizon compensation advisory board.
I can announce today that the Department for Business and Trade, rather than the Post Office, will be responsible for the delivery of redress for overturned convictions.
Final decisions on redress will be made by independent panels or independent individuals.
