I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I suggested, on different scenarios, about 1% or 2% of total generation coming from gas in future, compared with 38% in 2022, on an annualised basis.
Clearly, as the hon.
Gentleman should know better than anybody here with his deep knowledge of the subject, it is based on intermittency.
It depends on how much the sun shines and how much the wind blows, but we will ensure we have a robust system.
That is exactly what we are doing.
I would love it if people could celebrate this country’s global leadership and the fact that we are driving this forward, especially those such as members of the Green party, who are supposed to care about climate change.
We are doing this in a way that maintains security of supply and, by bringing in more and more renewables, with the lowest-cost and most flexible system to back it up, doing so in a more and more economical fashion.
