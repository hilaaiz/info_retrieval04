I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the issue and for the conversation I had with him.
I extend my sympathies to all those who have been affected.
I will of course ensure that he can meet the Secretary of State to discuss his Bill.
We are, as I committed to him, looking at the issue in some detail to ensure that our policies are providing the support that is needed.
