Thank you, Mr Speaker—tapadh leibh.
It is concerning that this was announced in Chatham House and not here in the House, and that the Secretary of State is not here today.
Off-piste speeches have cost in the past.
My Committee heard this morning that an Energy Minister made a speech a decade ago that, with the effect it had on investment, cost 1,000 jobs.
The Minister says that this is a consultation, but have the  Government picked a winner?
What room have they given for storage to be in the mix?
Are they confusing energy security—we have learned from the Ukraine war important how that is—with continual electricity supply?
Given what the Minister says about the percentage of gas used by 2030 and after, what percentage of capacity will this provide, and what percentage does he envisage will be used day to day?
What thought has been given to consideration of other technologies in his gigawatt demand?
