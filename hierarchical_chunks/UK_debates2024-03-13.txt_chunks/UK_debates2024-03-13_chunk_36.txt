I thank the Minister for all his answers.
While there is certainly an urge to prioritise our net zero promises, I am grateful to the Government for taking back-up precautions into consideration.
As the Minister has often recognised in responding to questions from me, Northern Ireland plays an important role in our contribution to meeting the net zero targets.
Will he therefore ensure that Northern Ireland is prioritised as a leading location for any new gas-powered stations that are to be built?
