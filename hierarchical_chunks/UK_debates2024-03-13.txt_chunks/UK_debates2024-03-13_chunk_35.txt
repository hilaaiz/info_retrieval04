The Minister said earlier that we faced a climate challenge, after struggling for words to describe what we are facing.
Why can the Government not join the global consensus and admit that what we are facing is a climate emergency?
As the Secretary-General of the United Nations has said, the year of climate warming is over and we are in an era of climate burning.
Unlike the hon.
Gentleman, I am not primarily concerned with words—I am primarily concerned with action—but in fact I did use the “emergency” word.
I do not know whether I broke some golden rule which says that Ministers should not use it, but I do treat this as an emergency.
I see the world warming up, I see the negative impacts of climate change, and that is why I spend every single day feeling proud to be part of the Department that is decarbonising its country faster than any other in the world.
The hon.
Gentleman should get away from rhetoric and start to focus on action.
