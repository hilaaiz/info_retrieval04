I welcome the announcement.
The independent Committee On Climate Change recognises that we will need unabated gas in the electricity market right up until 2035 and beyond, and more widely that even in 2050, 25% of our energy needs will come from hydrocarbons.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that this is exactly the right way to maintain lower energy production costs, while still meeting our net zero targets?
