The hon.
Gentleman sometimes gives the impression that he would like me to be running the energy system in Northern Ireland, but it is devolved—and we have Ministers there again, which is a cause for celebration.
I will work closely with Ministers in Northern Ireland, as I do with Ministers in other devolved Administrations, because if we are to meet our net zero targets, Northern Ireland must deliver its own targets.
Scotland has to deliver its targets, as does Wales.
We must work together, in a spirit of collaboration.
We can do that, and if the hon.
Gentleman can persuade his right hon.
Friend  the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) , who is sitting beside him, that it can be done in a way that strengthens our economy as well, we really will have something to celebrate.
