On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
This is a statement on Post Office legislation.
May I respectfully say that what the hon.
Lady is saying is irrelevant to this statement?
The shadow Minister will be moving on.
I will move on.
I simply hope that the Minister will reflect on the reversal of the statement he gave this morning, in which he took the position that he would take a donation from that donor.
I hope he reflects on the impact that the issue is having on many of us.
I turn to today’s crucial statement.
The Horizon scandal is truly shocking, and is one of the most devastating miscarriages of justice in British history.
The scandal has brought devastation to the lives of hundreds of falsely convicted sub-postmasters.
Over 20 years on, they and their families still suffer from the consequences and the trauma of all that they have been put through.
I pay tribute to them for their determination in pursuing justice, and to Alan Bates and the sub-postmasters who pioneered the campaign and worked tirelessly to seek justice.
Without their bravery and perseverance, the campaign would not be where it is today.
I also pay tribute to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)  for all his work, to Lord Arbuthnot for his campaigning on this issue for many years, to others in this House and the other House, and to members of the Business and Trade Committee and its Chair, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Liam Byrne) .
