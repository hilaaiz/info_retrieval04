Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the men's volleyball team from the University of California, Los Angeles.
They took home the 2024 NCAA Men's National Collegiate Volleyball Championship on the 4th State University, Long Beach at Walter Pyramid on the campus of Long Beach State in Long Beach, California.
This year's championship brought home the team's 21st national title win, cementing their record as the winningest program in NCAA history.
The win marks UCLA's 122nd overall NCAA title across all sports.
These are truly remarkable achievements.
The men's volleyball team should be proud of their achievement in earning the distinction of being back-to-back national champions, amongst the more than half a million student-athletes who participate in NCAA events each year.
With guidance from Coach John Speraw, who secured his fifth NCAA men's volleyball title as a collegiate head coach, UCLA ended their season with wins in 15 out of their last 16 matches.
I would like to sincerely congratulate the UCLA's men's volleyball team once again on winning its second consecutive national championship and wish them the best of luck next season.
This win is a special moment in the collegiate athletic careers of each player and marks an exceptional accomplishment and historical achievement for the UCLA community.
Go Bruins.
U-C-L-A. Fight.
Fight.
Fight.
