Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Quint Avenetti, of Rockwall, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Quint has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community and country.
Quint was born in Hayden, Arizona, in 1962.
He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1980 and participated in active service for nearly three decades.
From providing security to several U.S. Embassies around the world to being deployed during the Gulf War and Global War on Terrorism, Quint served with distinction and merit.
He specialized in Joint Targeting, Geodesy, Counterfire Radar, Artillery Operations, and Fire Support.
As a result of his exceptional leadership and expertise, Quint achieved the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 5.
After retiring from the military in March 2008, Quint moved to Rockwall with his family.
He currently serves as the Vice President of the Combat Systems Sector for Navmar Applied Science Corp.
In this role, Quint works diligently to train the next generation of Marine Joint Fire Observers, enhance security at diplomatic locations for the State Department, and develop unmanned aircraft technology.
In addition to his work in protecting our national security, he serves on the Advisory Board for Veterans Mortgage of America to help veterans succeed in home ownership.
Quint is the Commandant of the CWO2 James Randolph Detachment of the Marine Corps League and is involved with many veterans' advocacy organizations.
He also serves as a mentor to Eagle Scouts and was the previous Scoutmaster of Rockwall Troop 989.
I am proud of Quint's contributions to our community, and I am sure he will continue to make a positive impact on the world around us for many years to come.
It is an honor to bestow Quint with the Patriot Award for his exceptional service to our Nation and the people.
