Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our guest chaplain, Pastor David Mason, for his opening prayer on May 10th.
I've had the pleasure of knowing David for quite some time, as he serves as Pastor at my home church, Walnut Valley Baptist in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
David and his wife, Aamie, who serves as a family counselor, are dear friends of mine who have a heart for sharing the gospel and ministering not only inside the church building but in the community with individuals wherever there is a need.
David and Aamie have been faithful servants and leaders for many years.
It was a pleasure to host them in D.C. this week.
I, along with others in Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District, are grateful to Pastor Mason and his wife Aamie for their servant hearts and their obedience in serving God.
