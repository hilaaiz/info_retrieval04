Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bernie Ricke for all that he has done for the people.
Together we have been through the thick and thin of life, surviving the tough times by breaking bread at his famous garage parties.
We wish him all best in retirement, though we know he will still be working hard to support the UAW and his Detroit community in whatever ways he can.
I thank Bernie.
