Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Victoria Quine for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
Victoria has overcome many challenges along her journey to success, demonstrating perseverance at every step.
Students who strive to make the most of their education, like Victoria, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Victoria's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Sobesky Academy and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Victoria Quine on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
