Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Metra Commuter Railroad as it celebrates its 40th anniversary.
Whereas, for the past 40 years, Metra has dedicated itself to providing my constituents and other Illinoisans with reliable, affordable transportation options to connect them to greater Chicagoland; Whereas, on February 15, 2022, Metra approved its second strategic plan, My Metra, Our Future.
While the name indicates a transportation plan, the motto My Metra also illustrates the ethos of the agency; Whereas, Metra is not solely a transportation provider.
It is an essential and reliable service that is there when you need it.
To get you and your loved ones' home, and everywhere else, safely and comfortably.
It is about meeting its riders' expectations and understanding their values and priorities for the region;
Whereas, My Metra was adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic--to ensure that trains kept running.
Metra provided valuable services to essential workers in the healthcare field and other sectors who didn't have the option to work from home or take leave.
Metra's own employees are part continuity and connection, and a vital cog in economic and social life in Illinois; and
