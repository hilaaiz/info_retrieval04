Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of David Biggs as he retires from his role as City Manager.
David has brought a deep understanding of urban development to his work as City Manager.
After earning a degree in political science from California State University, Fullerton, he went on to earn his MBA from University.
For the last ten years of his career, David has served as city manager of two cities in the East Bay, first in Hercules starting in 2014 and later in Orinda, beginning in 2021.
During his time as City Manager of Orinda, he has worked tirelessly to serve our community, from his role in making Juneteenth an official holiday to his work to enhance Orinda's downtown area.
David's hard work has helped to increase quality of life and foster a vibrant community throughout the city.
Further, David has been a leader in improving Orinda's roads, helping to improve connectivity throughout the city.
He was instrumental in the continuation of this long-term project, which began in 2012, and his efforts improved the city's Pavement Condition Index (PCI) score from one of the lowest in the region to the second highest in the Bay Area.
In recognition of his service, David was also awarded the 2020 Local Government Service Award by the International City/County Management Association (ICMA), an accolade he certainly earned for his years of dedicated service to the people of Orinda and the East Bay.
Please join me in congratulating David Biggs on his well-deserved retirement after years of outstanding public service.
