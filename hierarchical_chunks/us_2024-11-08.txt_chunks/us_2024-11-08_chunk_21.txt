Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recall and recognize the recipients of a special annual salute to honor local Veterans of the 26th Congressional District.
Starting in 2005, I have had the privilege of honoring distinguished Veterans of my district with Texas' 26th Congressional District Veteran Commendation.
Our nation's Veterans have selflessly and honorably served our country and preserved our freedoms.
It is because of their service that we enjoy all the liberties we are afforded.
These brave men and women deserve our thanks and praise.
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to publicly recognize eighty-six Veterans over the past two decades and honor their service through the presentation of the Congressional Veteran Commendation (CVC) at the annual ``Salute Our Veterans'' luncheon sponsored by the Highland Village Business Association (HVBA) and the City of Highland Village, Texas.
At this patriotic event each year, in addition to the announcement of the CVC recipients, each Veteran in attendance is afforded the opportunity to give their name and branch of service along with a highlight of their military service.
With an annual attendance of over 250, the HVBA graciously covers the cost of the luncheon for attending Veterans and their guest.
As I retire from the U.S. House of Representatives, allow me to announce the five recipients of the 2024 Congressional Veteran Commendation and add their names to the illustrious list of prior recipients.
