Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor Rich Allen, a distinguished military veteran and the longest tenured employee at Lansing Community College.
Rich Allen's life exemplifies dedication to both education and service.
His story is one of unwavering commitment to his country and to higher education.
Born on June 11, 1945 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Rich moved with his family to Michigan in the 1950s.
He grew up in Michigan and graduated from Chelsea High School in 1963.
After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cleary University, Rich chose to enlist in the U.S. Army in 1967 during the height of the Vietnam War.
He served with the Army Security Agency, a predecessor of today's National Security Agency, which was tasked with electronic intelligence and warfare.
Agency operators played a critical role in intercepting and decoding enemy radio transmissions to provide vital intelligence to American forces.
As a Morse Intercept Operator, Rich underwent rigorous training, mastering Morse code.
In 1968, he was deployed to Vietnam stationed at the 303rd Radio Research Battalion, an undercover unit for Army Security Agency operators.
Rich performed critical tasks such as tracking enemy radio transmissions and triangulating positions to support military operations.
His work, which often included helicopter reconnaissance to gather frontline intelligence, was crucial to the war effort, coordinating intelligence that informed artillery and airstrikes.
Rich's distinguished service earned him numerous commendations, including the Bronze Star Medal with an Oak Leaf Cluster, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal, all recognizing his technical expertise and steadfast commitment.
After his honorable discharge in 1971, Rich returned to Michigan and enrolled at Lansing Community College, marking the beginning of a 50year career.
While pursuing a degree in computer programming, he began as a student programmer in 1973 and soon transitioned to a full-time position in the Information Technology Department, where he helped advance the college's technological capabilities.
From writing code on punch cards and using early computer systems to developing the college's first online system in 1975, his work laid the foundation for modern IT practices at Lansing Community College.
Over his tenure spanning more than five decades, Rich Allen has served under seven college presidents and held various job titles, adapting to each new wave of technology.
His expertise and collaborative spirit has helped countless colleagues, earning him deep respect within the Lansing community.
Rich's legacy is marked not only by his military service and professional accomplishments but also by his dedication to his family.
He finds joy in spending time with his son and grandchildren, fishing, camping, and gardening--a testament to living a well-rounded life.
It is with profound respect and gratitude that I recognize his service.
