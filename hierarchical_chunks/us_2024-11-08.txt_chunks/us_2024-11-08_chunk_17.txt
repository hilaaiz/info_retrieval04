Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of New Hampshire's Deputy Adjutant General, Warren Perry, who is retiring later this year.
For nine years, Warren has diligently served New Hampshire's Department of Military Affairs and Veterans Services.
In his role, he has played a key part in connecting military officials with the needs of New Hampshire and ensuring our veterans are receiving the support that they need.
Warren served our country for 28 years in the United States Army, and for that we are incredibly thankful.
He is a veteran of Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom where he fought to keep the United States safe from foreign threats.
In service to his fellow Granite Staters, when he returned home, Warren went on to serve as the State Inspector General for the New Hampshire National Guard.
Beyond national security, Warren has tirelessly served our communities on a local level.
As Deputy Adjutant General, Warren has worked to strengthen the New Hampshire Veteran-Friendly Business Program and increase veterans' employment with our local businesses as they return from combat.
As a decorated soldier, Warren has been awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, and many other distinguished honors.
As a community leader, Warren has aided our veterans in their employment efforts.
And as a proud member of a military family, Warren knows the meaning of service and has always strived to give back to his community.
Warren has dedicated his life to the security of our Nation and the betterment of our communities.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I thank Deputy Adjutant General Warren Perry for his service and wish him a happy retirement.
I wish Warren and his family all the best in the years to come.
