Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Fairfax County History Commission on the occasion of the 20th Annual Fairfax County History Conference.
Since 1969, the Fairfax County History Commission has worked to identify, document, record and preserve the history of our region.
There are few areas in the country that are as rich in history as our area is.
The History Conference provides an opportunity to reflect on the accomplishments of the past year while recognizing our neighbors who have made significant contributions to preserving and promoting our local history.
Through the dedicated efforts of the History Commission and its many volunteers, we are assured that our history will not be lost and will be available for future generations.
This year, a number of dedicated individuals are being honored for their commitment to the preservation and education of history.
I am proud to include in the Record their names: Dr. Glenn Fatzinger received the Lifetime Achievement Award for his career as a distinguished historian and educator.
Tom Shoop received the Nan Netherton Award for his book, ILDA, that brings to life the stories and history of a small, interracial enterprising village in Fairfax County.
Etta Wilson, Rita Colbelt, Linneall Naylor, and Rondia Prescott with Jenee Lindner received the Cultural Engagement Heritage Award for their book, Black Communities of Fairfax -- A History, that serves as an anthology of Fairfax County's rich Black Heritage.
Gibran Parvez received the Edith Moore Sprouse Award for the creation of his website, Heritage Dulles, that is an interactive online map and historical essay allowing readers to explore the area within and around Dulles Airport over multiple time periods.
Dr. Krystyn Moon, Kristin Neun, Dr. Matt Bakker, and Janine Dewitt received the Beth Mitchell Award for their website, Documenting Exclusion & Resilience, that examines the racial dynamics among property owners in Northern Virginia and Fairfax County.
