Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable constituent from my district, Fred Powell, as he approaches his 103rd birthday in May 2025.
With over a century of life experiences, Fred's journey is one of service, dedication, and community that deserves recognition.
After his honorable discharge from the Army, Fred joined the family business, Powell's Electric Shop, which was founded in 1922 by his father and great-uncle.
What began as a small appliance store on York Road in Hatboro grew over the decades into a full-service electrical company serving Bucks and Montgomery counties.
Fred took the reins of the business in the 1950s, working alongside his father until he eventually purchased the business and expanded it further.
Fred's dedication to Powell's Electric Shop laid the foundation for the company's success, and in 1990, after nearly 40 years of leadership, he passed the torch to his son Doug, continuing the Powell family legacy into its third generation.
Today, Powell's Electric Shop remains a trusted family-owned business, with Doug at the helm, continuing to provide excellent service to the community.
In his retirement, Fred enjoys spending time with his children and grandchildren.
He remains an active member of his community, attending resident meetings and participating in social events at The Manor at York Town.
Fred also stays connected with friends and neighbors through various programs and classes at the Manor.
As we celebrate Fred Powell's incredible life over 100 years, we honor his service to our country, his contributions to the success of his family business, and his unwavering commitment to his community.
Fred's legacy is one of hard work, dedication, and an enduring love for his family and friends.
We are deeply grateful for his many contributions and wish him continued health and happiness in the years to come.
