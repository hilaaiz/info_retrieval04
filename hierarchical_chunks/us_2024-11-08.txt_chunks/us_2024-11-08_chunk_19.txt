Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Southlake resident Ashley Burnett.
Last year, Ashley found out her father, Todd, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a progressive and fatal neuromuscular disease.
Ashley has been working to raise awareness and funds for ALS research ever since.
Over the summer, which marked the 10-year anniversary of the original ice bucket challenge to raise money for ALS research, Ashley hosted her own ice bucket challenge at Hawaiian Falls Waterpark in honor of her dad.
In Ashley's own words, ``With a disease that is full of the unknown and often feels so hopeless, raising money through this event gives my family back a little bit of that hope.''
Through her efforts, Ashley is helping those living with ALS, and their loved ones; tackle the physical, emotional, and financial toll that comes from the devastating disease.
Her challenge raised over $15,000 for ALS research.
I'd like to thank Ashley for her efforts to support those living with ALS.
She is an inspiration to North Texans and a beacon of hope to those suffering from the disease.
