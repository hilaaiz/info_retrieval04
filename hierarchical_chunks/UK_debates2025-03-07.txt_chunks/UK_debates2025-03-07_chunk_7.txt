I thank my hon.
Friend for the national debate he has stimulated about this; we should all be grateful to him for that.
I wondered what advice was already available to parents from the national health service, particularly in Scotland.
I could find no guidance on screen time on the NHS Scotland website.
On the website for my health board, NHS Lothian, I found guidance for parents with the very youngest children.
In Glasgow—which is Scotland’s second city, I have to stress; it does not even have a castle—the health board offers guidance that dates from 2016.
Things have moved on since then, and surely parents deserve to have the very latest guidance when it comes to considering this matter.
