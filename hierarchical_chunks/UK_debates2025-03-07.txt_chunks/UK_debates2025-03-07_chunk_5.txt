I thank the hon.
Gentleman for this important Bill and the way in which he is presenting it.
This week, in the education centre at Michael Hall school, I met A-level  students who were very concerned about the addictive nature of what they are seeing.
They absolutely want to see action.
I applaud him for listening to UK Youth, Girlguiding and others who feel exactly the same.
They want action now.
All power to him—we need to push the Government for change, because a year or three months in childhood is a long time for that addiction to grow and not be challenged.
