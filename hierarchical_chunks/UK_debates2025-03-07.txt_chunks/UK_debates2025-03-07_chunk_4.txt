Alarm bells on the question of data and consent are already ringing.
Just this week, the Information Commissioner announced an investigation into how TikTok uses the personal information of 13 to 17-year-olds in order to make recommendations to them.
Changing the digital age of consent would give parents more control over who accesses their children’s data, and it would dumb down the powerful algorithms that feed children addictive content.
I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on introducing the Bill in the way he has and on becoming a Parliamentary Private Secretary.
Does he support the Bill going into Committee?
I think there is consensus across the House that it should be given its Second Reading.
If it is not given its Second Reading, however, it will not go into Committee and we will not be able to discuss in further detail the points that he is making.
The hon.
Member is, of course, a connoisseur of private Members’ Bills and has been known not to be keen to see many of them make it to Committee.
I am sure he will not mind me gently making the point that I am here today, as so many Members are, to make a difference and ensure that the Government take action.
The Bill also commits the Government to instruct the UK chief medical officer to update and reissue guidance for parents and professionals about the impact of excessive screen time and social media use on children.
It is nearly six years since that guidance was last issued, and we have seen the positive impact of recent guidance elsewhere, such as in America where the Surgeon General advice has stated more recently: “social media has not been proved safe” and that “Children and adolescents who spend more than 3 hours a day on social media face double the risk of mental health problems including experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety.”
That advice led to calls in the US for cigarette packet-style health warnings on social media websites.
