I thank my hon.
Friend for that important question.
Most countries landed on the age of 13 as a result of a protracted negotiation in the US Senate about data and online safety many years ago.
That policy was not based on evidence; it was based on the compromise of a committee in another country.
We must base such decisions on evidence, and there was no firm evidence for picking 13 over any other age.
