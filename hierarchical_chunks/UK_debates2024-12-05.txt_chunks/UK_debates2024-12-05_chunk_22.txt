Earlier this week, I introduced a ten-minute rule Bill to bring in proportional representation for Westminster elections and English local elections.
I was delighted that it passed a Division of the House.
It was supported by Labour Members, as it reflected Labour party policy on this matter.
Now that it is the express will of the House that my Bill gets a Second Reading, will the Secretary of State commit to giving the Bill Government time so that it can be fully debated?
I hate to do this as we are approaching the festive season, but I am afraid that I will have to disappoint the hon.
Lady.
We have no plans to change the electoral system, and I cannot give her the Government time that she requires.
We owe a great debt of gratitude to our exceptional public servants who have given their lives to serve our nation.
Can the Minister update the House on what progress has been made in establishing the Elizabeth Emblem to commemorate former firefighters, police officers and other public servants who have died in public service?
