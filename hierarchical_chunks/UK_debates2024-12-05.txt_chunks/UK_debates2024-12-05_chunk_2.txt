I welcome the BSIP investment announced recently by the Government, and I look forward to hearing more from the Minister about plans to allow more local areas to have a smoother path to franchising.
I am keen for the Minister to look carefully at transport governance.
London and Greater Manchester, which have franchising already, have also historically had alignment of transport powers, resources and capacity all in one centralised place.
Passenger transport executives and their equivalents can accelerate the delivery of transport plans and play a crucial role in unlocking regional economic growth.
For 50 years, such structures have benefited from much higher levels of control and co-ordination of buses.
They also benefit from running over a much more logical functional economic geography.
