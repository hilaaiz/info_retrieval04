I am delighted to give Christmas greetings to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and I am sure that most of us in the House feel a great deal of respect for him.
As the Prime Minister knew he was appointing a convicted fraudster to the Cabinet, was it not incumbent on him to tell the propriety and ethics team?
If I can slip a second question in, Mr Speaker, will the right hon.
Gentleman, who is committed to and leads in the Government on transparency and openness, all of which have been promised, undertake—notwithstanding the fact that he has not looked at these declarations—to find out and let the House know whether she declared it to the House?
As I said to  the hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Alex Burghart)  a few moments ago, all Secretaries of State give their declaration to the propriety and ethics team upon appointment.
The matter was concluded last Friday with the Transport Secretary’s resignation.
She has been replaced by a new Secretary of State, and she set out her reasons for resigning in her resignation letter.
If the right hon.
Member has not had a copy, I am quite happy to make it available to him.
