It is a pleasure to face the right hon.
Gentleman across the Dispatch Box for what I believe is the first time.
I am pleased to see three members of the Cabinet on the Front Bench—it is quite right that the Cabinet Office should be so well reflected.
The day after he entered Downing Street, the Prime Minister pledged to personally chair each mission delivery board to drive through change.
We now hear that he is not chairing each mission delivery board.
Why has the Prime Minister broken his pledge?
Let me begin by welcoming the hon.
Gentleman to his position; I look forward to our exchanges.
He is also the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, so I hope his party leader will be giving him a Christmas bonus for productivity and hard work—he will certainly deserve it.
