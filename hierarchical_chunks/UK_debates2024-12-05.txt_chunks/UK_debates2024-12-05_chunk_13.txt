I welcome the hon.
Member to their place and look forward to meeting them across the Dispatch Box.
Unfortunately, the last Government left this country in a terrible place, with public services in crisis.
I was previously a council leader, and every single day I saw the absolute strain on our public services.
People were waiting up to 12 hours for ambulances, which sometimes did not turn up.
We have had to take action to invest in our public services in order to deliver growth.
Through our procurement regime, we are already taking action to support SMEs, to ensure that money is not lost and to ensure that suppliers are paid quickly.
I will set out more to the House in February—
