All Cabinet Ministers have an interview and make declarations to the propriety and ethics team before they are appointed to the Government.
I am aware of what I told the propriety and ethics team before my appointment, but I do not look through the declarations from every other Minister.
The previous Conservative Government exposed themselves to unprecedented levels of corruption and cronyism when delivering contracts during the pandemic.
Recent analysis has shown that £1 in every £3 spent went on high-risk contracts, worth more than £15 billion.
What steps are the Government taking to ensure that they are always making procurement decisions that are in the public interest, avoiding unmanaged and unmitigated conflicts?
What will they do to ensure that taxpayers’ money is always spent wisely?
My hon.
Friend is right to raise that point.
Earlier this week, the Chancellor announced the appointment of Tom Hayhoe as the covid counter-fraud commissioner.
The new commissioner will leave no stone unturned to investigate the unacceptable waste and fraud during the pandemic and to make sure that we learn lessons for the future.
