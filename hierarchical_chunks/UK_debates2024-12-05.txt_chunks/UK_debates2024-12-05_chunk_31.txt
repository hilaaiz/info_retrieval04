I welcome the Government’s commitment to the infected blood compensation scheme, and everybody in the House and across the country is pleased to see it.
As of this month, how many individuals have registered for infected blood compensation payments, and can the Minister provide an update for the delivery of compensation in 2025?
I would be pleased to get those figures for the United Kingdom, but in particular for Northern Ireland.
