The families of DS Ross Hunt and PC George Taylor, who were murdered in the line of duty in 1976 and 1983, were recently awarded the Elizabeth Emblem, following a campaign by myself and others.
But due to administrative errors, the police officers did not receive the George Cross.
Can a Cabinet Minister meet with me to discuss this issue so that their bravery is recognised as well as their death?
