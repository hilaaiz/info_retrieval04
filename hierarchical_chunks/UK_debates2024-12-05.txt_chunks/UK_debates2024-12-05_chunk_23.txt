I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
We must never forget those who have given their lives to  protect others in the line of duty.
Last month, the Government announced the first recipients of the Elizabeth Emblem.
The next of kin of more than 30 former firefighters, police officers and other public servants who have died in public service received the award in recognition of their deceased loved ones.
Although families will never be able to replace their loved ones, the Elizabeth Emblem pays tribute to the sacrifice they made, and I know that the whole House will support this award.
