Outside such areas, transport powers are held in many different places, and they require a number of organisations to independently agree reforms to enact change.
That can mean, for example, that bus stops, which are surely the window to the soul of buses, can be owned by an organisation with no say in how the bus service itself is run.
In many places in the country, highways and transport powers are split.
We perhaps  need more passenger transport executives, although the Urban Transport Group advises that the last passenger transport executive was established so long ago—not quite so long ago as when a Labour MP last represented Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard—that the mechanics around establishing a new one are unclear.
In any case, we need governance that is fit for the 21st century, with the right delegated functions being granted to a passenger transport executive or equivalent, and the establishment of an executive function to speed up decision making and delivery that makes the difference.
It needs to be based on a geography that reflects travel patterns as well as wider social and economic geographies, and which gives a large enough base to raise farebox income.
On geography, I argue that there need to be possibilities to franchise in areas larger than local transport authorities.
Given that franchising is not entirely a silver bullet, I urge the Minister to look at the geography of enhanced partnerships as well.
It is only one bus, but the F70, which travels from Luton to Milton Keynes via Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, goes through three separate enhanced partnership areas.
Finally, I thank Grant Palmer, Arriva and First, which have invited me aboard their buses recently, and Dawsongroup for bringing a double-decker bus just outside Parliament for Catch the Bus Month, which many hon.
Members from across the House came to support.
It is my belief, really, that every month should be Catch the Bus Month.
I urge all hon.
Members to get on board and back our local buses all year round.
