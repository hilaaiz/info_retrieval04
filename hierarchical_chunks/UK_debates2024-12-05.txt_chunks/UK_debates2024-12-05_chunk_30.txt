In relation to my hon.
Friend’s second point, it is right that the Church of England looks very carefully now at its procedures in the light of what has happened and been brought forward.
In relation to the duty of candour, I have no idea why the Opposition Front Benchers were laughing about that.
It is a hugely important reform that we are bringing forward, and it will make a significant difference across public service.
We will have public servants putting the public interest above their own personal reputations and above the reputation of institutions.
I hope the Opposition Front Benchers will come to support and help with the leadership required for that step change—that culture change—across public service.
The Golden Valley development adjacent to GCHQ in Cheltenham will pay a vital role in our nation’s cyber-security.
The recent confirmation of £20 million from the Government for that development is welcome, but will the Secretary of State confirm that the project will continue to feature in future iterations of the national cyber strategy?
The best thing to do when it comes to a specific place is for me to look into the exact situation and come back to the hon.
Member.
I assure him, as I have said several times during this session, that cyber-security is extremely important to the Government.
It is not just the Government’s job; cyber-security has to be taken seriously by business and the whole of society.
That is why we have the National Cyber Security Centre giving advice to bodies of all kinds to ensure that they are defended as well as possible.
