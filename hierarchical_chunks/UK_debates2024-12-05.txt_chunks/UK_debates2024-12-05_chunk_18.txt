Was the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team informed by Downing Street of the former Transport Secretary’s conviction before she was appointed as a Minister of the Crown?
The former Transport Secretary had exchanges with the Prime Minister last week, which have resulted in her resigning from the post.
She set out her reasons for her resignation in that letter.
We now have a new Transport Secretary, who has already made an excellent start in the job.
