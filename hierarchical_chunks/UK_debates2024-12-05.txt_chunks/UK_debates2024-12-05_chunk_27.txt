I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and for the time she spent with me last week setting out the opportunities of procurement and the needs of her community in Darlington.
We have heard from the whole House today how important it is to back small and medium- sized enterprises that have roots in communities, and we are determined that the new national policy procurement statement will do that.
