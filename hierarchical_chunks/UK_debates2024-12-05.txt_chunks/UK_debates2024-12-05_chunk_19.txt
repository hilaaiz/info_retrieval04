I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for restating what is already known.
Obviously, it is a matter of public interest whether the propriety and ethics team had been informed before the right hon.
Lady was made Transport Secretary.
I ask him again: will he confirm whether the PET was informed by Downing Street of the former Transport Secretary’s conviction before she was appointed a Minister of the Crown?
