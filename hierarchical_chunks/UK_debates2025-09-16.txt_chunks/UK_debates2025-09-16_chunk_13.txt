My constituent Louise reported her sexual assault to the police back in 2021.
She has had court dates pushed back twice and the trial is now expected in December 2026, nearly six years after reporting it to the police.
What assessment has the Minister made of the impact of such delays on victim-survivors, who are also witnesses, and of the impact on the quality of the eventual court case?
