I thank my hon.
Friend for that important question.
She is a tireless advocate for all victims of violence against women and girls.
She will know that this Government are committed to supporting those victims in court through measures such as section 28, the witness service and our victim liaison officers.
To further support victims, the Ministry of Justice also funds support services such as independent sexual violence advocates and independent domestic violence advocates.
We are also committed to introducing free, independent legal advisers for victims of adult rape across England and Wales, and I hope to announce more on that measure soon.
