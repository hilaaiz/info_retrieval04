I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his point of order.
I have had no indication that Ministers intend to come to the House to make a statement on this matter, but he has certainly put the point on the record.
I know that many other Members are concerned.
I will look to the Government to bring forward a statement on our immediate return to the House.
If not, I am quite sure that others will, on our return, look to place before me a request for an urgent question.
