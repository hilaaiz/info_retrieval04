I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his announcement on the Hillsborough law.
For decades, the families have carried the weight of injustice, and Governments have failed to act.
Today, the Hillsborough law will be laid before this House, but it must not be another false start.
Will the Deputy Prime Minister promise me that this Bill will be the Hillsborough law, and that it will emerge stronger and not weaker from Parliament and, finally, deliver justice for the 97?
