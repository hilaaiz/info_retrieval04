I thank the Minister for his response and welcome him to his place.
We have a prison population crisis, but rather than building or releasing our way out of it, we have to reduce reoffending.
I recently visited HMP Bure in my constituency and saw the excellent work it has been doing internally to support prisoners in learning new skills and equipping them for life after release.
Will the Minister assure me that the Government will support and provide funding for such programmes?
Will he meet me to hear more about the fantastic work of the staff at HMP Bure?
