I thank the hon.
Member for that really important question.
All my thoughts are with Louise and, sadly, so many like her who are waiting for justice.
We know that justice delayed is justice denied.
That is why we asked Sir Brian Leveson to conduct the once-in-a-generation reform of our criminal courts system: to ensure that we have a criminal justice system fit for the future, which breaks down the backlog on our court cases so that victims such as Louise are no longer waiting for justice.
