I am sure that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to the murdered prison officer Lenny Scott, whose killer was found guilty and sentenced over the recess.
It is hard to overstate the seriousness of the case: this was a prison officer murdered simply for doing his job.
Like police officers, we ask prison officers every day to stand up to some of the most violent people in our society.
Does the new Lord Chancellor agree that prison officers deserve the same legal protections as police officers?
The work that our prison officers do is incredible.
The work that our prison governors do is incredible.
Over the course of both my career in law and my career in the House, I have visited very many prisons,  and I pay tribute to their work.
I will certainly be looking closely at this issue.
I hope to come forward with more announcements in the coming days.
I am sure that prison officers will welcome any future announcements that the Lord Chancellor makes.
We have talked this morning about preventive measures we can take to ensure prison officer safety, but police officers benefit from legal protections in terms of the consequences for murdering them, with mandatory whole-life orders imposed on people who do that.
The Opposition will table an amendment to the Sentencing Bill that would give the same protection to prison officers.
I think they deserve it, and I would welcome his support for that measure.
It is a serious issue and I will certainly consider it.
I know that the Law Commission is looking at similar provisions.
What steps he is taking to support rehabilitative programmes in prisons.
Welcome, Minister.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
This Government are committed to tackling the root causes of reoffending.
That means investing in services that turn offenders away from a life of crime and instead back on the straight and narrow.
That includes services in employment, accommodation and substance misuse treatment.
