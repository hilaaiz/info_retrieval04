My right hon.
Friend rightly says that the Government are recruiting new probation officers to fulfil the new responsibilities under the Sentencing Bill and to deal with early release.
The BBC recently reported, however, a shortage of 10,000 probation officers.
How are we going to fill that gap?
The Probation Service is absolutely essential to the strategy that he is rightly following now.
My hon.
Friend and I did a lot of work together while the Probation Service was decimated by a badly botched privatisation that ruined such an incredible service.
He is right that we will need to recruit more officers.
The £700 million that we found is essential, and I will be looking closely at the allocations over the coming months.
I wish to pay tribute to the probation officers in Northern Ireland, who do an excellent job.
I have met them many times, and they are magnificent.
On many occasions they have to deal with young people who, due to peer pressure, find themselves influenced to do things that they normally would not do.
Restorative justice is one way to try to make things better.
Is there a direct strategy within Government to ensure that restorative justice is used to rehabilitate young people and give them the chance of a better life?
The hon.
Gentleman brings a lot of experience to these issues.
What he reflects on is an issue faced in constituencies like mine.
I hope he will contribute to the debate on the Sentencing Bill later today.
