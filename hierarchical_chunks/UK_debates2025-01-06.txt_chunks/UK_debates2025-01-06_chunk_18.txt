I thank the veterans Minister for his answer.
In previous questions in this Chamber I have suggested to the Minister that he might wish to visit Beyond the Battlefield, a charity in my  constituency that gives the only care for soldiers whenever they have fallen on bad times.
Will the Minister make time available to come and see what we do with that charity in Portavogie and Strangford as an example for everyone else?
