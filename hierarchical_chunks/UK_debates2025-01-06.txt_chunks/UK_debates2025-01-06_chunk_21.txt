I thank my hon.
Friend for his service.
It is absolutely vital that the voices of armed forces personnel and their families are listened to more.
That is why we are establishing in the commissioner an independent champion for armed forces and their families.
The commissioner will have an independent role, be able to scrutinise the actions of the armed forces and report to Parliament rather than to Ministers, and will not be beholden to the whims of either any Government of the day or the chain of command.
That independence will allow the commissioner to scrutinise general service welfare matters, shining a spotlight on the issues that really matter to those who serve in uniform and their families.
