I thank my hon.
Friends for raising an exceptionally important matter.
The deal to sell off most of our service family accommodation in 1996, then rent it back and upgrade it, is probably one of the worst deals I can think of.
The recent Annington homes deal, supported by those on both sides of the House, was delivered at speed by this Government, and it saves this country and the taxpayer £600,000 a day, or £230 million a year.
It puts us back in the driving seat of owning all our family accommodation.
It allows us to renovate or rebuild as required over the next five to 10 years and long into the future.
In the medium to long term, we have a once-in-a-generation, lifetime opportunity to rebuild all our accommodation.
