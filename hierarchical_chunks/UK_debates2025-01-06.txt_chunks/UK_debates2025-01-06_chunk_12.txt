I welcome this Government’s quick action to deliver on our promise to veterans of making veteran ID cards an accepted form of voter ID, which rightly ensures access to elections for those who have served to protect our freedoms.
Will the Minister work with colleagues across government to ensure that veterans are made aware of that very important change?
