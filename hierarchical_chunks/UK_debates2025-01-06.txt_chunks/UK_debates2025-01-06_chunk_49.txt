I welcome the consensual parts of the Secretary of State’s statement, but I wonder whether we have been entirely honest with the public about the sheer unaffordability of the cap proposed by Dilnot.
I do not absolve my own Government from this: maybe we should start telling the truth to the public.
Does the Secretary of State think we need a new social compact on bringing in social insurance so that people can plan for their entire life?
They would know that they will have to pay more in taxes during their life for their old age, but at least they would have certain rights.
