I thank the hon.
and learned Member for his important question.
First, we must get the armed forces covenant into law, which should cover a large proportion of the veteran support mechanism.
I congratulate David Johnstone on taking up his post; I phoned him just before the Christmas recess.
I am excited and looking forward to working with him and ensuring that the unique attributes of veterans in Northern Ireland are accounted for and represented in the correct manner.
