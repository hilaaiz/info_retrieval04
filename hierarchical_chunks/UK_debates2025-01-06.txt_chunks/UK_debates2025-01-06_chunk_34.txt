The Prime Minister has made it clear that ensuring that veterans and their families can access support—including for housing—is a priority; he mentioned that in his speech at party conference.
He has also announced that veterans will be exempt from the local connection test for social housing in England, and committed an additional £3.5 million to continuing the reducing veteran homelessness programme, including Op Fortitude.
The transition from military to civilian life is a critical moment for many veterans, but too often, those with complex mental health issues fall through the cracks, especially when it comes to accessing housing.
The armed forces covenant is an excellent positive step forward, but its voluntary nature means that not all veterans will benefit equally.
Will the Minister  commit to reviewing the transition process, and particularly mental health services provision, to ensure that all veterans receive more comprehensive and tailored support?
The career transition pathway that has just been set up is a great example of how we are helping those leaving the services to transition into civilian life.
Op Courage, in particular, has had more than 35,000 referrals; it is for anybody with mental health issues caused by their service.
I recommend going on to gov.uk and looking at the services available, as they are pretty ample.
The defence sector provides well paid jobs across my city and constituency, and across the country.
With 10,000 adults in the constituency on the minimum wage, will the Minister help me to work with the Department for Education to ensure that kids in my city get opportunities to work in this brilliant sector?
