My hon.
Friend is right in general terms: Russian aggression is not simply confined to Ukraine, and we all saw what happened on Christmas day.
We are deeply concerned about the damage and sabotage to undersea cables.
I can confirm to the House that for the first time the joint expeditionary force—the JEF—has activated an advanced UK-led reaction system to track potential threats to undersea infrastructure and to monitor the movements of the Russian shadow fleet.
That will be run out of the standing joint force headquarters at Northwood.
