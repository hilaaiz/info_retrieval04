I thank the hon.
Member for raising that point, and congratulate the people he has mentioned on signing up to the covenant duty, which is superb.
They join about 12,400 others who have given their signatures, which is a fantastic example of British society standing up to support veterans.
In due course, I would like to visit and meet them when we get a chance.
