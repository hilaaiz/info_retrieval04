Later this week I am going to Scotland, and we will do Wales and then Northern Ireland in due course, and when I visit I would be honoured to come to see the good work the charity is doing.
What progress he has made on appointing an independent armed forces commissioner.
This Labour Government are delivering for defence and the landmark Armed Forces Commissioner Bill is the first step in renewing the nation’s contract with those who serve.
The commissioner will be appointed following the passage of the primary legislation establishing the role.
The Bill passed Committee stage in the Commons in December and I look forward to Report stage in due course.
