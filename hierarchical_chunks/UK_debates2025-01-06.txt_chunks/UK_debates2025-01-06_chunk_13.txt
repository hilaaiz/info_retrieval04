It took us four months from starting the process to getting the veteran ID card recognised as voter ID, which is superb.
We will move this matter forward, and I would love to discuss it in more detail.
I highlight that it is not only a physical ID card: we now also have a digital card, which is increasing veterans’ ability to register with all the different services available.
Will the Minister join me in congratulating East Riding of Yorkshire council on achieving the armed forces covenant employer recognition scheme gold award, and pay tribute to both the council leader Anne Handley and our armed forces champion Councillor Liam Dealtry for their roles in achieving that?
Could he also tell the House what he is doing to encourage more organisations to achieve this highest standard in veterans’ support?
