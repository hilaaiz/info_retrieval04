I congratulate the Minister for Veterans and People,  the hon.
and gallant Member for Birmingham Selly Oak
(Al Carns) , on receiving a distinguished service order—we are all proud of him.
The Government have tied the announcement of their timetable for 2.5% to the publication of the strategic defence review, so we need it to be published as soon as possible.
Will the Secretary of State clarify why he has pushed back the SDR’s publication in Parliament from the spring to the summer?
I have not done that.
The work of the reviewers leading the strategic defence review is thorough and flat out.
The review has been widely contributed to and is the first of its kind in this country, allowing fresh thinking in defence planning.
On the 2.5% commitment, as we said in the plan for change, we will set out a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence in the spring.
The Government are delivering on defence and defence reform; we will deliver on defence funding, too.
