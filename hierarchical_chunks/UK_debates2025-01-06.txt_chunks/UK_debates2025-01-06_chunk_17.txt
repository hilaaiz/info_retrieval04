Maggie Haynes is the founder of Tuppenny Barn, a horticultural therapy charity in my constituency, and she is a veteran herself.
She established a female veterans course after observing that the challenges faced by women leaving the armed forces combined with poor communication from the MOD was leaving them unaware of the services available to them.
What is the Minister doing to improve support for female veterans?
We are working on our armed forces strategy, part of which will be a specific section for female veterans.
We understand the nuances and difficulties of female veterans leaving service and trying to find employment or linking employment with family life and so forth, so we are pushing that forward really hard.
Again, I would be very pleased to discuss that with the hon.
Member in due course.
