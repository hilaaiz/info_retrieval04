I associate myself and my party with the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister in calling for de-escalation in the middle east, the release of hostages and urgent aid to get into Gaza.
We Liberal Democrats oppose the Government’s cut to personal independence payments and carer’s allowance.
With a growing rebellion on the Government Benches, the Government may be forced to push these cuts through with the support of the official Opposition.
The Deputy Prime Minister knows that some of those affected are still waiting for justice after the carer’s allowance scandal saw thousands of innocent carers hounded for repayments.
Can the Deputy Prime Minister give a cast-iron guarantee that if these cuts are pursued, at the very least, not a  single person will lose a penny until the carer’s allowance scandal review has been completed and the recommendations have been implemented?
