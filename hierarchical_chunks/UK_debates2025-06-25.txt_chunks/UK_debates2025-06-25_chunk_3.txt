My hon.
Friend asked what our bus reform and £1 billion investment was meant to achieve.
We introduced the new £3 fare cap on single bus fares in England outside London, which has had the cap for a long time, ensuring that millions of people have access to affordable fares and better opportunities to both go to college and work and to see friends and family.
With UK SHORE, we have moved fast with the decarbonisation plan, and the research and development funding for this will continue.
We have worked internationally with the International Maritime Organisation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across our planet.
We have also announced £185 million through safer roads funds to invest in the 99 most risky A roads, and we have made clear commitments on rail cost base and subsidy.

Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Wendy Morton) , the former Rail Minister, is a doughty champion for Aldridge station—well done to her for that.
The money was reallocated by the current mayor to cover the costs of schemes implemented by the former mayor that did not have the funding.
She also talked about buses; I have already mentioned the £1 billion that we have invested in better buses.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Bradford East (Imran Hussain) , who cannot be in his seat at the moment, is an astonishing champion for Bradford.
May I pay tribute to him and to Councillor Susan Hinchcliffe, the leader of Bradford city council, for their work in this area?
The £2.1 billion train line and bus station investment is transformative.
Some £35 million of Government money will see an additional five daily services to London, and we will be making announcements in the next few weeks regarding Northern Powerhouse Rail and how important it is to connect the cities of Leeds, Bradford, Manchester and Liverpool.
