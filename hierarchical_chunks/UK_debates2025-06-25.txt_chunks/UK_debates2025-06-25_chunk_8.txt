I thank the shadow Secretary of State for his question.
The implementation is happening as set out and against the timeframe that was set out.
As I said, we are not only busy implementing the Act, but looking at all the gaps that exist in it because Ministers in his Government watered down the Bill as it went through the House.
We will review those gaps in the legislation and come forward with extra measures where they are needed.
