I thank the Minister for his answer.
I was going to say that having looked at the villages in my constituency on the mobile map, which was supposed to be updated this month, it is not up to date; it is good to hear that it will be.
Many of my constituents have to rely on the 3G network, which is being shut off.
We may be years away from getting high-speed broadband across the South Hams, so having access to a reliable 4G network is crucial.
Can the Minister tell me exactly how he is working with mobile phone providers to ensure that everyone has access to mobile voice and data coverage?
