I thank my hon.
Friend for his comments.
What we are talking about does not of course preclude any support for the Typhoon.
We are very committed to our Typhoons, and we are committed to upgrading them, as per our existing plans.
We are engaged in many efforts to export, and one would hope that some of them will come off at some point in the not-too-distant future.
