I am pleased that my hon.
Friend is supportive of the announcement.
As the House is aware, this Government have increased our defence spending by more than at any time since the end of the cold war.
The increase is fully funded, unlike some of the fantasy plans of the previous Government.
It is 2.4%—less than we spent.
We have shown how we will increase spending to 2.6% of GDP by 2027.
That is fully funded, and we have made clear how we will get to 3% in the next Parliament, as conditions allow.
The announcement was made today at NATO of a 5% target; all allies will focus on providing that funding in due course.
Over the next 10 years, NATO will check every year, as it always does, whether its requirements are being met, and we fully expect to be able to meet them.
