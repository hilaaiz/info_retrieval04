I thank the hon.
Member for her opening comments.
She knows that we have already taken steps on the carer’s allowance, and those steps will continue.
As she also knows, the welfare system is failing people.
Labour is the party of work, but we are also the party of fairness.
That is why our Bill will deliver the largest, permanent, real-terms increase to basic out-of-work support since the 1980s, invest in tailored employment support so people can try work safely, and ensure that those who can never work are properly supported.
