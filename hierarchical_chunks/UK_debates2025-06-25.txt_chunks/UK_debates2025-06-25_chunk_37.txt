I welcome the acquisition of the F-35As, not least for the impact it will have on industry and jobs in my constituency.
In answer to the question about refuelling, the Minister described very well how this new capability meshes with existing NATO capability.
Will she say a little more about how this capability supports the defence of not only the UK, but our NATO allies?
