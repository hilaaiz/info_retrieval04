The Minister just confirmed that the UK adheres to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
That treaty requires the declared nuclear-armed states not to allow proliferation and to take steps towards nuclear disarmament.
What the Minister has announced today is an increase in nuclear capability, with the construction of new nuclear warheads that can obviously be used anywhere in the world by airdropping them.
Can she explain how it is possible to say that this announcement is in compliance with the NPT when it is so obviously and clearly the very opposite of that?
The right hon.
Gentleman is wrong, I am afraid.
It is in compliance with the non-proliferation treaty.
The NATO nuclear mission would carry US nuclear weapons, which are already subject to the non-proliferation treaty.
What we are announcing today is the buying of aircraft that are capable of assisting with that mission, not the purchasing of new nuclear weapons.
I hope that is clear for the right hon.
Gentleman.
Clearly, the aim is to enhance what NATO has as a defensive structure, so will the Minister confirm that this is not a substitute for any of our other NATO allies withdrawing aircraft from service, and that we are adding to the potential cover against threat in case we are attacked?
We are adding some of our capability to the NATO nuclear mission by purchasing these weapons, which has been welcomed by our allies and by the NATO Secretary-General as improving the position for the NATO nuclear mission.
