I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his service.
He is absolutely right—our armed forces represent the very best of Britain, and put their lives on the line for us every day.
It is our responsibility to support those who defend us, so we are delivering the biggest sustained boost to defence spending since the end of the cold war.
The strategic defence review sets out our vision for defence, driving jobs and prosperity and renewing the nation’s contract with those who serve to secure Britain into the future.
