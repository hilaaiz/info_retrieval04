I thank the Chair of the Transport Committee for her speech.
She asked me a number of questions about when we will publish the outcome delivery plan.
This will be done by all Departments, co-ordinated through the Cabinet Office, later this year.
She asked about subsidiarity, and what happens if mayors do not use the money and new powers we have given them on the things that we want to do, citing active travel as an example.
Even with subsidiarity, mayors have to deliver against Government outcomes and objectives, and we hope to work with them in a spirit of co-operation to ensure that that is done right.
