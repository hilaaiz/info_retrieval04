May I begin by congratulating  the hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West (Dame Chi Onwurah)  on her well- deserved honour in the King’s birthday honours?
I hope the whole House will agree that it is a fitting and well-deserved honour for her expertise and service to the House.
Protecting children online should be a top priority for every Government, and that is why the Conservatives passed the Online Safety Act to give this Government all the sweeping powers they need to act, but when the  Minister was asked in Parliament why implementation under Labour was so slow, she said that implementation must be “as proofed against judicial review as possible.”—[Official

Why is she more concerned about protecting herself and the Government than about protecting children?
It was the hon.
Gentleman’s party that dragged its feet in bringing forward the legislation and that watered it down.
We are busy trying to implement the Act as it was set out in the guidance.
While the Act is not perfect, we will see a huge step change.
Where there are issues and gaps, we are not afraid to act.
It was my party that passed the Online Safety Act; it is the Minister’s party that is failing our children.
Ian Russell, who set up the Molly Rose Foundation following the tragic death of his daughter, says that Britain is now “going backwards” when it comes to protecting our children online.
The Government are being timid when they should be bold.
Their priorities are wrong, and legal caution is trumping children’s safety.
Why is the Minister still defending this Government’s track record of total failure?
