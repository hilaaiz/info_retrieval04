The Minister is well aware of my interest in the F-35 programme.
Lockheed Martin manufactures around 150 jets a year, and there are nearly 600 on order by everyone from Switzerland to Singapore.
On top of that, there are 1,200 still to be delivered to the US air force, so whereabouts are we in the queue?
She mentioned that we would expect the first deliveries before the end of decade, but are we cutting to the front of the line?
Given that the orders from some allies are not due to be fulfilled until 2032, will delivery of all 12 planes be completed within a decade?
On refuelling, will she clarify that we have no sovereign air-to-air refuelling capability outside of a NATO mission?
I know that the hon.
Gentleman has a very close interest in these matters because I have to answer all his parliamentary questions, and I welcome that interest.
As the Secretary of State said this morning, we hope that we can start receiving delivery of these planes before the end of the decade.
The hon.
Gentleman is right that any manufacturing capability has queues, but orders are subject to contractual discussions and arrangements can be made, so that is what we are aiming for.
Obviously, we will keep the House informed of how we get on.
