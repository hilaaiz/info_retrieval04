Yes.
I have been reminded of my promise to visit; that is on the list, and the visit will move closer to the top of the list after today.
I agree with my hon.
Friend.
If we are to deter potential aggressors and adversaries, it is key that we implement the findings of the SDR and increase our capability, and that is what we are doing.
May I encourage the Government not to be at all bashful about the fact that the decision on whether one of these weapons will be used—heaven forbid—will be an American one?
There is a long tradition of American nuclear weapons being based in NATO countries, not least the Cruise and Pershing missiles of the 1980s, which helped to end the cold war.
Will the Minister confirm that not only does this fill a gap in our deterrence spectrum, but it reasserts the commitment of the United States to the defence of the other NATO countries?
The right hon.
Gentleman is correct that the decision does all those things, and he has made a very good point.
