My hon.
Friend is correct.
In addition to the industrial benefits that we ought to glean from increasing the F-35 order, it is absolutely right that it strengthens NATO.
That is what the strategic defence review said that we should focus on, and NATO first is what we are doing.
Rejoining the NATO nuclear mission is a striking commitment.
We accepted the recommendation to make that commitment and we are now implementing it.
I also welcome this announcement, but can we talk about money?
We already know that 20% of our defence budget is spent on the nuclear deterrent.
It is disproportionately  expensive.
If we are now extending the nuclear capability with these airdrop weapons, what impact will that have on the budget for the rest of our conventional armed forces?
