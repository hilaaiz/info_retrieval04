I welcome the announcement and, on behalf of the Defence Committee, I welcome the additional detail that has been added to the SDR.
It is imperative that we recognise and close some of the gaps in our national defence, including the size and shape of our combat air force, and this announcement does part of that.
But 14 years of under-investment mean that some of the choices about basing and complementary capabilities will bring some challenges; will the Minister provide additional detail on how some of them may be addressed?
