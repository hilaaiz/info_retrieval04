For clarity, I did not say that this order was in addition to our already committed tranche of F-35s.
I said that we were substituting what would have been 12 F-35Bs with 12 F-35As, so it is not in addition.
We already have 39, and we have already purchased 48, not all of which have been delivered.
This is a tranche of the next 27, 12 of which will be F-35As and 15 of which will be F-35Bs.
It is part of acquiring the next tranche of F-35s that Governments of all stripes have been committed to over the time that the F-35 has been in production.
I am sure the Minister recognises that in addition to this plan to diversify the deterrent launch method, the UK must ensure that our strategic CASD enterprise has an effective and productive industrial base, delivering faster maintenance times.
Can she therefore confirm whether these aircraft will be budgeted from the ringfenced Defence Nuclear Enterprise budget?
The ringfenced Defence Nuclear Enterprise budget is not for purchasing aircraft; it is for dealing with our submarines.
It is a fair question—I hope that that is a clear answer.
