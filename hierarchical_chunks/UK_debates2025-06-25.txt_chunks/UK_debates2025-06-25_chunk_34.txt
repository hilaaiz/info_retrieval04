I agree very much with both points.
The decision indicates the strength of our alliance with the US, as well as the growing strength of NATO.
I do not understand industrially or militarily why the F-35 is the default choice.
If the F-35 can be delivered only by the end of the decade, why is Tempest, which is more than capable of being delivered by the mid-2030s, not being considered?
That is if we agree with the decision to be part of the nuclear sharing enterprise, and I do not agree with that, because no other nuclear-armed state takes part in nuclear sharing, no other P5 member delivers any other nation’s nuclear deterrent, and no nuclear power in the world delivers anyone else’s nuclear weapons.
I hear what the hon.
Gentleman says.
We are committed to buying 138 F-35s in the next tranche of F-35s.
We have substituted 12 F-35As for what would have been 12 F-35Bs, so there is that change to the mix, as recommended in the strategic defence review.
One of the recommendations was that we should  consider the mix, and we have considered it.
Another was that we should rejoin the NATO nuclear mission; we have considered that and consulted, and we are acting.
We have already implemented two of the major recommendations of the SDR.
Given the welcome that the SDR had from Members around the House, we should all be glad to see the implementation of those recommendations.
