I thank the Minister for her statement.
Following the announcement of the purchase of these 12 F-35As, I have read concerns expressed by defence analysts this morning over the size of this fleet and whether it truly represents either a capable offensive launch or, indeed, a capable deterrent.
In earlier statements, I think the Minister has said both that these F-35s are part of the current F-35 purchase envelope and, potentially, that these F-35s are in addition to those currently on order.
I would be grateful for clarification on that point.
Finally, could the Minister offer any reflection on the effect that this purchase will have on our commitment to GCAP?
