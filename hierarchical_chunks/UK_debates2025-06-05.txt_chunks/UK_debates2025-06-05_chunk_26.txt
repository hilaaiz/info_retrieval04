I know that the hon.
Member is frustrated and has worked really hard on this.
I express my deepest sympathies to the families of DS Hunt and PC Taylor.
I am sure she will agree that it is good that their families were awarded the Elizabeth Emblem by His Majesty in December, in recognition of the sacrifice they made.
Honours policy is not in the gift of Ministers; as I mentioned, it is set out by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals.
I recognise that she has written to the chair of the committee on this issue, and I am sure he will reply.
