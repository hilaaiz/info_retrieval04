I am delighted to have championed additional funding of more than £10 million for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust and over £1 million for Walsall Manor hospital for essential work and upgrades.
Let us contrast that to the Tories, who oversaw a backlog of maintenance and crumbling hospitals.
Will the Leader of the House meet me to continue championing safe, modern, future-fit facilities for patients and hard-working staff in Wolverhampton North East?
I am really pleased that the Government have ensured that the funding is there to provide the vital upgrades needed for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust.
My hon.
Friend is right that we inherited a hospital capital programme that was a work of fiction; there was not a penny allocated to many of the promises that had been made.
We have now set out a clear timetable with allocated funding so that her hospital and many others can get the improvements they desperately need.
The Leader of the House will be well aware that the global ocean treaty has still not had its passage through the House.
With the first ever ocean conference of the parties coming up quickly, next year, will she confirm when the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction agreement will be brought forward for ratification?
