I thank the hon.
Member for raising that issue.
As he knows, the agreement was laid before both Houses on  22 May , and under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act both Houses have 21 sitting days—running to  3 July —to scrutinise and lay, as he said, anything they want to on that.
We will ensure that the full CRaG process is followed at all times.
He will be aware that, in addition, we will introduce legislation to implement the agreement, and there will be ample time for the House to consider the Bill to ratify the treaty.
