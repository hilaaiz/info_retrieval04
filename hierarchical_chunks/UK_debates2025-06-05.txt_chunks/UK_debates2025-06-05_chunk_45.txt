I thank the hon.
Member for mentioning the delegation of Indian parliamentarians.
I was hoping to meet them myself, but I was unable to do so on this occasion, but I hope to do so in future.
He is right that our relationship with India is important, which is why this Government are so pleased that we have agreed an unprecedented trade deal with India.
There are also, as he says, security and other issues between India and Pakistan, and this House has been kept updated on those matters and I shall make sure that continues to be the case.
