I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that issue.
Along with other parliamentarians, I was pleased, but also moved, to watch the “Ocean with David Attenborough” documentary with David Attenborough in the House of Lords.
I can assure her that I and this Government were already resolved to ensure that that treaty was ratified and the Bill brought forward.
Having watched the documentary, I will ensure that we do that in a timely fashion.
