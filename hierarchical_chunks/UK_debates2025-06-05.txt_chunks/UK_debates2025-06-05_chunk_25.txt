I thank the Minister for her answer and for meeting me.
She knows that I have been supporting the families of PC Taylor and DS Hunt in the search for recognition of their bravery, which resulted in their deaths some years ago.
They cannot understand why there is a committee to consider historic military medals but not civilian ones.
It appears to them that one set of people who put themselves in harm’s way to protect our country can be recognised, but another set cannot.
I appreciate what the Minister said, but can we look at instituting an equal committee for civilian honours?
These families just want the proper recognition that historical administrative failures prevented them from receiving.
