The Minister for the Cabinet Office was asked— What steps he is taking to strengthen emergency preparedness.
The Government are taking a range of measures to strengthen our emergency preparedness.
Later this year, we will update a national pandemic response exercise and undertake a full test of our emergency alert system.
In April, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster also opened the new UK Resilience Academy, which will train up to 4,000 people a year.
The Government will shortly publish our updated resilience strategy.
We seem to get once-in-a-generation weather events once every couple of years these days.
Although some parties on the Opposition Benches do not want to take their responsibilities in that regard seriously, I know that this Government will.
On flooding, the village of King’s Bromley in my constituency has suffered on several occasions over the past few years, because all of the roads leading to the village have been cut off—although there has been no property flooding.
What steps is the Minister taking to measure and mitigate the impact of that type of serious flooding?
