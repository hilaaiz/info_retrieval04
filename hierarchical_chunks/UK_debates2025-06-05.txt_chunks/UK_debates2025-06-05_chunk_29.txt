I welcome the progress that is being made by IBCA.
Of course, the Minister is not directly responsible for how quickly that is rolling out.
I note that IBCA has announced that its plan is to prioritise those infected who are still alive; indeed, my constituent Daryn Craik was contacted last week.
I suggest that the Minister set up a metric that IBCA could agree to for the time between when people are contacted and when they receive their payment.
He could then report that interval back to the House, which would hold IBCA to account on the delivery for these infected people, who have suffered for too long.
