The hon.
Member is absolutely right.
The National Cyber Security Centre offers advice, guidance and tools such as Cyber Essentials to businesses to help them prepare as best they can for attacks.
Unfortunately, organised crime carries out some of these attacks, and the extortion of money is often at their root.
It is really important that Government, business and individuals prepare as best we can to act against the bad actors who are trying to explore cyber-vulnerabilities and often, as I said, extort money.
