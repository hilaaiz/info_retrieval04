The Minister has been commendably clear that the youth mobility scheme must be capped, and has made comparisons with agreements reached by the previous Government with countries such as Australia, Canada and Uruguay.
He will know that last year 9,750 youth mobility visas were issued to Australian nationals, 3,060 to Canadians and just 140 to Uruguayans.
Will he be equally clear in setting out what he thinks would be a reasonable level for that cap, or is it just a matter of whatever Brussels tells him he has to accept?
It certainly will not be; it will be subject to negotiation.
I genuinely welcome the Opposition’s support for a youth mobility scheme.
I think it came as a bit of a surprise to some of their Back Benchers in that debate, but none the less I welcome it.
What I have said—and this is what the wording of the common understanding sets out—is that it has to be balanced, capped and time-limited.
That is the negotiation we will take forward.
