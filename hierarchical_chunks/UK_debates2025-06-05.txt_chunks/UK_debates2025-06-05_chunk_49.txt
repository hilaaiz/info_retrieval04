I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
As he says, it was raised with me a few months ago, and I made it clear on that occasion what I hoped would happen.
I understand the concerns of Members across the House and of members of the Sikh community, many of whom he represents.
When I was asked about this issue previously, I did follow up, and I am sorry to say that I am still waiting.
When I do hear from the Foreign Office, I will ensure that my hon.
Friend and other Members are made fully aware and that the House is updated.
