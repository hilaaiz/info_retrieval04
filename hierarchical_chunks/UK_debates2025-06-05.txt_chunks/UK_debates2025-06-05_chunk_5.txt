I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and for raising the issue in King’s Bromley.
We are working closely with our colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who are responsible for managing significant flooding.
This includes the floods resilience taskforce, which I co-chair with the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Haltemprice (Emma Hardy) .
Earlier this year, we announced that we would commit a record £2.65 billion to build and maintain around 1,000 flood defences to protect lives, homes and businesses, which is a 26% uplift per annum on what the previous Government were spending.
