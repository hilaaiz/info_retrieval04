I thank the Minister for his answer.
As has been mentioned, we have recently seen attacks against private institutions, with groups such as Marks & Spencer being targeted.
I would be very interested to learn about the approach that has been taken by the statutory organisations and those in the military sphere, but I would like to know what efforts have been made to protect private businesses from cyber-attacks and to  ensure that my constituents in Mid Dunbartonshire and people across the UK have access to their daily essentials.
