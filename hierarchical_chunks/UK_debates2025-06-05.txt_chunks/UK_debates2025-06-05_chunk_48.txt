I was in the House during business questions on  9 January  when my hon.
Friend  the Member for Slough (Mr Dhesi) , Chair of the Defence Committee, referred to the storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar in June 1984, ordered by the then Indian Government.

Will the Leader of the House give a statement to the House announcing an independent, judge-led public inquiry to, in her own words, get to the bottom of what happened?
