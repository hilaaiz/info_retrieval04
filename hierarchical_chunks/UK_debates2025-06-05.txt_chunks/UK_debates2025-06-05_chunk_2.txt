I thank  the right hon.
Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)  for raising this issue, and for presenting his argument in the way that he did.
We have spoken about this case on a number of occasions, so he will know that I take responsibility for making sure that we make the correct decisions on ARAP.
When I was on the Opposition Front Bench, where  the right hon.
Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr Francois)  is now sitting, I raised concerns about the functioning of the ARAP scheme.
In office, we have made changes to the scheme to make sure that it functions better, which I will come to.
The hon.
Member for North East Fife (Wendy Chamberlain)  mentioned communications, and I believe  the right hon.
Member for New Forest East (Sir Julian Lewis)  quoted the Secretary of State’s comments on the Triples review, but I will address the issues raised by the right hon.
Member for Chingford and Woodford Green in the first instance.
