I thank the Minister for her answer.
When it comes to strengthening emergency preparedness, I have to point out that floods do not just  happen in London or Cardiff; they also happen in Northern Ireland, which has the same problems.
Has the Minister had the opportunity to talk to her counterparts in the province to ensure that, when it comes to emergency preparedness, the Department and the councils that have responsibilities in this area work together as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, so that we can do the same thing wherever we live?
