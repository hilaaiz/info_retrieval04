I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
I am sure we are all familiar with the Golden Hinde from walking along the south bank.
Restoring our heritage assets is really important to this Government,   and we announced additional funding to the heritage at risk programme in February.
I hope that my hon.
Friend and Southwark council can work together to do their bit to restore and bring back to life that great asset.
