Now that we have stabilised the economy, we are putting our values into practice further.
We are seeing huge investment in the north and in the midlands on key transport infrastructure, investment in the jobs of the future, bringing down waiting lists month after month after month, and 3 million more NHS appointments.
The right hon.
Gentleman did not want to mention this, but today we are announcing the biggest expansion of free school meals in years, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty.
That is the difference a Labour Government make: securing the real incomes of ordinary working people, putting our public services back on their feet and lifting children out of poverty.
As it is World Environment Day, does the Leader of the House agree that while the UK has beautiful national parks, local parks and green spaces in urban cities such as Southampton  are just as treasured and as valuable in bringing communities together and improving health and wellbeing, making such cities the great places that they are?
Communities in my constituency enjoyed a week-long Urban Wild festival during the half-term holiday, as part of Southampton’s journey in becoming the UK’s first national park city outside London.
Will she join me in congratulating Christelle Blunden in particular, but also the army of volunteers, friends of groups, charities and many more who champion our local nature every day and who are behind Southampton’s national park city campaign?
Finally— Order.
Please sit down.
This is a very important subject and I congratulate the hon.
Lady—she did ask me at the beginning and it is fantastic news—but I have to get a lot of Members in today.
So, please, I am sure the Leader of the House has grasped the message.
My hon.
Friend makes a compelling case for Southampton’s national park city status, and indeed for the fantastic contribution that green spaces, nature and wild places make to our cities, making places such as Southampton a great place to live.
