I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this issue.
It has been raised with me on a number of occasions by  the right hon.
Member for Dumfriesshire,  Clydesdale and Tweeddale (David Mundell)  as well.
No one should be left without a signal, and that is what should be happening, but I will ensure that the hon.
Lady and other Members are kept updated, because this is an urgent matter.
