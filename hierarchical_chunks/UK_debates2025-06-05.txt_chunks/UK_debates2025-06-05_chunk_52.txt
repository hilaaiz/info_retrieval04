Tackling child poverty is incredibly important.
On Monday, the Leader of the House told me: “I will ensure that she and the House are updated on the timings for the child poverty taskforce”.—[Official Report,  2 June 2025 ; Vol. 768, c. 33.]
I would appreciate an update on the timings.
When will we know when the announcements will be made?
The Under-Secretary of State for Education,  the hon.
Member for Portsmouth South (Stephen Morgan) , will shortly give a statement to the House about progress with free school meals.
As part of that statement, I am assured that he will let the House know where we are with the timings of the taskforce and when we can expect the report.
Many of my constituents have been deeply distressed by the story of Beth Martin, a mum of two from my constituency who tragically died in unclear circumstances on holiday in Turkey last month.
My thoughts and sympathies go out to her husband Luke and her two children, and indeed to all who love her.
I thank the Minister of State, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty)  for his sensitive and swift work.
Will the Leader of the House please make time for him to update me on his work internationally regarding this devastating death?
I am really sorry to hear about that distressing case.
I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our thoughts to Beth’s husband Luke and her two young children at this awful time.
I am pleased to hear that the Minister has been working with her.
I will ensure that that continues and that she is kept constantly updated.
