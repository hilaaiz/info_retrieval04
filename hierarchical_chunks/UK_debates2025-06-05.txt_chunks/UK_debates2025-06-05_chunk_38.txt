I welcome the recognition from the shadow Chancellor today, but it does not seem like everybody got the memo.
The right hon.
Gentleman seems to want to spend even more money from the Dispatch Box, without saying where it will come from.
The shadow Business Secretary,  the hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) , seems to want to get rid of some of the tax increases from the Budget, again without saying where the money will come from.
