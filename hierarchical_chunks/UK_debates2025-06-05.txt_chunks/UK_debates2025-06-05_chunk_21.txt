The Darlington economic campus is also pioneering a very strong cross-Government approach to working, which is helping to combat the strong departmental DNA that the CDL mentioned.
Will he join me in praising the leadership team at DEC for establishing themselves as an indispensable part of Government policymaking, and will he join me in ensuring that Darlington can serve as a model template for other campuses across the UK?
I join the right hon.
Gentleman in praising the leadership team at DEC.
He touches on a very important point, because we do not want just to  relocate jobs; we want people to have a good career path, too.
In some of the civil service offices I have visited around the country since last year, people have raised the question, “Can I pursue a career here that gets me promoted?”
It cannot just be about relocation; it has to be about the chance to build a career in these places.
My party was pleased to hear the announcement that GB Energy is coming to Aberdeen, which we have consistently said is the only sensible place for it, as Members would expect an Aberdeen MP to say.
Given that GB Energy will bring a maximum of 1,000 jobs over the next 10 years, will the right hon.
Gentleman please encourage his ministerial colleagues not to suggest that those jobs will replace the 400 jobs a fortnight that we are set to lose in the offshore energy industry over the next five years?
Investment in renewables is an energy policy, but it is also an economic and employment policy.
I can assure the hon.
Member that investment from both the public sector and the private sector will see many good new jobs created in new sources of energy over the coming years and decades.
