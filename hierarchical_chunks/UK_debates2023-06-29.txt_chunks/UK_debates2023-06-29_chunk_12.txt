I thank the Minister for that very positive response.
We in Northern Ireland are keen to ensure that the bilateral trade agreements benefit our companies as well.
Some people and councils across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland wish to downgrade Israel’s goods.
I know that the Minister and our Government want to do the very opposite.
Will the Minister tell the House what he is prepared to do to ensure that Israeli goods are promoted right across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?
