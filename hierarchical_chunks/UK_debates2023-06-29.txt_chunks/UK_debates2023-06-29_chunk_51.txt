I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I know that this is of concern to other Members.
Our position on this issue has not changed: drug testing providers must have a licence to test for controlled drugs, including at festivals.
We have always had that condition in place and we have made that clear, and law enforcement has always had a responsibility to uphold that legal requirement.
We have not received any applications for drug testing at major festivals this summer, and we continue to keep an open dialogue with any potential applicants.
He will know that Home Office questions are on Monday, so he may wish to pursue the matter with the Department.
