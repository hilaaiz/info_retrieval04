I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the forthcoming business.
I am glad she has announced that the Government will follow precedent and allow MPs to approve the Privileges Committee special report released this morning.
Its conclusions are clear; it found that senior Tory parliamentarians took it upon themselves to undermine the procedures of this House, and shamefully that includes a serving Minister and a former Leader of the House.
The report noted that the matter was made more difficult because two of the Members mounting the most vociferous attacks on the Committee did so from the platform of their own hosted TV shows.
That undermines democracy and undermines this House.
We owe it to the members of the Privileges Committee to give them our support.
