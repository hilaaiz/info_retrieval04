I thank my hon.
Friend for being the foremost parliamentary champion for this important cause.
The Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay)  Act 2023 will give eligible employed parents up to 12 weeks of extra paid leave if their new baby is admitted to neonatal care, providing extra support at a very worrying time.
We are keen to introduce the new entitlements as quickly as possible.
