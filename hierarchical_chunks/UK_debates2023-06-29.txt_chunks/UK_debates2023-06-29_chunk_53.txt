I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this issue.
I encourage her to attend the next question session for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, which is next Tuesday, and raise it there.
That Department is also running surgeries because of the complexity of the issues and the casework that hon.
Members are dealing with in relation to the energy market and schemes such as the one she outlines.
I encourage her to sit down with officials and have that bespoke surgery with them.
