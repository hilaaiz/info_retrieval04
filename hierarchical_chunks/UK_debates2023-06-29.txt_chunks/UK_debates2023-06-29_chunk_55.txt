I thank the hon.
Gentleman for all the work he does on those issues.
As I know from my International Development Department days, he is right that road traffic accidents are one of the biggest killers and causes of trauma around the world.
It is important to remind people of their obligations under the law and that such measures are a very good idea.
I congratulate him on all he has done to secure those laws.
