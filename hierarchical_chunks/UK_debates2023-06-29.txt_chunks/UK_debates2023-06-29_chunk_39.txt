I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter and for his contribution to the debate yesterday.
He will know that I take these matters very seriously.
We have stood up some additional training for the parliamentary teams and Clerks in Government Departments.
We—my noble Friend Lord True and I—have also brought all the permanent secretaries over to Parliament and told them exactly what Members need to conduct their business well.
He will know that I have also conducted, with the Commission, a survey of all Members to see what more we can do to ensure that they can do their job in the most effective way.
I will certainly write to the Department and make sure it has heard his remarks today, and I will feed it back to the permanent secretary.
