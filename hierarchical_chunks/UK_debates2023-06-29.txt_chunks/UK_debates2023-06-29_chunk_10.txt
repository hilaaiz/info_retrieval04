I thank my hon.
Friend and constituency neighbour for the work he does as the Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Ethiopia and many other countries.
I was also in Ethiopia recently, and many people were praising my hon.
Friend and his work.
He is right that the developing countries trading scheme will reduce tariffs, which is a win-win both for developing countries, making it easier and cheaper for them to export to the UK, and for UK consumers because it will reduce prices.
It is not just a matter of having the deal; we are laser-focused on making sure the benefits of the deal are realised, with more than 100 Department for Business and Trade officials working in Africa to make sure we get the full benefit of these deals.
