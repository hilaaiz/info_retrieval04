The sectors have changed but the taxpayers are still on the hook.
So will the Secretary of State commit to undertaking a review of the financial resilience of all companies in each regulated sector and to present her findings to the House?

They are carrying out a number of reviews at the moment, and I and colleagues across Government are working closely with them.
