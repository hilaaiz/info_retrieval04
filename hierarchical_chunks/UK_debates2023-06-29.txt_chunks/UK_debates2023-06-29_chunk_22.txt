I thank the Minister for that answer and his Department for its work on delivering the Neonatal Care (Leave and Pay) Act.
It is fantastic news for so many parents across the country.
We all want to see this entitlement delivered as quickly as possible.
It really should be possible for the Department to deliver it for April next year, as there is time to deliver the required statutory instruments and guidance.
There are examples of where His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has been able to move forward quickly to deliver such changes.
Will the Minister update the House on his work to drive through this important change, so that parents do not have to wait a second longer than necessary for this entitlement, which will support them during the most difficult and dark times in their life?
