Under our existing agreement, Israeli goods from the state of Israel receive tariff preferences under the UK-Israel partnership agreement.
Palestinian goods, from the Occupied Palestinian Territories, benefit from trade preferences in the interim UK-Palestinian Authority bilateral agreement.
To be clear, only goods originating from the state of Israel are covered by our current FTA, and that will not change in the upgraded FTA.
Last week, it was reported by The Jerusalem Post that Israel’s National Security Minister Ben-Gvir, who just 15 years ago was convicted of inciting racism and supporting a terrorist organisation, had told settlers in the illegal west bank outpost of Evyatar: “The Land of Israel must be settled and at the same time as the settlement of the Land a military operation must be launched.”
He then spoke of demolitions and the killing of “thousands” of Palestinians, in order to “fulfil our great mission.”
Will the Minister condemn those genocidal remarks about Palestinians, and ensure that any trade deal with Israel explicitly bans UK trade with those illegal settlements and makes binding regulations for companies to uphold human rights standards?
The hon.
Gentleman will be aware that the UK is a leading advocate of human rights around the world.
We have very frank conversations with our allies and we have frank and honest discussions across Government.
In answer to the trade element of his question, as I said previously, only goods originating in the state of Israel are covered by our current FTA, and that will not change under the upgraded FTA.
