Scotch whisky is an iconic Scottish export, and it is also hugely important strategically to the whole UK.
Had Ministers completed the free trade agreement with India by Diwali last year,  as was promised, the 150% tariff that producers of Scotch face when exporting to India could have been eliminated.
Given that the 10th round of talks has recently ended, with an 11th planned soon, can the Secretary of State tell us whether the free trade agreement will be completed by Diwali this year?
I have said repeatedly that it is about the deal and not the day.
Every single trade agreement that we negotiate is bespoke to the specific country and tailored to its economy, to ensure that it benefits both the UK and the counterpart country.
I am happy to say that the Scotch Whisky Association is very pleased with what it has been hearing about negotiations from its Indian counterparts, and we are working hard to make sure that the industry is successful.
