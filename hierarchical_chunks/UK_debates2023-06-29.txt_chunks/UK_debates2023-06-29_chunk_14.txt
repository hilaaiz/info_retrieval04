I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He will be pleased to know that Ministers in the Department met their counterpart, the Malaysian export Minister, this very week.
A lot is going on between our two countries.
The Department works closely with the UK-ASEAN Business Council, and our first bilateral joint economic trade committee with Malaysia is expected later this year.
It will help promote the bilateral trade and investment and economic co-operation that he rightly champions as the trade envoy to that country.
He will know that I will be signing the CPTPP agreement next month in New Zealand.
