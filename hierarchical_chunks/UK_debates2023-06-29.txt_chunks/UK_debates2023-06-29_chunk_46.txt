First, I associate myself with the remarks that have been made about Craig Brown.
In my previous career as a journalist, I was fortunate enough to meet Mr Brown on several occasions.
He was a gentleman and our thoughts are with his family.
A recent report by Shelter revealed just how bad homelessness has become in Scotland’s four main cities, with Edinburgh being the worst case.
Figures show that 5,000 people are living in temporary accommodation, including more than 2,000 children.
That is a tenfold increase since 2002.
Given the shortage of financial support from the Scottish Government for local authorities and the fact that homelessness is not confined to Scotland, is the Leader of the House willing to set aside time for a debate on how we can kick-start a co-ordinated approach with agencies to tackle this growing problem, and on how we can increase the number of social houses and the financial support available to local authorities?
