I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this important matter.
As she knows, we have provided more than 2.2 million additional homes and delivered 632,600 affordable homes since we came to office.
We have also helped many people take that step on to the property ladder.
However, this is about not just housing supply but a whole raft of challenges that individuals and families face, and I know that this is a concern to many Members across the House.
I am very happy to make sure that the Department has heard her call for time on the Floor of the House, and her plea has also been heard by the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee,  the hon.
Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns) , who is sitting behind her.
