The truth is that in the year stated, exports to the EU fell as a proportion of total trade.
Last month it was not inflation that halved, but exports of fruit to the EU.
The British Chambers of Commerce has reported that more small and medium-sized enterprises are seeing exports falling than rising, and Britain has the lowest export rates in the G7.
When a business tells me that it used to take three days for its products to reach shelves in Germany and now it takes 30, is it not fair to conclude  that the Government have failed on the economy, have no plan to make Brexit work and are making businesses pay the price?
That backs up my comment on pessimism; the hon.
Lady is cherry-picking the worst possible figures she can find.
In my conversations this week at the OECD conference on SMEs, nations around the world were crying out to do business with the UK, and indeed are doing so.
Of course we are trying to tackle market barriers where they exist.
We are leading a whole-of-Government effort to remove a hit list of 100 market access barriers, including those arising in Europe, to open up opportunity to UK exporters worth more than £20 billion.
The most recent statistics, for the year ending March 2023, show that 45 barriers were resolved in Europe in that year, compared with 41 in the previous year.
What recent assessment her Department has made of trends in the level of goods exports since the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
On a similar theme to my previous answer, the UK’s total exports have recovered to pre-pandemic levels measured against 2018.
In 2022, UK exports were £815 billion, up 21% in current prices and by 0.5% once adjusted for inflation.
