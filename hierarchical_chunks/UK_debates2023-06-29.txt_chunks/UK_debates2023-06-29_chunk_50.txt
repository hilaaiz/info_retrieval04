This morning, I spoke to a leading figure in the night-time and festival industry.
Since 2014, the Home Office has allowed drug testing to  take place at many festivals, potentially saving hundreds of lives.
Just over a month ago, there was a screeching U-turn from the Home Office that was inexplicable to many festival organisers across the country.
We had Glastonbury last weekend and we have many more festivals coming up across the rest of the summer.
For me, harm reduction has to be the focal point when organising those fantastic musical events.
I would like a debate in Government time that gets to the bottom of that inexplicable Home Office U-turn, because in prior times the Home Office sanctioned this activity taking place on site at festivals, with Home Office branding.
In fact, it has even permitted Greater Manchester police and Avon and Somerset police to allow this stuff to take place, as well as having their own forensic early warning systems in place, so that people can participate and make adult, informed choices about what they are and are not going to do in a much safer way.
