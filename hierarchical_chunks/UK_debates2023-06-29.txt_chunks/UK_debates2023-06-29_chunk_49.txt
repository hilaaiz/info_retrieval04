I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I shall not rehearse the arguments that were made at Prime Minister’s questions yesterday, but pay restraint is an important part of our getting through this very difficult time and, in particular, tackling inflation.
The next opportunity to question the Treasury team on this matter is not until after recess, so I shall make sure that they have heard his concerns.
