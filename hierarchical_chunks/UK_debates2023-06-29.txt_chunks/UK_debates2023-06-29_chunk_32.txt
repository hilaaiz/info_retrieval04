I welcome the Scottish Government’s recent announcement that workers’ rights will be a key element of a written constitution when Scotland becomes an independent nation.
That is in stark contrast to this place, where this Government have legislated for only seven of the 53 recommendations of the Taylor review.
When will they legislate for the other 46?
