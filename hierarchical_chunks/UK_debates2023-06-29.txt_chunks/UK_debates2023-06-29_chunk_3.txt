I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s early-morning snarkiness as he asks about what we are doing for Scotland.
We understand that there are issues that people have across borders, and my Department works closely with musicians and with all those who trade across borders to see what we can do to resolve those issues.
If there are specific cases in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, the Department is well placed to help his constituents with the issues he has described.
