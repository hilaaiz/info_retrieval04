Mr. NEAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the incredible life and legacy of Phillip D. Moseley, former Staff Director of the Committee on Ways and Means.
Phil dedicated his life to service, built a beautiful family, and garnered so many friends along the way.
A son of Hawaii, Phil landed in a career in politics, serving Chairman Bill Archer for 23 years.
He was the first Republican Staff Director for the Committee in decades, and the career that followed would be beyond his wildest dreams.
Phil was set apart by his steadfast belief in our Committee.
Regardless of the control of power, he revered the Committee and always believed in our ability to do right by the American people.
After an illustrious career, he lived out his days devoted to his family and developing his hobbies in coastal Carolina.
To his wife, Norah, his daughter Kendall, and son, Clay, as well as his cadre of grandsons, Phil will be remembered for all that he was, and all he gave to the Congress and his country.
His memory and legacy lives in all of us, and I thank him, his family, and loved ones for the impact to the Nation.
