Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the loss servants, former New Mexico State 
Representative Jim Trujillo.
He demonstrated what it means to answer the call to public service and that public service is an act of love.
I am grateful for the love Rep. Trujillo gave to the people of his district and our state.
His legacy now lives on in countless lives he touched in our beautiful state through both his important career as a financial professional and his broad public service in the New Mexico Human Services Department, six years in the New Mexico National Guard, and his outstanding 17 years in the New Mexico Legislature.
I met with Rep. Trujillo numerous times when I was working on voting rights and tribal intergovernmental matters.
He always listened with deep attention and gave clear direction and support.
He was a man of his word.
His tireless dedication to the people of New Mexico proved how much we can accomplish when we work together for our beloved communities.
I carry his inspiration with me as I continue my own service in the beautifully diverse Third District.
I offer my deepest condolences to his wife Victoria, their children, and the entire extended Trujillo family.
