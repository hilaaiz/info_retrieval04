Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the brave firefighters from across St. Clair County.
On Sunday, a dangerous fire broke out at an industrial warehouse in Port Huron.
Local Fire Departments rushed to the scene and were met with an incredibly complex and nasty fire deep within the metal warehouse.
But this fire wasn't fought alone, as there was a community-wide response from local departments to assist in extinguishing this fire.
Firefighters from Port Huron were joined by those from Fort Gratiot, Kimball Township, Marysville, St. Clair, and St. Clair County Homeland Security.
When one firefighter had given his all, the next man stepped up and continued the effort to fight this fire.
Thanks to the quick and decisive actions of our local fire departments, this dangerous fire was successfully extinguished without any casualties after a multi-day battle.
Michigan's 9th District is incredibly thankful for the cohesive effort by local fire departments to fight this fire and protect our community.
