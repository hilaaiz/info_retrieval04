Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career of Gallipolis native and Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army, Steve Lee.
Steve truly understands what service to our nation means.
Steve has never forgotten about our nation's veterans.
In 2004, Steve helped found one of the USO's largest annual events: Cincinnati's Tribute to the Troops, which has raised millions of dollars to help support the important work USOs do for our veterans.
As a Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the Army, Steve played a critical role in connecting local communities with the Army.
Through meeting with local community members, liaisons help communicate the concerns of the public with the Secretary of the Army.
Liaisons like Steve also play an important role in recruitment and retention, as he served as the face of the Army to the local community.
As a veteran myself, I have seen firsthand the impact Steve has had on our community
and I want to thank him for his tireless commitment to the over 40,000 veterans who reside in southern Ohio.
