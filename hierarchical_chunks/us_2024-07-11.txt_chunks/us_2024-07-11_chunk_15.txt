Mr. ZINKE.
Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of the incredible accomplishments of female athletes--and against the unfair and unjust regulations from the Biden Administration.
On the eve of the Olympics, the Biden Administration announced new rules to gut Title IX that would wipe away decades of progress and nearly eliminate any chance of a level playing field for female athletes.
When I was growing up, along with many in this chamber, I watched my schoolmates fight tooth and nail for every victory.
The lady Bulldogs were just as tough as their male counterparts, but it wasn't until Title IX that their right to equal access to athletics and scholarships was achieved.
Even then, the uphill battle for quality fields, equipment and coaches was a fight.
But those trailblazers made it possible for girls today to participate, develop, and excel as student athletes.
Many of my colleagues have mentioned the physical dangers of men competing against women, and there are many.
There's also the basic understanding of biology.
Boys are boys, and girls are girls.
Boys run faster, jump higher, and hit harder.
But I'd like to focus on the opportunity cost.
We all hear about elite female athletes being stripped of their titles by men who couldn't cut it in their own league.
How about the hundreds of young ladies we don't hear about who missed out on high school playoffs, scholarships, state records, and other accolades all to bow to the radical left agenda?
