Mr. Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, whose support 
Mr. Netanyahu needs to maintain his government, are strongly opposed to stopping the war in Gaza, even for a temporary truce They demand that the Gaza Strip be conquered and filled with new settlements.
For months now, many of us have participated in nationwide demonstrations demanding an immediate release of the hostages, an end to the war and immediate elections.
Polls of Israelis show that a majority want immediate elections, or elections right at the end of the war.
A large portion of Israelis have lost faith in Mr. Netanyahu's government.
He is clinging to power thanks to a tenuous parliamentary majority.
That majority ignores the plight of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced in the south after the Hamas attack and in the north because of attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the families of the hostages, a powerful force now in Israel.
That's where 
Mr. Netanyahu's speech to Congress fits in with his political needs No doubt it will be carefully stagemanaged to prop up his shaky hold on power and allow him to boast to his constituents about America's so-called support for his failed policies.
His supporters in Israel will be emboldened by his appearance in Congress to insist that the war continue, which will further distance any deal to secure the release of the hostages, including several U.S. citizens.
Giving 
Mr. Netanyahu the stage in Washington will all but dismiss the rage and pain of his people, as expressed in the demonstrations throughout the country American lawmakers should not let that happen.
They should ask 
Mr. Netanyahu to stay home.
