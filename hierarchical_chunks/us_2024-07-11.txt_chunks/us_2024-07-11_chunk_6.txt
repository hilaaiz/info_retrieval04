Mrs. RAMIREZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Andre Jones, in recognition of BIPOC Mental Health Awareness Month.
Andre's life and creativity are an invitation to celebrate the beauty Andre, a Chicago native from the Logan Square area in the IL-03, has published a unique coloring book.
It is called ``Colorful Memoirs: A Journey Through Andre's Life,'' which offers a glimpse into his experiences and affirms his credo: ``Just like you, I am a human being.''
Andie participates in the community living programs at Envision Unlimited, where he practices his commitment to inclusion and community-building through his leadership of the cycling committee.
There, he met Treena Glover, Envision Unlimited's residential housing manager.
Treena, who passionately nurtures the residents' unique interests and talents, served as Andre's motivator and helped co-author Andre's coloring book.
Andre is donating the proceeds from the coloring book to support his beloved summer cycling programs.
On behalf of Illinois' Third Congressional District, I commend Andre Jones for his contributions to mental health awareness and his ongoing efforts to equip and uplift our community.
