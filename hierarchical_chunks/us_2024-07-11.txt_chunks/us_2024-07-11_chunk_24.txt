Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with abundant joy and eternal gratitude in recognition of the 130th anniversary of Goodwill of Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas, affectionately referred to by their beneficiaries as MoKan Goodwill.
This year marks over a century communities by providing much-needed jobs, affordable household goods, and employment training services to Greater Kansas City's most vulnerable residents.
I fully expect MoKan Goodwill to continue to faithfully provide their services for as long as there are Missourians and Kansans to accept them, and I ask that we take a moment to reflect on the organization's profound impact.
