Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Jenny Lin Foundation, which provides music education and public safety programs, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary, which our community will commemorate this month.
The Jenny Lin Foundation was created in 1994 in response to the tragic murder of its namesake, a 14-year-old Castro Valley resident, in her own home after returning from school.
Jenny was a straight-A student passionate about music and friendship.
To keep Jenny's memory alive, her parents, Mei-Lian and John Lin, established the nonprofit in Castro Valley to their daughter's name.
The Foundation provides student music scholarships, public safety community events, and an annual summer music program.
The hallmark summer music program is free of charge to students in the Bay Area and offers programs for orchestra, band, and choir.
After the five-week program, participants perform in large concerts for the community to enjoy.
In 2023, over 200 students from 29 schools across 12 Bay Area cities participated in the program cosponsored by Chabot Community College.
The Jenny Lin Foundation also hosts safety fairs and workshops to inform our communities about child safety precautions for parents and children.
One specific advocacy effort was the Foundation's work to increase the number of books covering safety themes available at East Bay public libraries.
In 2023, the Jenny Lin Foundation received the Jefferson Award for Public Service.
This is the most prestigious public service award in the United States and was well-deserved.
I join the community in continuing to mourn the tragic loss of Jenny 30 years ago and admire Mei-Tian and John's resilience demonstrated through their community engagement and advocacy after such a tragic loss.
May their efforts continue to uplift and support the community and keep the memory of Jenny alive in our hearts.
