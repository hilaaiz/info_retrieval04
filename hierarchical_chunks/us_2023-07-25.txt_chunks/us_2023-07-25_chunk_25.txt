Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Youghiogheny River Lake on its 75th anniversary.
Located in Pennsylvania's Fayette and Somerset Counties, the lake provides flood protection for the upper Ohio River and the Youghiogheny and lower Monongahela River Valleys.
The flood control reservoir was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1938.
Since its completion in 1943, the dam is estimated to have saved more than $569 million by preventing upstream flood damage.
The benefits of the Youghiogheny River Lake don't stop there.
Alongside its support staff, the lake also alleviates pollution, improves water quality, and enhances the navigability of nearby rivers.
A hydroelectric plant along the dam generates enough power for approximately 8,000 homes per year.
Visitors can camp, fish, swim, picnic, and boat on the Youghiogheny River Lake.
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission regularly stocks the lake with trout and operates a boat launch along the shoreline.
The Youghiogheny Outflow Campground offers a nearby camping experience that allows even more visitors to enjoy the lake's beautiful scenery and recreational opportunities.
