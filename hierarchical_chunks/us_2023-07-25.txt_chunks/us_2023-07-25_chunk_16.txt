Mr. Speaker, Master Gunnery Sergeant Scott Stalker has dedicated his life to the service of our Nation and to the United States Marine Corps.
On behalf of a grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless sacrifice of ``Team Stalker,'' his wife Malerie, and their children, Olivia, Grace, and Scarlett.
I wish them the very best in this next chapter.
