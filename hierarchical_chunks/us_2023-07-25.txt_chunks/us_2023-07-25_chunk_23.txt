Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the Marine Corps League.
The Congressionally Chartered Veteran Service Organization over the past century has been critical in the care and welfare of our military, its Veterans, and their families.
The Marine Corps League was established in 1923 by World War I hero, then Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune.
On August 4, 1937, it was Congressionally Chartered by the 75th Congress Roosevelt.
The Marine Corps League provides millions of hours annually in service to the community, represents thousands of Veterans in cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs, performs tens of thousands of funeral honors annually for our passing Veterans, and provides millions and Marine Corps Reserves.
This volunteer work directly and positively impacts force readiness for the Marine Corps Reserves allowing additional focus on training and preparation.
As a retired Lt. General and the former Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves and Marine Forces North, I deeply understand the importance of strong and battle-ready reserve units and will continue to support their mission here in Congress.
The work of the Marine Corps League and the impact of their advocacy on behalf of our servicemembers, Veterans, and their families cannot be overstated.
It is an honor to recognize the Marine Corps League for 100 years of service to our country.
I look forward to assisting in fulfilling their mission to support our Servicemen and women.
Please join me in congratulating the Marine Corps League for this historic achievement.
