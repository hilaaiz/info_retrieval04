I thank the hon.
Lady for giving the House the time to debate the Bill this morning.
She references coercion, and I understand her point about the two medics, but medics will not be  able to see or hear everything at all times.
People will not be put beyond challenge, because subsequent to the death, if a relative claims coercion of another relative, investigation will remain.
I am entirely unclear how, without peradventure, two clinicians can claim that there had been no coercion at any point.
