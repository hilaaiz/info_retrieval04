I thank my hon.
Friend for the powerful and moving stories she is telling.
A constituent of mine watched her mum suffer from pancreatic cancer.
Unable to keep any food down, she basically starved to death.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that that is no way to see a loved one die?
Does she also agree that we did not come into this place to shy away from difficult choices, but to listen to our constituents and make better laws for everyone?
