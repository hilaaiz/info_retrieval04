I thank the hon.
Lady for giving way.
I have a great deal of sympathy for the arguments she is making.
However, we have seen, time and again, excessive judicial activism taking the words in this House and expanding their meaning into places we had not foreseen.
What reassurances can she give that the words in her Bill will be respected by the judiciary and that we will not find ourselves in a decade’s time in a totally different place that this House did not intend?
