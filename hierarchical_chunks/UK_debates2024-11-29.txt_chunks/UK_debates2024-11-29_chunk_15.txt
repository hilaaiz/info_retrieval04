A decade ago, I voted against a similar Bill, because I felt that perhaps it was not perfect and there were more things that I needed to know.
My hon.
Friend is right that we have not talked about death for the 10 years since or considered any legislation.
The truth is that if we vote against her Bill today, it will be the end of the conversation once again for another decade.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
How many people will go through the situations I have described if it is another 10 years before we address this matter?
rose— I am not going to take any more interventions, I am afraid, because I am conscious that lots of hon.
Members want to speak; I know
Mr Speaker is conscious of that as well.
Under the Bill, any terminally ill person who wants to be considered for an assisted death would have to undertake a thorough and robust process involving two doctors and a High Court judge.
No other jurisdiction in the world has those layers of safeguarding.
The person requesting assistance must have mental capacity and a settled wish at every stage.
That means they must repeatedly demonstrate that they understand the information relevant to their decision, the ability to retain that information, and to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision.
We know that capacity can fluctuate which is why it is assessed at every step of the process.
On that point, will my hon.
Friend give way?
I am sorry but I am not going to take any interventions, as I need to make progress.
The court must speak to one of the doctors and can hear from anybody else they deem necessary.
If there is any evidence of coercion, the court will not approve the request, and if evidence emerges subsequently, the court order could be revoked.
It is also important to note that the person can change their mind at any time, with periods of reflection built in.
Having consulted at the highest levels in the judiciary and the medical profession, I know that they can and will fulfil those safeguarding responsibilities and that they have the expertise to do so.[Official Report,  29 November 2024 ; Vol. 757, c. 1079.]
(Correction) Let us be clear: as my hon.
Friend  the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Kevin McKenna)  said earlier, this is not brand new territory for doctors.
Doctors, working in partnership with other clinicians, are already required to manage complexity in end-of-life decision making.
I followed the request of the British Medical Association that doctors should be under no obligation whatsoever to participate, but if they do participate, they will receive appropriate training and support.
Doctors should be able to use their professional judgment when and if a conversation takes place, taking their cue from the patient, as they do for many other issues.
I welcome that patient-centred approach.
Many doctors feel the change in the law would safeguard clinicians and patients by making everything explicit.
When it comes to the detail of what assisted dying would look like, we have the benefit of drawing on the experience of 31 jurisdictions around the world.
I could talk extensively about the international experience of assisted dying.
The Health and Social Care Committee report did a brilliant job of that, and this Bill has looked at best practice as well as models which I and many others would not be comfortable with our having here in England and Wales.
Reflecting on their experience, clinicians in Australia say: “through deep and meaningful conversations between doctors, patients and their loved ones we can dispel fear, reduce suffering, bring death and dying out of the shadows, and so allow patients and their families a better quality of life and quality of death”.
As one Australian Member of Parliament said: “We have brought ‘behind-closed-doors’ practices into the open and given dying people meaningful, transparent choices.
Crucially none of the fears that were put forward as reasons not to change the law have been realised.
The status quo was broken and assisted dying works.”
Evidence from around the world shows that the option of having an assisted death actually lifts the fear that terminally ill people have, and that many never actually use it but are able to make the best of the time they have left due to the comfort and reassurance that it provides.
People talk about a slippery slope, but the Health and Social Care Committee found that not one jurisdiction that has passed laws on the basis of terminal illness has expanded its scope.
[Interruption.]
That is absolutely true.
As the courts here and in Europe have repeatedly made clear, Parliament is sovereign.
This Bill could not be made any broader through any judicial process.
Speaking of process, with reference to the Bill, having listened to what I know are genuine concerns of Members about ensuring that we get this legislation right, I commit to the House that if the Bill passes Second Reading today, which I sincerely hope it does, I am minded to move a motion that gives the Bill Committee the power to take oral and written evidence in order to ensure that a thorough approach continues to be taken.
That is not normal procedure for a private Member’s Bill, but I think that that is the right thing to do.
I also reassure colleagues that the Bill Committee will meet over a number of weeks, meaning that there is ample time for full consideration of the details of the Bill, including amendments.
The Committee will be representative of the views and make-up of the House.
Let me be clear: that will mean there will be representatives of different parties with a range of views on the Committee.
As the Leader of the House said at the Dispatch Box just yesterday, and has said several times, the Government will, of course, work with me to ensure that the Bill is workable and operable.
That will quite rightly take time, and I have included in the Bill a commencement period of up to two years—this is not going to happen overnight.
That timeframe can be explored in Committee, as it is more important to get this right than to do it quickly.
In conclusion, for the reasons I have set out, I am very clear that the law needs to change to give terminally ill people choice at the end of life and to protect their loved ones from fear of prosecution.
There will be some of us here today who are lucky enough not to have personal experience of this issue, but sadly we know that any one of us could end up in this heartbreaking situation.
We are all living longer, which is brilliant, and I have campaigned inside and outside Parliament for a greater focus on prevention and early intervention of illness and disease to keep us fit and healthy for as long as possible, but any one of us or our loved ones could be unfortunate or unlucky enough to receive a terminal diagnosis.
I struggle to see how it is fair or just to deny anyone the autonomy, dignity and personal choice of taking control of their final weeks.
And the right to choose does not take away the right not to choose.
Giving the choice of an assisted death to those who want it would of course not stop anyone who is terminally ill from choosing not to make that choice.
Whatever happens today, I am incredibly proud of the work that my fantastic team and the many campaigners have done on this hugely significant, emotional and sensitive subject.
We need to be clear: a vote to take this Bill forward today is not a vote to implement the law tomorrow.
It is a vote to continue the debate.
It is a vote to subject the Bill to line-by-line scrutiny in Committee, on Report and on Third Reading.
Then, of course, the Bill will go to the Lords for what I have no doubt will be further robust debate and scrutiny.
This will be a thorough process, focused on one of the most significant issues of our time—an issue that people across the country clearly want us to address, none more so than the many families who are facing the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo.
Today is the beginning, not the end, of that process, but the debate can continue only if colleagues join me in the Aye lobby today.
I wholeheartedly encourage them to do so, and I commend the Bill to the House.
I think you indicated that I could speak for a little longer than eight minutes, Mr Speaker.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
I do not want to have too much grumbling at the eight-minute moment.
I will take my 15 minutes, with time for interventions.
I start by paying tribute to  the hon.
Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  for her very powerful speech and the way in which she has led this campaign—with great respect, sensitivity and, to use a contested word, dignity.
She and I knew each other before we were MPs, when we both worked in the charity sector.
I like and admire her greatly, and I know that we have more in common than might appear today.
All of us in this House have this in common: we all share a deep concern about the experience of people dying or fearing death, pain and suffering.
I bear heavily on my conscience the people whose lives will be prolonged beyond their wishes if I get my way and this Bill is defeated today.
I will not disregard those people or minimise their anxiety.
We will hear those voices in today’s debate—we have heard many of them already—speaking through hon.
Members in what I know will be very moving speeches.
If I voted for this Bill, I would have on my conscience many more people whose voices we cannot hear—the people who would be vulnerable as a consequence of the huge changes that this Bill would introduce in our society and in the NHS.
My view is that if we get our broken palliative care system right and our wonderful hospices properly funded, we can do so much more for all the people who we will hear about today, using modern pain relief and therapies to help everybody die with a minimum of suffering when the time comes.
We will not be able to do that if we introduce this new option; instead, we will expose many more people to harm.
I will go through the Bill in a moment, but first I will say a word about process, in response to the points made by the hon.
Member for Spen Valley.
This Bill is  simply too big for the time that it has been given, and I implore hon.
Members not to hide behind the fiction that it can be amended substantially in Committee and in its later stages.
The remaining stages of a private Member’s Bill are for minor tweaks, not the kind of wholesale restructuring that we would need if we were ever to make this Bill safe.
Members who vote for the Bill today must be prepared to see it become law largely unamended.
I suggest that if they have any doubts, the only responsible choice is to vote no, and let the advocates of assisted dying bring back a better Bill at another time.
I deeply appreciate the respectful way in which the hon.
Gentleman is making his point, but I stand before him not sure of how any colleague in this Chamber cannot have doubts whichever way they are voting today.
It feels like there are two necessary harms that we are all forced to weigh up.
If the hon.
Gentleman is so certain that doubt should push people one way, I am deeply intrigued to hear why that is, when it is very clear that many people will continue to suffer unnecessarily if we reject this Bill.
I recognise that there are very many doubts on each side, and I fully respect the arguments that have been made by the hon.
Member for Spen Valley.
Of course this is a finely balanced debate, but the point about process is that this Bill is too flawed; there is too much to do to it to address in Committee.
By all means, let us have this debate, but let us have that before a Bill of this magnitude is brought forward, The consideration of the Bill should be much more comprehensive.
Contrary to what the media are saying, today’s decision is not about bringing this Bill into law; it is about allowing it to go to the next stage.
People may have misgivings, but the hon.
Gentleman is making the assumption that the Bill cannot be corrected or amended in order to make it palatable to people who have doubts.
We all have doubts, but surely today’s vote is simply to let it go to the next stage.
The final decision on Third Reading is the critical one in deciding whether the Bill goes into law.
I think I have made the point that this Bill is too comprehensive and there is too much in it to address through the process of a private Member’s Bill.
If the hon.
Gentleman has serious concerns about aspects of the Bill that he would not be prepared to see come into law, he should not be supporting it today.
Let me explain the concerns about the Bill that I think are too comprehensive to be dealt with in Committee.
I recognise how hard the hon.
Member for Spen Valley has worked to try to ensure that it is safe, but I do not believe it is, for the following reasons.
Let us start at the beginning.
The process starts with a conversation between a patient and a medical practitioner—not necessarily a doctor; just a medic of some sort, unspecified at this stage.
If the patient tells their ordinary family doctor that they want an assisted death, the doctor is obliged to either explain how it works or pass them on to someone who will do it—which is probably what will happen, by the way.
The likelihood is that we would see a new branch of medicine spring up, like the medics I met in Canada.
Will the hon.
Member give way?
I will in a moment.
These medics I met in Canada are specialists in assisted death and personally kill hundreds of patients a year in their special clinics.
[Interruption.]
If hon.
Members have difficulty with the language, then I wonder what they are doing here.
This is what we are talking about.
I met doctors for whom this is their profession and their job, and they are proud to do it.
Will the hon.
Member give way?
I will give way to the other hon.
Gentleman.
I want to be very clear that “medical practitioner” is a synonym for doctor—not nurse, pharmacist, dentist or any other practitioner.
To be a doctor is to be a practitioner of medicine.
We need to be very clear on this.
There is lots of law and regulation on this, and I believe that what the hon.
Member said is incorrect.
What the Bill actually says is that a doctor means “a registered medical practitioner…who has such training, qualifications and experience as the Secretary of State may specify by regulations”.
Obviously they are some sort of regulated medic—I recognise that—but they are not necessarily a doctor.
We will find out.
I recognise that they will have professional qualifications, but it is not clear what those are going to be because it is not in the Bill.
I commend the hon.
Gentleman for the way in which he is engaging in this discussion, in the same spirit as  the hon.
Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) .
We often hear that one of the safeguards associated with the Bill is that medical practitioners would be involved and that a diagnosis of a terminal illness, with six months or less to live, would be required.
Does the hon.
Gentleman accept that medicine is not an exact science?
It is the science of uncertainty blended with the art of probability.
There is no exactitude in this.
No court will second-guess medical opinion; it will simply look at process.
I entirely agree with the right hon.
Gentleman; he is absolutely right.
I am afraid that the definition of terminal illness is in a sense the essential flaw in the Bill, but I will come on to that.
Going back to the conversation that the patient has with the medical practitioner, the crucial point is that the conversation does not need to be started by the patient, according to the Bill.
It could be started by the medic—any medic—perhaps in hospital, who could make the suggestion of an assisted death to a patient who has never raised the issue themselves, whose family have never suggested it and whose own doctor does not think it is the right thing to do.
And so the idea is planted.
Then, for whatever reason—and, by the way, there is no need ever to give a reason—the patient says that they want to proceed with an assisted death.
They sign a declaration, or rather somebody else can sign it for  them.
It could be any professional, someone they do not know—maybe a new medical practitioner.
A total stranger can do all the paperwork on their behalf.
That is what the clause about the proxy entails.
Then these two medical practitioners make their assessment.
I urge the hon.
Member to check the wording of the Bill, because if somebody signs as a proxy, they have to have known the individual for two years, and would simply be signing to say that they agree with the patient who wishes to go forward with assisted dying.
I do not have time to check the Bill now, but from my memory it refers to someone who has known the patient for two years or someone of good standing in the community, which could be some sort of professional who is not known to them at all.
Someone can quickly check the Bill, but my understanding is that it could be a total stranger to them.
Is the matter not very clear?
Clause 15(5) states: “In this section “proxy” means— (a) a person who has known the person making the declaration personally for at least 2 years, or (b) a person who is of good standing in the community.”
So there is no protection such as that which is pretended by the supporters of the Bill.
I am grateful for that intervention.
The assessments have to determine whether the patient is terminally ill, whether they have mental capacity to make the decision, and then whether they have been coerced or pressured into the decision.
In many ways the whole issue turns on the question of whether someone is terminally ill.
I am afraid that it is a term of great elasticity, almost to the point of meaninglessness.
It is well known, as  the right hon.
Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson)  said earlier, that it is impossible for doctors to predict with any accuracy that somebody will die within six months.
It is a purely subjective judgment, made in this case by a doctor whose job will be approving assisted deaths.
They simply have to determine not whether it is reasonably certain that death will occur, but that it can be reasonably expected—in other words, that it is possible.
The thrust of the Bill, as I understand it, is to ease suffering and pain in a patient who has a diagnosis and will die of the condition that has been diagnosed.
But that right could only be exercised within a six-month period, and the pain and discomfort could last a lot longer than that.
Has my hon.
Friend heard—because I have not—what the importance of six months is?
Why not eight, 10 or 12?
What would stop people challenging it on the grounds that the dam has been breached, the six months is entirely arbitrary and it could, and indeed should, be extended by negative resolution in a statutory instrument?
My hon.
Friend makes the right point, and I am afraid to say that is absolutely the case.
The six-month cut-off is completely arbitrary and impossible to determine.
It is a line in the sand, and of course it could be challenged, as so much of the Bill could be challenged, on human rights grounds.
Every one of the   safeguards that has been introduced by the hon.
Member for Spen Valley would in fact be a barrier and a discrimination against the new human right that has been awarded to one group but should of course be awarded to all—if the point is conceded in this way.
Earlier this week, colleagues and I met two eminent doctors who were former presidents of the Association for Palliative Medicine, and they raised serious concerns about the Bill, including that the doctor or medical practitioner who makes the assessment need never have met the person they are assessing, or been involved in their care at all.
What does the hon.
Gentleman make of that?
The hon.
Lady makes a very important point.
I will not get into the question of public opinion and the polling, because it is so contested, but there is clear evidence that the doctors who work with the dying—the palliative care professionals—are opposed to a change in the law by a great majority.
They see the damage that it would do to the palliative care profession and services, and they see the danger for vulnerable patients.
I appreciate that the hon.
Gentleman talks to us as a medical professional and we need to listen to his views.
But is it not true that any medical assessment is an approximation; something that cannot be said for certain?
For this decision too, we cannot be 100% certain, but that is life.
We cannot make legislation that is 100% good because at some point we have to make a decision, on balance, whether something has merit or not.
For that reason, we should vote for the Bill.
I am grateful to the hon.
Lady, especially for promoting me to the status of doctor; I am actually a charity worker and political hack by background.
It is good of her to credit me with those skills—perhaps I should set myself up as a medical practitioner.
She is right that medics and indeed judges have to make difficult judgments all the time.
I think it would be very dangerous and inappropriate to give them the power to do so in this case.
The whole question of the six-month cut-off is very important.
I acknowledge all the points that have been made, but there is another problem with the definition of terminal illness.
Almost anybody with a serious illness or disability could fit the definition.
I recognise that these are not the cases that the hon.
Member for Spen Valley has in mind—of course they are not—but that is the problem with the Bill.
All that someone needs to do to qualify for an assisted death—for the definition of terminal illness—is refuse treatment, such as insulin if the person is diabetic.
In the case of eating disorders, a topic on which I have worked with  the hon.
Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse) , a person just needs to refuse food.
The evidence from jurisdictions around the world, and our own jurisprudence, shows that that would be enough to qualify someone for an assisted death.
Does the hon.
Gentleman accept that every day in the NHS patients refuse treatment, and indeed food, and that there is currently legal oversight in respect of coercion and other such matters?
Would the Bill not strengthen protections in those areas?
I am perplexed by that argument.
The suggestion that there may be coercion—of course there will be—and abuse, and all sorts of injustices that take place in the current system, does not strike me as an argument for regulating and licensing assisted suicide.
If we have concerns about practice in the NHS, let us deal with that.
Let us not license suicide—and, by the way, evidence from around the world shows that that increases suicide in the general population.
Suicide is contagious.
For instance, Oregon is often pointed to as an example.
The incidence of suicide, outside assisted suicide laws, has risen by a third there since it was legalised.
There would be enormous contagious effects were we to regulate and license it in this way.
The hon.
Gentleman is making an excellent case for the Bill to be passed today.
What he is actually saying is that there are specifics that require debate, analysis and discussion in great detail in Committee—that is the whole point of it.
If it is not dealt with properly in Committee, it will not pass Third Reading.
He is suggesting that because he does not like those specifics, we cannot discuss the Bill in any detail.
I am sure that the hon.
Member for Spen Valley is delighted to have the support of the hon.
Gentleman.
I refer him to the point that I was making: this is an inappropriate process.
My hon.
Friend is making a superb speech, as I expected him to do.
On the issue of process, I say this to  the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness (Richard Tice) , my constituency neighbour: as he will know, I have introduced some very serious Bills, including the one that became the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.
It was preceded by three independent reports and pre-legislative cross-party scrutiny by both Houses, which happened before the Committee stage.
The point is that that process should take place before Second Reading, not after.
I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend.
I will now run through the process before taking any more interventions.
As I have explained, pretty much anybody with a serious illness or disability could work out how to qualify for an assisted death under the Bill.
Members may think that far-fetched, but it is what happens everywhere that assisted suicide is legal, including in Oregon.
On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
The hon.
Gentleman is using incorrect language.
It is not suicide.
That is offensive.
I ask him please to correct his language.
That is not a point of order.
I am sorry if offence is given, but the fact is that the value of having a Bill in black and white is seeing what the law really is.
What the Bill would do is amend the Suicide Act 1961.
It would allow people to assist with a suicide for the first time.
I respect the hon.
Lady’s concern, but I am afraid we do need to use the proper language here.
The Bill’s scope is very broad.
Members who think that assisted suicide for people with anorexia or other conditions that would not be regarded as terminal could not happen here should consider the young people in the UK today who are given a diagnosis of terminal anorexia and put on a palliative care pathway—essentially, assigned to death.
Of course these are extreme cases— rose— I am not going to give way again.
There are a great many of these cases, I am afraid, and I mention them to show how wide open the Bill is.
[Interruption.]
Order.
May I ask  the hon.
Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse)  to keep a little calmer?
She has intervened twice already, and plenty of other Members who also need to be heard.
I think particularly of disabled people, many of whom require constant treatment to stay alive.
All, immediately and by definition, will be eligible under the terms of the Bill for a state-sponsored death.
I refer Members to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has made the point that the line between disability and terminal illness is very blurred.
That is why the Bill’s title is, in fact, so dangerous.
rose— I will make a little progress.
The second question that medical practitioners have to answer is about mental capacity, and here again is a great vagueness.
How do they judge if someone is in their right mind when they are asking for help to kill themselves?
The Bill says that the definition of capacity is based on the Mental Capacity Act 2005, but that Act is deliberately expansive.
It explicitly assumes capacity in the patient, so having acute depression is no bar to being judged to have capacity under the Act.
Being suicidal is no bar under the Act, so the capacity test is no bar at all.
Finally, there is the question of coercion.
Is the patient asking for an assisted death because of pressure from someone else?
There are two glaring problems here.
The first is that the process does not even attempt to answer the question properly.
There is no investigation, no requirement for medics to interview friends and family, and no need for a psychiatrist or family doctor to be consulted.
The medics just need to satisfy themselves—who knows how?—that, to the best of their knowledge, the person has not been pressured.
The second problem with the coercion test is that it focuses on only one type of coercion—the less likely type.
The bigger danger is not other people pressuring someone to do this; it is that they pressure themselves—hon.
Members have made this point.
The Bill has nothing to say on that.
Internal pressure is absolutely fine.
If you feel worthless or a burden to others, if the NHS will not offer you the treatment you need, if the local authority will not make the adjustments you need to your home, if you have to wait too long for a hospital appointment, or if you want to die because you think the system has failed you, that is absolutely fine.
rose— I will get to the end of my speech.
That is the medical stage, and I will jump straight to the judicial stage.
The medical practitioners sign it off, and then the judge has to confirm all the same tests.
Of course, many eminent judges have made the point that it will overwhelm the family courts if the test were applied properly, but it will not be applied properly, because the Bill assumes that judges will fulfil a new inquisitorial role and actually look into cases as investigators, which is entirely unknown in English common law.
But the Bill will not require any actual investigation.
There is no requirement for a judge even to meet the applicant.
They simply have to have a phone call, or maybe it will be an email, from one of the medics.
That is it.
That is the inquiry.
On that basis, the judge must decide whether it is more likely than not that there has been external pressure.
After the judge approves it—they are required to approve it, unless they can find evidence of external coercion—we go to “the final act”, as the Bill says, where a junior colleague, as a medical practitioner, oversees your death by pills or lethal injection.
And here is the last thing that the Bill does or does not do.
There is no requirement at any stage of the process—at either the medical or the judicial stage—for anyone to tell the patient’s next of kin, their wider family or even their GP that the NHS and the judicial system are working in secret to bring about the death of their loved one, maybe their father or their daughter.
I say again that these are not the cases that the Bill was designed for, but they are directly in scope, and it is going to take more than a tweak in Committee to get them out.
Is this what is meant by having choice at the end of life?
Let us talk about choice.
I am often accused of wanting to impose my view on others—that point was made earlier.
People say, “If you don’t approve of assisted death, don’t have one, but don’t deprive me of the choice.”
In fact, the evidence is that, with this new option and the comparative loss of investment and innovation in palliative care, real choice will narrow.
There is a broader point to make about choice, which is that no man or woman is an island.
Just as every person’s death, even a good death, diminishes us all, so we will all be involved and affected if we make this change.
The Bill will not just create a new option for a few and leave everyone else unaffected; it will impose this new reality on every person towards the end of their life, on everyone who could be thought to be near death, and on their families—the option of assisted suicide, the obligation to have a conversation around the bedside or whispered in the corridor, “Is it time?”
It will change life and death for everyone.
I am very aware of the terrible plight of the people who are begging us for this new law.
I think we can do better for them than they fear, but we also need to think in real human terms about what the effect will be on the choices of other people, and I do not mean the people who are used to getting their way.
I am talking about the people who lack agency, the people who know what it is to be excluded from power and to have decisions made for them by bigwigs in distant offices who speak a language they do not understand—the sort of people  who the hon.
Member for Spen Valley and I both know from our previous charity work, and who we all know from our constituency work.
They are not the people who write to us campaigning for a change in the law, but the people who come to our surgeries with their lives in tatters, or who the police or social workers tell us about—the people with complex needs.
What are the safeguards for them?
Let me tell the House: we are the safeguard—this place; this Parliament; you and me.
We are the people who protect the most vulnerable in society from harm, yet we stand on the brink of abandoning that role.
The Rubicon was a very small stream, but on the other side lies a very different world—a worse world, with a very different idea of human value.
The idea that our individual worth lies in our utility, valuable only for so long as we are useful—not a burden, not a cost, not making a mess.
Let us not be the Parliament that authorises that idea.
I mentioned at the start of my speech the voices of those we cannot hear: the frail and elderly and the disabled.
As we are surrounded by such a cloud of witnesses, let us do better than this Bill.
Let today be not a vote for despair, but the start of a proper debate about dying well, in which we have a better idea than a state suicide service.
Let us have a debate in which we remember that we have intrinsic value; that real choice and autonomy means having access to the best care possible and the fullest control over what happens to us while we live; and that true dignity consists in being cared for to the end.
rose— Order.
I remind the House that we want to aim for speeches of up to eight minutes.
I call the Mother of the House.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend  the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  on bringing forward this Bill, which has been the occasion of a very important national conversation.
I recall to the House the fact that, in 1969, Parliament voted to abolish the death penalty for murder.
Public opinion was actually against that change, but MPs believed, on a point of principle, that the state should not be involved in taking a life.
It was a good principle in 1969 and it remains a good principle today.
I am not against legalising assisted dying in any circumstance, but I have many reservations about this Bill.
In particular, I do not believe that the safeguards are sufficient.
They are supposed to be the strongest in the world because of the involvement of a High Court judge, but the divisional courts have said that “the intervention of a court would simply interpose an expensive and time-consuming forensic procedure”.
Sir James Munby, the former president of the family division of the High Court, said recently: “Only those who believe implicitly in judicial omniscience and infallibility—and I do not—can possibly have any confidence in the efficacy of what is proposed.”
Is the judge supposed to second-guess doctors?
Will the judge make a decision on the basis of paperwork?
Or will there be a hearing in open court?
Where will be  the capacity in the criminal justice system to deal with all this?
Far from being a genuine safeguard, the involvement of a judge could just be a rubber stamp.
More than two thirds of care proceedings involving the most vulnerable children in our society cannot be completed within six months.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that there is a real concern that the safeguard is not deliverable, or risks being the rubber stamp that I know my hon.
Friend  the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  does not want it to be?
I entirely agree with my hon.
Friend.
Robust safeguards for the sick and dying are vital to protect them from predatory relatives, to protect them from the state and, above all, to protect them from themselves.
There will be those who say to themselves that they do not want to be a burden; I can imagine myself saying that in particular circumstances.
Others will worry about assets they had hoped to leave for their grandchildren being eroded by the cost of care.
There will even be a handful who will think they should not be taking up a hospital bed.
My right hon.
Friend makes her case powerfully.
Can I ask her to comment on the current situation whereby people ask themselves the question she just asked today?
What safeguards are there for those people?
What inquiry is made before those people pass away, often having taken the most drastic and horrific action to do so?
But if the House passes this legislation, the issue that I have raised will become foremost in people’s minds even more so.
We are told that there is no evidence of coercion in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is possible, but people do not generally write letters to sick relatives urging them to consider assisted suicide and then put those letters on file.
Coercion in the family context can be about not what you say but what you do not say—the long, meaningful pause.
As a medical professional who is surrounded by even more senior medical professionals, I know we can all miss things when there are tangibles in front of us: the shadows on X-rays and the markers on blood tests.
As professionals, we miss things that can be seen.
What security will we have that we can pick up things that we cannot see, like coercion?
That is the point: coercion is something that there will be no material evidence of and that we cannot see.
People keep saying that the Bill cannot be amended, but of course any future Government could bring in new clauses.
We can see what has happened in Canada, which introduced assisted dying in 2016 for adults with terminal illnesses.
In 2021, it was extended to people with no terminal illness and the disabled.
In March 2027, anyone with a serious mental health problem will also be eligible.
The House should remember that no single organisation representing the disabled supports the Bill.
My daughter Maria lived her life with severe disabilities and health conditions.
Since her birth, we were told many times that she might have only six months to live.
She lived for 27 years.
Crucially, Maria was non-verbal.
I am filled with dread and fear about what might happen to people like Maria who are non-verbal and do not have that capacity, if they are not loved and cared for and do not have somebody speaking out for them.
I have heard so many stories like that.
The arbitrary cut-off of six months does not necessarily meet with the reality of sick people.
The case of Maria, and others, should give us all pause.
Does the right hon.
Lady agree, with two thirds of the Cabinet apparently supporting this measure in principle, that we should reject the Bill today, but that we should as a House commit not to go another 10 years ignoring this topic, but to come forward in a considered way, ensure it is looked at properly, and do everything possible to have a system that is more robust, more caring and ensures good outcomes for people like Maria?
Order.
Let me also say that we must try to keep to the time limits.
I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman.
As I said right at the beginning, I am not against assisting dying in any circumstances.
If the Bill passes, we will have the NHS as a 100% funded suicide service, but palliative care will be funded only at 30% at best.
The former Member for Dunfermline East, Gordon Brown, has said recently: “we need to show we can do better at assisted living before deciding whether to legislate on ways to die.”
I represent very many vulnerable people in marginalised communities.
I cannot vote for a Bill when I have doubts about whether they will be protected.
We can come back, have a commission and craft a better Bill, but I will not be voting for the Bill today.
I want to make three brief points.
First, I have completely changed by mind on this subject since I entered the House during the last century, because I have sat in my advice surgery with tears pouring down my face listening to constituents who have set out so clearly, speaking with such emotion, about how their mother, brother, father or child had died in great pain and great indignity.
I strongly support the Bill, and I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  on the excellent way in which she has presented it.
I believe that we should give our constituents—our fellow citizens—this choice.
I want this choice for my constituents; I want it for those whom I love; and I want it, perhaps one day, for myself.
Will the right hon.
Gentleman give way?
I will not, I am afraid.
The current law forces people to plan their deaths in secret.
Their bodies are found by their loved ones.
Often, they die in the  most horrific circumstances.
They have no chance to say goodbye to their loved ones.
It is devastating for their families.
The former Health Secretary commissioned the Office for National Statistics to try to find out how many people who committed suicide every year were dying people.
The figure was between 300 and 650.
Secondly, in our democracy, the Commons must make this decision.
Only we, elected by our constituents, have the legitimacy to do this.
It is not the DPP, the Crown Prosecution Service, the police, doctors or even unelected Members of the House of Lords—this House of Commons must make this decision.
Let us be clear that all of us on both sides of the debate strongly support an increase in the quality and extent of palliative care.
For me, the debate is about extending choice, in very narrow and heavily regulated circumstances under the Bill, as the hon.
Lady so clearly set out—the choice not to be forced to end your life in pain and indignity.
No element in the Bill talks about intolerable suffering.
Many believe that the Bill is too narrowly drawn.
I stand by the hon.
Lady’s drafting.
We should remember that in Oregon there has been no serious attempt to change or amend the law.
I had the privilege of speaking to an NHS consultant last year, the day before she headed to Dignitas.
She said, “I love my country, but I object very strongly to my country forcing me to make this choice, and to having to travel unaccompanied to a foreign country to die.”
The status quo is cruel and dangerous.
People caught up in these circumstances have no transparency; there is no regulation, safeguards or oversight.
The Bill contains a whole series of safeguards that are not present at the moment.
Thirdly, we are deciding today on a principle.
If the Bill is voted down on Second Reading, that will be the end of the matter for many years, and we will do that in the knowledge that Scotland, the Isle of Man, Jersey and many other countries are likely to bring in legislation like this.
There are 300 million people in 30 jurisdictions who have secured this ability to choose.
There will be numerous safeguards.
There will not be a slippery slope unless this Parliament agrees to there being one.
If we agree to a Second Reading today it is, in my judgment, inconceivable that the Government Front Bench will not ensure we have the proper time to scrutinise the Bill.
This Bill goes with the grain of our constituents’ views—about 75%, according to the most recent polling.
There is an opportunity and a chance, as the hon.
Member for Spen Valley has set out, to consider in detail these matters ahead of Third Reading.
As drafted, the Bill seems to me a very modest and controlled proposal.
Let us not forget this: Oregon shows us that fewer people take these steps once they know they have this choice as a back-up.
I end with something I have never forgotten.
Some years ago, I was listening in a debate to a young man who had recently lost his father.
He had visited his father and seen him in great pain and indignity.
He had seen him three days before he died.
In the end his father put a bag over his head and used his dressing-gown cord to hang himself.
That young man said to all of us: “If you are ever in this position, let’s hope that God will help you, because they certainly won’t.”
Today, this House has the opportunity to ensure that they will.
It is a pleasure to follow the excellent speech of  the right hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) .
In preparation for today I have had a number of discussions with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) , and I want to put on record that the measured way she has dealt with the proceedings has been excellent.
I do not know whether she has ever had moments of doubting whether this was the right thing to pick as a private Member’s Bill, but she has been an absolute credit to this House in the way she has dealt with these matters so far.
In 2015, in the last Chamber debate on this subject, I wound up for the Opposition Front Bench, but my interest in it goes back much further.
Like all Members of this House, I have had hundreds of emails from constituents on both sides of the argument.
Many ask me to oppose the Bill; those emails come from people of faith, and I wholly and entirely respect what they say, but they are the first people also to say that this is an individual decision for every individual Member of the House to make.
As I have been at the bottom of the list of speakers to be called for so many years, I have great sympathy for those who find themselves there today, so I will try to keep my remarks to one narrow point: the legal context of the Bill.
There is a false dichotomy that the law as it stands is fit for purpose, that we go into the unknown with the Bill before us and that we should somehow keep the safety of the status quo.
I think that could not be more wrong.
There are no safeguards in the current law.
The only sanction against coercion is ex post facto; we are leaving it to individual directors of public prosecutions to make decisions in individual cases after the event.
DPPs take that job extremely seriously, as anyone knows who has heard Sir Max Hill, the last DPP to speak on the subject.
They have, at the instigation of the courts, set out guidelines—I think we know that it was an excellent Director of Public Prosecutions who set out the guidelines on this case.
They have done everything they can, but it is not their responsibility; it is our responsibility, and the courts, up to and including the Supreme Court, have made that clear.
We assign in this Bill a role to the High Court as part of the process, but we are the final decision takers.
That has been made clear not only by domestic, but by international courts; the European Court of Human Rights has said in every case in which such matters have come before it that the margin of appreciation should be put into effect and therefore it should not interfere with the law as we decide it.
We cannot dodge our responsibilities and I know that we do not want to do that.
We have a duty to put in place the best law we can, and that is not the law as it stands.
There are three choices for people who want to end their own lives.
They can go to Dignitas alone, if they can afford to do that.
They can attempt, and perhaps succeed in, suicide.
They risk failing.
If they succeed, they will have a lonely death.
They may, as others have pointed out, simply have to resort to refusing treatment or food.
The third option is that they can embroil their relatives or friends, at the risk of their being investigated or prosecuted.
They also risk ending their lives too soon.
On safeguards, I do not follow the view of opponents of the Bill.
At some times they seem to say that they are too complex, too expensive and that there are not enough resources.
If we want to resource the Bill, we can.
I do not think that those are the strongest arguments.
Will my hon.
Friend give way?
I really do not want to, because of the time.
I am sorry.
[Interruption.]
Should I?
I will give way once.
My hon.
Friend talks a little about safeguards.
I invite him and the House to reflect on the covid pandemic, when a lot of safeguards around a lot of things were relaxed.
I worry that if we were to see another pandemic on the scale that we saw in 2020, people might feel that they were doing something patriotic by getting out of the way and freeing up a bed for a younger person.
I invite him to reflect on that.
In practice, a terminally ill person will need to formally consider their decision at least eight times under the provisions in the Bill.
This is a starting point—a number of Members have made that point.
I believe the Bill has already had more scrutiny than most public Bills we consider, but we have up to nine months before us to consider it further.
All the practical and legal considerations point towards the Bill.
It may well be amended to change the safeguards or the way it operates, but we have the opportunity to do that.
In the end, for me, that is not the decision.
The decision is about two things: it is about human dignity and it is about agency.
I would like to think that even at the end of life—no, especially at the end of life—when someone has their faculties but may be at their weakest ebb, they can still exercise that agency and still make decisions for themselves.
They can have the longest life they can and they can end that life in the way that is most beneficial to them, their loved ones and their family.
That is simply not happening, and by voting against the Bill today Members ignore those facts.
When I was a child, my parents shielded me from death.
Centuries of art, literature and religion taught me that death was something noble or even slightly romantic.
When I became an adult, I learnt pretty quickly that that was not the case.
For far too many, it is anything but and certainly not noble.
The deathbed for far too many is a place of misery, torture and degradation, a reign of blood and vomit and tears.
I see no compassion and beauty in that, only profound human suffering.
In 10 years of campaigning on this issue, I have spent many, many hours with dying and bereaved people, which has, time and again, reinforced my view.
I am a co-sponsor of the Bill and I am the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for choice at the end of life.
I could give a speech to promote the Bill, but my hon.
Friend—and I do call her a friend— the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater)  has done that remarkably well.
In my speech I want to address some of the common issues that have been raised, and that will no doubt be raised during the debate, with which I struggle.
First, we will no doubt hear an awful lot about the overseas experience.
I am married to a Canadian, and I can tell the House that they love their children just as much as we do.
The idea that the Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, Spanish and Austrians care little for their relatives, or indeed for the wider society in which they live, is frankly offensive.
We should not pretend that somehow we are special or different.
They have thought as profoundly on these issues as we have over the past 10 years.
We can learn from them, and design a system for our own sensibilities and culture, as they have done.
They all have different laws on abortion, some of which we would not pass in this House, but that does not mean we should not have abortion laws here.
We are a 1,000-year-old democracy, and we should be able to design legislation that deals with this issue for ourselves.
The second issue that has been raised with which I have struggled regards the impact on the NHS and on judges.
People are already dying; they are already in the national health service and entitled to care.
Even if we think there will be an impact, are people seriously telling me that my death, my agony, is too much for the NHS to have time for, or too much hassle?
It is even claimed that such matters would overload the judges—that I should drown in my own faecal vomit because it is too much hassle for the judges to deal with.
We send things from this House to the NHS and to judges all the time.
Is anyone suggesting that we should not create the new offence of spiking, which has come through this week, because judges are overworked?
Of course not.
They will cope as they have done with all sorts of things that we have sent from this House over the years, and we should not countenance the idea that some logistical problem will get in the way of our giving a good death to our fellow citizens.
I also want to address directly those Members who are considering voting against the Bill, to ensure that they are clear in their minds that a vote against the Bill is not a passive act.
There are two states of being on offer today.
I have to break some news to Members: whatever happens to the Bill today, people with a terminal illness will still take their lives.
If the Bill falls today, we will be consigning those people to taking their lives in brutal, violent ways, as they are at the moment, and will see increasing numbers of our fellow citizens making the trip to Switzerland if they can afford it.
We know that between 600 and 700 people a year are killing themselves in violent ways—shooting themselves, throwing themselves in front of trains, taking overdoses in lonely, horrible circumstances.
As I said, many are going to Switzerland, but more than that are lying in hospital—I guarantee that there will be somebody over the river in St Thomas’ hospital now who is refusing treatment and starving themselves to death because they cannot face what is in front of them.
Does the right hon.
Gentleman agree that we had a choice today?
We have come here to debate assisted dying, but we could have come here to build cross-party consensus on how finally, once and for all, to fix palliative care in this country.
We could have come to look at a funding consensus, as that does need to be cross-party.
I agree  with his point that voting no is also a choice, but what follows from that should be a cross-party consensus on how we fix palliative care.
I agree with the hon.
Gentleman, and what a surprise it is that the conversation about palliative care has started.
We were not having that conversation before this Bill came forward.
The evidence from the Health and Care Committee, published only in February this year, shows that palliative care and assisted dying go hand in hand.
rose— I will not give way.
Improvements also go hand in hand; medics from across the world told us that the two things are complementary.
In Australia I discussed this issue with a palliative care doctor who was against the introduction of assisted dying when they were contemplating it.
She now finds it an invaluable tool, and she embraces it as something that her patients want and need.
My concern is that if the Bill is turned down, as it was in 2015, the conversation about palliative care will wither, as it has done for the past 10 years.
I want to share a story that has particularly affected me.
Mark Crampton was a former police chief inspector who was suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
His COPD became too much for him, so he informed his family that he was going to take his own life.
He took his oxygen tank and mask and late one night went out and sat on a railway embankment.
He wanted a death that was instant and quick, and that he could rely on.
He waited until 2 in the morning—heartbreakingly, he had worked out when the last train was going, so he would minimise disruption to the public—and then took his life in lonely circumstances in the middle of the night.
By not passing the Bill, we would deny to Mark supervision, conversation, access to doctors, periods of reflection, advice.
Even if he had been through all that and decided it was still too much, the Bill would give him a much better end than he actually achieved.
Members should be clear, as I say, that whatever happens to the Bill, terminal people will still take their lives.
I have to say to  the hon.
Member for Brent West (Barry Gardiner) , who says that hundreds of people dying in agony every year is a price worth paying for the good of society, that I find that an appalling prospect.
A society that looks away from these people —like those in the Public Gallery who are living in terrible fear of what will face them, or who have watched their families die in fear—and says that that is okay for the good of the whole is a terrible, terrible prospect.
We have a duty to assist them, as other countries around the world have done, and to find a way to make them comfortable in the end.
Will my right hon.
Friend give way?
I will not.
Finally, I want to talk briefly about rights.
We hear a lot about rights in this debate—quite rightly.
We hear about the rights and fears of the disabled community, who are specifically excluded from the Bill; we hear a lot  about the rights and fears of the elderly, who are also specifically excluded from the Bill; we are even hearing about the rights of doctors, who are allowed to conscientiously object to participating in this process, if they wish.
When are we going to have the conversation about the rights of the dying?
Where do we put them in the ranking of rights, as they face their end?
When do we grant them the autonomy and choice for which so many of them have campaigned over the years?
Surely, as they come towards the end of their life, their rights have to be at the forefront of our mind.
The last, best gift we can give them is control over the disease that is destroying them.
