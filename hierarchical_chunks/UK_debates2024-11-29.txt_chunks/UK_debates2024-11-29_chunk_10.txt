I thank my hon.
Friend for her intervention, and I am so sorry to hear that story from her constituency.
We all have stories from all our  constituencies, and she is absolutely right that we are here to make difficult decisions.
On her example there, I have been astonished by the number of people who have been in touch with me to tell me about the terminally ill loved ones who have starved themselves to death out of desperation—something that takes far longer than we may imagine and is just horrific for everyone involved.
That is currently legal, and doctors are required to assist the patient through this agonising process.
How can we allow that, but not a compassionate and humane assisted death?
