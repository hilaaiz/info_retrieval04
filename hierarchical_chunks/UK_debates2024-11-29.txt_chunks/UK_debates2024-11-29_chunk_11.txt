I join  the right hon.
Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)  in commending my hon.
Friend for the way she has made sure that this binary debate has not been a polarising one.
I started the debate where she is now, but I have moved to opposing the Bill by the stories I have heard of disabled people who have had “do not resuscitate” put on their medical records without their permission, or who have been stopped by strangers in the street and been told, “You would be better off dead.”
I know she will say that we are voting on the specifics of her Bill, but we are also voting on a principle.
Does she agree that there should be a precautionary approach, and does she honestly believe the legislative process gives us the time to be sure that we are making the right decision?
