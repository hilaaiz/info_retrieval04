Coming back to palliative care, in situations where pain simply cannot be managed, the result is deaths that are so horrific that the person themselves can spend hours, and in some cases days, in unimaginable pain as they die.
I want to bring the debate back to the issue that we are trying to solve.
For their loved ones, no matter how many joyful and happy memories they have, they also have the trauma that comes from watching someone you love die in unbearable agony and fear.
That memory stays with them forever.
Rebecca’s mum Fiona developed metastatic brain cancer at the age of 69.
She had very good palliative care, but her pain could not be managed, and she died begging and screaming for assistance to end her suffering.
Her family and the medical team treating her cried beside her bedside as it took her 10 days to die.
Lucy’s husband Tom was 47, a music teacher with a young son.
He had bile duct cancer which obstructed his bowel, resulting in an agonising death.
Tom vomited faecal matter for five hours before he ultimately inhaled the faeces and died.
He was vomiting so violently that he could not be sedated and was conscious throughout.
Lucy pleaded with the doctors to help.
The doctor treating him said there was nothing he could do.
His family say that the look of horror on his face as he died will never leave them.
Lucy now has post-traumatic stress disorder, which is quite common for families who lose loved ones in such harrowing circumstances.
