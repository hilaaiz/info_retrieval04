I am grateful to the hon.
Lady for giving way and congratulate her on the measured way in which she has conducted this debate over the last few weeks.
Whatever side of the House and whatever side of the debate, I would like to recognise that—it is not always the case.
But is it not the case that the Bill crosses a new and irreversible medical red line for doctors and nurses?
Is it not the case that in other Bills we have seen in this House over the years, the safeguards invariably become obsolete over time, and so the safeguards in this Bill, however well meant, should be seen as temporary safeguards and not immutable safeguards?
Absolutely not.
I respectfully disagree with the right hon.
Gentleman.
In countries where a Bill of this nature has been implemented, the safeguards have been in place and the boundaries have never changed.
I will come on to talk about that.
rose— I will take one more intervention and then I must make some progress.
