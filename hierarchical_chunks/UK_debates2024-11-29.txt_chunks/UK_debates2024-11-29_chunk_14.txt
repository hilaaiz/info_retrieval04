I thank my hon.
Friend for his intervention.
I suggest that the Bill will give society a much better approach towards end of life.
We are already hearing conversations about dying and death which I do not think we have heard enough in this country.
We have to take a holistic view.
Indeed, that is what happens in other countries and other jurisdictions.
Having those deep and meaningful conversations about death and dying is really important.
My hon.
Friend’s comments bring me on nicely to the protections and safeguards in the Bill.
