Mrs. FLETCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep gratitude to Ben Jackson for his many years of service and exceptional work for Texas' Seventh Congressional District.
After working in Congress for more than 13 years and for our district for almost six years, Ben is leaving my office this year.
Ben has served Texas' Seventh Congressional District for as long as I have, joining our staff as Legislative Director when we opened our office in January 2019.
An integral part of my team from the start, he has worked tirelessly and effectively, handling issues of all kinds.
As our office grew, so did Ben's role in it, as he moved from Legislative Director to Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor.
He has worked on issues of great importance to our district with a portfolio that includes energy, tax, financial services, and economic issues.
While working in my office, Ben also grew in his personal life and became a father to his son, Charles.
Throughout his almost six years serving our district, Ben has built meaningful relationships across our community and has led the way on efforts to ensure our district's and our region's priorities are included in our work, and that our work in Washington delivers meaningful progress back home.
Outstanding in his policy work, Ben was also an outstanding team member who always remained supportive of his colleagues and served as a mentor for many of them.
His work and his positive contributions have had--and will continue to have--a lasting impact on our team and on our district, and we will miss him.
