Mr. Speaker, as we bid farewell to Supervisor Jose ``Moke'' Simon III, we thank him for his service, his contributions to the economic and cultural advancement of his Tribe, and his dedication to public service in Lake County.
His leadership has uplifted our community, and it is only fitting that we honor him here today as he embarks on this new chapter of his life.
