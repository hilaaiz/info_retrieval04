Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Metra Commuter Railroad as it celebrates its 40th anniversary.
Over the last four decades, Mara has provided hundreds of millions of rides to its passengers while gaining a reputation for timeliness, reliability, and safety.
At its inception in 1984.
Metra faced multiple challenges.
It inherited an underinvested rail system and was immediately tasked with addressing a history of unstandardized fares and services in addition to stabilizing struggling private rail lines.
Through acquisitions, subsidizations.
and streamlining of services, Metra delivered on unifying commuter rail across the Chicago region.
Though Metra still faces steep funding challenges for its capital and operational needs, it remains a steady, reliable source of transportation for its riders.
It continues to rebuild and replace downtown stations, outlying stations, track and signals, and other infrastructure.
Metra has purchased new locomotives and railcars, modernized and expanded service, and has survived through underground floods, polar vortexes, and a global pandemic.
I commend Metra's workers for continuing to provide rides every day to my constituents, and I thank Metra's leadership for continuing to push innovation in Chicago's commuter rail system.
I congratulate Metra on its 40th anniversary and look forward to many more years of reliable commuter rail service.
