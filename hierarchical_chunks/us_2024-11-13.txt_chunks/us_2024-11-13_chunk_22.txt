Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the increasing threat of nuclear weapons.
Last year, the United States spent $51.5 billion on nuclear weapons.
Imagine if we used even a fraction of that to tackle homelessness, fund healthcare, or address the climate crisis.
Instead, we're pouring billions into weapons that could wipe out entire cities in seconds.
The simple truth is, as long as nuclear weapons exist, humanity is at risk.
One miscalculation, one malfunction, one act of aggression, and we're looking at a disaster that could end civilization as we know it.
Keeping these weapons isn't about strength or security--it's about holding on to outdated Cold War fears.
The only sane position is the complete abolition of these weapons of mass destruction from the face of the planet.
But this will only happen with bold leadership from the United States.
As tensions rise with adversaries like Russia and China, and concerns grow about nuclear proliferation in volatile regions like the Middle East, the threat of nuclear war is more urgent than it has been since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
That's why I'm grateful to my colleague, Congressman Jim McGovern, for his tireless work in drawing attention to this critical issue.
He understands that we have a moral imperative to act.
It's time for the United States to join the Treaty on the Prohibition an arsenal of world-ending weapons is not a sign of strength--it is a terrifying vulnerability.
The American people deserve leaders who will prioritize human lives over outdated Cold War posturing.
We have the chance to make the world a safer place, redirect resources to pressing domestic needs, and fulfill our obligation to future generations.
The time for action has never been more pressing.
