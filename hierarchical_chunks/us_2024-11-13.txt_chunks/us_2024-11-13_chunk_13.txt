Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate the YMCA of Greater Monmouth County on its 150th Anniversary and continued endeavor to strengthen the individuals, families and communities it serves.
During their 150th Anniversary Dinner, they plan to commemorate this milestone with the pursuit of offering expansive access to fitness, mental health, and education.
It is my privilege to recognize the outstanding efforts of the YMCA.
Since March 16, 1874, this commendable organization has nurtured children and families while fostering strong connected communities throughout the Monmouth County area.
The long history of this YMCA providing youth enrichment to families includes access to summer camp, preschool, and before and after care.
It is truly honorable to fathom the transformation of countless lives across generations from this last century and on.
It is honorable to recognize the community organizers who have demonstrated resilience and unity, as this remarkably shapes the impact of their chapter.
Begun in efforts to support youth in the local area, the YMCA of Greater Monmouth County now stands as a community center.
The acquisition of resources necessary and otherwise inaccessible can be attributed to invaluable growth.
Affordable childcare is one of the most appreciated programs, with therapeutic counseling, tutoring, teen leadership and college pathways tightly following.
I applaud this organization's beloved endless engagement and remarkable success in reaching the Monmouth County community.
Once again, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the YMCA of Greater Monmouth County on its 150th Anniversary of service.
The commitment to wellness has contributed support to help families thrive in our community, and therefore is truly deserving of this body's recognition.
