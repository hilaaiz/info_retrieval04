Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jim DeRose on his retirement as Bradley University's Men's Soccer Coach after 28 successful seasons.
Beginning his career in 1996 at the age of 28 as the youngest coach in NCAA Division I men's soccer, Jim quickly emerged as a dominant figure in the soccer community.
Jim guided the Braves to the regularseason Missouri Valley Conference title in 1998, followed by the program's first NCAA Tournament appearance in 2000.
Under Jim's leadership, Bradley's soccer program reached new heights and resulted in a 2007 run to the NCAA Elite Eight, where Jim was chosen as the Soccer America National Coach of the Year.
Jim's record speaks volumes of his commitment and dedication to the game.
During his tenure as head coach, Bradley held a 267-227-66 record with seven NCAA tournament appearances, the highest for any coach in Bradley University Athletics history.
Jim finishes his career as the second-winningest coach in Missouri Valley Conference soccer history and coached the only four-year all-Americans in MVC men's soccer history.
In addition to his accomplishments on the pitch, the accomplishments his ability to grow his players into successful young men.
Six former assistant coaches have gone on to become NCAA Division I head coaches, sixteen players have been selected for all-American academic awards, and nine have been selected in the Major League Soccer SuperDraft.
Jim has been an integral part of growing the game of soccer throughout central Illinois and his legacy will last for years to come.
It is my privilege to congratulate Jim DeRose on his retirement after 28 years with Bradley University Men's Soccer and wish him, his wife Robin, and his two children, Raleigh and J.R., all the best.
