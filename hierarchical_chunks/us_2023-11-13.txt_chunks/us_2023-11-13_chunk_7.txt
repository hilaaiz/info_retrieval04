Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Business Uninterrupted Monetary Program Act of 2023 (BUMP Act).
This crucial piece of legislation provides essential funding to businesses and nonprofits that have been directly and measurably fInancially impacted by major transportation projects, with the goal of keeping them solvent.
With major transit and highway projects planned across the country, the livelihoods and survival of some local businesses may be at risk because of construction disruptions that impede customers' access to their store fronts.
