Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise today to recognize The Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.
On August 7th, on the field of Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, the Bluecoats nearly achieved a perfect routine, scoring a 98.75 out of 100 to win the second world championship in their corps' history.
This current win comes on the heels of them holding second place in the championships in 2022 and 2023.
The Drum Corps International World Championships was the grand finale for the Bluecoats' busy summer.
The championship was the last show after a string of 17 competitive shows and 21 performances on its 8,000-mile national tour.
The Bluecoats are a perfect example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional District is known as the ``Birthplace.''
Once again, I'd like to congratulate the Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps for bringing this World Championship home.
We are so proud of your hard work and incredible talent.
