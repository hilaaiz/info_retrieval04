Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate September 19, 2024, as the inaugural National App Challenge Day.
This day honors the innovation, creativity, and technical skills of our nation's youth, who are the driving force behind our future's technological advancements.
The National App Challenge Day was established to encourage young students from across the United States to develop their coding skills, explore their creativity, and apply their problem-solving abilities to real-world issues.
This initiative aligns with our nation's broader goal of promoting K-12 STEM education and preparing our students to be competitive in the global economy.
Since its inception, the Congressional App Challenge has inspired over 58,000 students, across all 50 states and territories to engage in computer science and technology.
By participating in this challenge, students gain invaluable experience in teamwork, critical thinking, and innovation.
The apps developed by these young coders address a wide range of issues, from improving educational resources to creating solutions for community challenges.
National App Challenge Day highlights the importance of investing in our youth and supporting STEM education.
It is a day to celebrate the achievements of all student participants and to recognize the mentors, educators, and community leaders who support and inspire these students.
As a recovering computer science major and one of the co-chairs of the Congressional App Challenge, I recognize the importance of supporting initiatives that foster innovation and creativity among our nation's youth.
Let the National App Challenge Day serve as a catalyst for future leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers who will shape the world of tomorrow.
