Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Marvin Turner, who passed away on August 12, 2024.
Marvin was a dedicated civil servant and worked tirelessly to make the District of Columbia the 51st state.
Marvin was a native of Atlanta, Georgia.
After graduating high school, Marvin joined Job Corps and then began his career fighting for the rights of workers and for fair housing in North Carolina and South Carolina with the Service Employees International Union.
Marvin came to D.C. to work for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
Soon after arriving in D.C., Marvin became a staffer for then-Mayor Sharon Pratt and then became a member of my staff.
In 2013, Marvin was appointed as a commissioner on the District of Columbia Sentencing and Criminal Code Revision Commission, where he worked with other commissioners and D.C. Councilmembers to revise sentencing guidelines and the criminal code.
During his career, Marvin worked closely with Reverend Jesse Jackson as an advance staffer, as well as serving as the D.C. Statehood Coordinator for the National Rainbow Coalition.
Marvin's work on the local and national levels ultimately led to him working for the Democratic National Committee's Office of the Secretary for nearly 20 years.
Marvin's work left an indelible mark on both D.C. and our Nation.
I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life and legacy.
