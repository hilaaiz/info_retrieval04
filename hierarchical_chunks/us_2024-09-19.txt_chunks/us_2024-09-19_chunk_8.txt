Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Detective Matthew King of the North Canton Police Department as Ohio's 13th Congressional District Champion of the Week.
Detective King was recognized by his peers as the Police Officer of the year for the North Canton Police Department.
King has been a police officer since 2018, and has been with the North Canton Police Department since 2019.
In 2021, Officer King was promoted to Detective King when he graduated as the Valedictorian of his Drug Recognition Expert Class, earning a 99.14 percent grade point average.
He is also a member of the Stark County Metro Narcotics Unit and the OVI Task Force.
This honor is not Detective King's first award.
In 2021, he was awarded the Stark County Traffic Office of the Year.
Detective King has been a model police officer for many years.
Once again, I'd like to congratulate Detective Matthew King on this distinction, and thank him for his tireless public service to North Canton.
He is a perfect example of why Ohio's 13th Congressional District is known as the ``Birthplace.''
