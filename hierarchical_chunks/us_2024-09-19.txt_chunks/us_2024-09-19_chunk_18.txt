Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Pat Goin, who will be concluding her tenure as Chair of the North American Blueberry Council at the end of this year.
This August, I had the honor of visiting Pat and her husband Kevin at their blueberry farm, Goin's Blueberry Lane, in North Judson, Indiana as part of my district-wide ``Factories, Freeways, and Fields'' tour.
During my visit, I had the opportunity to learn more about their family-owned and operated blueberry farm that has been in business since 1980.
Just as importantly, I was able to see firsthand Pat's great character and the passion she has for consistently putting out a high-quality product over all these years.
I am immensely grateful to Pat for the warm hospitality that my team and I received on our visit, as well as for the fresh and ripe blueberries that she, Kevin, and their family have been producing for more than 40 years.
I also greatly appreciate the leadership that Pat has provided to the North American Blueberry Council in her role as Chair on behalf of our blueberry producers and those connected to the blueberry industry all across our country.
Our farmers and agricultural producers are some of the most industrious and important men and women anywhere in America, and I know that Pat has done a great service by effectively advocating on behalf of blueberry growers and their interests.
God bless Pat Goin.
