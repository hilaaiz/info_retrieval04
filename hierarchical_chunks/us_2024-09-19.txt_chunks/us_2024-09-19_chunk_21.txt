recognize the outstanding efforts of PRAHD to improve the well-being of our communities.
The rich history of this organization started with the mindset of the late Roberto Clemente.
As a human service agency, the PRAHD staff is dedicated to being an open door for community members facing life altering obstacles.
Honorably, the amazing organization has served over 14,000 people in the last year, feeding over 400 families annually.
In May of 1974, the organization began their impact by operating youth services within Perth Amboy and have since expanded to serve Middlesex, Monmouth, Union, and Hudson counties.
For 50 years, PRAHD has succeeded in an exemplary campaign for the betterment of impoverished individuals.
Their expansive human services empower the individual to reach their highest potential.
I applaud PRAHD for its remarkable generosity.
