Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate The Fresh Market on being named one of the top Grocery Stores in America by USA Today and being ranked number one in the following categories: Best Grocery Store Bakery, Best Grocery Store Deli, and Best Grocery Store
Prepared Food.
Originally founded right here in North Carolina, The Fresh Market has taken its renowned freshness and customer service to over 150 stores across 22 states.
While The Fresh Market has grown and expanded its footprint across the country, it has never stopped focusing on the things that its home state is known for, good food and good people.
Whether you're grabbing something quick to go, or enjoying one of their many baked goods, The Fresh Market has something for everyone.
The Fresh Market has shown its commitment to providing the highest quality food and produce to its customers, and that commitment is clearly reflected in these outstanding rankings.
I can confidently say that we here in North Carolina could not be prouder of our local company which has achieved such national recognition for its incredible quality.
Again, congratulations to all the folks at The Fresh Market.
They should feel extremely proud of all their hard work and dedication.
