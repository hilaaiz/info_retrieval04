Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate West Point implement on a half-century of doing business.
Fifty years ago, Buddy Ternus, Francis Sand, and Erv Eisenmenger started this business that has grown significantly and evolved to meet the needs of the community through the years.
Today, Erv and his sons Scott and Chad run West Point Implement as a family business.
Over the past five decades, the business has expanded to include West Point Design and EIS, Mfg.
One of the keys to their success has been their commitment ``to stay alert to change, and to lead the way for our employees and our customers toward being the best in the business of production agriculture.''
Cuming County, which is home to West Point Implement, has over 360,000 acres of farmland and is one of the top counties for cattle in Nebraska.
Consequently, West Point Implement has played a pivotal part in helping the ag economy grow in Cuming County in its years of business.
Congratulations to West Point Implement and the Eisenmenger family on reaching this milestone--here's to the next fifty years.
