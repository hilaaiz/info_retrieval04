Mr. BOST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cris Edwards of Olney, Illinois, for being named a National Distinguished Principal by the National Association.
Cris is the principal for Richland County Elementary School, which serves nearly 1,000 rural students.
The elementary school's mission is to ``develop respectful, responsible learners and leaders.''
Under Cris Edwards' watch, that mission is being fulfilled.
Her devotion is recognized by students, parents, and teachers alike.
The school was given the high honor of ``Legacy School'' by the Leader in Me program.
They host ``High Five Fridays'' to build connections in the community.
And they launched a mobile library in an old school bus to deliver books in the summer.
Cris has earned her status as a National Distinguished Principal, just as she has earned her new position as the incoming president of the Illinois Principals Association.
