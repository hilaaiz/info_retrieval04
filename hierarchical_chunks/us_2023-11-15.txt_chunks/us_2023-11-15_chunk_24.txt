Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Benzie Area Christian Neighbors (BACN) for 40 years of dedicated service and charity.
BACN serves as an inspiration to the community, standing by their mission of improving the quality of life for others and lending a hand to those in need.
Founded in 1983, BACN has since performed an integral role in the Benzie Area.
The group provides direct, needs-based assistance to those in the area who desperately require it.
If BACN can't provide the support necessary themselves, they always assist with a referral to those who can.
Over the years as BACN grew, it began to transform from a growing charity to a vibrant organization of faithful people working to better our society.
For 40 years, the list of services that BACN offers has expanded substantially.
Today, BACN is proud to provide a stocked food pantry, a large clothing center, adult education opportunities, financial assistance and so much more.
BACN also partners with larger philanthropic entities in order to extend the best possible services to the Northern Michigan community.
Through their collaborative efforts, no one who seeks help is turned away empty handed.
The spirit of selflessness and compassion which characterizes BACN is what makes it special.
Dedicated volunteers fill many crucial roles within the BACN network, serving as coordinators, organizers, and staff in all of the different locales of service.
Their commitment and support have kept BACN running efficiently these past 40 years.
