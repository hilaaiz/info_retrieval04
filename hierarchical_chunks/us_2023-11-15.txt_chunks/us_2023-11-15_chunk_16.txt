Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Southlake Carroll's Water Polo Team, the Lady Dragons.
In only their second year as a UIL program, the Southlake Carroll Lady Dragons Water Polo team has already achieved back-to-back appearances at the UIL 6A state tournament.
This year, they took 2nd place at the State Championships.
The Lady Dragons finished their 2023 season as District Champions, Regional Champions, and State Runner-Up, achieving a 23-2 overall record for the season.
Congratulations to the Southlake Carroll Lady Dragons Water Polo team on an amazing season and all of their accomplishments.
I look forward to cheering them on next season and wish all graduating seniors the best of luck.
