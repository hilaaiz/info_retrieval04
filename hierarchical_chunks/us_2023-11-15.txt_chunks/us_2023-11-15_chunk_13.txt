Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a Crystal Lake, Illinois native, Lorraine Egan, for her service in the United States Navy.
Following the unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Lorraine proclaimed that she would be ``joining the Navy,'' following in the footsteps of her father who had served in WWI.
On December 8, just the day after the attack, her father took her to the Navy's recruitment center.
Lorraine entered the Navy as part of the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) program, and in her words ``learned to be tough in a gentle way,'' which she said was necessary to push back against some of the men who were less supportive of women being in the military.
She was among the first 200 women to join the Navy.
The Navy sent Lorraine to Hunter College in New York where she attended nursing school before being sent to complete basic training at Naval Station Great Lakes in Lake County, Illinois.
Lorraine was then deployed to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and was involved in surgeries and delivering babies, parts of the job she loved the most.
Her daughter notes that Lorraine enjoyed almost every aspect of the job, recalling that ``she just loved all the work.''
Former service members call her an inspiration.
as not only did she have to pave the path for women to join the military, but ``she had to figure out the path.. and bring the stones.''
At 101 years old, Lorraine encourages young women she meets to join the military as it pays for their education, instills a strong work ethic, and teaches people to be thoughtful and care about others.
