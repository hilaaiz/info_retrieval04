Mr. VARGAS.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor Linda Kay Mitrovich, a beloved friend, leader and mentor.
Linda was born on May 18, 1947, in Whittier.
California.
She was a dedicated public servant.
She served on the Poway City Council and was Deputy Mayor from 1986 through 1990.
She committed her life to the betterment of others and took on many important causes, including environmental protection and Native American sovereignty.
She played a significant role in creating the first Wildlife Corridor in California.
the Coal Canyon Wildlife Reserve, which supported the ecological well-being of over twenty-two million people in Southern California.
Linda also created the first national conference on Native American Sovereignty in 2000.
The California State Legislature also recognized her accomplishments by naming her Woman of the Year in 1988 and 1991.
Linda's legacy is remembered through her husband and five children, and her memory is cherished by those fortunate enough to have met her.
