Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor South Florida's first responders as they are celebrated at the fourth annual Blue Mass at Assumption Catholic Church taking place in Florida's 23rd Congressional District on November 15, 2023.
Today and every day, America's first responders remain on alert and on call whenever we need them.
Putting themselves at great personal risk.
They are our police officers and sheriff's deputies protecting our communities.
They are our firefighters running into burning buildings or emergency medical technicians, paramedics, 911 dispatchers and other public health workers providing emergency cases.
There are not enough words to explain how grateful we are to all our extraordinary brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way each day, to keep our Nation safe.
