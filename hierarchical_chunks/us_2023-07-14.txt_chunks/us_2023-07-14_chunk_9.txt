Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the lives of the Oddo brothers, 6 men who courageously served their country as naval seamen following the outbreak of WWII.
Their father, Charles Oddo, was a Sicilian immigrant who settled in Bellevue, Ohio with his wife Mary.
They raised their sons to acknowledge the prestige and privilege of being American citizens.
Richard, William, Charles, Samuel, Carl, and James Oddo all faithfully served their nation, and are believed to be the largest set of siblings to serve in the U.S. Navy.
Thankfully, all 6 brothers returned home safely to start their lives in their hometown after their honorable service, where the Oddo family still gathers today.
Saturday, they will be honored with a plaque at the Dr. Jackson Commemorative Plaque Wall within the Navy memorial.
More than 2 dozen family and friends will be in attendance to pay tribute to their heroism.
Ohio salutes these exceptional men, who continued to serve their families, neighbors, and communities throughout their lives.
