Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and I; along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in honoring and commending the Reverend Dr. Gregory A. Sutton for 53 years of dedicated service to his God, Jackson Memorial Baptist Church and humankind.
Moreover, we pray God's continued blessings upon him, his ministry, and his family in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
