great detail.
Amid heavy rain, Susan stood illuminated by single a beam of sunlight.
For 3 years, the couple communicated through letters, finding peace in each other's presence amid the chaos of war.
Immediately after the war, Bob called Susan and proposed marriage.
They were married in a Nissen hut outside the ruins of a bombed English church in 1946.
They spent 72 wonderful years together and had three children.
They now have 4 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren.
Bob selflessly put his life on the on the line to defend America's freedom during one of its most challenging periods.
President Roosevelt famously referred to the Merchant Mariners' mission during World War II as ``the most difficult and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken.
It is my humble privilege to present Bob with the highest honor bestowed by Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal.
This award is 1 of numerous honors that Bob has received for his service, including the Atlantic War Zone Medal, the Merchant Marine Combat Bar with Silver Star device, and the World War II Victory Medal.
I congratulate Lieutenant Commander Bessell, on this well-deserved recognition.
A grateful Nation thanks him for his service.
