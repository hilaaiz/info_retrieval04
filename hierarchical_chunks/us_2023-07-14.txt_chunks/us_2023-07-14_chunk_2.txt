Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Wesley (Bob) Bessell for being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his service and bravery in the U.S. Merchant Marines during World War II.
Bob began his maritime career at the age of 15, as a member of the crew of the Corsair, an impressive private yacht owned by the J.P. Morgan family.
Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, and it was during his training that America entered World War II.
Upon the completion of his training, Bob joined the U.S. Merchant Marines as an Able-Bodied Seaman.
He served as a merchant mariner for more than 4\1/2\ years, which included a deployment on the SS West Hardaway when it was sunk by a torpedo from a German U-boat in 1942.
After the U-boat attack, Bob and his fellow sailors took refuge in the small town of Porlamar on Isla de Margarita in Venezuela.
The island's inhabitants, though facing their own challenges, extended a warm welcome to the stranded crew, offering them shelter, sustenance and a renewed sense of hope.
Bob forged bonds of friendship with the local community, transcending language barriers and cultural differences, and he recalls walking around the island like a rockstar, always surrounded by 10 or 20 smiling faces.
In 1943, Bob completed Officer Candidate School and rose to the rank of a lieutenant commander.
It was in the same year, on a mission to deliver documents in Liverpool, England, that Bob met Susan, the British love
