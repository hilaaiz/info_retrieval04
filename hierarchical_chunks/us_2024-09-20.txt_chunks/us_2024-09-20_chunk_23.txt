Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Detective Dale Ingram of Van Alstyne, Texas.
Detective Ingram has dedicated himself to faithfully serving and protecting our community.
Since 1978, Detective Ingram has served as a law enforcement officer in North Texas.
Throughout his 45 years in uniform, he has worked as a patrol officer, warrant officer, detective, and as a member of the North Texas Child Abuse Task Force.
Currently, Detective Ingram works for the Van Alstyne Police Department.
In his career, he has diligently fought to protect our children from harm and ensure our communities are safe.
In May, Detective Ingram was tragically diagnosed with a late stage brain tumor, which has affected his quality of life.
Despite this diagnosis, he has tirelessly fought to spend as much time with his family as possible.
When Detective Ingram's children went through his old files and keepsakes, they found that he had received countless exemplary reviews from superiors and commendations for his selfless service as a law enforcement officer.
Some weren't written down, as they involved his actions in protecting the lives of children who did not have a voice.
For decades, he has served North Texas with great pride and honor, unafraid of those who wish to do harm.
Outside of the uniform, Detective Ingram is a loving husband, father, and grandfather to thirteen grandchildren.
I am confident that he will fully triumph in the battle against cancer, and I wish him a complete recovery so that he may spend many more years with his family.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over out Nation's Capitol in recognition of Detective Ingram's extensive public service and dedication to the people.
May God Bless him.
