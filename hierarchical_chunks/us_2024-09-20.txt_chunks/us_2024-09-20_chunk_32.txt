Ms. Kennedy always ensured that those around her felt loved.
She was everyone's loudest cheerleader, strongest supporter, and best friend.
She relentlessly encouraged her family and friends to strive for the impossible and reach for the stars.
She always wanted to make everyone feel seen and special, armed with her thousand-watt smile and contagious laughter.
Today, 
Ms. Kennedy is remembered as a hard-working woman of God, who put the needs of others first, had a profound love for her children and family, and continuously fought for her health.
Please join me in honoring 
Ms. Tracey Anne Kennedy for her lifetime of dedication to service and faith.
