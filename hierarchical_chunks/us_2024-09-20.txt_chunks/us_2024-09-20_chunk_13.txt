Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with my colleague Congressman Mike Thompson, to honor and commend Sustainable Solano as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.
This remarkable milestone is a testament to the crucial work Sustainable Solano has accomplished to support sustainable food access in Solano County.
First established as the Benicia Community Gardens in 1999, Sustainable Solano's all-volunteer organization has spearheaded efforts to bolster local food systems and promote ecologically sustainable practices in Solano County.
Since its founding, Sustainable Solano has installed 68 sustainable gardens and planted over 400 trees, helping bring green infrastructure to urban areas in Solano County.
Sustainable Solano's critical initiatives are combating food insecurity in our communities, raise public awareness about the climate crisis, and support our local farmers.
In addition, Sustainable Solano's efforts to promote youth engagement will help encourage today's youth to become the environmental advocates and sustainability leaders of tomorrow.
As our planet faces increasingly severe threats from the climate crisis, organizations like Sustainable Solano are critical to building sustainable, resilient communities.
We look forward to seeing the essential work Sustainable Solano will continue to accomplish in our communities and beyond.
On behalf of the constituents of California's Fourth and Eighth Congressional District, we would like to congratulate Sustainable Solano on its 25th anniversary and extend our sincere gratitude for its service to the Solano County community.
