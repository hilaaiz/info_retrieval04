Mr. PENCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize former mayor of Shelbyville, Tom DeBaun.
First elected in 2011, Tom served his community as mayor for three terms.
As mayor, he prioritized economic development and residents, establishing an adult high school, creating Advantage Shelby County, and investing in trails and sidewalks to increase accessibility.
Before serving as mayor, Tom was a probation officer and head of the city's building and planning commission.
Today, I thank Tom for his service and support for the Hoosiers of Shelbyville.
