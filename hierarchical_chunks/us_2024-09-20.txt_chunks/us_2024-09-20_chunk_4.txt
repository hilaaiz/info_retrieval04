Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Recognition Day and honor those who were held captive and were returned, as well as those who remain missing.
Established in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, National POW/MIA Recognition Day is held yearly on the third Friday.
This day is marked by ceremonies at the Pentagon and at military installations across the Nation.
More than 81,000 American service personnel are missing from previous conflicts and approximately 38,000 are believed to be recoverable.
I commend the work of the Defense POW/ MIA Accounting Agency in searching for our missing Americans and ensuring that no service member is left behind.
As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I work hard each year to ensure that the POW/MIA Accounting Agency has the necessary funding to continue their essential work.
We have a duty to these service members that have endured unspeakable indignities to protect and preserve our freedoms.
The United States cannot and will not abandon the search for those who gave their last full measure of devotion in overseas wars.
I cannot express the depth of my gratitude for every patriot who have served our Nation.
I will continue to use my role in Congress to bring every imprisoned or missing servicemember home.
Mr. Speaker, please join me and all of our colleagues in the House of Representatives in commemorating National POW/MIA Recognition Day.
