Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, I would like to recognize Cathy Schwanke for her work with the Anthem, New River, Desert Hills, and Phoenix Republican Club.
Cathy saw a need to educate Republicans in the northern most areas of our Congressional District and was a driving force in creating this group.
She works tirelessly to keep members engaged in the political process, promote civic engagement, and educate citizens on Republican principles.
I am thankful for Cathy's leadership and dedication to conservative principles.
I sincerely appreciate her service to Congressional District 8 and the State.
