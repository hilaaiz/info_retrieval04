Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 35th anniversary of Fairfax Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), a nonprofit organization that has provided direct advocacy and support to abused and neglected children in Fairfax County's child welfare system.
Since its establishment, Fairfax CASA has made an immeasurable impact on the lives of these children.
Fairfax CASA plays a crucial role by vetting, training, and supervising community volunteers who are appointed by the Fairfax County Juvenile Domestic Relations District Court to represent the best interests of children in open abuse and neglect cases.
Over the last 35 years, the organization has trained nearly 1,900 volunteers, serving almost 9,000 children since its inception in 1989.
The vision to bring CASA to Fairfax County began with Judge Jane Delbridge, who recognized the need for neutral, dedicated advocates in her courtroom.
After attending a 1985 conference for judges and district attorneys, Judge Delbridge worked alongside Fairfax attorney Carole Coile, as well as former Director of Court Services Vince Pichcano and other court professionals, to launch the program.
Fairfax CASA officially opened its doors in 1989, and its first child abuse case was assigned to a Court Appointed Special Advocate on January 17 Since then, Fairfax CASA has continued to grow, both in scope and in the number of children it serves.
From its first year, when 37 community members volunteered and 80 children were served, to today, where the program assists an average of 350 children annually, Fairfax CASA has remained a vital resource for the community.
In the most recent fiscal year, Fairfax CASA served 395 children from 230 families.
Over the course of its 35-year history, Fairfax CASA volunteers have submitted over 10,000 comprehensive reports to the Court, ensuring that judges are equipped with the information necessary to make decisions in the best interests of the children.
These reports are an essential component of the advocacy process, shining a light on the circumstances that might otherwise go unheard in the judicial system.
Fairfax CASA's success is not just measured in the number of cases handled but in the lasting difference it has made in the lives of thousands of children.
The program's deep commitment to direct advocacy, as well as its push for systemic change, has earned it the respect and admiration of the entire child welfare community.
As Fairfax CASA celebrates 35 years of service, we are reminded of the immense value of its mission.
Until the day comes when no child in Fairfax County needs the services of a Court Appointed Special Advocate, Fairfax CASA will continue to stand as a pillar of hope and protection for the children who need it most.
