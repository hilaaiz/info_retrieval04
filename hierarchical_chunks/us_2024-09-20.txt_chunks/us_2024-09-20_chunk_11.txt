Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Judith Pittman, Chief Executive Officer.
Judith has been serving communities in Northern Virginia through Second Story since 1995.
Since 1972, Second Story has worked closely with youth and families across Northern Virginia through strategic programs to help them work towards selfsufficiency as well as break cycles of homelessness, abuse, and poverty.
As Chief Executive Officer, Judith has used her background of almost 30 years in nonprofit management and advocacy to obtain more services for at-risk, abused, homeless and runaway youth--including opening seven new programs since 2004 targeted to this population.
Because of Judith, thousands of youths and families have been able to write their Second Stories.
Judith has served on federal panels to develop standards for federally funded programs serving runaway, homeless, and street youth.
She also was a Greater Washington Nonprofit Roundtable Fellow.
She has presented at numerous National Conferences on topics relevant to youth and young adults.
Judith serves on the Policy Advisory Committee for the National Network for Youth.
She is a member of the Successful Children and Youth Policy Team of Fairfax County as a former Board Member for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Training and Technical Assistance Advisory Board.
