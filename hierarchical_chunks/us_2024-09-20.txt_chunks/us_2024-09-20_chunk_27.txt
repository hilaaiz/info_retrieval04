Mr. PENCE.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to mark the passing of a dear friend.
On May 14, Michael Steinbarger of Edinburgh, Indiana sadly left this world.
Michael was a native of my hometown of Columbus, Indiana and married his wife, Anngie, in 1982.
From that point on, they shared their lives together on a farm in Edinburgh, where they raised two daughters, Hayley Clark and Michelle Tobias.
Michael was an active servant of his community, proudly serving with the Shelby County Farm Bureau Board, Shelby County 4-H, Flat Rock Volunteer Fire Department, and was a member of the St. George Lutheran Church.
I am especially thankful for Michael and Anngie's wise counsel and service as it relates to my Sixth District Agriculture Advisory Board.
My heart goes out to Anngie, their two children, and their families.
All who knew Michael were better for having known him, and he will be greatly missed.
