Senator Dunn is survived by her beloved husband, the Honorable Grover Dunn; her daughter, the Honorable Karen Dunn Burks (Eric Burks-- deceased), her brother, Herman L. Lumzy; two grandsons, Grover Blake Burks and Frederick Brock Burks; nephews, Herman Lumzy (Jasmine), Mario Lumzy (Rhonda); her niece, Tameeka Lumzy Todd (Jeremiah) and a host of relatives and friends.
On a personal note, I was blessed to have known 
Senator Dunn and her wonderful family.
As Alabama's first Black Congresswoman, I stand on the shoulders of amazing leaders like 
Senator Dunn who opened the doors for me and many others.
She was a grand dame whose footsteps we as Black women elected officials in Alabama are blessed to follow.
On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy the State of Alabama and our Nation.
