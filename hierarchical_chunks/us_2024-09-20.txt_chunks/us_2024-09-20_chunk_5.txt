Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter of the American Business Women's Association (ABWA), based in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and to celebrate American Business Women's Day.
ABWA's Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter held its first meeting on May 22, 2019.
Since then, the organization has provided opportunities for local business leaders to network and learn from one another.
Through their work to recognize the rich contributions of women in business, members have brought together businesswomen from various fields and highlighted their voices at the local and national level.
I thank the Fredericksburg Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter for their unwavering commitment to fostering growth and excellence, spotlighting the role of local businesswomen in growing Virginia's economy, and
