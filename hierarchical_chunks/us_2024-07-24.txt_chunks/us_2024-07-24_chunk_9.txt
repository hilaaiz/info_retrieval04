Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize the 100th birthday of Greg Shorey, a patriot who has been so important for families in South Carolina developing the modern two-party system.
As South Carolina Republican Party Chairman from 1958 to 1961, he was a courageous pioneer to launch the modern Republican Party.
Beginning with the first elected Republican of the Twentieth Century, Charlie Boineau was elected to the State House in August 1961, representing Richland County.
Now, Republicans have super majorities in the State House and Senate, all statewide officials are Republicans, and eight of nine federal officials in the U.S. House of Representatives are Republican.
Chairman Greg Shorey is a champion for promoting limited government, expanded freedom, and peace through strength as hallmarks for Republican success.
