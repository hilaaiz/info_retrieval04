Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, during the last three years, Americans have endured the highest inflation in 40 years, costing the average family $13,000 more a year to buy the basics.
Under President Donald Trump, inflation was 1.4 percent.
Since then, costs have risen over 20 percent.
Families saw prices for Fourth of July celebration staples skyrocket: Ground beef was up 23 percent Sodas up 22 percent Hot dogs up 16 percent Ice cream also up 16 percent... just to name a few.
House Republicans and Donald Trump are committed to stopping reckless spending and restoring fiscal responsibility.
Corrupt Judge Merchan has unintentionally re-elected Donald Trump and removed Biden, clearly earning my invitation to the Trump Inauguration.
Unethical conduct backfires.
In conclusion, God Bless Our Troops as the Global War on Terrorism continues.
We do not need new border laws; we need to enforce existing laws.
Biden shamefully opens borders for dictators, as more 9/11 attacks across America are imminent, as repeatedly warned by the FBI.
