Badge Brothers, fostering camaraderie and unity among his colleagues.
Today, 
Mr. Krug is a proud South Buffalo native.
His unwavering commitment and dedication extends beyond his work, which is evident in his role as a devoted husband to the late Teresa Dougherty, proud father to Liz and Abbie, and loving grandfather to Addison.
His children have followed in his footsteps by serving their community as firefighters with the Buffalo Fire Department.
Please join me in congratulating David Krug on a career well spent, and wishing him well as he enters this new chapter of his life.
