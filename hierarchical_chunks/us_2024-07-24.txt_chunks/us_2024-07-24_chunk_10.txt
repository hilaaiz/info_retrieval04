Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Serres Family as they celebrate 100 years of the Serres Ranch.
The longevity of this great dynasty is a remarkable accomplishment and a testament to the Serres family's creativity, tenacity, dedication, and commitment to our vibrant agricultural community.
Serres Ranch was originally owned by Fighting Joe Hooker after the Mexican American War and the Bear Flag Revolt.
Mr. Hooker sold the property to George Watriss from New York.
Mr. Watriss moved his family onto the land after the purchase in 1857 and partnered with the Serres Family.
The property was known as the Watriss-Serres Ranch.
The property was fully acquired by the Serres Family in 1924 establishing Serres Ranch.
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Serres Ranch cultivated row crops, grapevines, and operated a thriving dairy farm.
Generations of the Serres Family, including John Pierre and John Pierre ``Toots'' Serres, dedicated their lives to nurturing the land and preserving its legacy.
The entrepreneurial spirit of the Serres family manifested in Serres Construction, founded in 1929 by Franklin Watriss Serres and his father John Pierre ``Toots'' Serres.
This venture evolved into Serres Corporation under the leadership of John Pierre Serres, reflecting the family's commitment to innovation and economic growth.
Today, Serres Ranch stands as a model of sustainable agriculture and family stewardship.
It is managed by John Pierre Serres and Judy Serres, alongside their children John, Buck, and Taylor Serres.
The legacy continues with the fifth generation overseeing the farming their rich family history.
Today, the ranch encompasses 200 acres, with 130 acres dedicated to grapevines, all sustainably grown and climate adaptation certified.
The diverse enterprises under the Serres Family umbrella, including Serres Ranch, Serres Corporation, and Serres Ranch Wine, exemplify their dedication to preserving the land and fostering community.
