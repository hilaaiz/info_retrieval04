The need for hard work will always be there and I encourage you to never shy away from a tough challenge.
You have shown what you can accomplish when you put your heart and mind to doing something worthwhile.
So, each of you should be extremely proud of your accomplishments.
You have worked hard to receive a wonderful education, so be confident of your abilities and be optimistic as you meet the future head on.
Our society faces many challenges right now, and politics can seem more divided than ever, but I can tell you from my own experience that there is no greater honor than service to your community.
I want to thank President Jackson and the faculty again for the honor of being with you today.
I want to thank the families and friends for letting me share in the celebration of these graduates.
And, of course, I want to thank you, the Class of 2024 for the opportunity to be with you today.
I wish you all the best in the years to come.
May God Bless.
