Mr. COMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bilby Family of Franklin County who has received the 2024 Angels in Adoption Award from the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.
Each year, CCAI selects individuals across the country who are committed to improving the lives of children in need of loving homes.
The Bilby Family started their journey in 2017 and immediately recognized the need for foster parents in Kentucky.
In 2019, 2-year-old James came into the family's life.
Since adopting James, the Bilby Family has grown closer, and James has become an integral part of their family.
Their story can serve as a blueprint for others who seek to open their homes and hearts to children in need of a forever family.
The entire 1st Congressional District of Kentucky should be proud of the Bilby Family.
