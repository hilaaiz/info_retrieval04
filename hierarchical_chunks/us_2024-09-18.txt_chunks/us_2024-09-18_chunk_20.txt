Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian; and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, in recognizing 
Mr. Scott Orr's over four decades of service to Georgia Power, the citizens of Georgia, and our great Nation.
May God continue to bless him and his family as he moves to the next chapter of his remarkable life.
