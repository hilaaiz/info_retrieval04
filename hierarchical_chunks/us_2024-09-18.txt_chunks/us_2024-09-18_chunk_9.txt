Mr. Kastrantas was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Greece, where he joined the Greek army and mastered the art of cartography.
He returned to the U.S. in 1939 and immediately enlisted to serve his country.
He was personally selected by Lieutenant Colonel James Gavin to contribute his artistic and linguistic abilities to the 505th Parachute Infantry.
Mr. Kastrantas was a skilled mapmaker and spoke five languages fluently, allowing him to be an incredible asset to the 82nd Airborne Division during World War II.
Affectionately nicknamed ``The Greek,'' he used his skills to map drop points at Normandy and completed four combat jumps in Normandy, Sicily, Salerno, and Holland as a paratrooper.
His intelligence and abilities were invaluable, enabling him to create a 3-dimensional sand table map for his unit's mission on D-Day.
Nick also fought in the Battle of the Bulge and earned six bronze stars, the Combat Infantryman Badge, and the Parachutist Badge through his heroic service.
