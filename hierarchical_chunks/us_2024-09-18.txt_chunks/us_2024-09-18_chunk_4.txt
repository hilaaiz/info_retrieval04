Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize former staff member Beatrice Holding for her service to the citizens of the District.
Beatrice was a valued team member, and both her contributions and presence will be missed.
Upon graduating from the University of North Carolina, she took on staff assistant duties in the Washington Office and immediately became a welcomed, energetic face.
As the daughter of former Congressman George Holding from North Carolina, Beatrice was already familiar with the work of Congress and was able to jump directly into policy work, eventually earning her the title.
Beatrice brought a unique background to the office being a dual U.S.- U.K. citizen, always helping the staff and myself to use proper English.
I offer her the best of luck as she continues her career in politics working on the campaign of North Carolina U.S. Congressional Candidate Brad Knott.
In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected America for 20 years as the Global War
On Terrorism moves from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.
We do not need new border laws.
We need to enforce the existing border laws.
Harris shamefully opens borders for dictators as more 9/11 attacks across America are imminent, as repeatedly warned by the FBI.
