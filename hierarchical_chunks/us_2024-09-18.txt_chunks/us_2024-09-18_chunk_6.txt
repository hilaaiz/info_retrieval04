Senator Ford continued his life of service after his Senate career ended, teaching at the University of Kentucky, working with young people at the Wendell H. Ford Education Center in Owensboro, and serving as a mentor to countless young leaders across the Commonwealth.
He passed away on January 22, 2015, at the age of 90.
His wife Jean celebrated her 100th birthday on March 1 of this year and still lives in the family home in Owensboro.
She and 
Senator Ford were married 71 years before his passing.
On a personal note, I would add that one of those young people receiving 
Senator Ford's wise counsel was me.
He was a tremendous role model for me, a close friend of my family, and someone who demonstrated the true meaning of public service.
Let his lifetime commitment of service be an example for us all as we remember him on the occasion of his 100th birthday.
