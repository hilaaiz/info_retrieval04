Mr. CARL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember a dear friend, Dr. Shelia Ross who passed away on September 13 after a hardfought battle of cancer.
As the Director of The University of South Alabama Health Stroke Program, Dr. Ross was focused on working with other health officials and community members on advocating for brain health and stroke care.
She used every opportunity to educate the residents of Mobile about the functions of the brain, in specific relation to strokes.
I am honored to have had such a courageous individual and friend residing in and helping the people of the First District of Alabama, and we will miss her greatly.
