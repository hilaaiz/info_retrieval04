Mr. COMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Ms. Joni Carrico of Graves County on being chosen as the 2024 Angel to Adoption by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.
Ms. Carrico has worked tirelessly with Hope That Binds, a nonprofit organization based out of Western Kentucky that aims to provide financial assistance for foster and adoptive families.
Through Hope That Binds, a network of loving families is growing and expanding.
To date, over 100 families have been assisted through the organization's fundraisers and grant program.
Throughout her time at Hope That Binds, 
Ms. Carrico has been a voice encouragement to the 1st Congressional District of Kentucky and our constituents.
She remains an important voice for hopeful parents seeking to grow their home.
