Ms. STRICKLAND.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Vance Lelli, who retired earlier this month from his positions as a committed longshoreman and as head of the Pierce County Central Labor Council.
He also served over two decades on the Washington State Labor Council Central Committee.
The Lelli family are known for their instrumental role in attracting new businesses and economic opportunities to the Port of Tacoma and transitioning it into one of the principal ports of entry on the Pacific Coast.
Vance Lelli has built upon this legacy in his own way, profoundly impacting our local longshoremen and women and the broader labor community in Washington State.
Throughout his career, Vance has been a tireless advocate for working people, championing their rights and welfare with dedication.
His efforts have strengthened working conditions and are supporting working families and retirees across the state.
On behalf of the thousands of union households in the South Sound, I thank Vance for his decades of service and leadership.
His contributions have made a lasting difference.
I wish him all the best as he begins this new chapter of his life.
Congratulations to Vance.
