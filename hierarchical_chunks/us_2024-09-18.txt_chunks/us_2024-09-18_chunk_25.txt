Foundation, a new organization seeking to raise awareness about the importance of public service by empowering servicemembers and their families.
Through philanthropic efforts, including a newly launched scholarship fund, the Foundation seeks to raise awareness of the connection between family and our military.
Additionally, the Foundation seeks to showcase the honored men and women who earn the Presidential Service Badge through non-partisan support to the Office of the President.
As the Dean of the Massachusetts and New England Delegations, I would like to join Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey in recognizing this organization and commending them for their support of those who have served our democracy.
I am proud of the fact that New England is home to more Presidential Service Badge recipients than any other region in the country, with over 2,000 in Massachusetts alone.
I thank them for their hard work, and I wish them many more years of success and prosperity.
