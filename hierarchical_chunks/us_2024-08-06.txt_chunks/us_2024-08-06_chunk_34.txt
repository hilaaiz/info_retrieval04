Mr. NICKEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Equality NC, which has a remarkable history as the oldest statewide organization in the country devoted to promoting LGBTQ rights.
Through grassroots organizing, education, and advocacy, the organization has made landmark strides towards equality for everyone regardless of their lived and expressed identity.
I appreciate Equality NC's efforts to push for legislation that calls for nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression in housing, employment, public accommodations, credit, insurance, and education.
One of their most notable achievements was leading the fight against HB2, a dangerous and discriminatory bill against the LGBTQ community that was later repealed after a successful public pressure campaign.
Equality NC has time and time again supported North Carolinians from their work on HIV/AIDS education to providing youth programming.
Through policy work and activism, Equality NC is leading the way towards a more equitable future for all North Carolinians.
Please join me in supporting their efforts to make the world a safer place for everyone, no matter who they are or who they love.
