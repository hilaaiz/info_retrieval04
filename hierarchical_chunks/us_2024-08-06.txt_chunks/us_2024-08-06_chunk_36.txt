Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the City of Willard's Sesquicentennial.
The perseverance of pioneers and settlers to overcome the challenges faced during the early years of the city's history has persisted throughout the past 150 years.
The hard work and spirit shown by generations of city residents have made Willard an outstanding example of American ingenuity.
In 1874, the City of Willard was established as a community and a junction for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's line to Sandusky and the branch west to Chicago.
The original name of Willard was Chicago; however, passengers would mistake the community for Chicago, Illinois.
The city's name was changed to Chicago Junction, but the word ``junction'' did not fit on name boards at the time.
In 1917, the town changed its name to Willard, after the then-president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Daniel Willard.
In 1960, Willard officially became a city.
The city is an asset to the great State of Ohio through its many contributions in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture.
It remains to this day a key junction for the rail company CSX Transportation.
