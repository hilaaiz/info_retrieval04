Paralegals have been in use in the legal profession for nearly 60 years.
These individuals are hard workers, held to the highest ethical standards, and provide essential support in legal offices.
Anyone in business knows that your business is only as strong as the people who work there.
Support is a vital part of the foundation of any success; within the legal ecosystem, paralegals play a vital part in building and sustaining that foundation.
``Liberty and justice for all'' is more than just a line in our national Pledge of Allegiance--it's the day-in, day-out mission for those in the legal profession.
Paralegals are essential to that profession, working in government agencies, corporations, law firms, and more.
Many professions are honored with a day of recognition.
I am thrilled to commemorate this first National Paralegal Day on August 6, 2024.
I thank our Nation's paralegals for their tireless and inspiring work and hope it will encourage others to pursue a career in this honorable field.
