Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring Coach Kevin Fite, a man who has been committed to improving the lives of the children who also call the city of Detroit home.
His efforts over the last 20+ years is a glowing example of spreading kindness and joy in an increasingly hostile world.
We thank him for his efforts, and we are excited to see what the students of the DCCC can accomplish over the next 21 years.
I thank Coach Fite.
