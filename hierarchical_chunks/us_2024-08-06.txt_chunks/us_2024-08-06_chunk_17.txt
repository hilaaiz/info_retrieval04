As Israel continues to fight for its right to exist, I remain committed to supporting one of our staunchest Middle Eastern allies.
Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of Congress where he eloquently and directly addressed the world on why Israel has the right and must defend itself and what the implications are for world peace and stability.
While the House of Representatives has stood with Israel, many on the radical left have turned their back on Israel.
They have chosen to withhold critical military aid that is necessary for Israel to defend itself and defeat the terrorist organization, Hamas, and have instead sided with pro-Hamas leftists.
As an embarrassment to the traditions of joint sessions of Congress, Vice President Kamala Harris skipped Netanyahu's at a time when it has never been more critical to show the world that America stands firmly with our ally.
Some of the major bills I helped pass in support of Israel following the terrorist attacks. 7 include measures to:
Provide an additional $14.1 billion in emergency appropriations in support of Israel's efforts to defend itself against Iran and Iran's terrorist proxies, and to replenish U.S. defense assets in the region.
Strengthen U S sanctions against Iran.
Condemn the International Criminal Court's decision to file applications for arrest warrants against Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.
Create a legal definition of antisemitism to protect Jewish people and students on college campuses facing discrimination.
U.S.-Israel relations are not only vital to providing stability in perhaps the most volatile region of the world, but our principles and values are closely aligned, and the U.S. must not waver in our ironclad support for Israel.
