Mrs. FLETCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with deep gratitude to Cameron Hull for her many years of service and exceptional work for Texas' Seventh Congressional District.
After working for our district for more than 5\1/2\ years, Cameron will leave my office to attend graduate school at Harvard University, where she expects to earn a Master's degree in Urban Planning.
Cameron has served Texas' Seventh Congressional District for as long as I have, joining our district staff as a Staff Assistant in Washington, D.C. as we opened our office in January 2019.
An integral part of my team from the start, she has worked tirelessly and effectively, handling issues of all kinds and engaging with our constituents in meaningful ways.
As our office grew, so did Cameron's role in it, as she moved from Staff Assistant to Legislative Correspondent to Legislative Assistant to Senior Legislative Assistant.
She has worked on issues of great importance to our district with a portfolio that includes transportation, infrastructure, and flooding policy.
It is fitting then that her work here has inspired her to pursue a career in urban planning.
Throughout her more than 5 years serving our district, Cameron has demonstrated a real passion for improving Texas' Seventh Congressional District and the broader Houston region.
She has built meaningful relationships across our community and has led the way on efforts to ensure our district's and our region's priorities are included in our work and that our work in Washington delivers meaningful progress back home.
Outstanding in her policy work, Cameron was also an outstanding team member who always remained positive and supportive of her colleagues.
Her work and her positive contributions have had--and will continue to have--a lasting impact on our team and on our district, and we will miss her.
