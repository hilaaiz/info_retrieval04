Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
Mr. Nicholas ``Nick'' Hargrove, an Eastern Shore seafood processor and oyster restoration expert who has had tremendous impact on the health and sustainability Nick is the owner of Tilghman Island Seafood which processes approximately 20,000 pounds of blue catfish daily.
Through his hard work and dedication, Nick is instrumental in protecting crabs, perch, menhaden, and others, against the invasive blue catfish population plaguing the Bay.
Nick has also contributed to addressing the oyster shell shortage by replanting millions of dried oyster shells in the Chesapeake Bay.
On behalf of the people of the Maryland's First Congressional District, I thank Nick for his tireless work and dedication to preserving the Chesapeake Bay for future generations to come.
