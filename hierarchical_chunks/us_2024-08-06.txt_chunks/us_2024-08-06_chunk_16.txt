Dear Friend, I voted in favor of H. Res. 1367, Establishing the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump, which would fully examine all actions related to the attempted assassination.
Our nation was shaken by the assassination attempt on President Trump, which tragically took the life of Corey Comperatore.
It has become clear since then that numerous security flaws and failures made it possible for the gunman to open file on President Trump.
The American people deserve transparency and accountability.
We must make sure that what happened at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania does not happen again.
Kimberly Cheatle, who just resigned as director of the United States Secret Service, refused to voluntarily provide answers that would allow us to figure out what went wrong.
The United States Secret Service has a no-fail mission, but it failed when the shooter attempted to assassinate President Trump, took the life of an innocent victim and harmed others.
A comprehensive investigation is necessary to understand what went wrong that day so we can learn how to prevent this from happening in the future.
While obvious security gaps were present, I commend the bravery of the individual Secret Service agents, local law enforcement, and Emergency Medical Services, who took immediate action to protect and care for President Trump.
