Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize Amy Boyette, Director of the Office of External Affairs at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site, on her retirement after 32 years of federal service with the Site.
Her remarkable career at SRS has witnessed many groundbreaking accomplishments in the history of the department, state, and nation that contribute to both our national security and environmental stewardship.
From her service as liaison to the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board to managing the U.S. Origin Nuclear Material Removal Program, her journey has been marked by dedication, excellence, and an unwavering commitment to public service.
Beyond her professional commitments, Amy's kindness, mentorship, and support for her colleagues and the community have created a legacy that will undoubtedly be an inspiration for many to follow.
I know her son, Nick Poston, parents, Milton and Shirley, her colleagues, and the citizens of both South Carolina and Georgia share my appreciation for her contributions to our states and service for Americans.
Congratulations to Amy on a truly remarkable career and best wishes on her future success.
