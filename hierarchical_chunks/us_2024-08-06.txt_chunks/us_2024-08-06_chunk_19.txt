Veterans have made great sacrifices to defend our freedom, and it is only right that we now serve them by supporting their transition to civilian life.
I was blown away by the turnout and involvement of everyone who participated in the Military Veteran Stand Down Celebration that I hosted with Henderson County.
More than 130 folks attended the event, and 21 resource vendors were available to share how they can assist veterans.
I appreciate all who showed up for our veterans and military families who have made great sacrifices to serve and protect us.
