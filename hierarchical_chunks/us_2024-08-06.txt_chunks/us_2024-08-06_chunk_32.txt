Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my congratulations and recognize the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company, which is celebrating 100 years of excellence.
This outstanding achievement is marked by the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company's commitment to providing safe, efficient, and effective emergency services to the Ransomville Community and surrounding communities in Niagara County, New York.
The Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company is located in the hamlet of Ransomville in the Town of Porter, in Niagara County, New York.
The fire company's stellar record of service began when it took on its first chartered members in March of 1924.
At that time their first line of defense against fires was one hand drawn hose cart, which was popular among many departments in the early 1900s.
Today, the fire company's 53 members are tasked with protecting local schools, government buildings, and several farms and annually respond to over 600 calls.
The members are not only limited to fighting fires, but they are also called upon to respond to motor vehicle accidents, hazardous material incidents, and medical emergencies.
Although times have changed for the members of the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company, the call to tirelessly safeguard the lives and property of citizens remains the same.
These courageous volunteers leave their jobs, their hobbies, and their families at a moment's notice to respond to danger
and I cannot thank them enough for that.
The residents who are served by the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company can rest comfortably knowing they will receive the best possible assistance.
I am pleased to congratulate the Ransomville Volunteer Fire Company for 100 years of protecting their community and recognize their continuing commitment to service.
