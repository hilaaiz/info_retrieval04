Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chad Reenders, a fourth-generation blueberry grower from West Michigan and this year's recipient of the Michigan Blueberry Advisory Committee Industry Award.
Michigan's high-quality produce drives our economy, feeds families across the Nation, and is both widely respected and recognized around the globe.
It is because of leaders like Chad Reenders that this reputation is gained, kept, and enhanced.
Chad is a premier advocate for his fellow blueberry growers across Michigan and has tirelessly fought to improve their standing, whether it be in the field, in the media, or in Washington, D.C., educating elected officials on the needs and importance of the industry.
As President of the Michigan Blueberry Advisory Committee, Chad continues to make impactful changes for growers and is recognized across our state for his passion, drive, and commitment.
The Michigan Blueberry Industry is stronger through Chad's leadership.
I thank him for his continued efforts to make Michigan the best place in the country to grow.
