Mr. BURLISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jackson Choi of Springfield, Missouri, who recently achieved the rank.
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America program.
Since its inception in 1911, only 4 percent of scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
Jackson is a junior at Kickapoo High School in Springfield, and he has been in scouting since he joined as a Cub Scout in 2013.
He is a member.
289, where he has held several leadership positions.
He also has attended three of the four high adventure camps earning him the Triple Crown Award from the Boy Scouts.
To earn the Eagle Scout designation, each individual must complete a project.
Jackson's project was to update the bamboo fencing at the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden at the Nathaniel Green/Close Memorial Park in Springfield.
The garden was established by Springfield's Japanese sister city in 1985.
The original bamboo fencing had fallen into disrepair, so Jackson studied the process and replaced 100-feet of fencing in the traditional Japanese way.
This accomplished young man deserves our applause for a job well done.
I am proud to have him as a constituent.
