Mr. Speaker, Joe's voice was defined not by its earthy baritone but by its moral clarity and commitment to truth.
Like so many others across the country and around the world, I will miss hearing it crackle through the radio in the morning.
Joe may be gone, but the question he posed to his listeners remains: `What are you going to do about it?'
Although he can no longer ask us that question, we can still answer.
