Over the past decade, Huron Valley PACE has been a proactive member of the local community, setting up events such as Super Bowl watch parties, heart disease awareness drives, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day community service projects in partnership with other local organizations.
In addition to caring for the elderly in Washtenaw County, Huron Valley PACE also works to instill a commitment to public service in local high school and university students by offering handson volunteer opportunities for students.
Volunteers distribute hot meals to underserved communities, lead food drives, and raise awareness about senior care.
Part of Huron Valley PACE's proactive approach to providing exceptional care for the elderly includes advocating for expanding comprehensive senior care services like the PACE Expanded Act.
At the state level, Huron Valley PACE works with the Michigan State Legislature to reduce the cost of medical care and to find innovative ways to help elderly people remain living in their homes.
This advocacy is yet another example of how Huron Valley PACE continues to demonstrate their commitment to providing and advocating for quality and affordable elderly care.
