His Eagle Scout project provided improvements and outdoor furnishing to South Park, a 65-acre park owned by the city of Monett that caters especially to children and adults with disabilities.
Scouting has been teaching valuable lessons in leadership since it was established in February 1910, and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout is an important accomplishment.
This young man deserves our applause for a job well done.
I am proud to have him as a constituent.
