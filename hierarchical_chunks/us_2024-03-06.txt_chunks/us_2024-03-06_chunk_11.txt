Mr. GRAVES.
Mr. Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize Nicholas Charles Nesslage.
Nicholas is a very special young man who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 495, and earning the most prestigious award.
Nicholas has been very active with his troop, participating in many Scout activities.
Over the many years Nicholas has been involved with Scouting, he has not only earned numerous merit badges, but also the respect of his family, peers, and community.
Nicholas has also contributed to his community through his Eagle Scout project.
Nicholas created a gravel water runoff area at his local park in Weatherby Lake to combat flooding.
