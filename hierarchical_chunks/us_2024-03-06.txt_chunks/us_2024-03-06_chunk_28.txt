Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the founding of Huron Valley PACE on their 10th anniversary.
They have had a tremendous impact on the Washtenaw County area and continue to find exciting ways to continue improving their services to their community, and I cannot wait to see what they accomplish over the next decade.
