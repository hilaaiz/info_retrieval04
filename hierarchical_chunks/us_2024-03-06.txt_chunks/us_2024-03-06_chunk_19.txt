Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Captain Kevin Mitchell for his outstanding service to the Kingsport Fire Department and the citizens of Kingsport, Tennessee.
His retirement marks the end of an era of exceptional service and leadership, and his legacy will continue to inspire current and future generations of public servants.
We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.
