Mr. Speaker, I offer my prayers to Joe's incredible wife of 47 years, Sherry; his three daughters, Monesha Madison Lever, Shawna Collins and Michelle Borleske; his son, Jason Madison; his four half-siblings; his five grandchildren; and his great-granddaughter.
I ask that all my colleagues join me in wishing them strength and in mourning Joe Madison--a titan of the airwaves.
May God bless and keep Joe Madison.
