Mr. BURLISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Franklin Lucore of Monett, Missouri, who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout just prior to his 15th birthday.
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America program, and since its inception in 1911, only 4 percent of scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
Franklin is a freshman in the International Baccalaureate Program at Central High School in Springfield and a member of BSA Troop 38 in Monett.
He began his scouting career as a Cub Scout at the age of seven and since then has held numerous leadership positions with the troop, while also maintaining a 4.0 grade point average in school.
He is a member of the Brotherhood of the Order of the Arrow, scouting's National Honor Society, and a member of the Tribe of the Lone Bear, an honors program of the Ozark Trails Council's Camp Arrowhead.
He also has earned 36 merit badges, camped out more than 50 nights, hiked more than 100 miles and performed more than 36 hours of community service.
