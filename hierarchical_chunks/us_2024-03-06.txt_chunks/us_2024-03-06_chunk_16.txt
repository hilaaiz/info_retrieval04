Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues, Representatives Levin, Sanchez, and Napolitano, and rise today to honor the life of Raymond ``Ray'' L. Cordova, a renowned labor leader who leaves behind a legacy Ray cut his teeth as an organizer in the early 1960s as part of the Freedom Summer Movement in Mississippi for almost two years.
A proud veteran of the U.S. Army Airborne, his service to his country continued after the Vietnam War when he returned home to build up his community.
He was always a dapper dresser and treated everyone with respect.
In a short time, Ray began making his name known as one of the most effective and impactful labor leaders in Orange County.
No matter what or who you believed in--if you were a Republican, Democrat, or something in between--Ray was a champion of all people.
When working men and women across America had no seat at the table, Ray fought tirelessly to make room through his leadership in the Communications Workers of America Union and as a labor organizer in Orange County.
Ray's influence and impact extends beyond his labor work.
He educated and prepared the next generation of the labor movement, and helped redefine politics in Southern California.
It is because of his mentorship that so many of the leaders of today are prepared to make the changes they envision, in California and beyond.
Not only was he a deeply loved member of our community, but my colleagues and I are lucky that Ray was also a dear friend.
I have personally had the pleasure of knowing and learning from him over the last 25 years.
I ask my colleagues to join me and Representatives Levin, Sanchez, and Napolitano in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy of Raymond ``Ray'' L. Cordova.
I thank Ray for setting an example of leadership and service that we all may aspire to and learn from.
