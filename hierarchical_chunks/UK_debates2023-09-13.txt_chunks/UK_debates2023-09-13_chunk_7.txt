I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his new position.
The UK Government are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society and we have taken decisive steps to do that, including UK-wide additional spending of £137.5 billion in benefits for pensioners, £67.9 billion in benefits to support disabled people and people with health conditions and £114.3 billion in working-age benefits and child welfare.
We have also uprated benefits and pension credit in line with inflation and have raised the national living wage to help to protect the most vulnerable.
We will continue to keep the situation under review, but this Government have continually demonstrated our commitment to the most vulnerable across Scotland.
