I think we should be clear: the Lord Advocate’s statement on Monday is a game changer.
It removes one of the major obstacles to a pilot drug consumption facility, which is designed to prevent overdoses.
The Secretary of State has been equivocal in his responses so far, so let me give him another chance to get on the right side of history.
Will he actually say that he will support and work with the Scottish Government to see this pilot project through?
I think I have been clear.
I have been clear that the UK Government’s policy is not to proceed with drug consumption rooms.
We believe, as I have said, that drugs devastate families and destroy communities.
I was very clear about those things, but I am also very clear that the Lord Advocate and the Scottish Government appear to have achieved a workaround that allows them to have a pilot drug consumption room, probably in Glasgow, and the United Kingdom Government will not intervene in that, so the SNP now has no more excuses.
Can I press the Secretary of State on this point, because of course he has form on intervening in decisions of the Scottish Government?
He says he will not intervene.
Can we therefore be clear that he will say, on behalf of the UK Government, that he will not use any administrative or legislative means to frustrate or block this pilot policy by the Scottish Government?
Hear, hear!
I am very popular today.
I will be with SNP Members in particular when I say that the answer is yes.
What recent discussions he has held with the Scottish Government on the impact of increases in the cost of living on people in (a) the UK and (b) Scotland.
Our Government have taken assertive action on the cost of living.
UK-wide support for households to help with higher energy bills is worth £94 billion, or £3,300 per household on average.
The United Kingdom Government’s focus has been on supporting everyone with the cost of living with specific targeted support and tailored interventions for the most vulnerable.
