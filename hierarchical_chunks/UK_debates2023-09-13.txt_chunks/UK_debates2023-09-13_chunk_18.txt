We come to the Leader of the Opposition.
I join the Prime Minister in his words about the Clerk of the House.
I pay tribute to the police who tracked down the escaped terror suspect from Wandsworth prison last week.
Despite being charged with terrorism, and despite being a flight risk, he was not held in a category A prison.
Why not?
