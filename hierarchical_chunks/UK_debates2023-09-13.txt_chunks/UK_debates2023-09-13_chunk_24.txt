I thank my right hon.
Friend for all of his work and attention in this area; it was good to work with him on Project Adder in particular.
He is right to highlight the fact that drugs destroy lives and families, hitting the most vulnerable in our society the hardest.
The 10-year drug strategy, which he helped put in place, is ambitious and backed with a record £3 billion of funding.
As he highlighted, we have consulted on a new drug possession offences framework, and I assure him that Ministers will keep him and this House updated on future plans.
