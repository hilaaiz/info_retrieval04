The Secretary of state will fully realise the challenge it would present for Border Force if we had differing rules on what drugs were lawful and not lawful across the United Kingdom.
Therefore, will he assure me that he will not look to devolve drugs policy, and will instead get the Scottish Government to focus on their own responsibilities?
Hear, hear!
Labour Members always seem to cheer me at this moment in Scottish questions.
They are very generous.
My hon.
Friend makes a very good point.
Drug deaths in Scotland are three times higher than the UK average, despite the laws being the same across the UK.
I do not believe drug consumption rooms are the panacea to those problems, but we absolutely must have drugs laws that work across the whole United Kingdom because it is a UK-wide problem.
