My right hon.
Friend is right to point out that we have taken action and given powers to the regulator.
A very successful prosecution happened; I believe Southern Water was fined £90 million in a recent case.
We need to continue to work to get effective action.
I have complete confidence in the Environment Agency in getting on with the detailed work that we need to do to ensure that the water companies stick to the law, and we continue to strengthen the law, including through the unlimited penalties that this House voted for.
Actually, I think it was only Government Members who went through the Division Lobby to pass those penalties.
