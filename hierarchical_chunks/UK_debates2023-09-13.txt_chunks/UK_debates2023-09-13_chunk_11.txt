The Minister did not answer the question, so I will try again.
Scotland needs a caring, compassionate, human rights-informed drugs policy with public health and the reduction of harm as its principles, and the Scottish Government are ready and willing to work with the UK Government to put that progressive policy into practice.
Scottish Tory MSP Miles Briggs said on “Good Morning Scotland” yesterday that he hoped the UK Government would not move to block this lifesaving measure.

Drug consumption rooms are not the easy solution hon.
Members may think they are.
There is no safe way to take illegal drugs.
Drugs devastate lives, ruin families and damage communities.
The UK Government believe that the police and the Procurator Fiscal Service should fully enforce the law.
However, I say to the hon.
Lady that if the Scottish Government and the Lord Advocate decide to proceed with a pilot on DCRs, the UK Government will not intervene.
