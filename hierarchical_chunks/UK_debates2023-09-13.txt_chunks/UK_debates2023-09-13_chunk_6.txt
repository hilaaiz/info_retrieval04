After 16 years of SNP Government and 13 years of the Tories, one in four children in Scotland lives in poverty.
There are 40,000 more children in poverty compared with a decade ago, and this week it was revealed that three members of the Scottish Government’s own Poverty and Inequality Commission had resigned.
Does the Minister agree that both the Scottish and the UK Governments should be working more urgently and more effectively to tackle child poverty?
