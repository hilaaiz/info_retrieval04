I thank the Secretary of State for the renewed determination to bring about improvement—it is clear that we need it.
When we voted on this issue in the House, we were given assurances that these incidents would not take place.
It is clear that, while officials may not agree with this investigation, there is still a real cause for concern.
How does the Secretary of State intend to alleviate those concerns and, more importantly, ensure that sewage releases are regulated and safe?
I make this suggestion very respectfully: stopping the dividends to the chief executives and directors would be a method to encourage improvements by the water companies, who seem reluctant to make them.
