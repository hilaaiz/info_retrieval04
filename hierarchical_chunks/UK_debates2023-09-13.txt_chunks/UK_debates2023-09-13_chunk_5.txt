The hon.
Gentleman is a doughty champion for rural communities in Northern Ireland, and he raises an important point.
I will endeavour to arrange a meeting for him with colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as soon as possible.
What discussions he has held with Cabinet colleagues and the Scottish Government on the effectiveness of the steps being taken to reduce rates of (a) poverty and (b) inequality in Scotland.
The United Kingdom Government are committed to a sustainable approach to tackling poverty and supporting people on lower incomes.
We have made substantial investment to help to mitigate the worst of the cost of living impacts, including welfare spending of around £276 billion.
The best route out of poverty, of course, is through work.
Therefore, our focus remains firmly on supporting people to move into and progress in work.
Scotland has the lowest rates of child poverty in the UK, with the game-changing Scottish child payment helping more than 300,000, and lifting 50,000 of them out of poverty.
Why do the UK Government continue to refuse to follow such a successful example?
The UK Government have ensured that the cost of living challenges have been tackled by working in tandem with the Scottish Government and using reserved and devolved levers to get the best outcomes for everybody across Scotland.
The benefit cap levels have been increased by 10.1% from  1 April .
The national living wage has increased by 9.7% to £10.42 an hour for workers aged 23 years and over.
Overall, this Government are working to deliver for the most vulnerable in society, and will do so in conjunction with our partners in the Scottish Government.
