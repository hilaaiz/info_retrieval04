I thank the Prime Minister for that answer, and I am glad to hear about the continuing growth in the west midlands.
However, in Lichfield we have a problem with road and footpath closures, and we do not know for how long they will go on.
HS2 is behind these closures, and one hand does not know what the other is doing—HS2 is the most dysfunctional organisation I have ever had to deal with.
Will the Prime Minister, in the short term, try to restructure HS2 so that it works as a company should?
In the longer term, can he save other constituencies by stopping HS2 at the end of phase 1?
