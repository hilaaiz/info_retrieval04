I welcome the work of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State in this area.
Despite what has been said today, we have to recognise that this is the first Government to take the bull by the horns and actually do something about illegally discharged sewage, which has been happening for decades.
I have witnessed it myself.
I have recently been speaking to Southern Water about a river that my constituency happens to be near.
Although I recognise that Southern Water is doing its very best to do small trials around land drainage, frankly it is not doing enough quickly enough.
Will the Secretary of State outline the powers of the Environment Agency that she is strengthening in order to fine companies such as Southern Water, which, as my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Sir Robert Goodwill)  said, are using opportunities in dry weather to dump sewage where that really should not be happening?
