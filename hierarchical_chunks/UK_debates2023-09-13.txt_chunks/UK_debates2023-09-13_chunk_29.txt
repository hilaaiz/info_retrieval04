I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the exhibition in Portcullis House.
Members will have heard his invitation.
We are consulting widely  on the detail of the White Paper on international development and what it should say, and specifically on the role of democracy in development.
I encourage all interested organisations and individuals to share their ideas through the public consultation.
