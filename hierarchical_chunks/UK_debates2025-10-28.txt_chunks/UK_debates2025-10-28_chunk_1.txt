Before we come to today’s business, I wanted to note that on  Sunday 27 October , we marked the 75th anniversary of the rebuilding of this Chamber after it was bombed during the second world war and left destroyed.
The Chamber we sit in today remains a continuing symbol of resilience and renewal.
On the rebuilding of the Chamber, Prime Minister Winston Churchill described the House of Commons as “the citadel of British liberty”.
This House and this Chamber continue to play a vital role at the heart of our democracy today.
I am sure the whole House will want to join me in marking this important anniversary.
I invite Members, at 11 am tomorrow, to attend the Chamber for a commemorative photo to mark the occasion.
