I agree with my hon.
Friend.
We need to increase the economic pressure on Putin.
We need to choke off the supply of Russian oil and gas into international markets.
Our package of sanctions, including on the two biggest Russian oil producers, is a substantial step forward.
It is welcome that other countries, including the US, are now doing the same.
It is only through international action that we will have that impact.
