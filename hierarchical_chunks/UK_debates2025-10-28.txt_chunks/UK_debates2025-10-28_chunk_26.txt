The Minister for the middle east, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Lincoln (Mr Falconer) , has raised this issue directly with the Syrian Government, and we continue to raise these security issues with not just Syria but other parties in the region, because the right hon.
Member will know the importance of regional Governments working together on the security issues  that she raises.
This is about the historical terrorism threat we have faced from the region, but also the responsibility on Governments to maintain stability in Syria, and the impact that has across the region.
We will continue to take these security issues immensely seriously.
