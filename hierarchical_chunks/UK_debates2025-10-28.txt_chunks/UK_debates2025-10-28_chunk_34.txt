Last week the Chancellor accepted that Brexit has caused huge damage to the economy.
This week sources suggest that the Prime Minister is being advised to go further in his realignment with the European Union, as the Office for Budget Responsibility is reportedly forecasting a new black hole of around £20 billion—again showing the impact of Brexit on growth.
Is the Foreign Secretary ready to admit that no matter how people try to spin it, Brexit has been an all-out disaster for Scotland and these islands?
We have had no hesitation in exposing the impacts of the botched Brexit deal that the previous Government made.
That is exactly why we have reset our relationship with the EU and achieved important agreements at the May summit.
It is also why the Minister for the Cabinet Office, myself and others are working to deliver on that deal to ensure benefits for our businesses, consumers and people across this country.
