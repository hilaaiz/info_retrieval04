I thank the shadow Chancellor for opening today’s debate with characteristic theatricality.
I know that Opposition Members are desperate to forget their time in office.
They are desperate for us all to forget the damage that they caused to the economy and to public services on their watch.
Surely, however, they cannot have forgotten how the Budget process works, so they will know that no Treasury Minister, particularly in the weeks immediately before a Budget, will speculate on tax changes.
Any decisions on tax will be taken at the Budget by the Chancellor in the usual way—[Interruption.]
I see surprised faces among Opposition Members, but I remind them that that is how the Budget process works.
They will know that the OBR produces a forecast, and the Chancellor will take decisions in the round based on that forecast when she presents the Budget to this House on  26 November .
