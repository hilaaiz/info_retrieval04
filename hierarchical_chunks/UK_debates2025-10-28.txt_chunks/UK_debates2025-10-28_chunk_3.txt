I thank the Secretary of State very much for her responses.
The peace plan can succeed only if Hamas are not part of it.
Hamas need to return the dead hostages to the families, and they need to be disarmed.
We also need to ensure that they are not carrying out summary executions of fellow Gazans, as they are currently doing.
If we are going to have a peace plan that lasts, Hamas need to be removed from the situation—we can then have peace.
