The issue of Russian sovereign assets is an extremely important one.
Both I and the Chancellor have had many discussions with our counterparts, particularly in Europe but also through the G7.
We want to be able to mobilise those sovereign assets in order to support Ukraine.
The EU has set out proposals for reparation loans, which we think are the sensible way forward, because fundamentally, Russia needs to pay for the damage it is doing to Ukraine.
