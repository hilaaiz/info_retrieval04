Does the Minister agree that foreign nationals convicted of serious drug offences in Northern Ireland should be deported without delay?
Will he ensure that his Department works with international partners and prioritises swift removal agreements to stop those involved in organised immigration and drug crime re-offending on our streets?
I absolutely agree with the sentiment of the hon.
Lady’s question.
She will know that in our first year in government, we deported over 5,000 foreign national offenders—a 14% increase on the previous 12 months.
We are speeding up the early removal scheme so that most foreign prisoners can be deported after serving 30%, rather than the previous 50%, of their custodial sentence.
What steps her Department is taking to provide sustainable funding for the BBC World Service.
The BBC World Service remains the world’s most-trusted international news source and supports our national security, growth and development objectives.
That is  why we provided a 31% increase in Government funding for the World Service this year.
Funding allocations for the next three years will be announced in due course.
The Institute for Global Prosperity and CreativePower have produced an excellent report on the sheer impact of the World Service, which reaches 320 million people globally and is trusted by 75%.
In a key market for the Government—India—75 million people listen to or watch the BBC.
How will the Government maximise the opportunity of the World Service, which is one of our best soft power assets and the best way that we can have conversations with the rest of the world?
