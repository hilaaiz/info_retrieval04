I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s comments about Russian frozen assets.
She will possibly agree with me that the US is an increasingly unreliable partner for Ukraine.
Can she tell me what discussions she has had with European counterparts about securing Ukrainians’ long-range missiles with European partners so that they can better defend themselves?
