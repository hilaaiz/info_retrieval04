I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The Government wholeheartedly agree with him that the BBC World Service is one of our strongest areas of soft power.
He will be aware that the charter review starts next year, and we think that is one of the best ways we can work towards establishing the funding streams.
We are working with the BBC World Service on ways in which it can innovate to ensure that it reaches even further, as the most trusted news network on the globe.
