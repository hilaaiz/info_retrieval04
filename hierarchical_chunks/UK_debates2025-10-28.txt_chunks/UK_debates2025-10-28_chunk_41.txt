The Minister is always generous with his time and always has a smile, which is a welcome thing in this Chamber.
Government spending this year is approaching £1,300 billion, but Ministers could not save £5 billion because of their own Back Benchers.
Is it his complete failure to make even the smallest savings on that monumental budget that makes him find it impossible to believe that others would have the will to do so?
What I find it impossible to believe from the Conservatives is that they now have a shadow Chancellor who claims to have a plan for £23 billion of welfare cuts, when he himself presided over the biggest increase in welfare spending in decades when he was the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
That is the record that gives him no credibility whatsoever in this debate.
In their motion, the Conservatives also claim that they want “to get Britain working, to grow the economy and to give people a stronger stake in their communities”.
Yet they spend their whole time trying to claim that Britain is broken.
They have joined the ranks of those who are trying to co-opt our flag for their own ends by claiming that it is in tatters.
I cannot believe that so many who claim to be proud of our country are so willing to talk it down.
Our country is not broken; we are a great country, filled with great people and great businesses.
We are willing to roll up our sleeves and work together for a greater future.
However, it is clear that many people across our country feel stuck.
Under the last Government, our economy stalled, our public services were starved and opportunities dried up.
