The Minister is right to say that the Opposition have not been clear about how they would fund this tax cut, but there are some clues.
The shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury,  the hon.
Member for North Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller) , told a fringe event at the Tory party conference that we should look at the Australian system of state pensions and “essentially” a means-tested state pension.
Does my right hon.
Friend share my concerns that under the Tories the state pension would be under threat?
My hon.
Friend is right to point out that the state pension would be under threat were the Conservatives to win the next general election.
He is also right to draw the House’s attention to comments made by Conservative Members at their party conference.
They may think that people are not listening to what they say at those conference fringe meetings, but we get the reports so we know exactly what they said.
From their recent conference, we know that they think that they can find some £47 billion through cuts to public spending, as the shadow Chancellor said, but let us look at the detail.
At least half of those fantasy savings come from a welfare plan that amounts to a menu with no prices: a list of measures that the Conservatives say will raise £23 billion in total, but with no breakdown whatsoever of how.
In June last year, just as they were on their way out of Downing Street, they said that they could cut £12 billion from the welfare bill.
Now they have doubled that without explanation.
Frankly, if the shadow Chancellor thinks that he has any credibility on this matter, he is sadly mistaken.
He is far from the best person to make this argument, given that he personally oversaw the biggest increase in benefits spending in decades during his time as the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.
