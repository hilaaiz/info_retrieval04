I thank my right hon.
Friend for all the work that he did in this area.
Yes, I understand the difficulty of choosing a blunt number or tool.
That is why I have asked the Office for Students to consider how such things could be used and what approaches we need to ensure that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water, or end up with unintended consequences.
On innovation, I am absolutely encouraging all our universities to innovate, working with businesses.
The pace of technological change across the world and what is to come in the future is immense, and I want our universities to work with our further education colleges, training providers, businesses and others, to ensure that we innovate and give everybody the best opportunities for the future.
