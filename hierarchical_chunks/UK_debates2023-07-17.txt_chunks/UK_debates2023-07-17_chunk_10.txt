Hospitality and tourism is an industry worth £3.5 billion a year to Cumbria, and it is our biggest employer.
Apprenticeships are an important way into a career within that sector.
The problem is that T-levels are a useful stepping stone into apprenticeships, yet the Government have again kicked into the long grass the T-level on catering, having already taken out the hospitality element of that.
Will the Secretary of State meet me and representatives from Cumbria Tourism, so we can talk about how she can change that policy, and so that more young people can enter that important profession?
I am happy to meet the hon.
Gentleman.
As he will know, I always have a laser-like focus on quality, and if the quality is not good enough then I will not release the apprenticeship, the apprenticeship standard or the T-level.
Too often we have had low-quality qualifications in this country, and it is important that we work with a vast array of businesses to ensure that we get the quality system that they demand and that will be good for all our young people.
May I beg the Minister to pay attention to the fact that good apprenticeships and good training in any town and city must come from a blend of good universities—I think most of our universities are good—with local further education colleges?
Will she take a leaf out of Tony Blair’s book, when he said in a recent important speech that what we need is more high-class universities and more polytechnics made up from the new former FE colleges?
As usual, we are ahead of the Opposition.
We have already invested in 21 institutes of technology, which are where a group of colleges and universities work with employers in the area.
They are a great addition to the landscape, along with all the other technical qualifications and skills training that we have introduced since 2010.
