May I ask the Secretary of State, because she has not actually spelled this out, what is a low-value degree?
In relation to low-value degrees, an example of the quality provisions we have introduced for the Office for Students is B3, which is about: whether students continue in their degree, because clearly if they drop out, it is not of much value; whether they complete their degree, because clearly if they do not complete it, it is of zero value; and whether they get a job or progress into higher education afterwards.
Those are the three quality measures we look at.
Right now, the Office for Students is looking at 18 providers and two specific areas—business and management, and computer science—because there is a massive range in what people  can expect to earn from jobs having followed one course or others, all of which seem to have the same name.
There are quality issues, and we want to make sure that they are thoroughly investigated.
The Office for Students is doing that.
