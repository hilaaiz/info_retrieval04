I thank the Minister for that answer but, in the last academic year, English students graduated with £30,000 more debt, on average, than their Scottish counterparts.
Despite this, both the Government and the Labour party refuse to follow the Scottish Government’s lead by abolishing tuition fees in England.
With more than 16,000 undergraduates dropping out of higher education this year, will this Government admit that their policies are pushing students into debt, and often out of university?
