I attended a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on fisheries, which I normally chair, where a keenness was expressed to encourage young people to have an interest in a career in fishing at the education stage.
I have heard similar pleas from farmers.
What more can the Department do to make that a reality?
My hon.
Friend is a true fisherman’s friend, although a lot sweeter tasting than the lozenges, I might add.
She will be pleased to know that high-quality apprenticeship standards in agriculture and a level 2 fisher apprenticeship are available.
We are promoting apprenticeships, including in agriculture, in our schools, and through the apprenticeship support and knowledge programme, and the Careers & Enterprise Company.
