There is no clearer sign of a Government who are out of ideas and have run out of steam than when they re-announce policies and badge them as new.
The Office for Students already has these powers, and has already capped four specific providers.
Rather than putting down our universities and capping our young people’s aspirations, why does the Secretary of State not invest in them by restoring maintenance grants, and finally signing the dotted line on Horizon membership?
Not all the things I have brought forward today have already been announced.
The information on foundation degrees is new, and the work we are doing with the OfS is also new.
We have asked the OfS to consider the impact of recruitment limits, and how those can be introduced.
I personally think this is an important set of reforms.
We need to make sure that we have access to these fantastic courses at our universities so that through programmes—such as Horizon, when we complete those negotiations—we can continue to offer the very best in science from this country.
I very much welcome this statement to limit the number of students that universities can recruit to courses that are failing.
The Secretary of State has my full support.
Can she tell me whether this measure will also apply to foreign students?
At the very least, will foreign students be barred from bringing dependants with them to do these courses?
The quality of the courses on offer applies to everybody.
If we change the quality for domestic students, it will then be the same quality for international students, which is important because of the size of the international student sector, which brings about £25 billion to £30 billion to our economy every year.
We have already addressed the issue of dependants for taught master’s courses in our recent changes to migration visas.
