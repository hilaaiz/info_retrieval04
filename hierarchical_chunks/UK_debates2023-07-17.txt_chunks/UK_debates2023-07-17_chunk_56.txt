I thank my hon.
Friend for his remarks, and I very much agree that this is about choice—the lifelong loan entitlement, degree apprenticeships and all of the other choices—and about people understanding that there are many different routes to success in life.
We have asked the Office for Students to look at earnings, because I realise that is difficult and that some jobs will not earn people more.
However, for his information, five years after graduating from some courses, people are earning less than £18,000.
That is less than the minimum wage, and it is not acceptable.
