I thank the Secretary of State for visiting BAE Systems recently in Lancashire.
Accrington and Rossendale College in my Hyndburn and Haslingden constituency has been successfully rolling out the T-level programme, but to ensure that young people in my constituency have the skills they need in areas such as technology and engineering, further capital investment is needed to ensure that it can continue to provide state-of-the-art facilities.
Will my right hon.
Friend confirm whether there will be further waves of the T-level capital fund?
