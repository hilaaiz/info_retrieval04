I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and for joining me on that visit, which I think was eye-opening for both of us.
The Nelson & Colne College group, which includes Accrington and Rossendale College in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, has benefited from capital investment of more than £6 million since 2010, including funding to improve the condition of its estate and support the delivery of T-levels and technical education.
Most recently, it benefited from further investment as one of our 108 T-level capital projects, working towards delivering engineering and manufacturing T-levels.
We will continue to support the roll-out of T-levels.
