The Secretary of State has confirmed that the Office for Students already had the powers to enforce on student outcome provisions,  so this announcement is just narrow politicking.
Hidden in the UCAS figures last week was the fact that home student applications are falling in this country.
Can the Secretary of State confirm that this Government’s policy is now one of narrowing participation?
Absolutely not, no.
I am delighted that the hon.
Gentleman has asked this question, because our policy is about widening participation and making sure that education is high-quality.
It is also about making sure that there are more degree apprenticeships.
There are now 180,000, which did not exist before.
There are now 180,000 more people who can do what I did, as the only degree apprentice in the House of Commons.
It is a fantastic route into the workplace.
We also have higher technical qualifications and boot camps.
There is so much investment that has all happened under this Conservative Government.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that the shadow Secretary of State,  the hon.
Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) , missed the opportunity to condemn the disgusting and cruel University and College Union marking boycott?
Will my right hon.
Friend use these reforms to protect young people to ensure that this never happens again and that universities such as Cambridge and Exeter can issue degrees?
It is important.
Young people have suffered already a lot during covid.
They have invested in their degree and put all the hard work in.
It is only right that they should have their degrees marked.
This is a dispute between universities and their lecturers, but we are urging them to make sure they prioritise all those who will be graduating this year.
