The mental wellbeing of young people and children is really important.
Last week, I met staff from Ebor Academy Trust and our mental health trust to talk about how better provision can be put in place.
Labour has committed to ensuring that we have mental health professionals in our schools, but in this school it was the teaching assistants providing most of the care.
How are we ensuring that teaching assistants are properly rewarded?
Rates for teaching assistants are set by the local authority.
Teaching assistants are highly regarded by all of us.
As the hon.
Lady says, they provide important pastoral care alongside the mental health support that we are rolling out via the mental health support teams.
Higher education already publishes outcomes data, so students choosing courses can compare what their chances of employment and earning power will be for each course at each college or university and make fully informed decisions.
Does the Minister accept that publishing outcomes for further education alongside higher education not only shows students the best courses and colleges, but puts FE and HE on an equal footing for the first time and pushes those offering low-value FE and HE qualifications to either shape up or close down?
I know that my hon.
Friend is a champion of his brilliant Weston College, which is an example of the greatness of our FE colleges.
He will be pleased to know that the DFE publishes outcomes data on further education, which shows statistics on the employment, earnings and learning outcomes of further education learners.
We are introducing a data dashboard, which is in the direction of travel in which he wants to go.
Despite statutory guidance to reduce the costs of school uniforms, far too many schools are requiring four and up to five branded items.
What more will the Minister do to intervene to ensure that schools abide by the law?
