It is good to hear the Secretary of State prioritising getting children into school.
Alongside her welcome funded pay offer, which will hopefully see an end to disruptive strikes, a real drive to reduce persistent absence and increase attendance would be welcome.
A long-standing recommendation of the Education Committee is a statutory register of children not in school, which she is well aware of and has told us is a priority.
May I therefore urge her to rapidly adopt the private Member’s Bill of my hon.
Friend  the Member for Meon Valley (Mrs Drummond)  so that we can get on with delivering on that priority?
