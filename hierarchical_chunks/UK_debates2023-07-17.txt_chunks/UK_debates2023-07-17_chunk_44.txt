I thank my hon.
Friend, who I know is an amazing campaigner on this issue.
We are doing a lot to progress the support in schools, making sure that we have access to a specialist workforce and that teachers have proper training.
We will set out a best practice guide on autism specifically, for which we have seen a big rise in need.
