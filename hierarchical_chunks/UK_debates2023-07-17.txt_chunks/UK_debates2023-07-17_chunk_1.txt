There is nothing that would make me give such drastic advice.
The truth about the apprenticeship levy is that 99.6% of it will be spent this year.
We can look in the rear view mirror, and there are some reports  going back over time that show some underspend in the levy, but they are back over time.
We are now spending 99.6% of the levy.
Perhaps what the hon.
Gentleman has not appreciated is that some of the funding goes to the devolved Governments.
If we examine the apprenticeship system in Wales and Scotland, it is not a patch on what we have introduced in England.
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study was published in May this year.
England had come fourth among 43 countries that tested children of the same age, nine and 10-year-olds.
In 2012 we introduced the phonics screening check, testing six-year-olds for their progress in reading and phonics.
In that year, 58% of pupils reached the expected standard; by 2019, just before the pandemic, the proportion had risen to 82% following a transformation in the teaching of phonics in nearly all primary schools.
Of course the Secretary of State will agree, as she has just said to me.
We are spending record amounts of funding on schools.
The Secretary of State achieved an extra £2 billion in the autumn statement last year and we are now spending £59.6 billion on school funding.
We have recruited 2,800 more teachers this year than last year and we have a record number of teachers in the profession, at 468,000, but of course I am happy to talk to the hon.
Lady and the teachers in her constituency to discuss their particular concerns.
