I thank my hon.
Friend for his Committee’s work on this issue, which really is important.
We have a world-class education system, but we need children in school to be able to take advantage of that.
As he knows, my Department remains committed to legislating for statutory local authority registers of children not in school and will do so at the next suitable legislative opportunity when parliamentary time allows.
I will work closely with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Meon Valley (Mrs Drummond)  on how we can best introduce that.
