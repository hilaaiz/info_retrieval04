Labour-run Kirklees Council has been sitting on millions of pounds of unspent section 106 infrastructure payments, much of which has been allocated for local schools.
In the meantime, I have a local school that has a leaky roof.
It is impairing the teachers’ ability to teach the children.
May I please ask the Minister what is happening with the latest round of condition improvement funding to help with school repairs?
