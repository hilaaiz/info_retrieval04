With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to announce the publication of the Government’s higher education reform consultation response.
This country is one of the best in the world for studying in higher education, boasting four of the world’s top 10 universities.
For most, higher education is a sound investment, with graduates expected to earn on average £100,000 more over their lifetime than those who do not go to university.
