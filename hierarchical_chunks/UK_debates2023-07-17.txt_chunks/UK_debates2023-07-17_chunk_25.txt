I thank the Minister for his answer.
My constituency of Edinburgh South West is home to two leading universities: Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh Napier.
Research by Universities UK shows that the constituency’s net economic benefit from international students is £170.8 million.
The Government plan to massage the net migration figures by making the UK less attractive to international students.
That is going to harm the economy in my constituency, Scotland’s economy and our educational institutions.
Can the Minister tell me: is that an example of the Union delivering for Scotland?
