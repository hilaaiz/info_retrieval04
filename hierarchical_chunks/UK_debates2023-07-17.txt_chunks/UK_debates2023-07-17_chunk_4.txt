What steps her Department is taking to fund skills and apprenticeships.
As I am sure everybody knows, I will never get tired of flying the flag for apprenticeships and skills.
This Government are investing record levels of funding, with an additional £3.8 billion in skills over this Parliament.
That includes an extra £1.6 billion for 16-to-19 education, and increasing investment in apprenticeships to £2.7 billion by 2024-25.
That supports our commitment to create a world-leading skills system that is employer-focused, high quality, and fit for the future.
This Government’s schools, colleges and businesses around the country are working hard to show young people that going to university is not the only route to success, and there are now so many study options, which the RHA, the Federation of Small Businesses, and lots of Stroud businesses are talking to me about all the time.
What is my right hon.
