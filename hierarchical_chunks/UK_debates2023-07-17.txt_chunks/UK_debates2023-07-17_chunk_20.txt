In its White Paper for schools, published last year, the Government’s headline ambition was for 90% of pupils leaving primary school to meet the expected standards in reading, writing and maths.
Why does the Minister think that, since that pledge, tens of thousands more children have been leaving primary school without meeting those standards?
As the hon.
Gentleman will know, owing to the pandemic we did see a fall in writing and maths standards.
Reading standards rose, and then fell by two points this year.
However, reading standards today are broadly similar to those before the pandemic, and since 2010 both reading and maths have improved enormously in primary schools throughout the country.
I am confident that we will meet the 90% target by 2030.
