I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The Turing scheme is a great success.
Disadvantaged students will take up two thirds of the international study and work opportunities from September, with students going to 160 different countries.
It is a remarkable scheme, given that it has been introduced so quickly.
It is a new demand-led scheme, but I will work with the sector to make improvements to it and make sure that people are funded in time.
