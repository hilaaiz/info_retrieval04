I thank the Secretary of State.
Those of us with long memories know that we either ration places by number or we give people choice.
If she is giving people the choice of being able to discriminate between the courses and universities on offer, I congratulate her, as I do especially on the lifetime learning and the degree apprenticeship expansion, which has already happened, with more to come.
