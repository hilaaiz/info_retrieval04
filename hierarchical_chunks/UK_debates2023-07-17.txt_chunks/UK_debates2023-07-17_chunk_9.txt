I thank my hon.
Friend for his continuous campaigning on this subject.
I do not know how many meetings we have had, but I see his passion to get a UTC in Southampton.
I recently met Becky Smith, one of the fantastic former students of UTC Portsmouth, who is now a degree apprentice studying mechanical engineering at the University of Chichester in my constituency.
She was full of praise for her time at UTC Portsmouth.
We are currently considering the applications we have received.
I have seen them all, and I have been through them in great detail in the latest free school wave, including Portsmouth’s bid for a new UTC in Southampton.
We hope to announce the successful applications very soon.
