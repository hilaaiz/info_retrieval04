Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Eastern Michigan University in recognition of its 175th anniversary.
An R2 Doctoral University for High Research Activity, Easton Michigan University has spent the last 175 years educating the future leaders of this nation and its contributions to society are worthy of commendation.
Established as Michigan State Normal School in 1849 as the first normal school outside of New England, the school opened its doors with 122 enrolled students on March 29th, 1853, and quickly established a reputation of training excellent educators.
By 1899 the school had developed the first four-year curriculum for a normal school in the United States and Michigan State Normal School became Michigan State Normal College.
The college continued its important mission in educating students through World War II, the Great Depression, and World War II, and later became Eastern Michigan University in 1959 after establishing its graduate school.
Following the transition to university status, an international student exchange program was organized with Britain in the early 1970s to allow students to gain broader perspectives and experiences.
