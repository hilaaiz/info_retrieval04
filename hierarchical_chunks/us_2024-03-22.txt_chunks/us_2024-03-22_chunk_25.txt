Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in The U.S. House of Representatives to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in expressing our deepest gratitude and best wishes to Reverend Dr. Emmett Scott Aniton, Jr. as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement after 45 years of devoted service at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church.
May God continue to bless him and his loved ones as he enters this new chapter in his life.
