Senator Breaux's impact on our community is reflected in the outpouring of grief and support as the entire Indiana community mourns this substantial loss.
She was a great friend, mentor, and confidante to so many, including myself.
On many occasions, I relied on her wisdom to guide me, and the lessons she taught us all will continue to endure.
On behalf of the entire 7th Congressional District, we offer our condolences to those grieving this significant loss, especially her beloved mother, former 
Senator Billie Breaux.
Today, we honor the life and legacy of 
Senator Jean Breaux, but we will continue to honor her every day moving forward by heeding her advice: fight for those less fortunate, no matter the obstacles in the way, speak up against injustice, and never stop working towards a brighter future.
