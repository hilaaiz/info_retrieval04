Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of Hermelinda Sapien.
She has dedicated 55 years to the Center for Employment Training, and the past 25 years she has displayed her unwavering leadership as President and Executive Director.
The Center for Employment Training is an economic and community development corporation.
Their job training and placement programs teach marketable skills to people of all educational levels and backgrounds, supporting them through the process of job placement.
With 12 locations, including San Jose's, CET's impact is monumental.
