Mrs. Sapien's work with CET began as an Administrative Assistant, and her commitment served her well as she moved up to Human Resources Director, Chief Administrative Officer, Deputy Director, and ultimately, President and CEO.
CET's ability to work with our community and support the dignity of self-sufficiency is largely due to Sapien's hard work.
She dedicated her career to ensuring CET's financial stability and guaranteeing that the needs of students at CET were being met.
Thousands of people have received the training and support they needed to find meaningful employment that supports them and their families.
Hermalinda's work and that of all the CET staff has changed lives and our community for the better.
Hermelinda's leadership has made a profound difference.
Hermelinda Sapien will be retiring in June of this year, and it is with great pride and respect that I recognize her accomplishments.
I share with the CET's Board of Directors in their heartfelt farewell to 
Mrs. Sapien, and we will always remember her impact on the Center for Employment Training's success.
