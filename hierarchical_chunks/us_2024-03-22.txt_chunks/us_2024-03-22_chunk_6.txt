Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a champion of our nation's abundant energy resources.
Western Energy Alliance is celebrating 50 years of unifying stakeholders and policymakers in support of oil and natural gas in the West.
Their work has helped balance the environment by providing citizens with the energy they need.
Today, just as in 1974, energy policy is vital to America's success.
Today, as back then, we also see regulators going out of their way to hamstring innovative solutions from small, independent companies focused on harnessing our Nation's mineral resources--companies that constitute the Alliance's membership.
Fortunately, the Alliance has been a guiding voice and valuable resource for members of Congress and has helped consumers combat high prices at the pump and lower their utility bills.
Congratulations to Western Energy Alliance for reaching the 50-year milestone and I thank them for being a credible advocate of western oil and natural gas.
