Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Indiana Senator Jean Breaux, who lived a life of selfless and profound service to the Indianapolis community.
For decades, 
Senator Breaux served our community with her signature fierce advocacy and fighting spirit.
Prior to holding office, Senator Breaux worked for the Indiana Department of Economic Development, where she fought for Hoosiers of all backgrounds.
In 2006, she was elected to the Indiana Senate--following in the footsteps of her mother, Billie Breaux--and served as assistant Democratic leader for the Senate Democratic Caucus from 2012 to 2020.
In her role, 
Senator Breaux fought tirelessly for vulnerable and disadvantaged Hoosiers.
In particular, she worked to improve Black infant and maternal mortality, increased access to healthy food in food deserts, protected Hoosiers from rising utility costs, fought for reproductive justice, passed policies to address poverty, advocated for gun violence prevention to keep our communities safe, and so much more.
In her role on the Senate Health Committee, she helped combat health disparities in the Black community and pushed for comprehensive access to care.
Equity was always at the center of her service.
Senator Breaux's initiative to eliminate school textbook fees passed last year, which will help Hoosier families for generations to come.
