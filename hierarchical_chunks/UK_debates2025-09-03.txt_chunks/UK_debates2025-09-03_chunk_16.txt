The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 3 September.
On Sunday, we won the contract for the biggest defence deal that Norway has ever placed.
That is a £10 billion investment, securing 15 years of shipbuilding in Scotland and across the rest of the United Kingdom.
One day later on Monday, we launched 30 hours of free childcare for working families.
Not only does that save working parents £7,500 a year, but it will transform the life chances of our children, because every child will start reception with an equal opportunity to achieve their potential.
That is a Labour Government in action, delivering for working people.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
Economically deprived high streets and poorer high streets are flooded with gambling shops.
The “aim to permit” legislation prevents councils from saying no.
My summer campaign on gambling reform has received loads of support, including from Gordon Brown, who says that if we tax the gambling industry, we will get £3 billion for our economy.
Will the Prime Minister join campaigners and help me to end “aim to permit”, so that constituents such as his and mine can thrive?
