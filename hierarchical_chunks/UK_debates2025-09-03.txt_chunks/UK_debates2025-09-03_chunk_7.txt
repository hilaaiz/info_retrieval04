The Minister will be aware that many trans people with gender recognition certificates followed all the legal processes in good faith, often over many years, and made legally binding commitments to live in their acquired gender for life.
Yet now that they find themselves legally bound to live in one gender, they are at the same time being denied access to services and facilities aligned with that gender.
How does the Minister plan to resolve those contradictory legal obligations, and what will she do to provide immediate support to the trans community?
I recognise the importance of gender recognition certificates.
Let me be absolutely clear to this House, as I have been on many occasions: no one, including trans people, should suffer indignity or a lack of respect.
They must of course have access to safe provisions and appropriate services.
However, the Supreme Court ruling was clear that biological sex is the means by which single-sex provision will be delivered.
I am really pleased that the Government are committed to delivering a full trans-inclusive ban on conversion therapy.
When will that legislation be introduced to bring that abusive practice to an end?
We are committed to bringing forward a draft Bill to ensure that we deliver on our manifesto commitment to a full trans-inclusive ban on conversion practices, which are abhorrent and have no place in our society.
