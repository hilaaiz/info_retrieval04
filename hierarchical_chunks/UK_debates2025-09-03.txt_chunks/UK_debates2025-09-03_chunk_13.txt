Trauma during childbirth can have lifelong and debilitating impacts.
Failing maternity services are felt by all, but especially by families from low-income and ethnic minority backgrounds.
In my constituency, where too many already experience health inequalities, Luton and Dunstable hospital’s maternity unit has recently been downgraded to “inadequate” by the Care Quality Commission.
Does the Minister agree with me that mothers and babies deserve better?
What cross-departmental work is taking place to ensure that NHS trusts across the country improve maternity care?
My hon.
Friend is campaigning strongly for her constituents on this issue.
We are establishing the maternity and neonatal national taskforce, which will develop a national plan to drive improvements across maternity and neonatal care.
It will be chaired by my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and made up of a panel of experts, and family, charity and staff representatives.
I was pleased to learn that my hon.
Friend met Baroness Merron in June to discuss maternity care in Luton North.
Post maternity, many women suffer female pelvic prolapse, but I am unable to get any answers on the matter of surgical mesh implants.
Will the Minister please work with his counterparts at the Department of Health and Social Care to get a realistic update on exactly what has happened as a result of the Hughes report, and give me the information about meetings between the Department and the Patient Safety Commissioner about progress on those recommendations?
I will absolutely raise the issue with colleagues in the Department and we will write to the hon.
Lady urgently with the answers she is looking for.
