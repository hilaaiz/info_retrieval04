The Minister for Women and Equalities was asked— What recent discussions she has had with the Secretary of State for Justice on the potential merits of creating new domestic abuse aggravated offences.
The Government are absolutely committed to tackling the scourge of domestic abuse and halving violence against women and girls in a decade.
We are implementing a domestic abuse identifier at sentencing to ensure consistent recognition of domestic abuse offenders across the whole justice system.
That will strengthen victim protection and offender management, delivering on a recommendation made by the independent sentencing review.
I am sickened by the frequency with which I hear from victims and survivors of domestic abuse about the ways in which the criminal justice system has aggravated their trauma.
One constituent recently told me that she was living in fear after her abuser was released early and the Probation Service failed to enforce probation conditions.
Another has seen the charges against her ex-partner scheduled for criminal trial in two years’ time, and in the meantime he continues to exert control through the family courts.
Will the Minister meet me to review what has gone wrong in those two cases and what lessons can be learned about how to use identifiers of aggravation to give victims and survivors more protection?
