I thank the hon.
Member for raising this point.
He will have seen that the commissioner put out a statement this morning in relation to this case.
I have been clear throughout that we must ensure that the police focus on the most serious issues and the issues that matter the most to our constituencies and all communities.
That includes tackling issues such as antisocial behaviour, knife crime and violence.
We have a long history of free speech in this country.
I am very proud of that, and I will always defend it.
