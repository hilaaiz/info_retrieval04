I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I was very pleased to get the call from the Prime Minister of Norway on Saturday night, telling us that the UK had won this contract, beating off competition from the US, France and Germany because of the quality of shipbuilding in this country.
This is a £10-billion deal—15 years-worth of shipbuilding, particularly in places like the Clyde, and thousands of skilled jobs in Scotland.
It shows the importance of the defence industrial strategy, and the importance of Britain being taken seriously again on the international stage.
It comes on top of the record investment in defence that we have already announced earlier this year.
