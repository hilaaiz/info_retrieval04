I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his kind words about the Conservative party—I am sure that they are deeply felt and very genuine.
What the Deputy Prime Minister should be doing is delivering more homes.
It is quite clear that the target of 1.5 million homes, which the Government claim they will deliver at the rate of 300,000 a year, will not be met.
I am quite happy to be proven wrong, but I very much suspect that I will not be, unfortunately.
