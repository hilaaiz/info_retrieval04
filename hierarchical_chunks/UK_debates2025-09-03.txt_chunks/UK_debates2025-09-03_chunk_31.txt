I thank the right hon.
Member for giving notice of his point of order.
While it is strictly not a matter for the Chair, I would agree that it is in everyone’s interest to work together to resolve matters.
I hope that we can get people around the table rather than striking.
I do not want to go into further details, and I think it is better we leave it at this stage.
