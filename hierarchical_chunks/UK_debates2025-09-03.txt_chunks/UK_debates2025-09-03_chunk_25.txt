I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
I was very proud to make our announcement about childcare on Monday.
As she says, rightly, it will save families on average £7,500 in a cost of living crisis, but crucially, it also applies from nine months to four years.
Under the previous Government, there was a disparity at age four between children arriving at reception, with some barely out of nappies, and others quite articulate.
That locks in inequality for  life.
I am really pleased that the measure that we announced on Monday unlocks that, ensuring that every single child aged four gets to the starting line in reception with a fair chance of going as far as their talents will take them.
