Since the start of the full-scale invasion into Ukraine, Russia has stolen, abducted and indoctrinated at least 19,546 children.
It is one of the most heinous crimes of this war.
I warmly welcome this morning’s announcement of an additional package of sanctions on those perpetrating these crimes, and will the Prime Minister assure the House that he will do everything possible to return these children to their homes?
I acknowledge my hon.
Friend’s campaigning on this really important issue.
Russia’s policy of forced deportations and indoctrination of Ukrainian children is despicable, and anybody who has heard the stories or seen the pictures cannot be other than profoundly moved.
We have taken firm action.
This was one issue that we discussed two weeks ago in Washington when I went over with other leaders to ensure that we are all imposing maximum pressure.
Among the very many horrors of the Ukraine conflict, this is right up there as one of the absolute worst.
Like many, I was deeply concerned that a police force deemed it necessary to take five armed officers to arrest a comedy writer from a flight.
Some may have found Mr Linehan’s comments offensive, but that is not the point.
If we do not support speech that we do not like, we do not support free speech.
Will the Prime Minister commit to reviewing our speech laws to ensure that legitimate free expression is protected and will he condemn the culture within the public sector that prioritises this dangerous and perverse nonsense?
