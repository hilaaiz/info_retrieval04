I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question and for all his work to amplify the voices of victims and survivors.
Like him, I am sickened by the treatment of the majority of women and girls who go through this in our criminal justice system.
He will know that we inherited a criminal justice system in absolute crisis.
That is why we conducted a once-in-a-generation review of our courts process—the Leveson review—which the Government will respond to shortly, and a once-in-a-generation sentencing review, to consider exactly the issues that he is talking about.
I will happily meet him to discuss this further.
