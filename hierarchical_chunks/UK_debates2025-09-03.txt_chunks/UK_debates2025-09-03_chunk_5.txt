I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that vital point.
She will, like me, be horrified by the results of the Femicide Census report this week, which show a rise in mothers being killed by their sons.
We must tackle that as a society.
She will be pleased to know that what she is talking about will be in the upcoming violence against women and girls strategy.
