I thank the shadow Chancellor for introducing this debate on such an important issue.
Properties and assets are vital to the country and to people.
On the lifetime limit for inheritance tax, over the past year everyone will have heard the Government telling farmers and family businesses to get their affairs in order and to plan.
Not having a limit on the lifetime cap was what allowed them to plan.
If that is cut or the cap is not in the right place, it will negate every argument that the Government have made in the past year to justify their family farm and family business tax.
Will the Minister please acknowledge that and rule out any change to the cap, which would penalise family farms and businesses?
