The Minister will be aware that many trans people with gender recognition certificates followed all the legal processes in good faith, often over many years, and made legally binding commitments to live in their required gender for life.
Yet now that they find themselves legally bound to live in one gender, they are at the same time being denied access to services and facilities aligned with that gender.
How does the Minister plan to resolve those contradictory legal obligations, and what will she do to provide immediate support to the trans community?

Has the Minister been told which bodies they are, and how can women and girls have any confidence in them if they are knowingly and deliberately breaking the law?
My hon.

Does he agree that that extends beyond economic value to their value more generally?
The Golden Smog, a friendly family pub in my constituency, supports an inclusive basketball team and has raised £700,000 from its annual “pALEgrimage”—it is like a pilgrimage but involves ale, so it is even better.
Will he join me in congratulating that pub?
