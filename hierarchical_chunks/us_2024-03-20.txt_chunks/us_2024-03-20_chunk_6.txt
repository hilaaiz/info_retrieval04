Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hampton High School Men's Basketball Team from Hampton, Virginia on becoming the Virginia High School League's Class 4 State Champions.
On Friday, March 8, 2024, the Hampton Crabbers won the championship game against the Tuscarora Huskies with a score of 66-63.
Led by Coach Eric Brown, the Crabbers won this title for the sixth time, the first since 2012.
Hampton High School closed their season with a record of 26 wins and 2 losses, maintaining a 16-game winning streak.
Throughout the game, the Crabbers and Huskies fought for control of the court, with the Crabbers maintaining the lead.
But victory for the Crabbers would not come easily, as the Huskies consistently chipped away at their lead.
With 20 seconds left on the clock, senior Daron Baugh sank two free-throws to give the Crabbers the final 66-63 lead.
The Crabbers fought hard and stayed determined until the game was over, and because of that, they were able to secure the championship.
