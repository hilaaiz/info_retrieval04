Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Susie Bell of Canon City for being inducted into the Fremont Hall.
Susie was a pillar in Fremont County and spent decades improving the community before her passing in November of 2023.
Her many philanthropic contributions and hours of volunteer work continue to have a transformative impact on students and so many others in Fremont County.
Susie was committed to advancing education--she built several scholarships for current and future learners, supported early childhood development programs, and donated and volunteered for many events to promote the arts.
Her tireless work and dedication to Fremont County did not go unnoticed.
She will be missed, but her contributions will last for generations.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Susie Bell for being inducted into Fremont Hall of Fame and thank her for her contribution and commitment to our community.
