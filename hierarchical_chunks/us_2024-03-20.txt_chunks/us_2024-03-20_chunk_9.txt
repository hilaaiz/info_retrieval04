Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Alexei Navalny, who made the ultimate sacrifice in his fight for freedom, democracy, and basic human rights.
For more than a decade, Navalny courageously led the unflinching opposition against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his evil cronies.
Determined to create a truly democratic Russia, Navalny exposed Putin for who he truly is: a murderous, corrupt dictator.
In August of 2020, officers of the Russian government attempted to kill Navalny by poison, forcing him to be evacuated and hospitalized in Germany.
Despite this attempt on his life, Navalny never wavered and, after miraculously recovering from this attempted murder, insisted on returning to Russia to continue his mission of bringing freedom to his countrymen.
Upon his return home, Navalny was wrongfully imprisoned by Russian authorities for the remainder of his life and, tragically, to his death.
His only crime was his determination to speak out in the face of oppression and advocate for a Russia free from Putin's control.
Throughout his imprisonment, Navalny never lost his sense of optimism and hope for the future.
He remained positive, even telling jokes in court less than 24 hours before his death.
While in prison in the Arctic Circle, Navalny continued being a strong voice for freedom, relying on his family, lawyers, and other supporters to speak out on his behalf and stand defiant against Putin's evil regime.
He was a man of deep conviction who never faltered in his mission, no matter the cost.
He was one of the bravest, most principled men I have ever met, and his memory will never be forgotten.
The United States must continue Navalny's legacy and stand up against Putin's efforts to trample freedom in Europe and around the world.
May we never stop fighting to secure peace and democracy for all those who seek it, just as Navalny so courageously did.
