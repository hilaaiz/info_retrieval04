Trujillo attended Sierra Vista Elementary, Haven Drive Middle School, and Arvin High School, and was involved in numerous activities in the Arvin community during her childhood.
Mayor Trujillo dedicated her life to serving the Arvin community for more than 60 years.
She served as the Vice-President of the Arvin Chamber of Commerce from 2013 to 2018, Chair of the Arvin City Planning Commission from 2015 to 2018, and was a member of the Arvin City Council from 2016 to 2018.
In 2020, she was elected as the Mayor of the City.
As the first woman, Latina, and immigrant in this position, her election represented a significant milestone in our community's history.
During her tenure, Mayor Trujillo was deeply committed to serving the community's most vulnerable, including the youth, senior, and homeless populations.
She was instrumental in bringing new jobs to the city, improving resources for the homeless population, and leading domestic violence awareness campaigns.
She significantly expanded various services for Arvin residents, including the new Bakersfield College Arvin Campus, the first Urgent Care Center and food bank, and the Arvin Kiwanis Club for youth leadership development.
Mayor Trujillo was a trailblazing leader, passionate about the well-being of all residents of the community.
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life.
Her service to the Arvin community will be felt for generations to come.
My thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time.
