Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mayor Olivia Trujillo, who passed away on March 3, 2024, surrounded by loved ones.
She was 67 years old.
Mayor Trujillo was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and at the age of five, her family immigrated to Arvin, California.
During her summers, she worked alongside her family harvesting fruits and vegetables in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley, learning the values of hard work and perseverance from a young age.
