Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the O'Neal School's varsity girls basketball team on winning their first ever state basketball title.
Last month, for the first time in school history, the women of the O'Neal School won the North Carolina Independent Schools Athletic Association (NCISAA) 2A basketball state championship.
The Falcons won this year's championship by a final score of 48-32 over Wayne County Day School.
This victory caps off what was an incredible year for the Falcons, who finished the season with a 30-1 record.
This is a momentous and well-deserved achievement.
The coaches and players of the O'Neal School's girls basketball team have brought great pride to both their school and the whole of Moore County.
I wish them all the best and hope to see them continue their great success next season.
Go Falcons.
