Mr. HIMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS) in Stamford, Connecticut, as they celebrate their 60th anniversary.
Since their inception in 1964, AIFS has pioneered cultural exchange and educational enrichment, having impacted the lives of over 1.8 million individuals and deepened relationships across international borders.
In partnership with the U.S. Department of State, AIFS continues to operate a diverse selection of programs for their nearly 40,000 annual participants, including study and travel abroad, high school exchange, camp counselor, and intern/trainee programs, which epitomize the Administration's dedication to diverse partnerships.
It is my unique honor to recognize the American Institute For Foreign Study for their 60th anniversary.
