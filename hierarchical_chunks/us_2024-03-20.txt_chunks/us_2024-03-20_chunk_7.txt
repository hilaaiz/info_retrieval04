Mr. Speaker, I want to again congratulate the Hampton High School Basketball Team and thank Coach Brown, the parents, and the entire Hampton High School community for supporting these students throughout the season.
They have all made their community proud.
I wish them the best in their future endeavors, and I wish the program continued success.
