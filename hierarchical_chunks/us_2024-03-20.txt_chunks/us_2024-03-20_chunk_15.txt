Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize and immortalize the career and accomplishments.
From the U.S. Army Reserve to the Vernon Police Department, to his future role as an armed school security officer in Ellington, Chief Kelley has always put his life on the line for the safety of others.
He is a reliable and amiable individual whose devotion to his community shines through in every aspect of his being.
One may hope that his humility and thoughtfulness are emulated by future generations.
As Chief Kelley caps off 28 years of consummate service to Vernon, we should acknowledge his wife, Kellie, and daughters Grace and Abby.
I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in commending and thanking John Kelley for his endless service to the United States.
