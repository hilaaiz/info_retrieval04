The Minister is new to his task, and a very wide portfolio it is.
In the wall-to-wall briefings he is currently getting, will he particularly ask for briefings on British science in the Arctic and the Antarctic?
We have 78 universities that are leading in that field—we are the fourth largest polar scientific research nation.
We are a leader in that area, and the Minister needs to know all about it.
I know that my hon.
Friend does fantastic work highlighting polar research through the all-party parliamentary group for the polar regions.
I will be happy to champion that work, and to meet him regarding that important domain for science.
