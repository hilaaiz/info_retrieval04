I welcome my right hon.
Friend and Essex neighbour to the great position of Home Secretary, and wish him well in all his endeavours on this incredibly difficult issue.
He touched on the Supreme Court’s decision and its comments on refoulement.
Today’s judgment was clear on that, but the issue is not new; it was raised earlier this year in the Court of Appeal.
If I may say so, Ministers had the opportunity to address some of the practical measures prior to today’s judgment.
I urge the Home Secretary to take every necessary step and measure to work with the Government of Rwanda on the practical, operational delivery of the migration and economic development partnership to give all those assurances.
That partnership is clearly integral to ensuring that we break the business model and stop the evil trade of people smuggling.
Addressing that principle will go a long way towards bringing in this essential deterrent in the illegal migration battle.
