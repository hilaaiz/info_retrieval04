I thank the Prime Minister for meeting my constituent Noam.
It has been 40 days since his mum, Ada Sagi, was kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October.
We all condemn Hamas’s actions and fight for the return of all hostages.
Noam wants the language of love to be louder than the language of hate.
Some 11,000 Palestinians have been killed, more than 4,000 of them children.
International law is important.
Does the Prime Minister agree that we can support Israel but also call out breaches of international law?
