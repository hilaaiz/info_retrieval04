I welcome the Minister of State,  the hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) , to his role, and I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State,  the hon.
Member for Meriden (Saqib Bhatti) , on his appointment and on the birth of his child.
I hope that he is getting some sleep in these busy days.
