I welcome the new Home Secretary to his place and share his disappointment at this morning’s judgment.
As we have heard, the Supreme Court focused on the principle of non-refoulement.
Hopefully that can be addressed in a new treaty.
Perhaps it will be made more robust if we can work jointly with other European partners who have expressed an interest in a Rwanda-type scheme.
Why, however, was this not considered in the original Rwanda treaty, and which Law Officer was responsible for giving legal advice to the Home Office about how it might stand up to challenge in the courts?
