I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
The UK’s long-standing position on the middle east peace process is very clear: we support a negotiated settlement, leading to a safe and secure Israel alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state in Gaza and the west bank.
I spoke about this on Monday.
Both Israelis and Palestinians have a right to live in peace and security.
The longer-term governance of Gaza and security needs to be looked at in the round.
It is something that I have discussed repeatedly with President Abbas.
We agree with the United States that Gaza should ultimately be under the control of the Palestinian Authority.
We will continue to support President Abbas and his people to get to that outcome.
