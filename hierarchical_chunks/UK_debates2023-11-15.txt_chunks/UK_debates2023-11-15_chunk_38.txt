I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his consistent campaigning on this issue.
I recall his last question at Prime Minister’s questions on this very topic.
I reassure him that we are committed to fair treatment for people affected by the changes, while protecting taxpayers appropriately.
Wherever property has been acquired for HS2, property owners have been fully compensated, and any outstanding cases will be settled.
We are developing a programme to sell the surplus land on HS2 phase 2, ensuring that it delivers value for money and does not disrupt local property markets.
I will ensure that the Rail Minister meets him swiftly so that he can speak on behalf of his constituents.
