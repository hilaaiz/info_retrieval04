I welcome the Home Secretary to his new role.
I am sure he would want to join me in expressing gratitude to all those in our public services who came here as refugees and make such a fantastic contribution to our country.
At the heart of this case are a series of asylum seekers, one of whom I know has been confirmed as a victim of trafficking.
He has been stuck in an asylum hotel since May 2022.
As yet, the Government have not even begun to look at his claim for asylum.
Can the Home Secretary tell us when his Department will begin to process the claims of those people and get on with finding out whether they are illegal asylum seekers?
Or is he just going to continue with the charade that he can make Rwanda workable?
