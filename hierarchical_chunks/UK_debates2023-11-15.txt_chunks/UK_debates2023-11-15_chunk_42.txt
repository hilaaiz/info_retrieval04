A new generation of drugs, Orkambi, Symkevi and Kaftrio, is transforming the lives of patients with cystic fibrosis.
People who would otherwise be waiting for double lung transplants are now living happy, healthy lives.
However, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is now saying that we cannot afford those drugs.
Will the Prime Minister and his new Health Secretary get around the table with NICE and the drugs company to ensure that the children who are being born with cystic fibrosis today are given those life-saving drugs in the same way as the children who are currently living with cystic fibrosis?
