My right hon.
Friend will know that the planned retirement of the public switched telephone network in 2025 will bring very significant concerns across rural communities, particularly in Essex—he will be familiar with that.
Can he provide some assurance about the work that is under way between the Government and telecommunications providers to help improve services in Essex, particularly where we have poor broadband connectivity?
As I suggested earlier, the retirement of the PSTN land network is a decision for the industry, but the Government have a key role to play in ensuring vulnerable consumers are protected through the transition.
I have regular meetings with communications providers and Ofcom to discuss progress on that.
With regard to Essex, I share my right hon.
Friend’s concern—my constituency is the neighbouring constituency to hers—about the need to ensure that vulnerable constituents are protected.
I can assure her that I will continue— Order.
We have only about seven minutes, so the Minister really has to be a bit more cautious in how much time he is using.
