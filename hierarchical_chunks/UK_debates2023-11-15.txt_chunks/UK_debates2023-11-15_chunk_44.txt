In view of the events of the last six weeks, can the Prime Minister tell the House why the Government have not proscribed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps?
This Government continue to take strong action against Iran while people in the UK and around the world are under threat from the regime.
We have sanctioned more than 350 Iranian individuals and entities, including the IRGC in its entirety.
The National Security Act 2023 implements new measures to protect the British public, including new offences for espionage and foreign interference.
While the Government  keep the list of proscribed organisations under review, it is, as Members will be aware, a long-standing convention that we do not comment on whether a specific organisation is being considered for proscription.
