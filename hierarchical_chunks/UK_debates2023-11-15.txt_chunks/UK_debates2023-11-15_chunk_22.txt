I share the hon.
Member’s pride in the wonderful work done by Cranfield University and Cranfield Aerospace Solutions.
We are providing £1.6 billion  of funding for the UK’s nine Catapults, including the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, some of which will go to the Cranfield Digital Aviation Research and Technology Centre.
I hope to join the hon.
Member in visiting that wonderful institution.
