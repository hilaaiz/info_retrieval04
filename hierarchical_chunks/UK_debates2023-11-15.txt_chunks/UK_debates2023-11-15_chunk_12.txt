I thank my hon.
Friend for his remarks.
We have just had a global, leading AI safety summit, which had immense coverage on that and also focused on frontier risks.
We have always been clear that we will take a pragmatic, proportionate and contextual approach.
With the 28 countries plus the European Union who have agreed to the Bletchley declaration, there is a great opportunity to use AI for our benefit, but we should also be wary of the risks involved.
