I thank the Minister for that response.
I have heard from numerous constituents who have been victims of online scams where perpetrators ask for bank details over the phone.
What steps can the Minister take to make people, especially elderly people—they are the ones who come to me—more aware of what to look out for in terms of online scams, to ensure that the money that they have earned over their lifetime is not stolen?
