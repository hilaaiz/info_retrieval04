I thank my right hon.
Friend for his kind remarks.
As I said, the Government will take this issue incredibly seriously, and I am confident that, through the defending democracy taskforce and election cell, we will be able to do the utmost to protect ourselves from election interference.
I offer to meet him to discuss this further and see what else can be done.
