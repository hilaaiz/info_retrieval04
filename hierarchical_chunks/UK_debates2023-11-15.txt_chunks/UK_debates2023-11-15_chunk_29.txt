The Prime Minister has said that terrorist groups could use artificial intelligence to build chemical or biological weapons, but he has still failed to act decisively to regulate AI, even though the US and the EU are both taking action.
Will the Minister tell the House whether the Secretary of State is using her current trip to the US to learn from the Biden Administration, or will our country have to put up with yet more dither and delay?
The Government have always been clear that we will have a contextual and proportionate response to AI.
I spoke to the Secretary of State yesterday, and it is very clear that the US sees us as global leaders and will be working with us.
Teesside was built on steel and now, thanks to Ben Houchen, British Steel is bringing steelmaking back to Teesside.
Green steel will be forged thanks to a new £1.25 billion arc furnace, leading the way in decarbonising our industries and bringing highly skilled jobs.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that any business looking to invest in green tech and energy in the UK should look to Teesside first?
Teesside is a wonderful net zero powerhouse, and I commend the green steel project.
That is one reason why Teesside was chosen to pilot the Innovate UK programme of launchpads, each of which will receive up to £7.5 million.
