I thank my right hon.
Friend for his kind words.
My focus in this role is making sure that the Department is highly effective in protecting the British people and protecting our borders.
This is not about trying to look tough; it is about trying to deliver for the British people, and that will be my relentless focus.
My right hon.
and learned Friend the Attorney General reminds me that her advice, like that of all very good in-house lawyers, is limited to the client, which is His Majesty’s Government.
However, I have no doubt I could persuade her to meet my right hon.
Friend on a private basis.
