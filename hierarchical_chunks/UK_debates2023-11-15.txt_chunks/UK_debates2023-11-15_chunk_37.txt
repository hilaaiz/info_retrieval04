I thank my right hon.
Friend for that encouraging answer.
On behalf of my constituents in Lichfield, may I thank him for having the guts to stop HS2?
May I ask that, for the area in the north of my constituency where construction is still going on, that happens swiftly, and that in areas that will not have HS2, compensation is given swiftly to those people who are expecting it?
