perform colonoscopies.
If a mass is found, the center gives the patient the pamphlet so patients don't have to go through their cancer journey alone.
The foundation also provides the public with pamphlets about colon cancer screening and pamphlets for current colon cancer patients.
All of the pamphlets have been designed by Bryan.
Bryan has also been instrumental in fundraising efforts to ensure the non-profit foundation has the resources it needs to operate.
Bryan even formed the ``Green and Gold Committee'' at USF where he and his fellow Pre-Med students met regularly to discuss ways to help the Foundation prosper.
They held a ``game night'' at USF to educate college kids about colon cancer and offered screening information for them to share with their family members.
They raised a little money and dispensed a lot of information.
Bryan is about to start his journey in medical school this summer and plans to practice medicine in Citrus County one day.
It is clear that 
Mr. Fisher has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
