Mr. Speaker.
I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Volunteer Fairfax for its decades of outstanding community service.
I congratulate the recipients of the 2024 Fairfax County Volunteer Service Awards and thank them and the thousands of other local volunteers for their incredible contributions to our community.
Their selfless dedication is worthy of our highest praise and is one of the main reasons that our community is often ranked as one of the best places in the country to live, work, and raise a family.
