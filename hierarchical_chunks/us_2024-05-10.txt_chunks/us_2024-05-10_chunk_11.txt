You've probably seen footage of antisemitic mobs who have been defending the actions of Hamas, harassing Jewish students and disrupting learning across college campuses in America.
The House has launched a probe to crack down on campus antisemitism, and we will not stop until Jewish students feel safe on their campuses, and until universities that fail to do their part are held accountable.
Colleges and universities need leadership with a moral backbone to stand up against antisemitism and provide a safe learning environment for Jewish students.
Any administrators who refuse to hold these protestors accountable are not fit to lead and should resign.
