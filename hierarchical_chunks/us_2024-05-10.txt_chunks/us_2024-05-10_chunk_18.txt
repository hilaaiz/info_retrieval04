Representatives and is an opportunity for Gold Star family members to apply for a one-year fellowship with members of Congress.
This includes any family member (parents, children including stepchildren, spouses or siblings) of military members who have died in the line of duty.
If you are interested in applying for this fellowship, visit the CAO website here.
With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards Member of Congress
