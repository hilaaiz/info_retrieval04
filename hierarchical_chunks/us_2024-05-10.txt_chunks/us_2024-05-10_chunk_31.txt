Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mark McGoff of Arvada, Colorado for winning the Pioneer Award from the Arvada Chamber Mark has proudly served his community in Arvada for years as a member of the City Council, the Arvada Fire Board, and a volunteer for the Historical Society, Arvada Jefferson Kiwanis, and the Arvada Center.
He is an Emeritus Board Member of the Ralston House and is currently working to plan Arvada's anniversary celebration this year.
The Pioneer Award is granted when a previous winner of the Man or Woman of the Year Award continues to perform notable work for the people.
Mark has done exactly that with his continual contributions to the community and longstanding dedication to public service.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Mark McGoff for winning the Pioneer Award.
We thank him for his commitment to our community.
