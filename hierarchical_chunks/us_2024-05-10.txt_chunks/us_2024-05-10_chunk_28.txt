Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the service and patriotism of one of my constituents, Ernest Scango.
Mr. Scango was born on January 8, 1923 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
He was drafted into the United States Army on March 5, 1943.
After training at Fort Benning, Ernest joined the 551st Paratroop Infantry Battalion.
As a Parachutist and Rifleman, Ernest participated in the major battles taking place in France.
He took part in Operation Dragoon which was designed to secure the southern coast of France and the critical Mediterranean ports while forcing the Germans to open a second front while facing the D-Day invasion in Normandy under Operation Overlord.
Then, he subsequently redeployed and took part in the Ardennes Offensive and Rhineland campaigns which were critical to ending war in Europe.
Today, 
Mr. Scango lives in Homosassa, Florida where he just celebrated his 102nd birthday.
This month, he is receiving the distinguished insignia at ``Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur'' (``Knight in the Legion of Honor'') from the French government.
As a Member of the Greatest Generation, 
Mr. Scango and his fellow brothers and sisters-in-arms demonstrated incredible bravery and skill as they fought to save the world from the evils of Nazism, hatred and genocide.
We all owe this hero a debt of gratitude that can never fully be repaid.
Today and always, we remember his patriotism and courageous actions.
We must honor his service and sacrifice by continuing to protect the sacred values of freedom he fought so hard to defend.
