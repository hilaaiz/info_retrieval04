During a House Budget Committee hearing, members examined the financial consequences of the administration's border crisis and had an opportunity to inform the American people The White House's open border policies have resulted in a surge of illegal immigrant encounters and influx of deadly drugs across our southwestern border.
This is being paid for by the American taxpayer at the federal, state and local levels.
The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) calculated that illegal immigration for 2023 alone cost taxpayers $150.7 billion.
Taxpayers are shouldering $8,776 per illegal immigrant per year for nearly 22 million illegal immigrants to cover costs including for housing, feeding, clothing, jailing, adjudication, education and shelter.
To protect American lives and improve the federal government's stewardship of taxpayer dollars, securing our southwestern border requires a collaborative partnership among all levels of government, including federal, state and local.
As a member of the House Budget Committee, I'll continue to look for avenues to enforce the law of the land and implement a cost-effective, comprehensive border security strategy that secures our border, ends illegal immigration and protects our citizens.
