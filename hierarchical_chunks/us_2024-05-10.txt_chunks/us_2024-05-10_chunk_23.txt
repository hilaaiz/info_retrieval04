Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made to our community by one of my constituents, Catherine Scheland, has exemplified outstanding dedication and selflessness as a volunteer with a local non-profit, One Community Now.
Cathy plays a pivotal role in the organization's Veterans program, serving as a team leader for Operation Stand Down.
Her commitment is truly commendable, dedicating over 180 hours each year to the event's setup, overseeing the Chaplains' area, and co-directing the transportation area.
Beyond the event, Cathy personally delivers bicycles to veterans in need throughout the year, using her own resources to provide locks and lights.
She serves as a mentor, offering support and using her own funds to assist homeless veterans with housing.
In the organization's Pack A Sack initiative to fight childhood hunger, Cathy is also actively involved, ensuring children have food every weekend of the year.
She not only contributes her time but also financially supports the program.
Cathy's engagement extends to the agency's annual Pack the Park fundraiser, where she plays a vital role in securing sponsors, donations, and volunteers.
Cathy's dedication isn't confined to our One Community Now; she volunteers with other
