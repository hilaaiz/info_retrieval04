Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the work of the Educational Foundation of Dexter over the last four decades.
Both the teachers and students of the Dexter community have had a more fulfilling educational experience due to the hard work of the EFD.
We are excited to see what they can accomplish over the next 40 years.
I thank the EFD.
