If the White House is going to require new product standards for energy conservation, the requirements should be feasible and reasonable.
I cast NC-11's vote for the Hands Off Our Home Appliances Act to modify the Department of Energy's (DOE) procedures for mandating energy-efficiency standards by prohibiting the DOE secretary from requiring standards that are not technologically feasible and economically justified.
Western North Carolinians are already burdened by rising costs, and the last thing we need is more unrealistic federal regulations that further raise prices, fail to provide meaningful energy savings and take away consumer choice.
