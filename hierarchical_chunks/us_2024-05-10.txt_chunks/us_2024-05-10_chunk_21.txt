Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions that have been made to our community by one of my constituents, Bryan Fisher.
Three years ago, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer and started a non-profit charity with her gastroenterologist and surgeon.
Their goal was helping other colon cancer patients.
Bryan, who was a Pre-Med student at the University of South Florida in Tampa at the time, volunteered countless hours to help the organization get off the ground.
He maintains the non-profit organization's website, updating it regularly with helpful resources for patients and healthcare providers.
The Foundation provides pamphlets to endoscopy centers that
