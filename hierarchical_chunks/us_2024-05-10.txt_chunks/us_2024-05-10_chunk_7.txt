A major reason we need to stop illegal immigrants from skewing representation numbers in our government is due to this administration's disastrous open-border policies that have allowed more than 7.2 million illegal immigrants to enter our country through our southern border.
That is more than the population of 36 states.
President Biden inherited policies from President Trump that would have strengthened our border security.
However, since Biden's first day in office, he has reversed policies that were in place to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, and has undermined U.S. border security on more than 60 occasions.
The House sent a strong message by passing H. Res. 1112, which condemns this administration's policies that have created this costly border crisis.
We also urged the administration to take immediate action to end this national security threat, and we will not rest until law and order is restored at our borders.
