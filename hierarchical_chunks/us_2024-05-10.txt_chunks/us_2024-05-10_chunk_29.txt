Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Humble House Cafe from Golden, Colorado for being honored as part of the Golden Rotary Ethics in Business Awards.
Known for its positive atmosphere and work environment, Humble House has designed a business model which includes both community involvement and charity work.
Humble House is involved with a variety of causes.
They offer free coffee Tuesdays for teachers, first-responders, and non-profit workers, sell retail on behalf of passionate artisans in the local community and creators in developing countries, and allow customers to choose which of several nonprofits the charity proceeds from their purchase will go.
Humble House has taken great care to create a business model that caters to the needs of the environment, encourages local community growth and engagement, and supports those in need around the world.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to thank the wonderful people of Humble House for their active involvement in our community.
