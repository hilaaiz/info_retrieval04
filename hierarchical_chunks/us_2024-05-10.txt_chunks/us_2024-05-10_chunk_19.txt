Ms. LOIS FRANKEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Annette Wolf for her milestone 100th birthday celebrated on April 1, 2024.
Annette has been a resident of Boynton Beach, Florida since 1999 and is a proud wife and mother to two great men.
What a wonderful occasion for Annette, her family, and friends as she reminisces and celebrates a life great in years and rich in accomplishments.
Annette and her husband ran a corrugated box factory business in Upstate New York for several years.
She started the Women's Business and Professional Organization in 1954 in Glens Falls, NY.
Annette loves to socialize with her friends by playing Mah-Jongg and Canasta.
She believes in doing everything in moderation and is an avid reader and regular viewer of MSNBC and CNN.
She has lived through extraordinary times in history and has no doubt witnessed remarkable changes unimaginable at the time of her birth in 1924.
May this be a joyous time as her family and friends gather to celebrate this amazing milestone.
Annette always has a smile on her face and remains positive in all things.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to congratulate 
Ms. Annette Wolf on her 100th birthday and I wish her good health and great happiness.
