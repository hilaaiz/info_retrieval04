Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Keith Sorci for earning the Man of the Year Award from the Arvada Chamber.
Keith has been serving his community for over 20 years in many capacities, including as president of the Arvada Gardeners, volunteering with the Arvada Historical Society and with local schools, and distributing food to those in need.
Keith also works with Jefferson County Justice Services which offers alternatives to incarceration for Coloradans, training others to be equally helpful in their work for the community.
His continued dedication to the Arvada Community showcases his spirit of service and this award acknowledges his hard work.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Keith on achieving the 2023 Arvada Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year Award.
