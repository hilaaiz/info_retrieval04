Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Educational Foundation of Dexter on the 40th anniversary of their founding.
The support they have provided for Dexter's students and educators over the last 40 years is worthy of commendation.
The Educational Foundation of Dexter (EFD) was founded in 1984 to enhance the educational experience for those enrolled in the Dexter Community School District.
Through teacher written grants, the EFD provides financial support for new and innovative educational projects.
The EFD has awarded over $1 million since 1984 for programs such as FLEX Robotics Kits for Creekside Middle School, a field trip to the Charles H. Wright Museum for the entire 5th grade, adaptive music for students with special needs, and equipment to support the Iron Dread program at Dexter High School.
In 2023, the EFD's Spring Auction raised over $24,000 for Dexter students.
In 2015, Excellence 4 Dexter Students (E4DS) was formed in response to multiple years of annual budget cuts at the state level.
This led to some notable changes within the district, including larger class sizes and reduced staffing.
Since their founding, E4DS has donated over $182,000 to the Dexter Community Schools for additional programming.
Their donations have supported additional math and science programming for grades 3-6, mental wellness programs for both staff and students, and an experience at Eastern Michigan University for many 6th grade classes.
In 2020, E4DS and the Educational Foundation of Dexter joined forces to better support and respond to the needs of the Dexter Community School District.
