Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Coen Brehmer, a Yulee High School Hornet who recently won the Florida High School weightlifting championships which is impressive at any age, but even more so as only a junior in high school.
Coen qualified for both the Olympic and traditional in the 119-pound weight class.
At the state championship, Coen stung the competition, winning first in the Olympic lift and finishing second in traditional.
He pulled off a 160-pound snatch, a 205-pound clean-and-jerk, and a 215-pound bench to bring home the gold.
The victory was as sweet as honey and the crowd was buzzing at his magnificent displays of strength.
The Hornets, under the leadership of Coach Kyle Dougherty, performed incredibly well across the board this season.
Coen's teammates, Zachary Kruger and Kevin Harris, also qualified for state after exceptional performances this season.
Coen is a fantastic representation.
He is a kind friend and a great teammate.
His hard work paid off and he became Yulee High School's first male state champion in any sport.
