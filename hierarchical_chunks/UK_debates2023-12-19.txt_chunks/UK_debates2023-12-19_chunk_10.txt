I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question.
She will know that 70% of trading businesses only pay the lower corporation tax rate of 19%.
That covers the vast majority of small businesses.
I used to run my own business; I ran it for 14 years before I came into Parliament.
I could not agree with her more: small  businesses are the backbone of the British economy, which is why we are tackling the scourge of low payments and we rolled over the 75% discount on retail, hospitality and leisure business rates in the autumn statement.
