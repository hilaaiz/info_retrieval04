I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
As she knows, the marriage allowance is currently £1,260 per year, and it has been fixed at 10% of the personal allowance since it was introduced in 2015.
On this side of the House, we believe it should be a woman’s choice, and we want to make that choice as real as possible for every family.
For that reason, we think the best thing we can do is to bring down the taxes paid by working people to put more money into the family budget, and we were happy to make a start on that in the autumn statement.
