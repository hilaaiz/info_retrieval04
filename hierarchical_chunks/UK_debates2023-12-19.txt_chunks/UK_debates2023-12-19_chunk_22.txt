I thank the Minister for that response.
It is very welcome to see full expensing, which will help businesses to invest in the plant and machinery and the technology that are needed.
It would also help the ceramics sector, in particular, if it were exempted from the emissions trading scheme.
Will my hon.
Friend speak to the Chancellor about the possibility of exempting the ceramics sector from the ETS, which would help to give the sector the breathing space to invest in productivity and energy efficiency gains?
