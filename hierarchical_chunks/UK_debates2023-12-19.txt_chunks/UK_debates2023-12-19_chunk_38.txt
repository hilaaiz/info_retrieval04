I am grateful to  the hon.
Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran)  for securing this very important urgent question.
May I say how deeply sorry I am to hear of the terrifying experience facing her family in Gaza?
I am sure the whole House is with her and her relatives at what must be an incredibly difficult time.
The reports from the Holy Family Catholic church are shocking: an innocent mother and daughter killed in the grounds of a church, with others too scared to leave and now running out of food.
Once again in this conflict, a place of sanctuary and peace has become a scene of fear and death.
It is one example of the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe confronting civilians across Gaza, and a reminder of the urgent imperative to address this crisis and help bring about the conditions for a sustainable ceasefire.
It comes at a moment of growing concern that this conflict could escalate, with Hezbollah in the north, more violence in the west bank, and Houthi threats in the Red sea.
We support efforts to maintain regional security, and Labour welcomes the UK’s participation in the new maritime security effort.
We thank our armed forces personnel for their service and professionalism.
Today, the United Nations Security Council is voting once again on a resolution.
This is a crucial chance to address the urgent and catastrophic situation in Gaza.
Let me be clear: Labour wants a resolution to pass, one that can protect civilian lives, that demands that hostages are released, and that can act as a stepping stone towards a sustainable ceasefire and provide renewed  impetus towards a two-state solution.
The time has come for the United Kingdom to support our international allies at this critical moment.
