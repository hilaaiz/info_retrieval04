I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his comments.
We have talked about this topic in my previous roles over many years.
He is aware that the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has published a consultation on the introduction of a planning use class for short-term lets.
He will also be aware that, through the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, the Government have introduced a new power to allow councils to apply a council tax premium on second homes.
There is progress in this area, but we are always open to new ideas.
