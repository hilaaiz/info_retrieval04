Thank you very much for doing the funnies, Mr Speaker.
Freeports can certainly be a catalyst of economic growth and prosperity in north Wales and the east midlands, but they must be in the right place.
Putting a freeport in North West Leicestershire, which already enjoys some of the highest economic growth in the country, has low unemployment, and is capable of filling its industrial sites without incentives, makes little sense.
Will the Chancellor agree to meet me to discuss better alternatives for the east midlands than the Diseworth freeport site?
I would be happy to ask one of my colleagues to meet the hon.
Gentleman to discuss why freeports are not appropriate in his part of Leicestershire.
What recent discussions he has had with his Scottish counterpart on farm budgets for the financial year 2024-25.
A very merry Christmas, Mr Speaker.
The Government guarantee to maintain the £2.4 billion annual budget for farmers across the UK for every year of this Parliament.
As agriculture is devolved, it is ultimately for the Scottish Government to decide how to allocate that money to farming in Scotland.
