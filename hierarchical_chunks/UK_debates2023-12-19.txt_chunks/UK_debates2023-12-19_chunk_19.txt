The Minister’s response really does not reflect the seriousness of the situation.
This is not just one bad apple; this is a rotten culture that goes to the very top, with £8.7 billion lost on wasted PPE and £7.2 billion lost to covid fraud.
That is £15.9 billion of public money gone at a time when people and public services are struggling.
Can the Minister remind the House who was Chancellor at the time that all of this was signed off?
I do not know what more I can add to my last answer.
This was done very quickly, at pace, because we were desperate to get PPE to the frontline as quickly as possible.
We have set up initiatives to recoup money from fraudulent activity including the Public Sector Fraud Authority, which has already saved taxpayers £311 million in the first year of operation.
If he will make mandatory the recommendations on reporting of the taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures.
This Government have been one of the largest donors to the global market-led taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures—TNFD—initiative.

The TNFD initiative was launched by the UK G7 presidency in 2021 and it featured in the green finance strategy that my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor and I did the ministerial foreword to earlier this year.
He will be aware of the recommendations that were launched in September.
I am conscious that there was a lot of support from the Treasury previously and that we should try to accelerate the International Sustainability Standards Board standards so that we can bring in this initiative just as successfully as we have done for the TCFD—the taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures.
