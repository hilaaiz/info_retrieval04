The Minister will be aware of the frustration that is felt by many farmers and crofters in Scotland that the £33 million that was given to the Scottish Government for a specific purpose as part of the Bew review has been deferred hitherto.
What will she do in future to ensure that where money is given for the express purpose of supporting Scottish agriculture, it is in fact used for that purpose?
The right hon.
Member raises an excellent question.
The SNP Government are yet to clarify when this ringfenced money will be returned.
I hope they will do so this afternoon at the Budget.
