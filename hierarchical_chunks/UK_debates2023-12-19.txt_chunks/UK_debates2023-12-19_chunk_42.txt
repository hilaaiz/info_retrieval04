I welcome the calls from the Foreign Secretary for a sustainable ceasefire, and I welcome my right hon.
Friend’s words from the Dispatch Box today.
Over the weekend, the Foreign Secretary received two letters, one from 10 Back Benchers on this side of the House and another from a group of foreign policy experts, calling for a permanent ceasefire.
The last truce resulted in over 80 hostages being released and hundreds of lives being saved.
Does my right hon.
Friend accept that a permanent ceasefire would reap similar results?
