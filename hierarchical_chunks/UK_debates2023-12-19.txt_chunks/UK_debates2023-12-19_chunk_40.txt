On the issue of the humanitarian catastrophe to which the shadow Foreign Secretary referred, I can tell him that there is some movement this week.
There are 50 World Food Programme trucks ready at Allenby bridge to travel through Israel to Kerem Shalom, and if signed off, that will provide a new route through to Gaza.
We have made available some money to the World Food Programme—it is available today—to enhance that route if it opens.
All of us abhor the loss of innocent civilian life in Israel and Gaza, but talk of a “sustainable ceasefire” is unhelpful.
All it does is give succour to Israel’s enemies at the time of its greatest need.
This is a country that fell to its knees just a few weeks ago and suffered the worst tragedy since the holocaust.
Now it is trying to eliminate Hamas and to free the hostages, some of whom are British citizens.
Let it finish the job, let it protect Israeli security, and in doing so, let Israel protect our security as well.
While it is true that weapons have been discovered in incubators in a hospital in Gaza, nevertheless I do not agree with my right hon.
Friend.
We are working towards a sustainable ceasefire.
We are not there yet, but we should all of us be working towards that.
In the meanwhile, on the pathway to a sustainable ceasefire, we need urgently to get these humanitarian pauses so that humanitarian relief can enter Gaza.
