I thank the hon.
Lady for her comments.
I understand how deeply distressing this is for her, with her family caught up in the Holy Family church complex.
As I said in my response, I am grateful to her for the harrowing update she was able to give me direct from the Holy Family church.
I am very pleased to hear that she thinks food has been delivered—we will follow up on that point directly after this urgent question.
