I thank the shadow Foreign Secretary for his comments.
We are, as he knows, very committed to trying to make sure that there is no escalation.
I thank him for his welcome for the US-led work to secure maritime security, and I also thank him for his comments, particularly at this time of year, about our armed forces.
I have already commented on the UN Security Council resolution, which I hope will be voted on this afternoon; like him, I hope that agreement can be reached.
