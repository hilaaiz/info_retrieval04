I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question.
She mentions the Treasury’s green finance strategy, which contains plans to bring forward the sustainability disclosure requirements, building on the global commitments.
We have already implemented the climate-related financial disclosures, and we are looking very carefully at the nature-related financial disclosures.
We hope to update the House in due course.
