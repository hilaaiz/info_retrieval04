I, too, send my very best wishes to the family of  the hon.
Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) .
As we know, later today the Government’s call for a sustainable ceasefire will be tested at the UN Security Council.
If the Government again decide to abdicate their responsibility to humanity and abstain, they will be giving Netanyahu the political cover he needs to prosecute a war in which tens of thousands have already been killed and in which, at the weekend, according to the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, “a sniper of the IDF murdered two women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza.”
If the UK is unable to support a ceasefire now, when will it?
What has to happen before this Government say enough is enough, and that the indiscriminate killing of innocents, the blanket bombing of civilian infrastructure and the killing of journalists has to stop now?
How many more breaches of international humanitarian law will it take for this Government to find the moral courage to say, “This has to stop, and it has to stop now”?
I do not think this is an issue of moral courage.
The Government, with the support of those on the Opposition Front Bench, are doing what we believe to be right.
We have been very clear that Israel has a right to defend itself, but it must do more to diminish and minimise the number of civilian casualties.
On the point the hon.
Member made about the United Nations resolution, which we hope will be passed this afternoon, as I have said, skilled British diplomats in New York are engaged in talking throughout the United Nations to try to make sure that that resolution lands in the way both he and I want.
