I thank my hon.
Friend the Chair of the Treasury Committee for raising this issue with me.
We want to ensure that people can be served accurately and effectively through the most efficient channels.
Two thirds of calls to the self-assessment line could be resolved online, through other channels—I highly recommend the app, for example.
Last year, HMRC received over 3 million calls on three issues—resetting a password, getting a tax code and getting a national insurance number—that could easily be resolved digitally.
People will still be able to call in, but we need to redeploy resources away from very simple questions towards those most in need, which will help those who are digitally unaware.
