I thank my hon.
Friend for her continued interest in this area on behalf of her constituents.
The Government want to ensure a diverse and sustainable visitor accommodation offer while protecting local communities, including ensuring the availability of affordable housing to rent or to buy.
That is why we are introducing a registration scheme for short-term lets in England, which will be a vital step towards achieving that aim.
The Government keep the tax treatment of property landlords under review, but I would be happy to meet her to discuss these issues further.
