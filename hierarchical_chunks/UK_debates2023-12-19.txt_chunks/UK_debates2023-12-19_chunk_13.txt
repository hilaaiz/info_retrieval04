The Minister will appreciate that the greatest investment that anyone can make is in themselves and their own country—Northern Ireland and all the United Kingdom.
What steps can be taken to ensure UK-wide investment by pensions schemes in cutting edge businesses such as Wrightbus and Thales?
There are a couple of things that we need to do.
We need to ensure that the industry abides by its commitment to the 5% target.
Working with the Exchequer Secretary, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Gareth Davies) , we must present the right investment opportunities so that the capital goes into the UK in the right way.
Whether his Department is taking fiscal steps to reduce differences in the levels of taxation between long and short-term lets.
The Government provide a different income tax regime for short-term lets compared with long-term lets if they qualify as furnished holiday lets, for which there are stringent conditions.
As with all aspects of the tax system, the Government keep the tax treatment of property landlords under review.
Any decisions on future changes will be taken by the Chancellor in the context of wider public finances.
The changes to landlord tax relief, which fully came in during the pandemic, exclude holiday lets.
That has contributed to a significant decline in residential landlords in tourist areas like North Devon.
The lack of affordable rental properties has priced out  workers, particularly in the hospitality sector, resulting in businesses reducing their opening hours and therefore their tax contribution to the Treasury.
Can my hon.
Friend provide any hope of levelling the tax playing field to encourage long-term landlords back to the market?
