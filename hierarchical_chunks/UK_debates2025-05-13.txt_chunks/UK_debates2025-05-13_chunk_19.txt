I thank the Minister for his response.
Members of the family of Alaa Abd el-Fattah are again in the Gallery today, and his mother Laila has now not taken food for seven months.
I met her again recently
and she is so frail now.
Does the Minister agree that Alaa’s arbitrary detention, long after his sentence ended, continues in violation of the Vienna convention, and that there must be consequences for Egypt, including international legal options and new travel advice,  given the evident dangers to British nationals detained in Egypt?
