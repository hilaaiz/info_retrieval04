Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
You have said much that was true and good, and it is hard to improve on what you said as well as the Chief Whip, but may I add a few words?
Roy Stone went into the civil  service at the age of 16 and served his entire life there and in this House.
Twelve Chief Whips across extraordinary moments were the beneficiaries of his sage counsel and advice.
I think the House will be aware that there were several occasions on which I was able to benefit from his advice in somewhat tumultuous times, having offended various senior politicians.
I did not always get a meeting with the Chief Whip with coffee—as hon.
Members know, that is the key test—but Sir Roy and his team were the models of professional expertise, diligence, discretion, care and candid advice throughout.
The fact that he has been taken from us so quickly, so prematurely and so early into his long-deserved retirement is, I am sure, a source of the utmost sadness for every Member of this House.
I am sure that I speak for all members of His Majesty’s Opposition.
We will remember him with great fondness for a very long time.
