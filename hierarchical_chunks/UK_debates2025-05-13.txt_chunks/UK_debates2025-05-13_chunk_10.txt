I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question and his commitment to these issues.
Were it only so that passing a right in this place would secure the release of the people whose cases have been raised.
In every case that has been mentioned by the right hon.
Gentleman and by  the hon.
Member for Edinburgh West (Christine Jardine) , the people concerned do receive consular assistance.
I have met the families of Ryan Cornelius and Alaa Abd el-Fattah; they both remain very much in our minds.
It is important that we get the rights correct.
These are complex cases, and we are bound not just by what we decide in Parliament, but by the relevant conventions and diplomatic norms.
We will take action to try to preserve the safety of British nationals overseas, but it is right that we take our time to ensure that we get it correct.
