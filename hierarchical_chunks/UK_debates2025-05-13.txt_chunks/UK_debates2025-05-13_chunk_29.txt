I welcome the release of Edan Alexander after an agonising 583 days in captivity, and I thank Qatar and Egypt for their support.
We urge all parties to seize this opportunity to re-engage with negotiations and return to a ceasefire.
That is what will see the return of those hostages.
When I discussed this with Secretary of State Rubio and, indeed, with partners in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, I urged them to raise those issues with the President this week.
