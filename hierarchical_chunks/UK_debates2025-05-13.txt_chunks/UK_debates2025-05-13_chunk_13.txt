The sustainable success of Ukraine and its self-defence hinges very much on the appetite of the President of the United States of America.
What steps are the Foreign Secretary, his Ministers and his officials taking to ensure that the President remains committed to defending the territorial integrity of not just his own nation but all nations, and will the Foreign Secretary ensure that the White House understands that allowing an aggressor to prosper in this case will encourage other aggressors to invade their neighbours in the future?
I am grateful for the experience and the strength with which the right hon.
Gentleman has spoken.
He will have noted that the Prime Minister was in Kyiv recently with President Zelensky and other European partners, and that they engaged with President Trump there.
We welcome the desire to secure an enduring peace, but it seems to me that engaging in those talks will require a ceasefire.
It is Putin who is prevaricating, it is Putin who is obfuscating, and we must call that out with our long experience of scrutinising that particular individual.
We all hope the mooted peace talks between Russia and Ukraine on ending Russia’s illegal invasion take place as quickly as possible, to stop the killing and save lives.
Accountability is important, so will the Foreign Secretary outline his position on Russian war crimes and on how justice can be done?
I was very pleased to be with other European Foreign Ministers in Lviv to support the special tribunal and be crystal clear that those who have prosecuted this war must attest and be accountable for their actions.
