Is a pattern emerging where the Trump Administration take initially extreme positions on international trade and foreign policy and then quickly re-adjust to more realistic and sensible policies?
What opportunities does that give for British diplomacy?
In many ways, that question is better put to President Trump and I do not want to speak for him.
None the less, I am pleased that the United Kingdom was the first country to strike a trade agreement with the United States.
Many international partners are now ringing us up to ask us how we did it.
