The UK is a world leader in protecting marine environments, particularly around the British Overseas Territories, but tragically that reputation will be trashed when Labour surrenders to Mauritius one of the most important marine protected areas around the British Indian Ocean Territory.
While Mauritian fisheries Ministers have been pledging to issue fishing and trawler licences for those waters, Labour Ministers have given no assurances about future protections, and have just made vague comments on working with Mauritius on a new MPA.
Can the Minister state if the proposed treaty will have any guaranteed protections in place?
Will she confirm what was said in a legal letter to British Chagossians—that their right of return is not guaranteed?
Surely that would be a total betrayal.
