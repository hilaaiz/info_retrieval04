I thank my hon.
Friend for continually raising this matter.
We are an active member of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children, and we fund the Bring Kids Back UA and Save Ukraine campaigns.
We have raised this issue internationally, and I am proud to have worked on it with Mrs Zelensky.
I will write to the hon.
Lady as soon as I can to update her on the funding.
