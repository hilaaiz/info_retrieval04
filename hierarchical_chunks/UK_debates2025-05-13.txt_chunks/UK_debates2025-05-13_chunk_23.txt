I welcome that the UK Government are to convene  an urgent session of the UN Security Council this   afternoon to discuss the food situation in Gaza.
Will Ministers ensure that Dame Barbara Woodward takes a message from my constituents, including Mairi MacKinnon, Ian Stephen, Louise Scullion and Malcolm MacLean, who expressed their disgust and condemnation of the Israeli Government using food as a weapon of war?
There are 71,000 children in Gaza.
Will he ensure that that message is heard in New York?
