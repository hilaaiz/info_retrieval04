On Sunday, I had the honour of meeting Emily Damari.
She told me about her good friends, Ziv and Gali Berman, who remain in captivity.
It is so clear to me that no hostage will be free until all hostages are free.
Hamas footage at the weekend serves only to deliver more torment to the  families.
Will the Minister set out, before the 600 day-anniversary later this month of the  7 October  attacks, the steps he will be taking to ensure humanitarian access for those hostages?
