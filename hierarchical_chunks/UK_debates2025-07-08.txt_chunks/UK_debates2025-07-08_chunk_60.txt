That is a good question.
It is really important that we learn from the experience of the pandemic a few years ago, but we must not fall into the trap, as I said, of assuming that the next emergency will be exactly the same.
We have to be flexible in our response.
The next emergency, and indeed the next pandemic, may be quite different in character from the one that we went through a few years ago.
Will the preparations take into account the lasting, disastrous consequences of lockdown, and the blithering absurdity of face coverings?
The preparations should take everything into account.
