I thank the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for his statement.
I was pleased to hear him reference the £370 million that the Government are investing to secure our telecommunications network.
Will that extend to our undersea network of cables, which face perpetual threats from the Russian shadow fleet and others who are under a thin veil of plausible deniability?
If those networks are disrupted, it will create chaos in the UK.
