I welcome the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster’s commitment that resilience must be for all, not just for some.
The people of Shetland will hold him to those words.
A few years ago, we suffered a catastrophic power outage for about seven days in winter storms, leaving many of my constituents relying on copper wire phone lines for their connection to the outside world.
If that copper wire is withdrawn without sufficient resilience being built into its replacement, the consequences for my constituents could be catastrophic.
Will he, through his office, engage with private sector organisations when they are making these strategic decisions for us all?
