I know that my hon.
Friend cares deeply about this issue.
She will be aware of the work that the Women’s Justice Board is doing with the   Department, some of the reviews by David Gauke including, specifically, the sentencing review, and Baroness Casey’s recent rapid review of grooming gangs; all that work is connected with defences for victims.
We are actively considering this matter, and I will happily work with my hon.
Friend and the Centre for Women’s Justice to develop further policies.
