That is a good and important question.
As I said, resilience has to be for all, not just for some.
This is taken very seriously at the National Situation Centre.
As data gets better—as, for example, energy companies get a better map of their vulnerable customers—we are getting to a better place when it comes to knowing exactly where the Government should direct their effort when an emergency hits.
It is a really important part of community solidarity that people of all income groups know that the Government are there for them when an emergency hits.
Will the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster confirm that climate-related emergencies are a core part of this resilience strategy?
Climate breakdown has the potential to threaten our core infrastructure and poses risks to our core support systems, such as food and water, and the Climate Change Committee says that we are woefully ill-prepared for climate-related changes, so does he agree that the issue should be not a political football?
Instead, it should be central to the Government’s resilience plans for protecting our citizens.
