I thank the hon.
Member for his engagement on this issue.
He has written to me and we have had quite productive conversations about it.
I recently met the chief coroner to discuss the specific issue on the Isle of Wight, because we know that the delays are causing untold turmoil to families in an already awful, traumatic process.
I will happily meet the hon.
Member to discuss a way forward, but I am reassured by the action being taken by the chief coroner to address the issue in the Isle of Wight directly.
