I thank the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for that question, but I would challenge him on two points.
I do not think we are undermining justice in this country, when he himself recognises that justice delayed is justice denied.
We are trying to properly think through, “What is a good system for us to proceed with in this country?”
As he knows, 90% of all criminal cases already go to the magistrates court.
That is why we will pursue the reforms that we have set out.
