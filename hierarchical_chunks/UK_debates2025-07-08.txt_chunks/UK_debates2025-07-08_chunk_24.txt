I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Under the last Government, between 2019 and 2023, drone sightings around prisons increased by over 770%.
As I have said, we are investing £40 million in bolstering security measures in our prisons, and we are currently trialling new anti-drone netting on the long-term, high-security estate to tackle drone incursions.
