I thank the Minister for the statement.
I welcome the announcement that the Government will undertake a full national test of the emergency alert system in September.
How will they ensure that rural areas such as Church Eaton in my  constituency, which is still waiting for its phone mast to be activated, and Maer, which has had long-term difficulties with mobile reception, can receive the message?
My understanding is that the alert is dependent on 4G access.
