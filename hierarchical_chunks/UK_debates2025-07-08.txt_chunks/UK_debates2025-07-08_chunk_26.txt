I welcome the Minister’s answer.
Knife crime ruins lives and devastates communities; rightly, those responsible must be held accountable.
If we are serious about preventing reoffending, however, we also need structured, credible rehabilitation, the focus of which must be on prevention and diversionary activities.
As chair of the all-party parliamentary group on boxing, I have seen how grassroots boxing clubs offer something different—structure, community and hope—that is of particular benefit to young people.
I ask the Minister to meet me to discuss how boxing can be a key part of successfully rehabilitating offenders.
