My experience in the year since the general election is that on matters such as this, co-operation and joint working between the UK Government and the devolved Governments is good.
I am pleased to say that this is an area where party politics is usually left outside the door, and I think that is right.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right: when an emergency hits, we need good co-operation and dialogue with either the devolved Governments or local authorities and local resilience forums, which I referred to in my statement.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster referenced the considerable spending on flood defences over the next few years.
He will be aware that the port of Immingham and much of the south bank of the Humber was severely affected by a tidal surge in 2013.
Although much work has been done in recent years, can he give an assurance to businesses and residents that the south bank of the Humber will remain a priority for increased flood defence expenditure?
We have set aside some £4 billion for investment in flood defences.
The details of when and where that will be spent will be set out by my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
