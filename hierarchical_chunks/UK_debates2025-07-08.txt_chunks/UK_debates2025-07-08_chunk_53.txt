I thank the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for advance sight of the statement.
The world is now less stable and more insecure than at any time since the cold war.
Consequently, the Government must ensure that the British people and the United Kingdom are prepared in the event that our country or an overseas territory is threatened.
The Liberal Democrats therefore welcome any measures to strengthen our resilience, especially to the cyber-security threat—a new and evolving threat against which we must be armed.
