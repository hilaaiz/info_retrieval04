A constituent of mine who recently fled France because of domestic violence and abuse, after being a habitual resident for just 21 days, has been ordered to return to France next week under protective measures.
What more can the Government do to protect women fleeing domestic violence in relation to the Hague convention and the Child Abduction Act 1984?
The hon.
Member will know that I cannot comment on specific cases, but if he wants to write to me, I will happily look at that.
I recently had productive conversations about the Hague convention and others, and we will happily develop those conversations further.
May I associate myself with your remarks, Mr Speaker, at the outset of these proceedings about the passing of Lord Tebbit?
Lord Tebbit was a great friend of Northern Ireland, particularly of the many fellow victims of IRA terrorism.
May I return the Lord Chancellor to the subject of the backlogs in our Crown courts?
In Northern Ireland, we have the worst of all records; it takes an average of 551 days to conclude a Crown court case.
Murder trials have been stalled since last September with no new start date.
We have a Minister of Justice locally who talks the talk but never walks the walk, and particularly does not walk the walk in settling the ongoing remuneration issue that is holding things up.
Would the Lord Chancellor bring some pressure to bear on the local Justice Minister to sort this matter out?
The hon.
and learned Member will know that for devolved matters it would of course be deeply inappropriate for me to try to influence or put pressure on the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland.
On a cross-UK basis, we regularly meet our fellow Justice Ministers in the devolved Administrations, and I will happily pick up those conversations in a constructive way.
