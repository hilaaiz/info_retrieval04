I thank the hon.
Member for raising this case, which will have hit all of us incredibly hard.
It is horrific and just goes to show that violence against women and girls is at epidemic levels in every corner of the United Kingdom, not just in England and Wales.
I am due to meet my counterparts across the devolved nations shortly to figure out exactly how we can best join up to tackle this issue as a whole, because it will take a societal response.
If the hon.
Member wants to meet me to discuss this further, I would be happy to do so.
