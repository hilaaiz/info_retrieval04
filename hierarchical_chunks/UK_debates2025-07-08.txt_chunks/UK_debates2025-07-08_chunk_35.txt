My hon.
Friend is right to emphasise the importance of rehabilitation in the panoply of things that we do in the criminal justice system.
She is also right to highlight the number of prisoners and people in the criminal justice system who have dyslexia, which is one of the many neurodiverse conditions in the prison service.
Every prison has a neurodiversity officer who co-ordinates activity to address that in each prison, but if she wants to write to me about the issue, I would be happy to respond in more detail.
