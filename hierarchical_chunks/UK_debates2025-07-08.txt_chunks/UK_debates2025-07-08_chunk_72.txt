I have called for a responsibility revolution in which all businesses, organisations and individuals play their part in the national interest.
I have seen that in my constituency on a visit to the National Gas station, which is a part of the critical infrastructure, and when talking to the Wolston and Brandon flood action group.
Will my right hon.
Friend set out what steps the Government are taking to provide better information to the public so that they can play their part in making our country more resilient?
I very much agree with my hon.
Friend.
This issue involves the public understanding the risks, and I think we should make this conversation normal.
That is why it is right that we do the second emergency test of the system.
We have used it a few times in live scenarios, in two storms that posed a real risk to life during last winter and in one or two more localised situations.
The public are becoming more aware, but we will continue to make more information available so that people have a greater awareness of these situations and what they might be able to do to increase their own resilience.
