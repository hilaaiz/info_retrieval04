I thank the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for advance sight of his statement and the associated documentation.
I also thank him for the date on which the UK emergency alert will be tested—he can only have chosen it to notify the country that it is my birthday.
I shall very much look forward to the alarm at 3 pm.
