“consolidated, data-driven picture of our resilience baseline” to show how resilient the UK is at any moment, and a new cyber-resilience index that highlights the critical national infrastructure at greatest risk.
Will my right hon.
Friend give the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy, which I chair, access to those indices, and may I suggest that we help him in developing them?
I am grateful to the Chair of the Joint Committee on National Security Strategy for his questions.
The National Cyber Security Centre has been working closely with Marks & Spencer and the other victims of recent cyber-attacks.
I look forward to appearing before his Committee in a few days and working closely with it in the future.
