Let me say yet again that, as the shadow Minister will know, we voted against that amendment because victim impact statements are currently classed as evidence in a court of law, and they have to be quite specific.
We are aware of the concerns of victims; what we need to do is put forward workable, realistic possibilities for how we can best represent their voice in the courtroom.
We are getting on with action, whereas the Conservatives dithered and delayed for 14 years.
We are making sure that victims are represented in our criminal justice system.
