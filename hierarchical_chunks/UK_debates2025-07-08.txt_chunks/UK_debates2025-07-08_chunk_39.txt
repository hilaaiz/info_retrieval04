I welcome my hon.
Friend’s question
and I am grateful to him for raising the pathfinder court.
These pilots are proving incredibly successful.
They front-load a lot of the evidence gathering, they put the safety of children and family arrangements right at their heart, and they are proving a really successful   model, which is why we plan to roll them out further.
As part of that, as he has heard, we will be publishing our response to the presumption review very shortly.
