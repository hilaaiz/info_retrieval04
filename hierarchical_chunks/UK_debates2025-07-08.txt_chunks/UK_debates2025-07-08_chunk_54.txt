While the Liberal Democrats welcome the alert test, we call for a wider public information campaign to support resilience building across the UK, and to ensure that the public are properly ready for any potential future conflict or disaster.
Perhaps we could take lessons from our Scandinavian neighbours, who are always working to address future threats and providing information to their citizens.
Information should be provided through a number of different means, including leaflets and traditional broadcast.
While we welcome the alert test, websites and text alerts will miss millions of British people—those without phones, or without signal or battery—so we need to be ready on all fronts, and not just rely on single text alerts.
Will the Government accept the Liberal Democrats’ call to launch a national awareness campaign that draws on different modes of contact?
