I welcome the Government’s efforts to reform sentencing following the sentencing review.
I am confident that those steps will end the chaos left behind by the previous Government.
I am particularly interested in rehabilitation as a priority in sentencing.
A troubling statistic remains: studies have shown that 30% of prisoners in the UK are diagnosed as dyslexic, and there are probably many more who are undiagnosed, meaning that the numbers are much higher.
Will the Minister tell me what steps are being taken to support dyslexic people in prison and to prevent reoffending following release?
