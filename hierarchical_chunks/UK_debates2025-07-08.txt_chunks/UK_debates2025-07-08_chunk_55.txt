I welcome the talk about being more resilient to climate emergencies.
We have all seen the horrifying pictures and upsetting stories from the floods in Texas  in recent days, and in this country, we have had one of the hottest starts to a summer in UK history; it is vital that the Government are not caught unawares as the temperature rises.
Last week, I had a meeting in my constituency with Thames Water, which told me that it is preparing drought mitigation measures.
The regular supply of water to people’s properties, businesses and agricultural land is vital to livelihoods and everyday lives.
What steps are the Government taking, and perhaps putting in their new action plan, to ensure that any drought mitigation measures will not significantly impact the country in the coming months?
