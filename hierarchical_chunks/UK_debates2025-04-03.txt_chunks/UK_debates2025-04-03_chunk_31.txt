I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question on this important issue.
I continue to engage with the Foreign Secretary’s team and office on this issue, and I will write to the Government yet again, to ensure that they are defending and protecting the rights of all Palestinians.
I think we can all agree that we need to see an end to the violence and the killing of innocent people.
