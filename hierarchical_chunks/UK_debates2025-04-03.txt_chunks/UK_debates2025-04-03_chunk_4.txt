With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the United Kingdom’s economic relationship with the United States.
The UK has a strong and balanced trading relationship with the US worth £315 billion, which supports 2.5 million jobs across both our countries.
This is second only to the EU, where our trading relationship is worth £791 billion.
Yesterday evening the United States announced a 10% reciprocal tariff on UK exports, and it has today imposed a 25% global tariff on cars.
That follows the application of tariffs of 25% on US imports of steel, aluminium and derivative products announced on  12 March .
