I thank my hon.
Friend for his important and timely question.
The ongoing de facto annexation of parts of the west bank and threats to annex parts of Gaza are incredibly disturbing.
In February, the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem issued a joint statement against the threat of mass displacement, and I agree with them that there can be no justification for uprooting people who are already suffering beyond all measure.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to outline that international law must be upheld at all times, and there are significant concerns about what is taking place in Israel at the moment.
