At this time, the most important issue is to ensure that the legislation reflects the full range of concerns and experiences, and meets the expectations of the families.
The very worst thing we could do is not meet those expectations, given that all the trust issues relate to the state failing to live up to the families’ expectations.
We are working on the Bill at pace, but we will take whatever time is necessary to work collaboratively with the families and their representatives, because getting the legislation right is overwhelmingly our priority, as I am sure the hon.
Lady can understand.
Last month, Whitburn Band, from a former mining town in my constituency, won the Scottish brass band championships for the third time in four years.
The band will represent Scotland at the national brass band championships in London, and at the European brass band championships next year.
Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Whitburn Band on its remarkable achievement, and wishing its members the very best of luck as they represent Scotland?
Will she make time for a debate on the important contribution of brass bands to our musical heritage in communities across the UK?
I join my hon.
Friend in congratulating the Whitburn brass band, the Scottish brass band champions, and wish them all the very best in the UK-wide national brass band championships.
If I may say so, she is doing a fantastic job of blowing the trumpet on behalf of her constituents.
[Laughter.]
It is Easter.
I wish the band all the best in the championships.
