I thank the Second Church Estates Commissioner for her answers on this topic, but could she outline what support she can offer churches across Guildford that are facing significant shortfalls due to the £25,000 cap?
One such church had been expecting to recover VAT of about £750,000 on its £4 million project, but it now faces a major funding shortfall.
Although churches can claim for work that  has already been invoiced, that does not address the major concern for those that have not yet completed their work.
