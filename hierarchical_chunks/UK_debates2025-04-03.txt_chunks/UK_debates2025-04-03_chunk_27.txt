I thank my hon.
Friend for that kind invitation.
The Minister with responsibility for young people, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Barnsley South (Stephanie Peacock) , would be delighted to go, if she can make that work with her existing commitments.
I share my hon.
Friend’s view that we, as a Government, are not just interested in young people having a voice; we also want them to have real power to be in the driving seat of their own lives.
That is why we have invited young people to co-produce the national youth strategy with us, and I am delighted that we have already made good on our promise of the biggest conversation with this generation that has ever taken place.
