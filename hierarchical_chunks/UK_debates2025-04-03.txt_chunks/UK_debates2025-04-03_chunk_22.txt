As the Select Committee looks into school and community sports, it has learned that the previous Government’s opening school facilities fund helped deliver sport to 300,000 people outside of school hours, seeing more girls, more disadvantaged pupils and more of those with special educational needs taking part.
That fund ended on Monday, and I have already heard from two schools in my constituency that they will be scaling  back their community provision.
The Government talk a lot about the importance of communities and supporting young people, but this flies in the face of that, does it not?
