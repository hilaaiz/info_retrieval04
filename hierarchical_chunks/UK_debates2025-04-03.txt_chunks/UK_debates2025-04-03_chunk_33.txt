I thank my hon.
Friend, who has raised this issue on many occasions.
Yes, I will seek to arrange a roundtable meeting with the churches impacted.
I hope we can also ensure that a Minister is present at that meeting, to hear at first hand about the impact of the cap and the potential future of the scheme.
