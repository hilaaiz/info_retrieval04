I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue; it was also raised last week by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Widnes and Halewood (Derek Twigg) .
She is right.
As we approach the anniversary of the Hillsborough tragedy, we should remember the 97 lives lost, all the families affected and the years and years of fighting for justice and accountability that the families have suffered since—frankly, with the state fighting against them, in most cases.
That is something we should all endeavour to put right.
As she says, the Prime Minister and the whole Government, myself included, remain focused on fulfilling our commitment to the Hillsborough families to bring forward and enact a Hillsborough law, which will of course include a duty of candour at all times.
That is a very important measure to take forward.
