On  15 April , we will mark the 36th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster and remember the 97 people who tragically lost  their life on that dark day, as well as their families’ subsequent fight for justice.
Last September, the Prime Minister gave a commitment that the Hillsborough law would be introduced in Parliament before we reached this anniversary.
A duty of candour for public servants and public bodies is long overdue, and will help stop future cover-ups.
It is vital that the legislation delivers on the commitments made to Hillsborough families in a meaningful way.
Can the Leader of the House give an update on whether the legislation will be introduced before we rise for the Easter recess?
If it will not, when we can realistically expect it?
