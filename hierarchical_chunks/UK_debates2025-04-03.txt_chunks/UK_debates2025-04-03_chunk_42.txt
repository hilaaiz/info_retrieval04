I thank my hon.
Friend for that answer.
I really welcome the work that has been done by Northern Lithium in Weardale in my constituency.
Critical minerals will play an increasingly important role in the UK’s transition to net zero and in our economy.
With the Church of England owning vast swathes of mineral rights across the country, it is really important that there is transparency and that the Church plays an active role in ensuring local populations benefit from the wealth beneath their feet, as part of a just transition.
Will she meet me to discuss that?
