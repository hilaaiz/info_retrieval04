I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this very serious issue.
He will know that since the Leveson inquiry concluded, there have been dramatic changes in the media landscape, meaning that we need to take a much wider view of how to protect a free, fair and self- regulated press and to protect the public.
Nevertheless, we recognise that there are long-standing issues with the protection of members of the public such as my hon.
Friend’s constituent, who the Minister for Creative Industries, Arts and Tourism knows well.
I recently met families from the campaign group Hacked Off and listened to their stories.
It was a harrowing meeting, and we are committed to working with them to resolve these issues.
