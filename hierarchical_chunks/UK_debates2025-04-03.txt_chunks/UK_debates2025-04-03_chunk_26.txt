I should properly declare an interest as a former member of the British Actors’ Equity Association.
Mr Speaker, if I enter your house and steal the draft manuscript of your memoirs, I am guilty of a crime.
Artists, writers, musicians and other creatives are all having their work stolen as we speak, and you and I have received letters about this issue.
We do not have the time to wait; what are the Government going to do to protect creatives and their work?
Copyright law stands firmly behind the creative industries today, and will in the future.
We will do absolutely nothing to undermine the fact that this country is one of the few great countries in the world that is able to boast of itself as a content superpower, and anything we do in relation to artificial intelligence and copyright will proceed only if we can make sure that the creative industries have more control and more remuneration at the end of that process, rather than less.
I very  much welcome the national youth survey, which was launched last month and was mentioned by the Secretary  of State.
It is great to see a Government who are not only listening to young people, but are determined to put young voices at the heart of policymaking.
In Dartford, we have a rapidly growing youth population, with the number of under-15s having grown by 30% at the last census.
Does the Secretary of State agree that it is vital that policies that affect young people are produced with the people who are affected by them, and will she consider attending my youth engagement event in Dartford later this month?
