Music fans were left outraged last summer by rip-off prices for Oasis tickets.
Many paid hundreds of pounds over resale value to access the concerts they wanted to get to as dedicated fans.
Liberal Democrats are calling for an outright ban on resales above face value.
At the moment, it seems the Government are “Half the World Away” from a solution.
When the Ministers answer, “Whatever” they say, please promise me that the answer to whether we will have a ban above resale value is not “Definitely Maybe”?
As the hon.
Member knows perfectly well, a consultation is ongoing and will close on  4 April .
It was a manifesto commitment of ours to ensure that the secondary ticketing market works for everybody.
If someone is not able to turn up to a gig for whatever reason—family reasons, a funeral or whatever—they should be able to sell the ticket on.
We have asked specifically whether people should only be able to sell it at face value or face value plus 10%, 20% or 30%.
I note his response to the consultation.
I hope he has responded to all the other issues in the consultation as well.
What discussions she has had with the Glasgow 2026 Organising Company on the 2026 Commonwealth games.
My Department is in regular contact with the organising company, and I was pleased to meet recently with both the CEO and the chair to discuss progress on delivery, at a meeting in my Department and when I was delighted to attend the King’s baton relay launch at Buckingham Palace with His Majesty the King to mark 500 days until the games.
The UK has been proud to host the Commonwealth games twice since 2014, and I am delighted that the UK Government have been able to get behind and support Glasgow 2026.
