My constituent Paul Dadge was iconically photographed rescuing a badly burned survivor of the 7/7 bombings.
What thanks did Paul get?
His phone was hacked by a newspaper looking for stories.
Twelve years on from the Leveson inquiry, most national papers are still in the Independent Press Standards Organisation, a complaints handler that they control and that has never investigated or fined a single newspaper in its history.
Will the Secretary of State consult on introducing a truly independent press regulator for all national papers, so that we can make sure there are no more victims of phone hacking and press intrusion?
