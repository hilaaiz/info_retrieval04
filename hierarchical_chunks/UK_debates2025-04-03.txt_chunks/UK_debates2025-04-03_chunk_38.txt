I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
The restoration and renewal programme is one of the UK’s biggest restoration projects.
For example,  it must deliver for small and medium-sized enterprises by creating apprenticeships, and skills and training opportunities all over the country.
The original Act—the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act 2019—stresses the need for the benefits of the works to be available across the UK.
Over half of the delivery authority’s spend on supplies to date—for example, on surveys—has been to companies outside London and the south-east.
The restoration and renewal client board is very clear that this programme must benefit the whole of the UK.
