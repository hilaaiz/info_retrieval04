I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that issue, and I will certainly look into the specific fund she has mentioned.
The Education Secretary and I are committed to putting sport back at the heart of the curriculum and our classrooms.
We will be in a position to announce more about that shortly, but we share the hon.
Lady’s vision of schools that are the hubs of their communities and are open longer hours to enable them to provide those opportunities for young people.
