I thank my hon.
Friend, not just for her service to her constituents but her previous service in the NHS.
As she has noted, thanks to Labour, NHS waiting lists in England have fallen month on month, because this Government have a plan and we have invested.
Sadly, it is a completely different story in Scotland, as she has pointed out.
Like mine, her constituents see a situation in which almost one in six people are now stuck on a waiting list.
John Swinney has announced this SNP Government’s fifth NHS recovery plan in less than four years, but patients and staff know that it is not good enough, and we need a new direction.
