The Secretary of State will know that the biggest financial impacts on higher education in Scotland have been Westminster policies, which is why the sector in the UK faces some challenges.
We have the national insurance increase, Brexit, which I know he passionately opposed—or used to, anyway—and the hostile environment.
Labour found common ground with Michael Gove on sticking him into the House of Lords, but it also found common ground with him on his commitment to decentralising migration.
That has had a particular impact on the higher education sector, not least in Dundee, which has had the biggest financial hit.
Will the Secretary of State let us know what progress he has made on that commitment by Scottish Labour?
May I give the hon.
Gentleman and all his SNP colleagues our deepest condolences on the loss of Christina McKelvie?
I think this is the first time that we have had Scottish questions since then.
I say again that the hon.
Gentleman and his SNP colleagues voted against the Budget, which delivered an extra £4.9 billion for public services in Scotland.
Some of that should have gone to frontline services, including to ensuring that our higher education sector was funded  properly in the Scottish context.
The SNP is very good at blaming everybody else for powers that do not belong to it, but what it should actually do is get a mirror.
In the last seven days, the only increase it has made in using the budget given to it is £20,000 on the salaries of Scottish Government Ministers, who have all singularly failed.
