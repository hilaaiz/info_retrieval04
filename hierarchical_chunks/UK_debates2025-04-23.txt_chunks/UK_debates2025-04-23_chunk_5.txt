The university sector in Scotland has never been in a worse state.
It is in a state of crisis, with job losses, both compulsory and voluntary, being contemplated across the whole sector in Scotland.
It is young Scots who are paying the price.
To balance the books, the Scottish Government are limiting the number of young Scots who can go to university, forcing universities to rely more and more on the recruitment of students from overseas.
To be clear, that means that Scots are often sitting at home unable to access a place because students from overseas with lower qualifications are getting those places.
Does the Secretary of State agree that Scotland’s young people must be supported and the university sector must be fully funded in Scotland?
