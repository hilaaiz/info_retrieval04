I thank the Minister for her reply and very kind remarks.
As in Wales and England, not a single NHS board in Scotland is meeting the 62-day cancer waiting time standard.
That is a legacy of under-investment from the SNP in Scotland, from Labour in Wales, and from the Conservatives in England.
To develop change and save lives, we need proper funding for cancer services.
How will the Secretary of State for Scotland ensure that his colleagues at the Department of Health and Social Care understand the importance of fully funding cancer strategies to avoid disasters like that devised by the SNP?
