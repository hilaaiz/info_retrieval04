The Prime Minister has often referred to his time working in Northern Ireland, and I have spoken to one of his bosses, who speaks of his diligence.
In that vein, could he speak to his Northern Ireland team about their understanding of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement?
In an interview, the Secretary of State seemed to think that it had been negotiated by Ian Paisley, rather than David Trimble and my party.
His Northern Ireland Minister said at the start of this week that the future of Northern Ireland as part of the Union is dependent on opinion polls and she was not sure whether she was a Unionist.
Will the Prime Minister confirm to me his understanding of the principle of consent and confirm to this House that he is a Unionist?
