I associate myself with the Secretary of State’s comments about the death of Pope Francis.
In a rare consensus, I agree with much of what has been said by both the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State.
Many universities are extremely concerned about the funding situation.
Many of my constituents who are employees of universities or who have children at Scottish universities are concerned, particularly following the news of the 600 job cuts at the University of Dundee.
I have spoken to the principal of the University of Edinburgh and he is also concerned about the funding model in Scotland, which is failing everyone.
Will the Secretary of State discuss with the Scottish Government how they can make changes and put pressure on them to do so?
The national insurance changes are not helpful, so it would help Scottish education if we had some changes there as well.
The hon.
Lady’s question is slightly contradictory.
On the one hand, she does not like the national insurance contribution increase, which has given the Scottish Government a £4.9 billion boost—the highest settlement in the history of devolution.
That money should be going to the frontline of higher education, but it is not.
On the other hand, she talks about a more generous funding settlement for universities.
She cannot have it both ways.
The funding model must change, and the Scotland Office is in touch with all our universities’ principals to see how we can work through this issue.
This is a problem with the funding of higher education as a result of SNP policies and the Scottish Government.
I associate myself with the comments about the devastating loss of Pope Francis and the compassion that he showed to the most vulnerable in our society.
On a happier note, I wish all friends and family a very happy St George’s day.
I also note my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests in relation to higher education.
