I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for what he does to support higher education in Scotland.
Thanks to the SNP’s higher education financial crisis, as my hon.
Friend says, too many Scottish students are missing out on places.
Labour has committed to ensuring that Scottish students from all backgrounds can access university, and that can only be achieved with a new funding settlement that both protects our world-leading universities and gives any Scottish student who wants to pursue university the opportunity to do so.
I am proud to have made it from Wester Hailes education centre, in the Wester Hailes scheme, to the University of Edinburgh, but that story is becoming all too rare under the SNP Government.
It is time for a new direction for Scottish universities.
