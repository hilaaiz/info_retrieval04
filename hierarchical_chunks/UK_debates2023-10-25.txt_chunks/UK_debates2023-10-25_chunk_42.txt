I knew that when you referred to us all as distinguished and experienced Members you did not mean me, Madam Deputy Speaker.
This is the third time we have been back here, and I think it incumbent on the Government to listen to the Lords.
They have made it clear that they feel strongly about their very reasonable amendments, which shows how important they are and how we should be getting this right.
There is no question that, as the Minister suggested, we are going to let the Bill fall today.
I think that if he were worried about that he would accept the Lords amendments this afternoon, rather than allowing the process to go on and on.
We did not need to be here at the last minute; he could have accepted many of the amendments at a much earlier stage, because fundamentally he agrees with them.
We know that, because he said it on many occasions before he took ministerial office.
I think that a great deal can be done if the Minister will make that compromise this afternoon.
The notion that 99.5% of businesses can be exempted from the “failure to prevent” offence is absolutely mad.
Small businesses are both part of and victims of economic crime.
Some figures from UK Finance arrived in our inboxes earlier today.
According to its findings, criminals stole £580 million through unauthorised and authorised fraud in just the first half of 2023.
UK Finance says that that is a 2% decrease, but it is still a significant amount of money.
Businesses as well as individuals are losing out, and the Government should be paying more attention to that.
