I thank the hon.
Lady for her point.
In 2021-22, there were 200,000 fewer female pensioners in absolute poverty than in 2009-10, after housing costs.
I point the hon.
Lady to the Barnett consequentials of the household support fund in Scotland, which is there to be distributed by her Government to those in need.
