With almost a quarter of the UK’s population registered as disabled, does the Minister agree that all political parties need to try harder in the run-up to the next general election in selecting a diverse group of candidates, with perhaps slightly less emphasis on nepotism and more on the representation of ordinary voters, including those from all ethnic minority backgrounds?
The hon.
Lady asks an excellent question, and I thank her for all the work she does campaigning for women’s rights.
She has been at the vanguard of some contentious issues.
She is quite right to raise candidate selection.
All political parties have to make the very best of efforts in ensuring that a meritocracy exists and helping those including disabled people who might need additional assistance in participating through some of the difficult selection processes.
I highlight again how diverse the Conservative party is, and the Cabinet in particular.
That is testament to the fact that meritocracy works.
We hope that others will learn from our example.
