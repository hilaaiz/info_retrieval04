Last week I met a group of life science apprentices, young women and young men, who have taken up some great opportunities with STEM employers.
One issue they raised with me was the lack of information about non-trade apprenticeships when they were considering their career options.
What more can my hon.
Friend do to promote STEM apprenticeships for the 16 to 18-year-olds who may not want to pursue the university route?
My hon.
Friend is a shining example of how women can lead in the STEM sector, with her own experience in clinical care before she came to this place.
We are trying to drive forward apprenticeships, particularly in STEM subjects.
Since May 2010, over 5 million apprenticeship starts have happened and our apprenticeship diversity champions are helping those aged 16 and over to get into apprenticeships, particularly in STEM subjects.
Organisations such as UCAS and Young Women’s Trust are also doing that specific work.
The Scottish Government have a number of ambitions to address the lack of women in STEM occupations  and settings such as schools.
Those ambitions start early.
The gender pay gap action plan examines how schools have a key role in helping young women make transitions into broader occupations, as well as setting out measures that address occupation segregation, leading to more women accessing STEM careers.
What are the Government doing to provide that kind of support?
One key route is through apprenticeships.
For many young women, being able to earn while you learn and getting that work experience is vital for them to progress through the STEM sector.
We have 22,000 degree apprenticeships and seven masters degree apprenticeships.
That is an increase of 14%.
In STEM subjects in particular, we have 360 employer design apprenticeships, including level 3 cyber-security, level 4 software development and level 6 civil engineering.
We believe apprenticeships are the way forward to drive more women into STEM areas.
