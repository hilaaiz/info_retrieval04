I thank the Minister for that answer.
In Northern Ireland, women are under-represented in STEM industries.
Only 15% of women in Northern Ireland study core STEM subjects, compared to 36% of men.
That is a clear anomaly that needs to be addressed.
May I encourage the Minister to use her office to engage with the Department for the Economy to encourage more uptake in university STEM subjects?
Women can do the job every bit as well as a man given that opportunity.
