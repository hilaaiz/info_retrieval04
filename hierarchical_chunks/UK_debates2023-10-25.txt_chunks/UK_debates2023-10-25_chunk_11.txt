The Minister is absolutely right: great things have been done for LGBT+ people in the last 13 years, including blood donation changes, the PrEP—pre-exposure prophylaxis—roll-out, and of course same-sex marriage.
However, hate crime against LGBT+ people is on the up, conversion therapy still has not been banned and the UK has slipped down the ranking for LGBT+ equality.
I know that this Minister takes these issues incredibly seriously, but how can he assure me that the Government take them seriously and that they will tackle them as a matter of urgency?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight the issue of all forms of anti-LGBT hate crimes.
They are utterly unacceptable, and we have a robust legislative framework to respond to that.
I met representatives of  the Metropolitan police and other stakeholders just last week to ensure that everything possible was being done to crack down on such crimes.
There will be further questions later about conversion practices, and we are considering all those issues.
This is a complex area of work, but I give my hon.
Friend a personal commitment that anything to do with LGBT rights and improving the lives of LGBT people will be high on my agenda.
A Bill banning the psychological abuse that some people call conversion therapy has been promised repeatedly in this Session from that Dispatch Box.
Where is it?
I accept that, and I apologise for the fact that it has taken so long, but, as I have said, it is a complex issue.
I have been personally campaigning for this for many years, but even I recognise there are deep complexities.
It is right that we take the time to consider each of the issues carefully, so that what we have in place is consistent, robust and up to date, and tackles these appalling practices.
