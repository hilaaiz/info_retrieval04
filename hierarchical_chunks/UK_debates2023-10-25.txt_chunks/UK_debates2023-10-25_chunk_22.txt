I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that matter.
The point regarding the EHRC is that it is an independent and public body, but I do not think that any Member comes to this House to erode anybody’s rights whether they are disabled or have a health issue.
I absolutely refute what the hon.
Lady says.
She should look at our actions and our record of the work that we have done around British Sign Language and more widely.
We stand by all constituents whatever their needs.
