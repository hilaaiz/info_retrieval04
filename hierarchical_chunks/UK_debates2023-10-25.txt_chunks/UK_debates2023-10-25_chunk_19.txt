As a woman in her 50s—[Hon.
Members: “No!”]—I know how challenging the menopause can be, especially when you have a busy job.
What support is there for working women with the menopause?
I hope that my right hon.
Friend feels that she is supported by all of her colleagues.
I am delighted to let her know that there will be a full debate on menopause tomorrow, led by the Minister for Social Mobility.
I am proud of the great strides that Helen Tomlinson has made since her appointment as the Department for Work and Pensions menopause employment champion.
The report “No Time to Step Back” details this progress and looks forward to the next six months, including the sector-specific workshops.
In less than a decade, the proportion of female pensioners in the UK living in poverty has risen by 6%, which means that one in every five female pensioners are below the breadline, despite the fact that  the number of female pensioners has fallen due to the rise in state pension age, which disadvantaged tens of thousands of older women.
Does the Minister for Equalities share my concern that in the UK today 20% of female pensioners are living in poverty, and what action will she take to address that?
