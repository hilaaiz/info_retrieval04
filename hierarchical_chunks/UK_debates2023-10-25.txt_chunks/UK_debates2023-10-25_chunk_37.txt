I welcome the unity across the House on Israel’s right to defend itself in the face of an unspeakable act of terror, but it is also clear that we must support the Palestinian people; they are victims of Hamas, too.
Hamas use innocent people as human shields, and we mourn the loss of every innocent life of every people, every faith and every nationality.
We are working as hard as we can to get as much humanitarian aid into Gaza as quickly as practically possible.
