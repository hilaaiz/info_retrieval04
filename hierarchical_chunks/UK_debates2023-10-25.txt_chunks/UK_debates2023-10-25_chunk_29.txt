I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important issue on behalf of his and my constituents.
It is vital that we have the same high-quality services in rural areas as in our towns and cities.
I am pleased to tell him that we are providing £95 million through the rural services delivery grant to help rural councils achieve exactly that.
We are currently reviewing the police funding formula.
I remember working with him to ensure that the national funding formula for schools takes account of the different characteristics of schools and their pupils.
We will continue to keep all those things under review.
I agree with him entirely: our rural communities must be given the same funding and public services as everyone else in our country.
