The Minister for Women and Equalities was asked— What steps the Government is taking to protect single-sex spaces.
We are committed to maintaining the safeguards that allow organisations to provide single-sex services.
The Equality Act 2010 sets out that providers have the right to restrict use of services on the basis of sex where there is justified and proportionate reason.
A number of Members of the House have relatives or family members who are trans, and we will all have constituents who are members of the trans community.
Does the Minister agree that trans people need safe spaces, too?
My right hon.
Friend is absolutely right to highlight the tone in which the debate should take place.
Just a few weeks ago, we had a debate in Westminster Hall where I absolutely made that point.
This is not about pitting women against the trans community.
Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act, but it is important that biological women have the ability to access single-sex spaces, too.
What steps the Government are taking to help increase the participation of minority ethnic groups in the democratic process.
Whether she has had discussions with stakeholders on improving the diversity of parliamentary candidates.
The Government have worked hard to remove any material obstacles to democratic participation for all eligible groups.
Registering to vote is quick and easy, taking as little as five minutes.
Any elector without an  accepted form of photographic identification can apply for a voter authority certificate from their local authority free of charge, or alternatively they could vote by post or proxy.
I have a thriving British-Albanian community in my Chipping Barnet constituency, making a really positive contribution to our culture and economy.
What more can the Government do to encourage them to be involved in campaigning at elections, voting in elections and standing as candidates in elections?
