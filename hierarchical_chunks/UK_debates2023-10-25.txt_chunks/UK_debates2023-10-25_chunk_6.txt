I thank my hon.
Friend for his work, particularly around promoting the energy sector across the United Kingdom.
We are making progress on trying to get women and girls into that vital sector.
One of our Build Back Better campaigns is seeking to inspire women from all walks of life to work in the green energy economy and raise awareness of green education, training and careers.
My colleague the Minister with responsibility for employment and I regularly meet devolved colleagues to discuss how we can have a United Kingdom approach to this issue.
