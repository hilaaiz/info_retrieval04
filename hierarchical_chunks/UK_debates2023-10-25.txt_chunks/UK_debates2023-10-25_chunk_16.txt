I thank my right hon.
Friend for her point, which gives me the opportunity to say that from next Tuesday an additional £300 will be paid in cost of living payments to those who are eligible.
Regarding access to work, there is a continuing focus on improving waiting times for customers and we are streamlining and digitising the process.
Indeed, I spoke to the Minister  for Disabled People this week on exactly this matter in relation to one of my own constituents, and I will see that he hears it again from my right hon.
Friend.
