Mr. RUIZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birthday of Loretta Rinaldi who is deeply cherished by her community, her church, and family.
Born to English-immigrant parents on July 17, 1924, in Los Angeles, California, 
Mrs. Rinaldi dedicated her life to education, her community, and family.
In 1942, she graduated as valedictorian of Catholic Girls' High School after which she took her vows to become a nun.
At Immaculate Heart, 
Mrs. Rinaldi taught science and found her passion for being an educator.
She continued to educate and be a proactive figure in her community even after leaving the covenant.
