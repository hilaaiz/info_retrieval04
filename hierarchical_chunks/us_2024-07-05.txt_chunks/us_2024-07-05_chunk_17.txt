threat to our national security, yet there is no funding to help communities adapt to drought, rising coastlines, or extreme heat, and no funding to stop deforestation or recurring coastal flooding.
Additionally, there is no support for adapting to renewable energy.
Even in areas where we can usually find bipartisan agreement, this bill falls short.
For example, the Feed the Future program, which has historically enjoyed bipartisan support across multiple administrations, received a $50 million cut.
This program has helped feed 32 million children worldwide in the last year alone and has helped their families learn to farm sustainably and stand on their own.
This cut will have devastating impacts on children and families that struggle with malnutrition and food instability.
This is a deeply political bill that will diminish America's leadership on the worlds stage, make it more difficult for us to support our allies and deter our adversaries, and will ultimately jeopardize our national security.
For these reasons, I ask that my colleagues vote against it.
