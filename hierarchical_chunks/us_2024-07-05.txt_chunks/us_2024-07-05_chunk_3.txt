Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, each July 4th we have an opportunity to pause and reflect upon our past and celebrate our future for what we as a Nation have accomplished.
Today, we can celebrate that over the nearly two and a half centuries we have conquered the crucibles faced: from the civil war, global conflicts and global deadly pandemics and an assault on our Capitol-- the citadel of Democracy--the birthplace of all modern democracies.
The success of our democracy and the means provided to the people of this Nation to shape its present and guide it into the future has been and continues to be the ballot box.
Martin Luther King's Speech at the March on Washington explains the power of the vote to empower We The People to shape our destiny.
