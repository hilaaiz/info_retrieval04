Mr. Speaker, in celebrating Loretta Rinaldi, we celebrate the empowerment found in knowledge, the precedent set by courageous advocates, and the strength of familial bonds.
On behalf of California's 25th District, I extend my warmest wishes to 
Mrs. Rinaldi and her family as we join in celebrating this major life milestone.
