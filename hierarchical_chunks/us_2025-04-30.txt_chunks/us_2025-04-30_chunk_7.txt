Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors an exceptional leader within our community: Principal Markisha Stovall.
Her unwavering dedication to her students, their families, and our community embodies the very essence of exemplary public service.
Born and raised in Detroit, Principal Stovall's resilient life story includes overcoming the loss of her mother to addiction, her father's incarceration, and being raised by her grandmother with five siblings.
Despite these hardships, she graduated from Michigan State University and, as a single mother, became an educator to uplift all children.
Serving as the Principal of Madison Carver Academy, her leadership has yielded transformative results: a significant 33 percent surge in enrollment, an impressive 99 percent average attendance rate, the establishment of over 20 enriching student clubs, and the implementation of crucial wraparound services to support families facing crises.
The 12th Congressional District honors her leadership and commitment to our students and community.
I congratulate her on all her accomplishments.
