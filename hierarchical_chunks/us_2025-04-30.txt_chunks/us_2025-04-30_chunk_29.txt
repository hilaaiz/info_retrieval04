Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Fall.
April 30, 2025, marks 50 years since the pivotal moment that signaled both the end of the Vietnam War and the beginning of a new chapter for millions of Vietnamese refugees--many of whom have made extraordinary contributions to communities across the United States, particularly in Northern Virginia.
On April 30, 1975, the world watched as the city of Saigon fell.
For many, it marked a day of loss, of country, of family, and of home.
Yet it also marked the beginning of a remarkable story of resilience, strength, and hope.
In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands fled Vietnam in search of liberty and opportunity, many finding a new beginning here in the United States.
Northern Virginia is home to one of the largest and most vibrant Vietnamese American communities in the country.
Places like the Eden Center stand as a testament of the rich cultural heritage and entrepreneurial spirit.
The businesses, traditions, and values the Vietnamese American community upholds continue to enrich our region and make invaluable contributions.
The Vietnamese American community's story is one of perseverance, courage, and hope.
Their contributions have made our communities stronger and better.
Their journey embodies the ideals we hold dear: perseverance through hardship, strength in adversity, and an enduring hope for a better future.
