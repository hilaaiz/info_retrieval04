Mr. Perry has seen a great deal of change in agriculture in York County.
One constant throughout that time has been Perrydell Farms, which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2023.
Perrydell's long and storied history in York County is due in large part to the work of George Perry, who over his more than a century of life has pursued a mission of providing quality products to his community.
Perrydell Farms is now run by 
Mr. Perry's three sons, Tom, Greg, and Chip.
Despite no longer running the farm, George is regarded as the farm's patriarch, an invaluable member of the farm and family's history in the dairy industry.
It is with great enthusiasm that I congratulate 
Mr. Perry on his 103rd birthday, his service to our country, and his success as a business owner.
His stewardship of Perrydell Farms has allowed it to remain a staple of the community, and I hope for their continued success for years to come.
