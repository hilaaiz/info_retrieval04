Mrs. Williams was a woman of strength and devotion.
She shared over 60 years of life and love with her beloved husband, the late Sylvester E. Williams, whom she married on January 6, 1950.
Together, they raised four children: Alan Williams, Dale Williams, Vera Williams and Janet Williams, all who attended college.
Their family was built on love and mutual respect.
For over three decades, 
Mrs. Williams faithfully served her community as a mail sorter for the United States Postal Service.
She often worked long hours diligently ensuring our local postal operations ran smoothly.
She was more than a mail sorter, however.
With her consistent presence and friendly nature, she was a source of connection for those in her community.
Her commitment to her work and the genuine care she had for her community earned her numerous commendations from both her colleagues and her community.
