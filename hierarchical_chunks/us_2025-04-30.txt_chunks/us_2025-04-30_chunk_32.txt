When 
Mrs. Willie Lee Glass was unable to attend a luncheon hosted by 
Mrs. Lyndon Baines Johnson, she asked Major Ozell M. Dean to attend in her place.

Mrs. Glass and other distinguished Texas women to explore the possibility of forming an organization dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by youth in their communities.
From its inaugural meeting on June 4, 1964, at Texas College in Tyler, Texas, TLOD has grown into a renowned national service organization with 135 chapters and over 5,300 members across the country.
