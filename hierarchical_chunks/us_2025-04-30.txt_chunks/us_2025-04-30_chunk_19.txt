Mr. FITZGERALD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating several remarkable Girl Scouts from Wisconsin's 5th Congressional District for demonstrating leadership, creativity, and a commitment to making a lasting impact by earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.
Gold Award Girl Scouts help their communities and the world by identifying a community need, investigating it, devising a plan, and leading a team of experts and community members to implement a project that produces lasting change.
Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and leadership, distinguishing them from their peers.
Through their resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to make the world a better place.
