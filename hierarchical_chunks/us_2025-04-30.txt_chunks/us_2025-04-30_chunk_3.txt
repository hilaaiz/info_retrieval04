Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate George Perry on his 103rd birthday and for his longstanding service to his country and the York County community.
You would be hard pressed to find a better representative of York County than 
Mr. George Perry.
He has served his country, his community, and is still active in the running of his family's business.
George Perry was born on his family's dairy farm in York, Pennsylvania in 1922.
Since then, Perry has become an icon in the community as the head of his family's thriving business, Perrydell Farms.
Perrydell Farms produces fresh milk and ice cream made, all of which is made on site.
Not only is Perry a veteran of the dairy industry but also World War II.
He left college in 1943 to join the Army and fight in the Pacific.
After the war, 
Mr. Perry took over Perrydell Farms in 1949 with his brother.
Together, they helped to establish Perrydell as a local onestop-shop for fresh, high-quality milk and ice cream.
In his 103 years,
