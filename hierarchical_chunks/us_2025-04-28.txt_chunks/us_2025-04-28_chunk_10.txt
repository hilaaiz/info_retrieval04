Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in honoring the life and legacy of 
Ms. Chiquita Michele Greene and in extending our deepest sympathies to her family, friends, colleagues, and all those who mourn her tragic loss.
We pray that all will be consoled by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
