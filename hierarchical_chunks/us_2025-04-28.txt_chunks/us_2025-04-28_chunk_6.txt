Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Ms. Chiquita Michele Greene--a devoted educator, trailblazer, and servant leader from Southwest Georgia.
Her unwavering commitment to her students and the greater community has profoundly touched countless lives across Georgia and the Nation.
Sadly, 
Ms. Greene transitioned from labor to reward on April 6, 2025.
A celebration of her life was held on Monday, April 14, 2025, at Unity Baptist Church in Sylvester, Georgia.
