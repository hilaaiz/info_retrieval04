Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Peter Pearson, a 57-year resident of New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, who recently passed away at the age of 83.
Residing in the town of Andover, he was elected member of the Andover Regional Board of Education from 1984 to 1996 and later as an Andover Borough Councilman from 2002 to 2022.
Additionally, 
Mr. Pearson served as comptroller for multiple small businesses and as the School Business Administrator for several of the surrounding school districts for over 25 years.
Mr. Pearson was always ready to help with anything that would better his community and will be remembered for his kind personality and dedication to serving those around him.
I am honored to be able to recognize such a dedicated and thoughtful resident of my district.
