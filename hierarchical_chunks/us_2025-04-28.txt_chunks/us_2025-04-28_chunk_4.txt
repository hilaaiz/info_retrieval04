Ms. DelBENE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, alongside my colleague Rep. Dan Newhouse, to honor the life and legacy of Washington's former Secretary of Health Mary Selecky, who we both had the honor of serving besides in former Governor Christine Gregoire's cabinet.
For over four decades, Mary dedicated her life and career to improving public health across Washington.
She began her career as the administrator for the Northeast Tri County Health District.
In 1999, she was appointed as the Secretary of Health by Governor Gary Locke and continued in that role under Governors Gregoire and Jay Inslee until her retirement in 2013.
During her tenure as Washington's Secretary of Health, Mary was instrumental in reducing smoking rates and increasing childhood vaccination coverage across the state.
She was known for her commitment to preventive care and for strengthening the collaboration between state and local health agencies.
In 2020, during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state drew on Mary's commitment to preparedness for a public health emergency.
During our time in the cabinet with her, we valued her expertise, tenacity, and mentorship that she provided to all.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Mary was deeply connected to her community in Colville, Washington, where she resided for over 50 years.
Her dedication to both her local community and the broader public health landscape left a lasting impact on the state.
Mr. Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join us in honoring Mary Selecky's life and contributions to public health, as well as Washington.
