I thank the Minister for the clarity of her answers today.
We are all aware that Iran played a major role through its antisemitic regime in funding Hamas and Hezbollah, with the stated aim of destroying the state of Israel.
If there is to be faith in the reconstruction of Gaza, people who want to do that will have to have faith that there is a secure situation.
The attitude of this White House towards Iran is different from the previous one.
What  action are the Government taking and how are they involved in ensuring that Iran is not able to re-establish itself to fund and arm the groups that specifically want to destroy the state of Israel?
