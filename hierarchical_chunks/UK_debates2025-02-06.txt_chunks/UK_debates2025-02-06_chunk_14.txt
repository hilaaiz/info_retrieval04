There are 12.5 million cat owners in the UK, and hundreds of thousands of cats are killed on the roads every year.
The previous Government agreed that it would be right to include cats in the Road Safety Act 2006, but they simply did not do it.
This means that cats are regularly hit and, because there is no legal duty to report it, are just scooped to the side of the road.

This is an issue that has been widely discussed.
Our advice is that it would be difficult to enforce in practice, but I fully recognise the distress and concern that it causes.
