May I take the Secretary of State back to the subject of illegal meat imports?
On Tuesday the Select Committee was told that at Dover this work, which covers only 20% of arrivals, is being done in live lanes, despite the fact that there is a border control post at Dover that is sitting unused, and the funding for Dover Port Health Authority is due to expire at the end of March.
Can we at the very least sort out the financing of this for the next financial year?
