Farmers in West Dorset are struggling with rising costs, the regulatory burden, market instability and supermarkets paying unsustainably low prices for what they produce.
This forces many farmers to diversify away from food production in order to survive.
Given the vital role that farming plays in both our rural economy and in food security, what specific measures will the Government introduce to stop the need for diversification and ensure that farming remains a financially viable and attractive industry for the next generation of West Dorset farmers?
The hon.
Gentleman makes an important set of points, but I point him to the speech that my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State made at Oxford, because he made the very strong point that farming needs to get a better return for the hard work that farmers do.
Alongside that, diversification is important to allow people to get through the difficult times, which inevitably come up in a cyclical business such as farming.
The increasing demand for biofuel feedstocks offers a huge opportunity for agriculture, particularly in feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel.
With the welcome SAF mandate and revenue certainty mechanism, there is a real chance for growth in this area, especially if we support rapid conversion at Grangemouth.
What steps is the Minister taking to secure a scalable supply of feedstocks, and how he will remove barriers to their use in the production of SAF?
My hon.
Friend makes a very important point, but we need to make sure that we get the right balance between producing food and using our land for other purposes.
That is why it is so important that a land use framework was brought forward.
We have a consultation going on for the next 12 weeks, and I am sure that he and others will contribute to it.
