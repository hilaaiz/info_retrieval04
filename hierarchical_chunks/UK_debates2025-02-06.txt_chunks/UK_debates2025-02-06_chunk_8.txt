My hon.
Friend the Minister and my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State deserve great credit for attracting the large investment that they have secured, but once they have finished the lap of honour, they will be aware that this is the first step up the mountain.
The Minister is right that the Government have inherited flood defences that are in an appalling state, and the latest estimate shows that as many as 6 million houses are at risk of flooding.
I call on her to get on with the flood improvements that we demand in Chesterfield.
First, will she tell us more about how she will ensure the money will be spent wisely?
Secondly, how will she ensure that the Treasury understands that this is not a one-year commitment, but something that we will need for the rest of this term in office?
