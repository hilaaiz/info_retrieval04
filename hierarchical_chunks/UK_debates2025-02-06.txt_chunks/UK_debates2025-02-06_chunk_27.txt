Constituents in Witney were extremely distressed to receive letters this week from Thames Water saying that their bills are going up by £19 a month from April, putting more pressure on household bills.
Does the Minister think that is acceptable, given that the restructuring plan in the High Court is putting £800 million to £900 million of interest expenses on to this company— Order.
This is sub judice, and the hon.
Member should not go into the actual detail of the application before the Court at the moment.
Can the Minister say anything?
If not, we will have to move on.
Over a decade ago, planning permission was given to build an incinerator on the outskirts of Corby.
That location now has thousands of houses, a school and a nursery.
Frankly, it is now in the heart of the community and no longer on the outskirts.
Given that the incinerator is yet to be built, does the Minister agree with me that, in the light of the crackdown on waste incinerators, the planning application should be looked at again and the incinerator moved?
It is not appropriate for me to comment on a specific planning permission case, but I do encourage those developing energy-from-waste facilities, including those that already have permission, to consider the evidence that DEFRA published over the recess, the new  standards that we have introduced and the Government’s circular economy opportunities when determining whether their facility is still required.
