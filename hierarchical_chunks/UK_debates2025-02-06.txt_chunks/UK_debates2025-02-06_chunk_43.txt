The context in which we approach this question is following 16 months of bloodshed and the deaths of almost 50,000 Palestinians, and a welcome temporary ceasefire.
So the remarks of the US President, in conference with the Israeli Prime Minister, that the US will “take over the Gaza Strip” to create a “Riviera of the Middle East” and that “1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza” should live in “other countries”, are reckless and dangerous.
That has emboldened the Israeli Defence Minister Katz overnight to further propose the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.
The remarks are generating fear and tension in the Palestinian population, and across the middle east—as evidenced by the statements of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and others—and will cause concern and more determined demonstrations in the UK.
The US President has also restored arms shipments, ended funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council.
Netanyahu says that Israel will redraw the map, and the Israeli Defence Forces have detonated whole streets in the Jenin refugee camp in the west bank.
In such dangerous circumstances we should be careful, calculated and accurate in our use of language.
Forced displacement of the type advocated, which has already occurred within the Gaza strip, is a breach of international humanitarian rights and a war crime.
Advocating the expulsion of a people is also justly described as ethnic cleansing, and can only be achieved through yet further appalling violence.
I acknowledge that the Government will wish to maintain their diplomatic relationship with the US, as a long-standing friend, but it is the role of friends to be honest with each other, and the UK must use its influence.
