I thank my hon.
Friend for his service on the Water (Special Measures) Bill Committee.
He will know that the Bill creates new powers for the regulator, including banning the payment of unjustified bonuses for water bosses whose companies fail to meet environmental standards and ensuring that imprisonment is a sentencing option where environmental regulators are obstructed.
That will hold water companies and their executives to account.
In addition, we are doubling compensation for poor service to hold water companies to account for failure in their service delivery.
