I thank the hon.
Member for his question, which is one that I have been asked at the Dispatch Box many times over the past few weeks.
I have been to meet farmers in Cumbria, and last week I met farmers in south Cambridgeshire.
I would love to meet farmers in Devon, so I am happy to add him to the list for my grand tour across the country to reassure people that there is a strong plan to ensure that farmers have a viable future, which they did not have under the last Government.
