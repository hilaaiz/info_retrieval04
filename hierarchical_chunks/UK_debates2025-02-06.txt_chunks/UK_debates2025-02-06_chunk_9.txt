I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and may I congratulate him on his recent engagement?
He is right to point out the importance of money being spent wisely now to save money in the future.
There are a couple of interesting factors: every £1 we spend on maintenance of flood defences saves £13 in damage prevention, and every £1 we spend on new defences saves £5 in damage prevention.
Those are important statistics that I use frequently in negotiations about future spending reviews with Treasury officials.
