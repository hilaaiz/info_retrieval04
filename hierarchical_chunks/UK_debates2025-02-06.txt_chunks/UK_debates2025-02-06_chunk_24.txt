I thank the hon.
Lady for her important question.
The Government are developing a series of interventions to reduce emissions, so that everybody’s exposure to air pollution is reduced.
We are also conducting a comprehensive review of how we communicate air quality information, to ensure that members of the public and vulnerable groups have the information they need to protect themselves and understand the impact on air quality.
Of course, no further decisions have been made regarding other developments.
