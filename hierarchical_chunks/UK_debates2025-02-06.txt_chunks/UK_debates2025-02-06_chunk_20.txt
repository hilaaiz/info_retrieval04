I welcome the Government’s focus in this area.
One of the barriers that small agricultural businesses in my constituency face in supplying the public sector is the complexity of the contracting process.
The Crown Commercial Service made significant improvements to its portal last year, but I urge the ministerial team to build on that progress to make it easier, particularly for small companies, to provide food to the public sector.
Ultimately, we all want to see more of that.
