In the north of my constituency, between the Scottish border and Hadrian’s wall, lie the debatable lands, but in the centre of Carlisle lies a forgotten land along the River Caldew.
It is forgotten because of the incompetence of the Conservatives, who failed to deliver the flood defences along the Caldew that were promised after Carlisle was devastated in 2015.
Will the Minister remember the forgotten lands of Carlisle?
My hon.
Friend makes a persuasive case, as she has done at every oral question time we have had so far.
She is right to highlight the fact that not only did the previous Government leave our defences in the worst state on record, but they failed to spend some of  the money that had been allocated.
This Government are having to deal with that, along with the many other issues we are cleaning up.
