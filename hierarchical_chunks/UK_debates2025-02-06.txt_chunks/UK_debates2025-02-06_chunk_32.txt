I thank my hon.
Friend, who is right to highlight how the previous flooding formula discriminated against rural communities because it was based purely on the number of properties protected, not on creating the right solution in the right area.
That is exactly why we wish to reform the formula, and we will be announcing a consultation very shortly.
