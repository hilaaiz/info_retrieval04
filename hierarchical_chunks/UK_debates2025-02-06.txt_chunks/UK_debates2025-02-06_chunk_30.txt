I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for his question.
The issues at Dover are significant and long-running.
The funding was not resolved ahead of the general election, and there is an ongoing discussion.
We are very aware of the challenges, but we are on it, and we will make sure that we are talking to those at Dover Port Health Authority.
