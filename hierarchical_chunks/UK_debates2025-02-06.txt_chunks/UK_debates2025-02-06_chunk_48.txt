The Prime Minister was quite clear when he said at that Dispatch Box that the right of Gazans to return and remain on their land is absolute.
As they return, there are many hundreds of thousands of psychologically and physically damaged children, which is unprecedented in recent memory.
What can we, the British state, do to help them?
I know that my hon.
Friend will be concerned about this issue given his considerable medical expertise.
The UK has been acting to ensure that we are doing our part to support children in Gaza, and we will continue to do so.
We are having urgent discussions with our partners on this, and those discussions extend to the concerning issues around psychosocial trauma that has been experienced by children and ensuring that those vulnerable children receive the support that they need in the future.
It is welcome news that some hostages have been released, but the shocking scenes that we have seen of brave young women surrounded by terrorists demonstrate that Hamas are still in charge in Gaza.
The question now turns to how we ensure that the Palestinian people can return to safe and secure homes, that the terror tunnels are destroyed and that Hamas play no part in the governance of Gaza.
Given that Hamas are in charge, and that President Trump has made an announcement about how all this could be done, what will the British Government do to come up with a counter proposal that is both reasonable and achievable?
I share the hon.
Member’s concern about those scenes, and I am sure that other Members in the House do so as well.
The UK Government have been very clear: Hamas must not play a part in those future governance arrangements.
We have been seeking to work in a practical manner with the Palestinian Authority, especially making sure that they have the expertise that they need for their reform programme and working towards the reconstruction and recovery that is so important in Gaza.
