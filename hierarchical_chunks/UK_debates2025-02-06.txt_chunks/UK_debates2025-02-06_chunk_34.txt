I thank the Solicitor General for that reply.
We in Northern Ireland understand that economic crime is used by paramilitaries to fund their organisations and criminal groups.
In America, Al Capone was put in jail not for the crimes he committed, but for tax evasion and financial issues.
Will the Attorney General target paramilitary groups for their efforts to raise money illegally?
