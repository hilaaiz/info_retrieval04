I thank the Secretary of State for his answer.
Many of my constituents in Southampton Itchen have written to me, outraged at the 53% bill increase that Southern Water is proposing at a time when it and  others continue to pollute our rivers at an alarming rate.
This is simply becoming a national scandal.
As part of the work of the coming independent water review, will the Secretary of State ensure that water companies get back to delivering reliable services for customers, rather than lining the pockets of executives and shareholders?
