I thank my hon.
Friend for what he has said, and I thank the Butterfly Volunteers.
Supporting people at that really important end of life stage is hard and critical work, and I commend them for it.
The local link is also critical: we need to ensure that people can be directed from the national system to local systems, through NHS England and perhaps—if it is appropriate, Mr Speaker—through the House.
It is in the interests of local Members of Parliament for us to ensure that what we have learnt from the national scheme is continued into the local scheme, and, as my hon.
Friend says, we need the local co-ordination and infrastructure about which we have heard this afternoon.
