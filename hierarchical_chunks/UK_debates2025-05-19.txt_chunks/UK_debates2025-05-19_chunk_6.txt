This is a big step today—a broad and bespoke agreement between the European Union and the UK on security and defence—but it is a first step.
Settling the details and the terms of access for European programmes, including the SAFE funding programme, is exactly the task beyond today.
Before being elected, I was proud to serve alongside our European allies, including French, Dutch and Estonian forces, in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
In the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine, it is more important than ever that we build on those alliances to strengthen European security.
Can the Secretary of State tell us how we can do more to strengthen European mechanisms for security, such as the joint expeditionary force, to build our collective security?
My hon.
Friend is right about the joint expeditionary force, and he is right to emphasise the importance of the step today.
While NATO is the cornerstone of our European security—and recognised as such by the European Union in its White Paper—the  step today will mean that we will be able to upgrade our co-operation with the European Union on the mobility of military matériel and personnel, on maritime and space security, on irregular migration and on protecting our critical infrastructure.
It opens the door to closer defence industrial collaboration, including potential participation in the EU’s €150 billion SAFE arrangements.
Will the Minister join me in congratulating the crew of HMS Dragon, which succeeded in obliterating a supersonic missile with a Sea Viper missile off the coast of the Hebrides?
The Royal Navy hit their target thanks to the work of the MOD Hebrides range.
Will he also congratulate them on their continued work?
I will indeed.
We congratulate the crew of HMS Dragon on their professionalism and skill, and they will welcome my hon.
Friend’s championing of that skill in the House this afternoon.
