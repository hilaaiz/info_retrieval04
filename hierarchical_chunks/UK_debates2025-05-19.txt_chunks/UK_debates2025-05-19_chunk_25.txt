I thank my hon.
Friend for her welcome for that investment in her constituency.
We have to do more to improve housing for military families, including in Suffolk Coastal.
The defence housing strategy work includes an extensive review of our entire service family accommodation portfolio to determine how we will use our properties.
It will report later this year; she will then know more.
