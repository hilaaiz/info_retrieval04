I thank my hon.
Friend for the way in which she raises that case; it is certainly something that the whole House can get behind.
Telling the stories of the bravery and courage of those who served in that golden generation is vital to ensuring that we learn lessons from it and understand their sacrifice.
I would be happy to arrange a meeting between her and the Veterans Minister to see what we can do with our Canadian friends.
