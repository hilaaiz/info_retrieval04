I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the issue and that case.
It is vital that no matter who you fall in love with, there is a place for you in our armed forces.
I am pleased to announce that since the LGBT financial recognition scheme was launched on  12 December 2024 , we have now made a total of £1 million in payments to the dismissed or discharged, to people who are terminally ill, or the over-80s who were dismissed or discharged due to their sexuality.
Some 964 applications for non-financial restorative measures have been received and are being processed.
The recruitment of the independent panel and appeals board is complete, so payment for the LGBT FRS impact payments can begin shortly.
