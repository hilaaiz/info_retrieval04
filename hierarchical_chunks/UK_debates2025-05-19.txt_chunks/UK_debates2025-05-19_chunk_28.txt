Salute Her, a veterans’ charity in the north-east, does incredible work to support women veterans with specific needs in accessing support.
Will the Secretary of State reassure me that women’s voices and needs will be heard and catered for in the upcoming veterans’ strategy?
We are developing the veterans’ strategy in close consultation with veterans and the organisations that represent them.
They are at the heart of the process; I can give my hon.
Friend that reassurance.
I am glad that she is looking forward to the strategy’s publication.
UNCLOS––the United Nations convention on the law of the sea—is an incredible international anti-piracy and anti-drug-running tool, but as the House of Lords discussed in 2022, it needs upgrading to include measures on modern slavery and human trafficking.
What work are the Government doing on that in the international sphere?
The UK promotes UNCLOS, freedom of navigation and the UNCLOS rules.
I would be very happy to have a meeting with the hon.
Lady, but a conversation with the Department for Transport, which owns that relationship, may also be beneficial.
