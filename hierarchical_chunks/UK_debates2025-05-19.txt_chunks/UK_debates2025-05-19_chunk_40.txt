I thank the Minister for her answers so far.
Prior to my election, I spent 23 years running a volunteer programme in the NHS, including during covid and the covid response.
We should thank not only all the volunteers who have been involved, but those who run the volunteer programmes locally.
Local infrastructure is important.
It is all well and good having a national system, but where the infrastructure works well, the system works well.
Where the system does not work well, it is due to lack of local infrastructure.
What steps is the Minister putting in place to ensure that local infrastructure can support volunteering and make things better for all those who contribute?
