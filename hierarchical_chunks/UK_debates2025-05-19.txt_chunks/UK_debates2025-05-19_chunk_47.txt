On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
Notwithstanding the response to the urgent question that you were kind enough to grant, we still have no idea how long the gap in the service will last, or what will happen to the most vulnerable people who are using it.
What other parliamentary mechanisms could I use to secure the answers to these questions?
I think that, in fairness, I cannot allow the debate to continue, which is what I think the hon.
Lady is trying to tempt me towards.
What I would say, however, is that I am sure that the good offices around her will give some very strong advice.
I am sure that the Table Office and others will be able to advise her on how she can pursue this matter, and I am sure that those on the Front Bench have heard her point of order.
Before I call the Home Secretary to make her statement, I must remind the House that the resolution of the House relating to matters that are sub judice prohibits any reference to cases in which an individual has been charged.
Three men have been charged with offences under the National Security Act, and the matter is therefore sub judice.
However, since this case concerns matters of national importance and it is in the public interest for the House to hear from the Home Secretary, I am granting a limited waiver for the purposes of this statement only, to allow discussion of the wider security issues.
Members should exercise a high degree of caution in their remarks and take every care to avoid saying anything that could potentially prejudice the criminal trial.
