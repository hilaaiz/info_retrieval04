I thank my hon.
Friend for that contribution and her service in that role.
She is absolutely right to highlight not just the people who come forward, but the people who run that local infrastructure.
As I said in my opening remarks, much of this work is done at a local level.
The learning we must take from what the national scheme did is how we bring that together in a crisis.
We want to make sure that the learning is spread across the country and that we can use digital technology and a portal, where that suits the many people coming forward.
She is absolutely right about local infrastructure and people to make sure things happen.
They are best placed to know where the service gaps are and where the people are who can support them.
They provide an important link.
We will make sure that that is part of our 10-year plan.
