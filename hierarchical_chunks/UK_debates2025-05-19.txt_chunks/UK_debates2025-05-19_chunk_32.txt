I thank the hon.
Member for giving me the opportunity to speak about this topic and highlight the important role that volunteering plays in our health and social care system.
The NHS has always benefited from the generous contribution made by volunteers, who play a vital role in supporting our patients, staff and services.
We are grateful to the thousands of volunteers who donate their time to support the NHS in a wide variety of roles, from helping patients to leave hospital faster and settle in at home, to supporting emergency cardiac incidents and providing companionship to patients during end-of-life care.
