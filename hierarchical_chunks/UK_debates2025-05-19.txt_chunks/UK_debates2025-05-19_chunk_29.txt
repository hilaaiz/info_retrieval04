The Minister may know that I have spent months convincing British scale-up Aeralis to choose Prestwick as the location at  which it will build a proposed Hawk replacement—the first British jet built in 50 years.
That would create 4,000 jobs.
Will she do all she can to bring Aeralis to Prestwick, and make the Red Arrows British and Scottish?
I have met representatives of Aeralis on a number of occasions, as have my senior officials.
The MOD has provided the company with considerable support as it develops its concept of a modular aircraft with digital design.
The Department remains engaged with Aeralis, and with the sector as a whole, to seek a solution that will generate the combat air pilots of the future.
We have begun considering what aircraft will replace the Hawk fast jet trainer, which is currently in operation in the Royal Air Force.
