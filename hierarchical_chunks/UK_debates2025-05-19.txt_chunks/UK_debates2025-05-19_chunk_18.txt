I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that question.
This Government are delivering for defence with increased defence spending.
By April 2027, we will be spending 2.5% of our GDP on defence, which includes an extra £5 billion for defence in this financial year; that will rise to 3% in the next Parliament, when economic conditions allow.
What we spend that money on is just as important, and that is what the strategic defence review, when it is published, will set out.
