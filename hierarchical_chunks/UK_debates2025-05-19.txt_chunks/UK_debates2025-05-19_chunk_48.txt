With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement about the charging of three individuals under the National Security Act 2023 that took place on  17 May , and the further action that the Government are taking to counter national security threats.
I want to thank the police and the security and intelligence agencies not just for their work on the vital operations and investigations that are currently under way, but for the dedication that they show each day to defending our national security and keeping our communities safe.
Their tireless work—often in the shadows, often in secret, and often in great personal danger—is indispensable, and I hope that the whole House will join me in paying tribute to their service.
