I welcome the Minister to her new position.
I have to say, though, if ever there were an illustration of the  scale of the challenge facing Ministers in turning around the Department, this is it.
Let us not forget that this fund was created because the Prime Minister rolled over for a further 12 years the catastrophically bad deal that Boris Johnson gave us for five years.
If the Minister is sincere when she says that the aim of the Government is to maximise local investment, then using the Barnett formula to distribute the funding is ocean-going madness.
By volume and value, Shetland alone accounts for 9% of the fish landed in this country, but Scotland as a whole will get only 8% of the funding.
When will the funding formula be reviewed, and when will we hear exactly where the money will be spent and what it will be available for?
