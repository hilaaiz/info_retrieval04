I thank the hon.
Member for those kind words.
This case was brought under the Official Secrets Act.
There is now new legislation in place, which means it is no longer necessary to prove the enemy part of the test in order to bring a successful prosecution.
That will make it easier to bring prosecutions of this nature in future.
It is regretful that the previous Government did not bring in this legislation sooner.
Had they done so, I expect we would not have found ourselves in the situation we are in today.
