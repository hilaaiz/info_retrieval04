The hon.
Lady may not know that I was a pilot in the Royal Air Force.
I used to do a lot of work advocating for young black people entering STEM—science, technology, engineering and mathematics—industries, so I had the great privilege of visiting Aberdeen on a number of occasions.
Unfortunately, I will not be able to visit next week, when the Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers holds its annual conference in the hon.
Lady’s constituency.
The association was created by Dr Nike Folayan MBE and is supported ably by Falayo Osekita, who is a representative of Leonardo.
Will the hon.
Lady join me in recognising the excellent work that they do, creating a new history for her town?
Before we come to questions, I know that there has been some commentary on what Members may or may not discuss in the Chamber in relation to Prince Andrew, some of which is inaccurate.
There is understandably great interest in this matter, from Members and from the public.
For the benefit of the House, I would like to be clear that there are ways for the House properly to consider this matter.
Any reflections on the conduct of members of the royal family can properly be discussed on substantive motions.
I know that some Members have already tabled such a motion.
I am unable to allocate time for a debate on such a motion, but others are able to do so if they wish.
The long-standing practice of the House, as set out in “Erskine May”, is that criticism of members of the royal family cannot be made as part of questions.
I hope that clarification is helpful, as there has been a lot of online speculation.
