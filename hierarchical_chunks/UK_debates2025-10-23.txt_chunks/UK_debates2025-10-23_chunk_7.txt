The hon.
Member will no doubt have heard from the Health Secretary in Health questions and subsequent statements about the NHS 10-year plan, which is moving the delivery of services from hospitals into the community.
We know that too many patients end up in A&E, for example, making hospital delivery very difficult, because they cannot access support and care in the community.
That is why the Department of Health and Social Care has been setting out its plans for supporting the delivery of care services in the local community, where local people are.
What recent assessment he has made of the efficiency of the security clearance processes of United Kingdom Security Vetting.
The Government are absolutely committed to ensuring that UKSV delivers a security clearance process that is efficient and fit for purpose.
Security vetting clearances are being processed within agreed timescales, and UKSV performance is monitored monthly.
It is working to ensure that demand for vetting is forecast better.
