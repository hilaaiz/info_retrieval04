I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and welcome the companies from her and her colleague’s constituencies to Parliament today.
As she knows, this Labour Government are committed to the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war.
Our strategic defence review and defence industrial strategy will also make defence an engine for economic growth, creating jobs and driving innovation in every  nation and region.
I particularly thank institutions such as Bournemouth and Poole college and Bournemouth University for their important work, and for their focus on developing defence skills for the future and creating jobs for young people in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
