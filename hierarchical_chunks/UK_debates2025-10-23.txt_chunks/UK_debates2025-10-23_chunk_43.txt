Those are the kind of schemes, places, and fishing and coastal communities that the fund should be aimed at; we should not just funnel the money to the already wealthy quota barons who dominate the industry and the airwaves.
My hon.
Friend has made some interesting observations about creativity, which may well be applied to the fund.
We are trying to co-design the way the fund will work—it is there for the next 12 years—so that we can be creative and think about how we support the younger generation of people who wish to go into the industry.
Some of the suggestions that he has made are intriguing, and I will certainly follow them up with him and others.
