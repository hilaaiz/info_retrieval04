In Lincolnshire we know all about fishing, because Grimsby used to be the world’s greatest fishing port.
It beggars belief that we, a coastal nation, import twice as much fish as we export.
Fishermen feel completely betrayed after years of vassalage to the European Union and this latest deal.
We are where we are—we have this fund now—so I want to end on a positive note by asking my favourite Minister: will she ensure that she uses the fund to recreate fishing in areas such as Grimsby, which now has a miniscule amount of fishing, to help them to modernise, get more staff and rebuild our industry?
The Father of the House knows that flattery will get him everywhere—obviously, I hold him in equally high esteem.
Along with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes (Melanie Onn) , I am more than happy to work out how we can use this fund to do precisely as he suggests.
