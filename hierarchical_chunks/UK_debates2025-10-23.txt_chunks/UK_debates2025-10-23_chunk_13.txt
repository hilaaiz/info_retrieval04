I thank my hon.
Friend for his vital work on the frontline during the pandemic.
The Government absolutely recognise that the most complex emergencies impact the whole system.
That is why there has been extensive engagement with local partners ahead of Exercise Pegasus.
The exercise will test national-to-local co-ordination arrangements, and lessons from the exercise will help strengthen pandemic preparedness at national and local levels.
