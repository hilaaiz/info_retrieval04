I thank the Minister for coming to the Dispatch Box, and  the hon.
Member for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East (Seamus Logan)  for raising this important issue.
There is a question of fairness in the geographical distribution of the fund, and the Minister should consider that; I hope the funding will be reviewed in due course.
There is another aspect to fairness, too: there should be fairness across the sector.
I want the funding to be aimed at new entrants to fishing communities that face big challenges to do with depopulation, crewing and keeping themselves going.
For example, the funding can be used to allocate and buy quota, so that local authorities can distribute it to new entrants, as happens to a limited degree in Orkney and in the Western Isles.
I also want the funding to be aimed at new opportunities.
This  summer, an 800 lb tuna was landed in my constituency from the North Atlantic, and it is to be sold at a famous market in Tokyo.
