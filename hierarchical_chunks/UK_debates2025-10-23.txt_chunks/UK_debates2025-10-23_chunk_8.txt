The Minister will know how proud we in Barrow are to be building our world-class nuclear submarines.
Working in the shipyard requires security clearance, which is provided by UKSV.
However, some of my constituents have lost job offers due to the significant delays in receiving clearance.
That has a severe impact on those individuals as well as on our ability to deliver the submarines that defend the country.
Can the Minister assure me that steps are being taken to speed up the process?
My hon.
Friend will know better than anyone that Barrow makes a critical contribution to national security.
I can assure her that UKSV continues to undertake a programme of work to improve the efficiency of the vetting process and that further work is ongoing to digitise and improve the automation of processes.
If she has any further concerns, I would be happy to discuss them with her.
What recent steps his Department has taken to strengthen partnership working with the voluntary sector.
The Government believe that strong partnerships with the voluntary sector are central to delivering for people across the country.
Following publication in July of the civil society covenant—our ambitious plan to partner with civil society—we are now working with partners to launch a new £100 million programme that will reform services at a local level to help prevent the most vulnerable from falling into crisis.
It will involve partnering with the voluntary sector to support people who might otherwise fall through the cracks between services, such as prison leavers or those suffering domestic abuse.
