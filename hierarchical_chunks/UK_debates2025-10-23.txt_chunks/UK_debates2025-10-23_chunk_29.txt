I welcome the Paymaster General’s remarks on the acceleration of the delivery of payments in relation to infected blood.
It is very welcome for one of my constituents who has had it.
I also welcome his response to the additional report by Sir Brian Langstaff in July.
Given that, can he update the House on the lifetime of the public inquiry and any conversations he has had about ending the inquiry, which seems to be going on rather a long time given that the legislation was passed in May last year?
