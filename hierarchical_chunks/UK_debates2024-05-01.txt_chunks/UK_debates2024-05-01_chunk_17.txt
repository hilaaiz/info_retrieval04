I am glad to actually see  the hon.
Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter)  in the House, because he recently pointed out that residents under his local Labour council are “charged much more in council tax but in return receive…lower quality” services.
He has been wrong about some things recently, but on that point he is absolutely right, and this week, people everywhere should vote Conservative.
