I welcome the statement and, in particular, the news that in some categories at least immigration is finally beginning to fall.
On asylum specifically, the Irish Foreign Minister and former Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, complained bitterly just a few days ago that large numbers of asylum seekers were moving from Northern Ireland into the Irish Republic.
Sky News reported yesterday that the Irish Government are seriously contemplating moving police officers to the border to interdict that  flow.
In effect, that would create a hard border on the island of Ireland.
Some of us were lectured for years, including by today’s Opposition spokesman, that the Irish Government would never contemplate that in any circumstances, so the stench of hypocrisy is strong.
Will the Minister assure me that we will never allow the Republic to return those people to Northern Ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross-channel migrants to France?
As for the contemptible remarks of the SNP spokesman, let me say that at least the UK has a Government, which is more than we can say for Scotland this week.
