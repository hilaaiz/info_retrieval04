I welcome my hon.
Friend  the Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter)  to his place on the Labour Benches.
After nearly two decades as a Tory politician and an NHS doctor, he has concluded that if you care about the future of our country and our NHS, it is time for change; it is time for this changed Labour party.
As of today, he is our newest Labour MP, but I am sure he will not mind my saying that I hope he loses that title on Friday.
When a lifelong Tory and doctor says that “the only cure” for the NHS is a Labour Government, is it not time that the Prime Minister admits that he has utterly failed?
