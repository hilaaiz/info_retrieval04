I thank and commend the hon.
Lady for raising that case, and I pay tribute to Georgina for what she is doing.
I often say that one of the most incredible things about doing this job is meeting people like Georgina, who have suffered tragedy in their lives but used that to campaign, inspire and bring about a better life for everyone else.
She is a prime example of that, and she deserves nothing but our praise and admiration.
I am so pleased that she has brought comfort to so many other people, too.
