The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 1 May.
I know the thoughts of the whole House are with the people of Hainault in east London following yesterday’s appalling attacks.
Such violence has no place on our streets.
It is absolutely heartbreaking that a teenage boy has died, and I cannot imagine what his family are going through.
We send them our heartfelt condolences and offer our very best wishes to all those injured.
I reiterate my thanks to the police and other emergency first responders for embodying the highest standards of public service under such awful circumstances.
I know our thoughts are also with those injured this morning in an attack at a school in Sheffield.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
We know that more than one in five teenagers are vaping, with some experts describing it as an epidemic.
Yesterday, new research suggested that teenagers who vape could be at risk of exposure to toxic metals, potentially harming brain or organ development.
I agree with the Prime Minister in his wish to reduce the harms caused by smoking and vaping through the Tobacco and Vapes Bill.
Does he agree that permitting football strips to be sponsored by vaping companies sends entirely the wrong message to young people, and that it is time to ban vape companies from advertising on sports strips?
