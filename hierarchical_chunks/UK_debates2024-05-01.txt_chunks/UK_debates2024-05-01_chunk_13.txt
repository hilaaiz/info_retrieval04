My husband is a veteran, and the defence of the country is the Government’s first duty, in order to protect people across the United Kingdom.
Can the Prime Minister reassure the House that he has a plan in place for backing our world-leading armed services, and does he know why the Opposition refuse to back his plan?
I start by paying tribute to my hon.
Friend’s husband and all our veterans for their service to our country.
In the most uncertain times since the cold war, it is right that we build our security, protecting our values, our interests and indeed our nation.
That is why this Government have taken the step to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, making us the biggest spender in Europe under NATO.
When the Labour leader stands up, I hope he stops dithering, does the right thing and confirms that he will back our plan to increase defence spending.
