I join the Prime Minister in his words about yesterday’s awful events in Hainault.
I am sure that the whole House will want to commend the first responders and send our deepest condolences to the family of the 14-year-old boy who was murdered.
I join the Prime Minister in his remarks about the attack in the school in Sheffield as well.
I know that everyone in the House will be delighted to see His Majesty the King returning to his public duties and looking so well.
We all wish him and the Princess of Wales the best in their continued recovery.
