Never before has such rubbish been uttered about a piece of legislation as has been uttered about the Hate Crime Act.
In one week, the Tories have tried to repeal it—which, given that it mainly consolidates existing legislation, will leave us unprotected against islamophobia, racism and homophobia.
Will the Secretary of State now issue one of his famous colonial decrees and tell the Scottish Tories to back off?
First of all, those laws already existed—that is the important thing.
Secondly, I was right about police resources.
There were 8,000 hate crime reports in the first week, more than in any of the seven preceding years.
It is a ridiculous, unnecessary piece of legislation.
