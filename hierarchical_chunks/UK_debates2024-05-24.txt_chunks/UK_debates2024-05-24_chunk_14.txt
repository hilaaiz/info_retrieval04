It is a sad day.
I call the Scottish National party spokesperson.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Blackpool South (Chris Webb)  on his maiden speech.
Normally after a maiden speech, we stand up and say “I am sure the new Member will be a doughty campaigner for his constituents,” and I am sure he will for a week!
I wish him all the best and hope he is returned to this place.
I also send best wishes to his son and his wife Portia.
Being the spouse of a politician is probably the worst job in the world.
It is incredibly difficult and I cannot imagine the rollercoaster she has been on in the past few weeks, so I send my solidarity to her particularly as she is dealing with the joys and otherwise of having a very young child to look after.
I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman.
If you do not mind, Mr Speaker, I would like to offer some brief thank yous; I will probably be speaking on the tribunals measure later, but now would be a more appropriate time for this, given the mood of the House.
I thank a few of my colleagues who will no longer be in this place after the election.
First, I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) , who during my time as deputy leader was the Chief Whip of the SNP.
He was my confidante and my rock.
We had many late-night sessions planning parliamentary mischief, not least in advance of the SNP walk-out that I think a number of people will remember very well.
I appreciate everything he did for me during that time.
