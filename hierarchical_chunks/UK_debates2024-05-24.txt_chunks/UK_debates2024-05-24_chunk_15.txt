I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Glenrothes (Peter Grant) , who is probably not someone who will be remembered for setting the heather on fire in this place,  but he has done absolutely everything that has needed to be done and everything asked of him, he has dealt with some incredibly technical legislation and he has always been there with words of advice whenever they were needed.
I also thank my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie) , who has been in this place for a long time; he will be stepping back from frontline politics but I am sure not from the SNP.
He has similarly been a huge source of advice and, although we have had some very good-natured disagreements, I have huge respect for everything he has done, particularly for the SNP as a whole, and I have no doubt he will carry on doing that.
