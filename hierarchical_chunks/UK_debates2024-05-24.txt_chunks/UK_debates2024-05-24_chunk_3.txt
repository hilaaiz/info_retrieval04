I thank my constituents in Hendon for electing me on four occasions.
At the last election, I received 26,878 votes, the highest number of Conservative votes in the constituency since 1935.
It sometimes irked me when I was first elected in 2010 that I had a majority of 106 and over 20,000 people had elected me, while there were others sitting on different Benches who had received fewer votes than me but had huge majorities.
That did not feel quite right.
