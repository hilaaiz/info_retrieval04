I thank my hon.
Friend for her intervention and, indeed, for her very kind words towards those who do a huge amount of work behind the scenes to enable us to bring forward a rolling level of sanctions legislation, which has continued to degrade Putin’s ability to fund his war.
We believe that sanctions across the piece have taken some £400 billion out of his capabilities.
It is a continuum, and today’s legislation continues that.
She is absolutely right.
The sanctions will continue to be tools that help us in many ways to keep ahead of those who wish us harm and who wish to support Putin in his illegal war in Ukraine, and to continue to hunt them down and to restrict their capacity.
