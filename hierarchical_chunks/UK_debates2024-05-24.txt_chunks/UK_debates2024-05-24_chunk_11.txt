I thank my predecessor Scott Benton and his staff for all their work and support of local residents.
I also thank Gordon Marsden for his personal support and tireless work in Blackpool South during his 22 years of service.
Gordon is still fondly remembered and recognised for his huge contribution to my constituency and his pursuit of everyone having access to lifelong learning.
