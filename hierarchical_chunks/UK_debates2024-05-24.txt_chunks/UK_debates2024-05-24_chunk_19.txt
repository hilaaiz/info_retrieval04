I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I will take this opportunity to say farewell to him.
His leaving will be a loss to the House.
He makes a good point.
The proposed measures will combat some of what he talks about, but there is a wider possibility for review as time moves on.
We want coronial inquests to be carried out and expedited as quickly as possible.
