I thank the Minister for setting out the measures, though, as I said, they could have come earlier.
I hope that she can provide clarity on the concerns that I raised.
Labour will continue to support further expansion of our sanctions regime, but it is becoming ever clearer that the actions that we take today will have lasting ramifications.
In devising such actions in the next Parliament, we will strive to be even bolder, swifter and more ambitious.
