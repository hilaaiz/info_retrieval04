I thank all colleagues, on both sides of the House.
When we have disagreed, it has always been with courtesy and respect.
Not enough people beyond this place see that that is the way the affairs of this House are mostly conducted.
Most of all, I wish all good fortune and success to all those who will arrive here in July—in particular, my successor in the new seat of Wells and Mendip Hills—having been returned to represent their communities and to make a difference on behalf of  this country, in what will be incredibly challenging times.
It has been a great pleasure and a real honour to serve here.
