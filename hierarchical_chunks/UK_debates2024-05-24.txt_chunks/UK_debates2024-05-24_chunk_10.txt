We come to a maiden speech.
I call Chris Webb.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
When it was announced that I was the winner of the Blackpool South by-election at 5.15 am on  3 May , I called on the Prime Minister to hold a  general election and give the rest of the country the same chance that my constituents had to vote for change and elect a new Labour Government.
I thank the Prime Minister for taking me up on that, although I had not expected to be back out on the campaign trail quite so soon.
I ask the whole House to join me in showing solidarity with my amazing—and now long-suffering—wife Portia, who has been at my side throughout with our amazing three-month-old son Cillian, who has brought so much joy and laughter to our lives.
Mr Speaker, I am grateful for this opportunity to stand before you, at short notice.
It was the last opportunity to do so before a general election; had I not taken it, I risked a lifetime of being an answer to an obscure pub quiz question.
I relish getting back on the doorsteps and speaking with fellow residents.
