Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Hanna Maschhoff on her victory in Missouri's Class 2 Individual Golf State Championship.
Hanna claimed the Class 2 individual title for the School of the Osage, making it her fourth time receiving all-state honors.
Hanna shot a two-day total of 153 to hold off the second-place finisher by one stroke.
She should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home another state championship to her school and community.
