Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Amie Fraley on being named Woman of the Year by the Moore County Community Foundation.
A resident of Whispering Pines, Amie Fraley has headed Habitat for Humanity of the NC Sandhills since 2014.
Through providing financial backing, volunteering and advocacy services, Habitat for Humanity of the NC Sandhills helps families gain the strength and stability needed to build better lives for themselves.
Under her leadership, this organization engages in fundraising efforts to construct numerous homes and provide critical repairs to around 50 homes annually.
Amie hopes, and expects, to reach 1,000 families helped in the coming year.
Beyond her work with Habitat, Amie is an active member of the Southern Pines Rotary Club, Moore County Chamber of Commerce, as well as other community service focused groups.
Amie's dedication to the people of Moore County is without question.
Her many years of service are both commendable and inspiring.
I know I speak for everyone in our community when I say that we are grateful for all she has done to better the place we call home.
