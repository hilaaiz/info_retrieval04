Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Alexandra Volkalt on her victory in Missouri's Class 3 Individual Cross-Country Championship.
Alexandra claimed the Class 3 title to earn her second straight championship for Southern Boone High School.
She stayed with the pack for most of the race until she pulled away near the end to finish first by two seconds.
Alexandra should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home another state championship to her school and community.
