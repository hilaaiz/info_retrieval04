Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Robert H. Bernard for his outstanding service and leadership as Board Chair for Operation Refuge, a grassroots organization based in Western Wayne County.
Operation Refuge provides essential services like emergency food assistance and youth programming to some of the most underserved populations in Wayne County and whose mission is to serve the community with compassion, empathy, and integrity.
As Board Chair, Dr. Bernard leads with this mission as his top priority.
He has worked tirelessly to foster community development and promote career-driven and educational opportunities for the youth.
Dr. Bernard has gone above and beyond to ensure that youth programs, such as Camp Inspire, are inviting and fulfilling and that youth scholarship funding is plentiful and available.
Overall, Dr. Bernard's leadership
