Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the St. Dominic Girls Golf Team on their victory in Missouri's Class 3 Team Girls' Golf State Championship.
The Crusaders claimed the Class 3 title by dominating their competition.
By the end of the first day, the team held a 17-shot advantage and never looked back as they went on to win by 42 strokes.
The team should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home a state championship to their school and community.
