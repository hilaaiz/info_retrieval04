Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating St. Charles West High School on their victory in Missouri's Class 3 Girls' Team Cross-Country Championship.
By claiming the Class 3 title, the Warriors are now state champions for the second consecutive year.
Every member of the team performed admirably, beating out their closest competition by nearly 100 points.
The team should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home a state championship to their school and community.
