Mr. Speaker, I am honored and privileged to recognize Deputy Chief Dennis J. Sorensen on his well-earned retirement from the City Harrisburg Police Bureau.
His tireless, faithful, and selfless service of more than 39 years to community, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the United States of America sets the standard by which we all should be judged.
