Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Senator Jim Perry for his great service to the state of North Carolina and to offer my best wishes as he enters the next chapter of his career.
Earlier this month, Jim announced that he would not file for reelection for the North Carolina Senate after serving three terms.
Jim has served in the state senate since 2019, and in that time, did much to support his constituents of the 2nd district and the state as a whole.
He is a staunch supporter of North Carolina's agricultural industry, rural communities as well as our military personnel.
What's more--Jim is a leader within the Senate itself, currently serving as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and is a Member of the Committees on Commerce and Insurance Health Care, Redistricting and Elections and Rules and Operations of the Senate.
In his time, he's served in leadership roles on numerous other Committees.
Furthermore, he also serves as Majority Whip, to which he was elected unanimously during his first term in office.
Jim is a born and bred son of North Carolina, great American and dear friend.
Jim's dedication to service and constant willingness to step up when needed is commendable and inspiring.
It has been an honor serving the people of North Carolina alongside him
and I wish him the best in all his future endeavors.
