Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the City of Richmond Heights, located in Missouri's First District.
Richmond Heights was incorporated on December 29, 1913 with just 18 families residing in the area.
Since then, the population has grown to 9,286.
Richmond Heights has been home to many Missourians who brought the joys of art and music to St. Louis, such as jazz singer Mae Wheeler, rock-n-roll legend Chuck Berry, artist Ernest Trova, gospel singer Doris Fiddmont Frazier, architect Henry Hampton, and filmmaker Henry Hampton Jr.
Moreover, Richmond Heights is home to many impactful social justice advocates such as Dr. Thomas E. Rusan, Jr., Georgia Tallier Rusan, and Rev. James E. Fiddmont.
It is also home to one of the most recognizable voices in St. Louis, the legendary sports commentator, Jack Buck.
Richmond Heights enriches Missouri's First District with community institutions such as the Esquire Theater, Tropicana Lanes, SSM Health St. Mary's Hospital, the Saint Louis Galleria, and the Boulevard.
It includes four school districts: the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District, Clayton School District, Brentwood School District and Ladue School District, as well as Little Flower, Immaculata School, and the International Schoolhouse.
As the Congresswoman for Missouri's First District, I congratulate the residents of Richmond Heights and their current leadership, including Mayor Jim Thomson and Councilmembers Lisa Eppert, Greg Vescovo, Reginald Finney, Maurice Muia, Megan Moylan, Ashley Metcalf, Danny Hebenstreit and Scott Huston on 110 fruitful years.
Here's to 110 more.
