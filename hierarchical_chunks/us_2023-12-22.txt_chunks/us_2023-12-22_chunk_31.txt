Mr. HUDSON.
Mr, Speaker, I rise today to honor Stuart Mills on being named as the Man of the Year by the Moore County Community Foundation.
Stuart Mills' impact on Moore County is similarly robust and wide ranging.
He has and continues to work in many important community leadership roles, including as Chairman of The Given Tufts Foundation, director of Pinehurst's Village Heritage Foundation, as well as board Chairman and trustee of The O'Neal School.
Likewise, Governor Roy Cooper appointed Stuart to North Carolina's Financial Literacy Council last year.
Stuart's most prominent community role is as Executive Director of Partners for Children and Families, a private nonprofit organization promoting early childhood development in Moore County.
Stuart's dedication to the people of Moore County is without question.
His many years of service are both commendable and inspiring.
I know I speak for everyone in our community when I say that we are grateful for all he has done to improve the place we call home.
