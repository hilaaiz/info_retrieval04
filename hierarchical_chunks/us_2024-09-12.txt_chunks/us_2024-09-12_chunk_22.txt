Ms. MACE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to those of my colleagues who are coming to the Floor this week to speak about, and to legislate in response to, the growing threat from the Chinese Communist Party.
The threat is real, it is significant, and it is the solemn duty You will hear a lot this week about the threat to our intellectual property.
You will hear about the threat to our privacy, our economic security, and our national security.
But I rise today to make sure we don't overlook the very real threat of food security.
I've heard Members of both parties say, ``Food security is national security.''
But tucked into the current version of the House Farm Bill is the H.R. 4417--EATS Act of 2023, a bill that would be a gift to the CCP.
It's been lauded by the Chinese media as a way for Chinese-owned companies to dominate market share in the American food industry.
