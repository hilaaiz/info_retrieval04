Mr. MFUME.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Maryland leader who is a visionary when it comes to policymaking and the epitome of Black excellence.
Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins is a commanding trailblazer in our state who is currently serving as the Chair of the Legislative Black Caucus.
Delegate Wilkins was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and moved to the United States at just five years old.
She was raised in neighboring Delaware and attended the University of Delaware before concluding her studies with a master's degree from American University.
Chair Wilkins has always been steadfast in her lifelong mission of enacting policy change that makes a substantial difference in people's lives.
Before she ever held public office, Wilkins began her professional career as an intern at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.
She would impressively develop within the organization from her position as an intern all the way to her current full-time role as the Director of State and Local Government Affairs working fiercely in the realms of immigration reform, education equity, and civil rights legislation.
Wilkins' first steps into the political arena were through her positions on the board of the Montgomery County Association of Black Democrats and the Montgomery County Young Democrats.
In 2014, she was elected to the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee.
Then, in 2016, she was appointed to fill the vacant state delegate seat in the Maryland House of Delegates 20th District--becoming the first African American woman to assume this position.
From the moment she took office, Delegate Wilkins has been a passionate and powerful voice in the House of Delegates on behalf of all of her constituents in Montgomery County, Maryland.
She is respected by so many of her peers for being unapologetic in her fight for what is right.
