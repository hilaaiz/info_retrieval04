Mr. BUCSHON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lifesaving efforts of Deputy Quinten L. Might of the Gibson County Sheriff's Office and thank him for his continuing service to his community and state.
Deputy Might grew up in the community that he serves today, attending and graduating from Wood Memorial High School in Gibson County.
After graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army where he served as a medic.
He continued his record of service when he joined the Gibson County Sheriff's Office in 2019 as a correctional officer and was sworn in as a deputy in 2021.
At only 25 years old, Quinten has proven that he is willing and ready to protect and save the lives of those in his community, including in four separate incidents since July of 2023.
One of these lifesaving occasions was on May 24, 2024, when Deputy Might and another deputy responded to a personal injury accident involving a two-vehicle collision.
Upon arrival, Deputy Might came to the aid of an individual who was unconscious and not breathing.
Despite multiple small explosions from the fire of the crash, the two deputies moved the victim to safety, and hooked up an AED unit and began twoperson CPR until the individual thankfully regained consciousness, ultimately surviving the incident.
More recently, on August 9, 2024, Deputy Might responded to a residence call about a two-year old girl who fell into a swimming pool and was unresponsive.
As soon as he arrived, Deputy Might called an ambulance and quickly moved the child from the backyard to the front, during which time he freed up her airway by striking her back, likely saving her life.
I am grateful that we have law enforcement officers like Deputy Quinten Might serving our communities today and thank him for his service and dedication to Gibson County, and the State.
