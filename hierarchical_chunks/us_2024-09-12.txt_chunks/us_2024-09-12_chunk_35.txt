Mr. Uhrich's dedication was recognized through many prestigious accolades throughout his journalism career, including the John Anson Ford Award and awards from the Association of Alternative Newsmedia (AAN), California News Publishers Association (CNPA) and the LA Press Club.
My thoughts go out to Marina, Ted, and the rest of 
Mr. Uhrich's family.
His legacy will resonate for years to come, and he will always be remembered for his work and the bright essence of his spirit.
