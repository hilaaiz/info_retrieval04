Mr. Speaker, Berman and Violet's love for each other has kept them together for more years than many people live.
Together, they have shared the joys and challenges of marriage, and set a fine example for many young husbands and wives.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Berman and Violet Layer as they each celebrate 101 years of a life well-lived, and 80 years of love and treasured memories.
I wish them more years of good health and happiness together.
