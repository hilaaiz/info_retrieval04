Mr. Speaker, next month Colonel Foy will assume command of the 621st Contingency Response Group at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey.
It has been a great pleasure to work with Colonel Foy during his time representing U.S. Transportation Command on Capitol Hill.
On behalf of our grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of Colonel Foy and his wife, Natacha.
I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in our U.S. Air Force.
They have dedicated their lives to the service of our great Nation.
Together, We Deliver.
