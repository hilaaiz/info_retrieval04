Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an inspiring young girl from my hometown of Las Vegas, New Mexico--Heaven Rose Archuleta.
Heaven Rose, a seventh grader at West Las Vegas Middle School, has already proven herself to be a remarkable young leader.
At only 13 years old, she delivered a powerful TED Talk about teachers' salaries, earning her first place at the Educators Rising National Competition in Washington, D.C.
Heaven Rose is not only a passionate advocate for strengthening our education system, but also an active member of her school and community.
She participates in cross country, track, and Mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) at West Las Vegas Middle School and serves at her local church.
Her dedication, passion, and commitment to her community and education have made her a true role model for her peers.
Her achievements have been recognized across the state.
At the first New Mexico Highlands University football game this season, she was honored at halftime for her accomplishments.
Heaven Rose Archuleta continues to shine brightly, representing her state, city, community, and school district with distinction.
She is a source of pride for all of us, and I look forward to seeing the many ways she will continue to lead and inspire others in the future.
