Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a remarkable individual and a significant milestone.
Today, we celebrate Bill Massey, the President & CEO of the Peninsula Agency on Aging, on his 40th anniversary with the organization.
For 4 decades, 
Mr. Massey has shown his commitment and compassion for older adults in Hampton Roads, and his work has empowered both older adults and their caregivers.
Mr. Massey has been a cornerstone in the Hampton Roads community, working tirelessly to ensure the Peninsula Agency on Aging fulfills its mission to promote healthy aging by offering a wide range of services to seniors tailored to their specific needs.
The Peninsula Agency on Aging offers older generations the opportunity to foster greater independence, security, and an improved quality of life.
The organization specifically implements several vital programs authorized under the Older Americans Act--the country's preeminent law that supports our nation's seniors.
The Peninsula Agency on Aging also provides seniors with information regarding Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other supports for families and caregivers.
In 2022, under his leadership, the Peninsula Agency on Aging served over 10,200 clients and provided 183,000 home delivered meals to senior citizens as well as transportation for non-emergency medical appointments.
Simply put, 
Mr. Massey and his organization have helped Virginians stay healthy and safe.
