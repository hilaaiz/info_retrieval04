Mr. SCHIFF.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Kevin Uhrich, the long-time editor of the Pasadena Weekly from 1999 to 2020, who passed away on August 23, 2024.
I had the pleasure of knowing and working with 
Mr. Uhrich for many years.
His unwavering dedication, passion for the issues, and intellect were on full display for those of us who were lucky enough to work with him and read his work.
He was truly a remarkable and inspiring individual--a champion for social justice issues committed to covering the vulnerable and disadvantaged of our community.
At all times, like any good journalist, 
Mr. Uhrich sought to uncover the truth, and fight for what he felt was right and good in his community--always standing up for those whose voices were marginalized and who had few other advocates.
He could be tough on elected officials--I can say that too from personal experience--but that was part of his job, part of holding those in power accountable, and he was always fair, professional and transparent in his analysis.
