Mr. GRIJALVA.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the remarkable careers of three distinguished journalists who have recently retired from KVOA, one of Tucson's premier news organizations: Lupita Murillo, Frank Velasco, and Al Mazeika.
Lupita Murillo joined the KVOA team in 1978 as a general assignment reporter, specializing in crime reporting.
A pioneer in her field, Lupita was the first Hispanic female in broadcasting in South Texas before moving to Tucson.
Her career at KVOA spans an impressive 46 years, during which she has garnered numerous accolades, including awards from the Arizona Press Club, United Press International, and the Associated Press.
She has also been honored with several Edward R. Murrow awards and has received national recognition from the American Women in Radio and Television.
Lupita's commitment to community service is exemplified by her involvement with organization such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of Tucson and Santa Cruz County, the Southern Arizona AIDS Foundation, and the University of Arizona's Mel and Enid Zuckerman College.
Her dedication extends beyond the newsroom, making her a cherished member of the Tucson community.
Frank Velasco has been a steadfast presence at KVOA since 1965, starting with janitorial work and rising to become the station's first official news photographer in 1973.
Over his extensive career, Frank has witnessed and adapted to significant technological changes in the industry.
His passion for videography and production has left an indelible mark on the station, and his creative contributions have shaped many of the station's memorable broadcasts.
Frank's deep-rooted connection to KVOA is evident in his long tenure and his role in helping the station evolve over decades.
Al Mazeika joined KVOA in 1975, initially as a part-time booth announcer and eventually transitioning into roles such as audio technician, technical director, and commercial producer.
With nearly 50 years at the station, Al's versatility and dedication have made him an integral part of the KVOA family.
Known for his engaging voice and behind-the-scenes work, Al has not only contributed to commercial production but has also made occasional on-air appearances.
His enduring commitment to KVOA and his personal connection to the station, including meeting his wife Cathy through KVOA, highlight the deep ties he has with the organization.
Together, Lupita Murillo, Frank Velasco, and Al Mazeika have exemplified excellence in journalism and broadcasting.
Their careers have enriched the Tucson community and the field of journalism through their unwavering dedication, innovative contributions, and deep connections to their work and audience.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude and best wishes to Lupita, Frank, and Al in their retirement and life after journalism.
Their legacy of service and excellence will continue to inspire and influence the next generation of journalists and broadcasters.
