Mr. Martin's unit was vital to the war effort, often serving as a lifeline to fellow soldiers and the South Vietnamese Army via cover and support.
He and his fellow men were known as ``Shining Star'' by those they saved in combat.
After returning home in 1967, 
Mr. Martin continued to serve in a different way--working in finance with Northwestern National Bank, which later became Wells Fargo, and eventually shifting to computer work in the final 20 years of his career.
Since moving to Noblesville in 1998, 
Mr. Martin has been actively involved in Memorial Day and Veterans Day services, contributing his time and passion to honoring fellow veterans.
We are forever thankful to the service of 
Mr. Martin, and so many others who answered the call and sacrifice so much for our Nation.
From me and on behalf of the people of Indiana's 5th District, I thank Mr. Martin.
