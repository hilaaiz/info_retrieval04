Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Colonel Jacob Helgestad, who recently passed away after a valiant battle with cancer.
Col. Helgestad was born and raised in Lonsdale, Minnesota.
He attended New Prague High School where he played football, hockey, and baseball.
His life of service started earlier than most--before he even graduated high school, he joined the National Guard as a private.
He continued to serve in the National Guard while he attended college at Mankato State University, where he met his wife, Karry.
In 2001, Col. Helgestad deployed to Saudi Arabia as an enlisted chemical reconnaissance specialist.
A few months later, in the wake of the tragic events of 9/11, he made the selfless choice to dedicate his life to serving our country.
He attended Officer Candidate School and was commissioned as an Infantry Officer in Ft. Benning, Georgia.
He was then deployed to Kosovo and later Iraq as a company executive officer years leading the soldiers of Charly Company in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
For his final deployment, Col. Helgestad served as the Battalion Commander of the 1-194 Armor Regiment.
He led a historic deployment for Operation Spartan Shield based out of Camp Buehring, Kuwait.
Under his leadership, 425 soldiers participated in the evacuation of Kabul, Afghanistan in August 2021 by securing vital sectors of Hamid Karzai International Airport and providing humanitarian assistance.
His battalion was awarded the Army Presidential Unit Citation, the U.S. military's highest unit award, for their work.
Col. Helgestad's life and career were characterized by great personal sacrifice and exemplary service.
He represented the best that this country has to offer.
I offer my deepest condolences to Col. Helgestad's family--his wife, Karry, and his two children, Lucy and Sam.
And I thank him and his family for their service and dedication to our country.
