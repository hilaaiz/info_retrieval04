Mrs. SPARTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mr. James Martin, a Hoosier hero of the Vietnam War who has dedicated so much to our country and to Indiana.
Drafted into the U.S. Army on St. Patrick's Day of 1965, 
Mr. Martin took on multiple roles in the Army, including mailman, fireman, battery clerk, and supply clerk.
In Vietnam, he was a critical element to the 2nd Howitzer Battalion, 17th Artillery, within the notorious 1st Cavalry Division.
