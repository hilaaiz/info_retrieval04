Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Major General Bobby M. Ginn, Jr. on his new role as the Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard.
Major General Bobby Ginn was appointed by Governor Tate Reeves on August 1, 2024.
From Tylertown, Mississippi, Major General Bobby Ginn has a long history of military tradition.
His grandfather served in WWI, and his father served in WWII, both mobilizing through Camp Shelby, Mississippi--the very same military post that Major General Ginn commanded from July 2017 through November 2020.
Ginn has over 34 years of service in the Armed Forces.
He started his career in 1990 as an enlisted soldier and was commissioned as a Logistics Officer in 1993 through Officer Candidate School.
He became a Supply Officer for Headquarters and Headquarters Co., 114th Area Support Group, and then was assigned as a platoon leader in 1994 of the 367th Maintenance Company--a unit he later commanded.
Ginn has completed many critical assignments, including playing a vital role in the response effort after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
He answered the call in 2007-2008 when he was deployed overseas during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
In 2017, he was appointed commander at Camp Shelby and, most recently, Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics.
Ginn earned a B.S. from the University of Southern Mississippi and a Master of Strategic Studies degree from the United States Army War College.
Major General Ginn is a decorated officer having earned the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Iraqi Campaign Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and many other commendations.
I am proud of his appointment as the new Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard.
His service both to our Nation and the State of Mississippi are well recognized, and I am thankful for his leadership.
Major General Bobby Ginn is a true American patriot.
