Mr. TURNER.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate a husband and wife from my Congressional district in Dayton, Ohio, who have reached a rare milestone, celebrating their 80th wedding anniversary.
Berman Layer and his wife Violet Layer are both 101 years old.
They were married on Berman's 21st birthday, on September 16, 1944.
At the time, Berman served in Europe as an aerial photographer in the U.S. Army Corps.
After serving three years in both France and Germany, Berman retired from the military and returned home to the United States.
He used the GI Bill to attend Ohio State University, and graduated in 1950.
During their eight decades of marriage, Berman and Violet have served as business and civic leaders in their community.
They owned and managed a small business called Layer Repair Solutions in Dayton.
Berman was elected to the Miami Township Board of Trustees in Montgomery County and served from 1978 through 1997.
He helped establish the Miami Township Park Board, was a member of the Ohio Township Association, and served as an officer for that organization for 15 years.
Berman and Violet have been faithful members of the Parkview Methodist Church in Miamisburg for the past 70 years.
They served as nature tour guide volunteers for school children at Cox Arboretum for over 40 years.
They have visited all 50 states and toured 23 foreign countries.
The couple have one son, two daughters, and eleven grandchildren.
