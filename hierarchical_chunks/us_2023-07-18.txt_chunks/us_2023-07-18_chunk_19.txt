Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, on July 17, 2023, I was unable to be present for the recorded suspension votes on Roll Call Nos. 329 and 330.
Had I been present, I would have voted YES on Roll Call No. 329, S. 111--Providing for Accountability Through Transparency Act, as amended; and YES on Roll Call No. 330, H.R. 813--Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2023, as amended.
