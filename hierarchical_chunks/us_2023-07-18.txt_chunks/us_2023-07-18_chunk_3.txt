Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Timberland High School's Emilia Labruyere on her victory in Missouri's Class 5 Discus State Championship.
Emilia claimed the Class 5 title, becoming the Wolves' first female track and field state champion.
Her incredible, winning throw of 42.14 meters matched both her personal best and school record-winning toss of the same distance a month prior.
Emilia should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championship to her school and community.
