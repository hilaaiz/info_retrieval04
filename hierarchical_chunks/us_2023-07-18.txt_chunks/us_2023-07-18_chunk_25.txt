Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rosa Margaret Cartwright of Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the occasion of her 100th Birthday.
Her dedication to her family and local community over the last century is worthy of commendation.
Rosa was born on July 18, 1923, in Roanoke, Alabama to Eva and George Dozier.
Rosa came to Michigan by way of Ohio in the 1940s.
During this time, she attended the National Beauty Culturists' League for Cosmetology and held the title of 3rd Vice President and Secretary to the League.
Rosa also pledged Theta Nu Sigma sorority and is currently 1 of the oldest living sorority members.
She has also held the title of Theta Nu Sigma's Ambassador for the State of Michigan for many years.
After receiving her degree in Cosmetology, Rosa married her husband Benjamin in 1951.
Together the couple had 4 children.
A proud small business owner, Rosa was the owner and proprietor of Tony's Beauty Salon for over 70 years in addition to a small convenience store.
Rosa is still an active community member and has served in many city and local organizations, including the Eastern Star as well as serving as Choir Director and Vice President.
Rosa still meets up weekly with a group of avid game players, and until recently taught piano.
