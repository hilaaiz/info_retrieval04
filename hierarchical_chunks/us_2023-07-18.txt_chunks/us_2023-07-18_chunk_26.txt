Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday of 
Mrs. Rosa Cartwright.
We are so proud of her continued tenacity and spirit at such a well-seasoned age.
She continues to be a pillar of the Ypsilanti community and is a true beacon of love and friendship to all family and friends that are lucky enough to be in her presence.
Happy birthday to Rosa.
