Mr. ALLRED.
Mr. Speaker, on May 6 our North Texas community was left scarred by the shooting at Allen Premium Outlets.
Nine people were killed, and 7 others were injured.
But today, I recognize the brave story of the service of Gicela Aleman.
An unsung hero who that day was shopping for new shoes at the outlet mall with her daughter, Adele.
When the gunman opened fire, he severely wounded Preeti Patel, a mother and grandmother who was visiting family in North Texas and like so many others--was just trying to do some shopping.
Amidst the chaos and violence, Gicela sprung into action.
She grabbed Preeti and tried to slow her bleeding.
After seeing that ambulances were struggling to get through security, Gicela drove Preeti herself to get the care she needed.
Preeti is alive today because.
An amazing story that deserves a hero's praise.
We thank her for her bravery, selflessness and representing the best
