Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, July 27th marks the 70th Anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which formally ended the Korean War.
As Co-Chair of Congressional Caucus on Korea, I was grateful to have joined my colleagues in welcoming new Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States, His Excellency Hyun-Dong Cho and the Korean National Assembly ruling party delegation to the U.S. Capitol for a breakfast recognizing veterans of the Korean War.
I valued the opportunity to have met with 6 members of the ruling People Power Party Leader, Assemblyman Gi-Hyeon Kim, members of the National Assembly Chul-Gyu Lee, Seok-Ki Kim, Sang-Bum Yoo, Min-Kuk Kang, and Chairman of the International Relations Committee of the People Power Party and former National Assemblyman Jae-Young Lee.
Visible proof of affection by Americans for the people of the Republic of Korea was the Joint Session of Congress speech by President Yoon Suk Yeol.
