Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jeremy Zavitz, a dedicated educator, loving husband, and devoted father who touched the lives of so many in our community.
Mr. Zavitz passed away on February 22, 2025, after a 24-year fight with brain cancer, but his legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.
