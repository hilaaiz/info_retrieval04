Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life of one of Lincoln's cornerstones: Cathy Blythe.
Growing up in Lincoln, Cathy quickly knew that she wanted to pursue a career in broadcasting.
She got her start at KFOR in 1972 and worked her way up to eventually become the co-host of the KFOR Morning Show.
Over the years, Cathy touched the hearts of all who tuned in.
Her stories and wit cemented her reputation, which was only rivaled by her active involvement in local charities and nonprofits.
Cathy's dedication, talent, and integrity were recognized with her induction into the Nebraska Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2011.
Cathy will be deeply missed by all of us--especially by the generations of listeners who enjoyed her broadcasts before her retirement.
Our hearts and prayers go out to her loved ones as we all celebrate the life of one of Lincoln's brightest lights.
