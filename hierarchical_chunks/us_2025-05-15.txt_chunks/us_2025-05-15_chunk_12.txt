Mr. Speaker, Jeremy Zavitz was a true example of what it means to lead a life of service to others, and his impact on DeLaSalle High School, his community in South Minneapolis, and his family will never be forgotten.
Today, we honor his memory and express our deepest condolences to his family and all who were fortunate enough to know him.
