Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Buffalo Chapter of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants (NYCPA).
Since its founding on February 5, 1925, the Buffalo Chapter of NYCPA has been a pillar of Western New York's professional and civic life.
Visionaries like 
Mr. Luther K. Watkins, 
Mr. William J. Gunnell, and 
Mr. Edward C. Gruen joined together with a group of dedicated Certified Public Accountants to build a local organization where accounting professionals could connect and collaborate.
Their vision created a foundation that continues to thrive today.
Now, a full century later, the NYCPA Buffalo Chapter has become one of the most dynamic and active in New York State, proudly serving members across Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans, and Wyoming Counties.
Under the leadership of Chapter President 
Ms. Mindy Rose Elinski, and following in the impressive footsteps of past presidents, the Buffalo Chapter continues to embody the spirit of collaboration, mentorship, and community that its founders have worked tirelessly to establish.
Through events like Buffalo Educational Night and New CPA Celebration, the Buffalo Chapter brings together students, educators, and career professionals to celebrate academic excellence and career achievement.
The New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants Buffalo Chapter has been a source of support, growth, and inspiration for generations.
The Buffalo Chapter has consistently worked to engage everyone from high school students to reirees, ensuring the accounting profession remains resilient, inclusive, and future-focused.
What makes the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants Buffalo Chapter so special is not just its professional excellence, but its heart.
As we celebrate 100 years of their Buffalo chapter, let us recognize their success and contributions to Western New York.
Their work reminds us that when we invest in people, nurture talent, mentor the next generation, and support each other, we all benefit together.
