Mrs. Brown worked as an occupational therapist at Cataract Elementary School in Niagara Falls, New York, where she was admired for her dedication and gentle, healing spirit she brought to her work and students.
Her love of reading reflected her lifelong commitment to learning and the power of education.
Perhaps one of the most treasured memories for those who knew her was hearing her sing the song ``Grace''--a simple yet powerful testament to the faith and love she carried within her heart.
