Ms. Mercado was a true businesswoman who always kept her roots in mind.
She made efforts to start a business that served Puerto Rican rice dishes after discovering the lack of Puerto Rican restaurants in her neighborhood.
In her adult life, her family and community looked up to her as the matriarch of her family.
As a single mother, she had six children and later went on to have two grandchildren and several greatgrandchildren.
When she had the opportunity to further her education, Rev. Mercado attended San Antonio College in unison with her oldest grandchild.
Even when met with unexpected challenges, she persisted.
At the age of 56, a stroke left her aphasic and with communication difficulties, forcing her to retire.
At 96, she was met with another stroke coupled with isolation from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Still, Miriam ensured close communication with her family and others in the community, demonstrating that unexpected challenges would not strain her relationships with those she loved.
In her late 70s, she helped found the Agape International Spiritual Center in Los Angeles.
Inspired by her upbringing as a spiritualist due to the influence of her Jamaican grandmother, she remained very involved with the Center for Spiritual Living throughout the rest of her life.
For her outstanding accomplishments and remarkable life, it is my honor to recognize Reverend Miriam Mercado.
Her service and commitment to the Inland Empire and beyond are worthy of the highest commendation.
