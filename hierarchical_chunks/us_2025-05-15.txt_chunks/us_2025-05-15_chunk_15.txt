Mrs. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Reverend Miriam Mercado and her service to our community.
Reverend Mercado peacefully passed away in her home on Easter Day, April 20, 2025, at the age of 101.
On July 23, 1923, Miriam Mercado was born in Puerto Rico.
When she was nine years old, her family moved to New York, and in 1968, she moved her family to California where she ultimately resided in the Inland Empire.
For the past 30 years, Reverend Mercado lived in the City of Claremont where she served as a Staff Minister to the Claremont Church.
Additionally, she not only ran a successful business as a Tax Accountant, but she also spent 18 years volunteering as a Chaplain at the Pomona Valley Hospital.
