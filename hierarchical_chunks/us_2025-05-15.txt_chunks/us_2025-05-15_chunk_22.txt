Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 765,00 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, salute and honor life of Honorable Curtis Parham ``CP'' Redding, Sr., a man of purpose and heart, whose enduring love for his family and community will never be forgotten.
I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest condolences to his family and all those who mourn his loss during this difficult time of bereavement.
I pray that they will be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
