Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 
Mrs. Doretta Brown.
She was a woman of quiet strength, deep faith, and unwavering love for her family, students, and community.
Her presence brought warmth, wisdom, and a gentle grace that touched the lives of all who knew her.
Born on March 26, 1953, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 
Mrs. Brown was the eldest daughter of Tommie and Daisy Royster.
She moved through life with a deep sense of purpose and compassion, grounded in the values instilled in her from a young age.
She was baptized in 1966 at Linwood Church of Christ, a moment that reflected the faith that would anchor her life.
What truly defined 
Mrs. Brown was her deep love of family.
As a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, her greatest joy was spent with her late husband, 
Mr. Ivory Brown, and their two children, Anthony and Duryea Doran.
She later became a proud grandmother to Anthony, Jaxon, Skylar, and Hudson.
She was also a loving aunt to two nephews and four nieces, nurturing them with the same kindness and care she gave to everyone in her life.
Mrs. Brown cherished every moment spent with her family--a life filled with love and partnership until her passing.
