Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ms. Bethany Moy, for her work as an intern serving in my D.C. office.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her hard work and recognize the meaningful contributions she has made to the office this fall.
Bethany is from Elmsford, New York, and recently graduated from American University, earning her Masters.
Bethany is a graduate of Gordon College and majored in History with a minor in Political Science.
Interns work with staff to serve constituents in North Carolina's 11th congressional district.
Bethany was chosen from a competitive pool and impressive work ethic.
It was a pleasure to work with Bethany, and I am so proud to have had such an intelligent and ambitious intern representing my office.
Bethany exemplified the spirit of public service and represents the best that our Nation has to offer.
I congratulate Bethany on the successful completion of her internship and thank her on behalf of the people.
