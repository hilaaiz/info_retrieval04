Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the James Madison High School Robotics Team, Team 620, known proudly as the Warbots.
The Warbots participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an international high school robotics competition.
This year, Team 620 qualified for the FIRST Robotics World Championship held in Houston, Texas, marking only the fourth time in the team's 25-year history that they have achieved this honor.
At the Championship, the Warbots and their robot, ``Dory,'' delivered a remarkable performance, finishing 11th in the Galileo Division's qualification rounds.
The team went on to serve as captain of a threeteam alliance, selecting partners from India, Canada, and Michigan.
They then went against the 5th seeded alliance and won with a score of 228-227.
In addition to their success in Houston, the Warbots had an extremely successful regional competition season.
In January, FIRST released this year's challenge, ``Reefscape,'' prompting teams to design, build, and automate their robots in under two months.
During District Competitions in March and District Championships in early April, Team 620 captured the Excellence in Engineering Award and the Autonomous Award.
Their alliance won the Alexandria event and earned the highest score of the year in the FIRST Chesapeake District.
I include in the Record, the eighteen students who represented James Madison High School at the World Championship:
