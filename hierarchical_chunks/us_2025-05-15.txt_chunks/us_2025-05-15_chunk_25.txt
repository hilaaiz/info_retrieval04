Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the South Fairfax Chamber of Commerce and the honorees of the 2025 Achievement Honors Gala.
Each year, the Chamber brings together community and business leaders and extraordinary individuals who exemplify service, innovation, and dedication to our community.
This year's Member to Watch Award recipient is Dr. Swathi M. Reddy of All Smiles Orthodontics.
A native of India and a lifelong learner, Dr. Reddy has pursued excellence in her field across three countries.
She earned her dental degree in India, her DMD from Boston University where she graduated with high honors and was inducted into the Omicron Kappa Upsilon honor fraternity, and her specialization in Orthodontics from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
As a local practitioner and community leader, Dr. Reddy has donated 3D printers to elementary schools and actively supports numerous professional organizations.
She is a great example of how professional excellence can be paired with deep community investment.
The Community Impact Award honors two remarkable individuals: Elena Jordon and Ron Kowalski, both of whom have made lasting contributions to South Fairfax.
For more than a decade, Elena Jordon has volunteered with the South County Athletic Booster Club, raising over $40,000 annually and helping organize major community events such as the Lorton Holiday Extravaganza and the Spring Fling.
As co-founder of The Emma Jordon Kidz Fighting Cancer Foundation named in honor of her daughter, Elena has raised over $140,000 in support of pediatric oncology research and families at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Her legacy of service is driven not only by experience, as a veteran of the Army Nurse Corps, but also by her compassion.
Ron Kowalski, founding member of the Chamber and leader of the Ron K Real Estate Group, has also played a pivotal role in the community.
For the past ten years, he has served on the Board of the Lorton Community Action Center and organized the popular Monopoly Tournament fundraiser, now in its 16th year.
His dedication to civic life exemplifies the spirit of leadership that strengthens our community.
The Chamber also supports the next generation of business leaders through its Student Pro-Growth Business Scholarships, which recognize outstanding high school seniors who have demonstrated entrepreneurial spirit and academic achievement.
I am proud to congratulate and include in the Record the 2025 scholarship recipients:
