Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Juror Pay Parity Act, which would require D.C.'s local trial court, the Superior Court, to pay jurors the same amount federal courts pay jurors.
Currently, the Superior Court pays jurors the same amount as federal jurors, but the Superior Court has sometimes paid less.
Under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, Congress assumed responsibility for funding the local D.C. courts.
The local D.C. courts, however, have always been under the direct control of Congress, even when they were funded by D.C.
The D.C. Home Rule Act prohibits the D.C. Council from enacting any law with respect to any provision of Title 11 of the D.C. Code.
Under Title 11, the Board of Judges of the Superior Court sets juror pay.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
