Ms. ESHOO.
Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present during Roll Call vote No. 120 through 123 on April 15, 2024 because my flight to Washington, D.C. was diverted due to weather conditions.
Had I been present: on Roll Call vote No. 120, I would have voted YES; on Roll Call vote No. 121, I would have voted YES; on Roll Call vote No. 122, I would have voted YES; and on Roll Call vote No. 123, I would have voted NO.
