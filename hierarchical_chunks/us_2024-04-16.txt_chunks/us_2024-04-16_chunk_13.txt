Mr. ROSE.
Mr. Speaker, for many of the folks I represent in the Upper Cumberland Region of Middle Tennessee, this year feels a lot like 1989.
That's the last time the Pickett County Lady Bobcats were named TSSAA girls basketball state champions.
They reclaimed that title last month, when they defeated the Moore County Lady Raiders, 56-45, in the Class 1A final.
And this championship, 
Mr. Speaker, was a family affair.
Lady Bobcats Guard Zoe Nicholas now joins her aunt and grandmother in having been members of a Pickett County state championship team.
It doesn't stop there.
Nicholas' cousin, Callie Reeder, is also on the winning team and was even named tournament MVP.
The coach that led the team to victory, Brent Smith, has a brother named Barry, who happened to coach the last winning team 35 years ago.
It's important to note that even though this is the first state championship in a while, the program does very well every season.
It's also important to note that each time the Lady Bobcats have made it out of the quarterfinals and advanced to the state championship, they've won.
I want to congratulate the current champions for keeping that now six-time winning streak alive.
I am proud to represent Pickett County, and many places like it, that take so much pride in their families, communities, and their home team.
I would now like to recognize everyone who carried the team to victory.
Players included: Senior Allie Amonett, Senior Ella K. Keisling, Junior Emmy Lowe, Junior Callie Reeder, Junior Kaylee Tompkins, Sophomore Addison Lowe, Sophomore Zoey Nicholas, Sophomore Kylie Wood, and Freshman Emma Tompkins.
Managers included: Senior Nikki Gunter, Junior Addie Keisling, and Junior Ava Keisling.
