Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate this week's Hometown Hero, Leticia Ferrer.
During last week's solar eclipse, Leticia's lifelong fascination with the movement of the sun and the moon gave her the opportunity to lead a project in North Texas funded by NASA.
Leticia's passion for things out-of-this-world started in childhood and she's dedicated her life to documenting and filming eclipses across the globe.
Collecting data on the sun throughout her viewings, last week the Farmer's Branch native had the opportunity to work with the Citizen CATE project as a coordinator of scientific viewing teams of the eclipse at home in North Texas.
The Citizen CATE project works with NASA and the National Science Foundation to collect data on the magnetic structure and energy of the sun's corona.
Leticia helped lead four teams of North Texans through the process of properly collecting the necessary data and using telescopes to gather images to be studied for years to come.
I'm inspired by Leticia's dedication to the advancement of solar science and thankful for her outreach in North Texas during the total solar eclipse.
