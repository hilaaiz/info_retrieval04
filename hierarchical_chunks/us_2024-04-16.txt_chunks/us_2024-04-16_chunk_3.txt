Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, April 19, 2024, corresponding to the 11th of Nissan, marks the birthday of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, known as ``the Rebbe.''
It is celebrated worldwide and in all 50 states across our great country, including my home state.
This day is also observed as ``Education & Sharing Day'' in recognition of the Rebbe's deep commitment to bettering the education imparting knowledge but must instill values essential for living a meaningful life, fostering moral character, and contributing to the betterment of individuals and society at large.
These moral and ethical principles have served as the foundation of civilization since time immemorial.
Like two of the greatest Jewish leaders known to humanity in their times, Moses and Maimonides, whom we honor with their bas-reliefs adorning the walls of this august body, the Rebbe provided leadership, guidance, and healing in our times.
This body is honored to have awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal.
The Rebbe said that from his earliest childhood days, he envisioned seeing the world come to a state of peace.
Through decades of dedicated service and leadership, while guiding many of our nation's leaders, he exemplified how humanity, through moral education, charitable deeds, and acts of kindness, can bring our world to a state where ``swords are turned into plowshares,'' with peace and prosperity for all inhabitants On the Rebbe's birthday, it is fitting that we honor him by striving to apply his teachings with greater diligence, embodying his vision of a world illuminated by compassion and goodwill for all.
