Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the outstanding work of the Network of Victim Assistance (NOVA), as it commemorates its 50th year of service to the residents.
NOVA stands as a beacon of hope and support for victims of serious crimes and their families.
NOVA's mission of providing support, counsel, and empowerment of victims of sexual assault and abuse in our region manifests itself through its tireless advocacy and community education.
NOVA directly assists over 3,000 victims annually, providing them with crucial support and resources during their time of need.
Additionally, their team of educators conducts personal safety training for approximately 30,000 individuals each year, spanning across different age groups from children to adults By utilizing individual and group counseling, victims of sexual assault and abuse can regain control of their lives, and through education programs, children and communities learn to be advocates for victims of abuse, as well as prevention and personal safety.
By empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to protect themselves, NOVA plays a vital role in fostering safer communities.
The organization's reputation for delivering exemplary services and programs is well-deserved and wide recognized both statewide and beyond.
In conclusion, as NOVA celebrates its 50th anniversary, let us commend and express our gratitude to all the staff, volunteers, and supporters who have contributed to its success over the years.
I am thankful to work with their President, Sarah Larson, Executive Director, Penny Ettinger, and the many other NOVA staff and volunteers serving Bucks County.
I am proud to support them in their mission to stand for victims in the fight to end sexual assault.
