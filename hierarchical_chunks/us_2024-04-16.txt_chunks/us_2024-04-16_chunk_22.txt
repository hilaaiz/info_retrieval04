Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, David Gonzalez, who is a valued volunteer with several community organizations in Hernando County and has been a long-time employee of our community's electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative.
In this capacity, he has served as the face of the organization in the community, presenting millions of dollars if credit refunds to local governments and school boards.
Mr. Gonzalez has also served in key leadership roles on the Board of Directors for several non-profits in Hernando with the highest levels of dedication, including: the Hernando Chamber of Commerce, Hernando Education Foundation, Hernando Economic Development Council, Oak Hill Hospital Board, and the United Way.
Whenever there has been a need, 
Mr. Gonzalez has stepped forward to address it, without concern for who gets the credit.
A truly humble problem-solver, Mr.
