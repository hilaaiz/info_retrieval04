Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps for its 71 years of emergency medical service to Western New York.
Operating every day of every year, the volunteer first responders who comprise Lancaster Ambulance often serve as the first and most crucial contact for those suffering from profound medical distress.
Lancaster Ambulance's impact on Town of Lancaster, Village of Lancaster, Town of Alden, Village of Alden, and Village of Depew is unquestionable, with its volunteers responding to an astounding 7,553 calls last year alone.
These dedicated emergency responders are treating our friends and neighbors amidst their darkest hours, and I am proud to recognize their community service and high level of professionalism in the line of duty.
On behalf of Congress and the 23rd Congressional District, I commend the men and women serving as part of the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corp.
I include in the Record the names of the Lancaster Ambulance Board and Management Team into the Record as a sign of respect and appreciation for their service and all the members of this important organization: Chester Popiolkowski--President William Revelas--Vice President Chistopher Yockey--Secretary Robert Over--Treasurer Amy Revelas--Director of Operations Nancy Revelas--Director Allison Abraham--Director John O'Donnell--Director Jonathan Hunter--Director Robert Sank--Chief of Compliance Brian Fenik--Chief of Narcotics Lynn O'Donnell--Training Coordinator
I ask that this legislative body joins me in celebrating the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corps for its over seven decades of service.
We thank the many generations of first responders who have protected the Town of Lancaster and its surrounding area through this exemplary organization.
