Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by the lvanovsky Family.
The Twistid Arts Initiative was born out of the desire to raise awareness Citrus County.
Prior to the creation of this non-profit organization, youth in Citrus County had limited opportunities for exposure to successful arts-based careers.
In response, this non-profit organization was developed to provide innovative programming, hands-on education, and immersive events throughout the community.
The lvanovsky Family has jumped in to help at every Twistid Arts event that has been held to date.
They are extremely dedicated to the cause and are willing to do even the most menial tasks to ensure events and programs run smoothly.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones It is clear that the Ivanovsky Family is making a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.
