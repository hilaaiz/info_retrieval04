comprehensive, evidence-based program for kids in grades K-5.
It empowers children and relevant adults with information and strategies to prevent, recognize, and appropriately respond to bullying, cyberbullying, abuse, and digital abuse dangers.
Beyond advocacy, Janine will often work directly with children who have been victims of abuse to help ensure they get the support they need to fully recover.
Her compassion and empathy know no bounds.
It is clear that 
Ms. Kell has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with.
I am grateful for her service.
