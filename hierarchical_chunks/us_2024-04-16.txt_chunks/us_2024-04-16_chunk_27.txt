Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, Mark McClarty, who has been a volunteer with the non-profit, People Helping People (PHP) since 2023.
Mark stepped up to manage the organization's Weekend Blessings program which provides four meals per weekend to children facing food insecurity.
The program also feeds these children throughout the summer.
Careful coordination with the Hernando County School District and other organizations is required to make this initiative successful, and Mark works tirelessly to get the job done.
Mark's background in finance and his people skills are so incredibly valuable.
He continually finds innovative ways to lower the costs while increasing value of the food
PHP purchases for the program.
Under his leadership, the Weekend Blessings initiative has grown, as it now serves an additional 150 needy children each week.
The efficiencies he has implemented for this initiative have also been replicated within PHP's senior feeding program.
His positive attitude is infectious.
It is clear that 
Mr. McClarty has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
