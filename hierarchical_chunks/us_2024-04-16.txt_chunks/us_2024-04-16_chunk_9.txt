Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Robbins Area Library for thirty years of service to the people.
Thirty years ago, this library was established to serve as a center for community and learning for the people of Robbins, North Carolina.
Before it was built, folks had to travel to neighboring towns in order to visit a library.
But now Robbin's library has emerged as an integral part of the town.
The library houses thousands of books, provides internet access in an area where coverage is limited, and caters to the learning of people of all ages.
Additionally, it serves as a central meeting spot, hosting children's events, book groups, movie groups, sports clubs, and more.
Numerous folks have been integral to the success of this storied landmark.
This includes people like Theron Bell, who was the chief advocate for the establishment of the library back in the 1990's, and Clara Bernicken, a thirty-year veteran of the local library system and one of the lead story tellers at Robbins.
They, and many others, have performed a tremendous service to our community in Moore County.
I think I speak for everyone in Moore County in thanking them for all they have done and continue to do.
