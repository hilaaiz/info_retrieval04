Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, today I would like to include in the Record an important article from consumer advocate, lawyer, and author Ralph Nader that celebrate the determination and courage of citizen activists like Nadia Milleron.
Nadia's daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, tragically died in a plane crash when the defective Boeing 737 Max she was in, crashed in Ethiopia on March 10, 2019, killing all 156 people on board.
Nadia was determined to fight for justice, and successfully pushed for action to ensure that the families of victims of such tragedies could collect punitive damages.
Her story is an inspiration that should be read by all as a reminder that in our democracy, one person truly can make a difference.
