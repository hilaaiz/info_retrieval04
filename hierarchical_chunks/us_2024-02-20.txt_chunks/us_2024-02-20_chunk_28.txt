Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Keller City Manager, Mark Hafner, who is retiring after more than four decades of public service.
At just 18 years old, 
Mr. Hafner started his career as a police officer.
In 2001, he moved his family to Texas to lead the Keller Police Department as the Chief.
Under his watch, Keller's first Crime Control and Prevention District sales tax was passed, allocating a portion of the tax dollars toward ensuring public safety.
Keller Police Department also earned its state and national accreditations and forged cutting-edge partnerships in 911 dispatch, animal services, detention, municipal court services, and policing with the cities of Colleyville, Roanoke, Southlake, and Westlake.
He also oversaw two major police station expansions and renovation projects.
