Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, I, along with the people.
Louis, rise to honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Erna Je'Neen French.
Erna was a giant in the gospel community, a mother, grandmother, and sister who dedicated her life to spreading the joy and love of God through her powerful voice.
Erna professed her devotion to Jesus Christ at the early age of five, and she knew she would one day be a famous gospel singer.
Inspired by her mother Lavera, gospel music was always central to Erna's life.
Erna was a scholar of spiritual hymns, and she understood the weight those verses carried.
Before the age of 12, Erna recorded three national gospel records with the Thomas A. Dorsey National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses under the St. Louis Gospel Choral Union, the O'Neal Twins, and the Stan Lee Gospel Music Workshop.
Later in her life, Erna recorded with numerous artists and ministries nationally and internationally and was a member of the Gospel Music Workshop of America, the Sanctified POSSE, GEMCA, Dello Thedford and the Gospel Symphonic Choir, Rusty Watson, One Voice, the Psalms of David, and countless other ministries.
In 2018, Erna accomplished a lifelong dream releasing her project ``Always'' with the help.
A student of the University City School District, she was a proud member of the graduating class of 1985.
In 1986, Erna began a career as a professional driver.
She drove school buses until 1998 when she joined the Bistate Development Agency/Metro St. Louis Transit Agency, from which she retired in 2021.
Most importantly, Erna loved spending time with her family.
Her daughter Alysha De'Nise French and grandson CJ were the lights of her life.
Erna shared her deep passion for gospel music with her older sister, Monica.
I offer my deepest condolences on behalf of Missouri's First District to Erna's entire family and all those who loved her.
