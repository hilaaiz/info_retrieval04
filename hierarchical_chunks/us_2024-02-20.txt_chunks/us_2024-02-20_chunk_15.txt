Mr. Speaker, I am proud to immortalize him today.
He has been a great inspiration not just for me, but for his family, community, and beyond.
His loss is deeply felt by his family members, including his wife, Ellen Schopfer Burke; his sons, Matthew, Jonathan, Andrew, and Sullivan Burke, and their wives; his sister, Susan Evans Burke, and his cousin Mary Jane Dempsey.
He will also be missed by the community at large, which has seen many improvements directly due to Bo's efforts and deep commitment to others.
His deep and nuanced understanding of the law assisted many constituents in defending their rights as American citizens.
I am grateful to know that Bo's legacy will carry on within and beyond my district, as others follow in his footsteps.
