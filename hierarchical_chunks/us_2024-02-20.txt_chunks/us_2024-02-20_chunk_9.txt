Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, 
Mr. Don Bloomer, who is retiring after nearly 50 years of service at Citizens National Bank in Somerset, Kentucky.
Over the last five decades, Don has been a trusted leader in the Lake Cumberland area, dedicating countless hours of volunteer service to other community entities, and helping local families and businesses reach or exceed their financial goals.
Raised on a small farm in Pulaski County, Don knew the value of hard work and loyalty from an early age.
His life's dream was to be a successful citizen in his hometown community and a strong family man, both of which he has accomplished through diligent work and compassion.
Don first arrived at Citizens National Bank as a Management Trainee in 1976, under the guidance of former bank president Clay Davis.
From there he climbed the banking ladder as auditor, comptroller, and cashier, until he was promoted to President and CEO in 2007, where he has guided the bank and the local community through unexpected changes in technology and financial shifts ever since.
Clay encouraged Don to learn every aspect of the industry through advanced educational opportunities, strengthening the future of the institution he serves and the local community.
May his life's story be an inspiration to our aspiring youth who hope to one day follow in Don's footsteps, working hard from the family farm to become the local bank president in their hometown.
We can all make a difference in our communities, like Don Bloomer, with a tireless work ethic and sheer resolve to make this region a better place to live.
My wife Cynthia and I deeply appreciate the loyal friendship of Don and Rhonda Bloomer, and we wish them the most joyful years of retirement in the years ahead.
