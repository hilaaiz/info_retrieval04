Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, in recognizing and commending Minister Belvin D. Ware, on his continued service as the newly appointed Pastor of Macon, Georgia's Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church.
