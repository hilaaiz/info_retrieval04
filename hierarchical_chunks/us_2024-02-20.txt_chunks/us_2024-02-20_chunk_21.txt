Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the more than 160,000 Black-owned employer businesses in the U.S. during National Entrepreneurship Week.
Black businessowners experience pervasive barriers to accessing capital--more than any other demographic.
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, two-thirds of Black employers seek financing to expand business operations, yet half Micael Habte is the owner of Upper Cup Coffee, an Eritrean-based coffee shop and wholesale coffee supplier located in the Old Towne East neighborhood.
Despite capital challenges due to COVID-19, today Micael is running two cafes, and a coffee kiosk, and has even expanded his roasting facility.
I'm proud of the fortitude businessowners like Micael have displayed, and I urge my colleagues to closely consider the challenges faced by Black entrepreneurs.
We must work together to build a stronger, more equitable economy for all.
