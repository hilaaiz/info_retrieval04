Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Geremiah Lofton--an intelligent, hardworking, and charismatic former member of my staff--who passed away on January 22, 2024.
A proud native of Port Arthur, Texas, Geremiah was the son of Gina and Kenneth Lofton, Sr.
He graduated from Memorial High School and went on to earn a bachelor's degree in business administration from HustonTillotson University in Austin, Texas, a Historically Black College.
Dedicated to public service, Geremiah served as an intern at the Department of State during college and moved to Washington, D.C., after graduation.
He joined the staff of the Committee on Homeland Security in 2019, first as an intern and later as a staff assistant and a committee clerk, while pursuing his master's in public administration at The George Washington University.
After earning his master's degree, Geremiah continued his congressional service by assisting the Select Committee on the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.
Geremiah was an exemplary and engaging member of my staff.
His work was excellent and his warm, kind personality won him many friends on the Committee and across Capitol Hill.
In 2022, Geremiah became special assistant and briefing book coordinator for the Secretary of Homeland Security, where he served for nearly 2 years as a valued member of the Department of Homeland Security team.
Geremiah was also active in the community, as a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, and Eastern Star Baptist Church in Port Arthur.
Geremiah left us too soon, and he will be greatly missed not only by his loved ones in Port Arthur but also his Capitol Hill family and friends.
We are better for having known Geremiah and are grateful for his many contributions to the Committee, the community, and our country.
My heartfelt sympathies and sincere condolences are with the Lofton family at this most difficult time.
