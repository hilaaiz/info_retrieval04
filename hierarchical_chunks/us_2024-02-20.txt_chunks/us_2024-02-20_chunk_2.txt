Mr. TURNER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the 75th anniversary of WHIO-TV, a leader in local news in my hometown of Dayton, Ohio.
WHIO was the first television station to begin broadcasting in Dayton, and has remained a CBS affiliate since that first broadcast.
For nearly their entire history, WHIO has aired on Channel 7 in the Miami Valley and residents have routinely tuned in to the `coverage they can count on.'
For three quarters of a century, WHIO has provided their audience with vital weather updates, local and national news coverage, and indepth reports from their investigative unit, the I-Team.
Our community also relies on Channel 7 for their sports coverage, faithfully airing both Bengals and Browns CBS games on Sundays.
The WHIO news team plays a vital role in keeping the Miami Valley informed and up to date on affairs that affect our everyday life.
The Storm Center 7 weather team prepares viewers for their day, but also provides lifesaving information when severe weather strikes.
The news team holds business and government accountable to the citizens they serve, as well as informing viewers of local and national news stories.
Local journalism is a critical part of our community and is instrumental to our democratic experiment.
WHIO embraces that responsibility and has established itself as a trusted news source for the Dayton area.
I join the Miami Valley in saying thank you for a steadfast 75 years, looking forward to tuning in for many more.
