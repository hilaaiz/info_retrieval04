Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of my friend, Bill Brand, Mayor.
Mayor Brand passed away on Friday, February 9th at home alongside friends and family.
He valiantly fought stage-four lung cancer over the past four and a half years, while remaining in office.
He survived his specific cancer longer than any other diagnosed in the United States.
Bill Brand was born in Dallas, Texas, and moved to the South Bay region of Los Angeles County in 1966.
He vividly remembered his first sight of the Seaside Lagoon and called it ``finding heaven.''
Bill dedicated his life to serving people.
He saw the need to champion access to open space for South Bay residents and created a non-profit organization in 2004, the South Bay Parkland Conservancy, which is dedicated to the restoration, preservation, and public use of coastal land resources in the South Bay.
This organization continues to grow and serve our coastal communities as a steward of our environment, carrying on Bill's legacy.
Bill Brand expanded on his work in public service, first as a Member of the Redondo Beach City Council, and finally as Mayor, a position he served until his last day.
He was a fierce advocate for many environmental and coastal priorities, and it was a great honor to work with him to champion these issues.
Bill is survived by his loving wife, Deirdre.
He served his community fervidly despite the difficulty of his condition.
His tremendous will was a demonstration of his love and dedication for his community.
He was a remarkable public servant, and it was a privilege to know him and call him a friend.
May his memory live on in his many contributions to the community.
