Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Woodside High School Men's Basketball Team from Newport News, Virginia on becoming the Virginia High School League's Class 5 State Champions.
On Saturday, March 9, 2024, the Woodside Wolverines won the Class 5 State Championship Game against the Lloyd C. Bird Skyhawks with a score of 53-33.
This is the second year in a row that Woodside High School has claimed a state championship title.
Led by Coach Stefan Welsh, the Wolverines closed their season with a record of 27 wins and 1 loss.
The Wolverines and Skyhawks battled throughout the first and second quarters for an advantage.
At the end of the second quarter, though, the Wolverines went on a 9-0 run positioning themselves into a 23-15 lead by halftime.
The Wolverines then expanded their lead in the second half creating as much as a 23-point lead on their opponents.
The Wolverines were able to defend this lead throughout the rest of the game and ultimately win the championship.
