Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the lives of fallen officers Allen Lee Harmon and Otis Lee Robison of the Lincoln Police Department.
November 16th will mark the 50th anniversary of Officer Harmon and Officer Robison's paying the ultimate sacrifice while in the line of duty.
On November 16, 1974, the two men tragically lost their lives.
On November 15, 2024, the City of Lincoln will hold a remembrance event at Lincoln City Hall to honor the lives of Officer Harmon and Officer Robison.
