Mr. WALBERG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Nina Plaushin, Vice President of Federal Affairs and Regulatory Strategy at ITC, the largest independent transmission company in the U.S. Nina is retiring after more than 25 years of dedicated service, managing the twists and turns of congressional and regulatory policy.
During this time, Nina was known as a leader in the industry, always to be consulted for her expertise and deep breadth of knowledge.
She has served various roles within industry groups, including as President of the WIRES Coalition, President of Americans for Clean Energy Board Grid Board and Chair the EEI Energy Delivery Executive Advisory Committee.
Before her illustrious work at ITC, she served as Legislative Director for Congressman Thomas C. McMillen, another figure larger than life--quite literally.
Nina's leaving a lasting legacy at ITC and on American energy more broadly.
