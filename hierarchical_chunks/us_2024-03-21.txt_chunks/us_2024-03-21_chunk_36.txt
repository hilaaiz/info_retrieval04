Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a community leader and devoted public servant.
W.B. Wilson--the ``Workhorse of Williamsburg County''--transitioned from this life on March 15, 2024.
His rich sense of humor, wisdom, and optimistic spirit will be sorely missed.
Councilman Wilson dedicated his life to serving others.
He was elected to the Williamsburg County Council in 1994 and immediately got to work improving the county's roads, many of them rural roads that had never been paved.
W.B.'s proudest achievement was improving access to clean water in the county.
After his father died from kidney disease directly connected to unsafe drinking water, W.B. made it his mission to ensure others in his community did not suffer the same fate.
As a result of various USDA grants and loans he helped secure, Williamsburg County now has abundant access to clean drinking water.
It was through his efforts to improve the essential infrastructure of Williamsburg County and his various other talents that W.B. earned his reputation as a natural leader.
In addition to his work on the Williamsburg County Council, W.B. was actively involved in the South Carolina Association of Counties, the Williamsburg County Billing Committee, the Community Emergency Response Team, the Hemingway High School band and athletic booster club, and many other organizations.
He also served on the boards of various community organizations and volunteered as a firefighter.
Left to cherish his memory are his wife, Verlena Dicker Wilson, daughter, P. Jeanette Simon, son, Andre Wilson, brother, Samuel C. Wilson and sisters, Fannie Smith and Valtricia Cunningham.
