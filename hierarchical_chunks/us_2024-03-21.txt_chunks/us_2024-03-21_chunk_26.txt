Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Teresa Darlene McDowney, who passed away on Thursday, February 22, 2024.
She was born on July 15, 1971.
She was employed with the King George Sheriff's Office as an Animal Control Officer from 2013 to 2020 and was employed with the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Office at the time of her passing.
While with the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Office, she served as the Animal Shelter Manager, Animal Control Officer, and Animal Advocate.
In every position, Teresa was a dedicated worker.
Even when she was not working with the Sheriff's Office, she would often answer text messages about dangerous dogs in the middle of the night and help the community with animal related matters.
Teresa was often described as a sweet and kind lady, often assisting her family, friends, and the community.
While Teresa was a genuinely kind and sweet natured person, she was also very straightforward-- leaving little room for misinterpretation.
If Teresa said it, she meant it.
She was a protector of her family and what was right.
Teresa leaves to cherish her precious memory, her husband, Kevin McDowney of Colonial Beach, VA, and son, Nathaniel Pittman of Williamsburg, VA.
