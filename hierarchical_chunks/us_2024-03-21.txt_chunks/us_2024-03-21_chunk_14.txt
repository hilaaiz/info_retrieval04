Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Sol Ortega was born in Peru and migrated to Kissimmee when she was seven years old.
Her parents, Esther Rivasplata and David Ortega, created a life in Central Florida where they contributed to the growing tourism economy.
Her family's immigration journey and sacrifices inspired Sol to pursue a career in public service to give back to the community she grew up in.
While she was young, she participated in community service projects through the local YMCA, becoming a mentor for Bookmark Buddies through the Education Foundation of Osceola County, and, while in high school, volunteered in Teen Court, a program to divert less serious juvenile cases away from the more formal Juvenile Court.
During her time at Professional and Technical High School, she enrolled in the dual enrollment program where she attended Valencia College.
Thanks to this program, she was able to earn her associate degree and high school diploma at the same time.
She then moved to Gainesville, Florida, to attain her bachelor's degree in political science and Latin American Studies--making her the first in her family to graduate from a four-year institution.
During her time at the University of Florida, Sol advocated for immigrant issues and completed a fellowship in the Florida State Capitol.
Sol then moved to Washington, D.C., to pursue an internship in Congress and worked in service of Florida's Ninth Congressional District, providing vital support for constituents, including during the aftermath.
Sol now works at the White House Office of Public Engagement, conducting outreach to the broader Latino community.
