Mrs. Bush has received numerous awards to recognize her accomplishments as Head Coach.
In 2018, she was named the Cal-Hi Sports Division V State Coach of the Year.
Two years later, she earned the CIF Central Section National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) Coach of the Year and was nominated for Federation's State NFHS Coach of the Year.
This season, 
Mrs. Bush has been honored as the Tri-County Conference Co-Coach of the Year.
In addition to her achievements on the court, 
Mrs. Bush has worked hard to ensure the Golden Bears are active in the Central Valley community.
Over the years, the team has put together several donation drives to support local residents, including drives to support the families of fallen firefighters and police officers.
The team also volunteers every year at the Episcopal Church of the Savior Parish Soup Kitchen.
During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the team donated food items to the Kings Pantry to give back to local families.
The success of the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball Team is a true testament to 
Mrs. Bush's character and dedication to the program.
While she will be missed as Head Coach, I am confident that her leadership will have a lasting impact on the Golden Bears for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House dedication to the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball Team and the Central Valley.
I wish her a happy and well-deserved retirement.
