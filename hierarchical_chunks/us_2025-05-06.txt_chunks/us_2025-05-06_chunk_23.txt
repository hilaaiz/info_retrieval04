Ms. Abderholden's advocacy brought mental health training into our schools, ensured screenings for individuals entering the justice system, and reformed civil commitment laws to emphasize voluntary treatment.
She expanded crisis and early intervention services, championed a more diverse mental health workforce, and worked to strengthen housing and community-based support services.
Her compassion extended to her home where 
Ms. Abderholden and her family fostered children with disabilities and youth aging out of foster care, offering stability and care when it was most needed.
On behalf of myself and countless Minnesotans, I offer my gratitude to 
Ms. Abderholden for her decades of hard work and service.
