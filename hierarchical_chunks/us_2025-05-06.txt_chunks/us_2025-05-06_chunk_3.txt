Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Kim A. Wilcox on his tenure as the ninth chancellor of UC Riverside.
Since 2013, he has led the university through a remarkable transformation, turning UCR into a national model for student success and social mobility.
Dr. Wilcox's vision brought bold expansion in research, enrollment, graduation rates, and campus development.
He guided the creation of the Schools of Medicine and Public Policy, grew enrollment by over 25 percent, and championed faculty diversity.
His efforts resulted in over 2 million square feet of new academic, residential, and dining space.
A passionate advocate for access and equity, Chancellor Wilcox has made UC Riverside a hub of scientific innovation and has brought future innovators to the Inland Empire.
Chancellor Wilcox has been a partner and friend to my office during his tenure, and I am proud to have partnered with him to secure grants to further the reach and impact of UC Riverside.
We have collaborated to bring grant money from the National Science Foundation, funds from the Chips and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act back to UC Riverside.
While we will miss his unwavering commitment to academic excellence and thoughtful stewardship, perhaps what many of us will miss most is the sound of his truly infectious laugh echoing throughout the room.
It always had a way of brightening even the toughest days.
Happy retirement to Chancellor Wilcox and go Highlanders.
