Mr. AGUILAR.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 100th birthday of 
Ms. Trinidad ``Trini'' Gomez, a constituent and friend who has led an incredible life and made our community better and brighter for everyone who crossed her path.
Born in Gallup, New Mexico, in 1925 as the eldest of 12 children, Trini was no stranger to hard work.
From learning English so she could attend school, to joining the railroad industry alongside other women during World War II, to becoming the sole breadwinner for her household following her husband's passing, Trini Gomez never met a challenge she could not overcome.
As a San Bernardino resident.
Trini has had a profound impact on the Inland Empire's culture and history.
In 1986, Trini and her late husband, Graciano Gomez, founded the Inland Empire Hispanic News, a newspaper that aimed to advocate for the greater Hispanic community in the region.
The publication quickly became the largest-circulated English-language community newspaper in the Inland Empire and had a lasting impact on the community.
The Inland Empire Hispanic News provided a platform for Hispanic voices, shed light on important political and activist issues and recognized the achievements and contributions of the Hispanic community.
After 23 years of service, the archive of the publication became an indispensable record of Mexican American history in the Inland Empire.
Today, I wish Trini Gomez a happy birthday and thank her for her dedication to and love for the Inland Empire and the people who call it home.
I hope all of us can pay tribute to her achievements and the profound impact she has had on countless people.
May the coming year bring Trini good health, happiness and time spent with loved ones.
