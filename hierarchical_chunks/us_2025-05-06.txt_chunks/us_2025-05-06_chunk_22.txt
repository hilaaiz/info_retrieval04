Ms. MORRISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sue Abderholden for her decades of tireless service and steadfast commitment to Minnesotans living with disabilities and mental illnesses.
For the past 24 years, 
Ms. Abderholden has served as Executive Director of the Minnesota chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
Under her leadership, our state has become more compassionate, more informed, and more responsive to the needs of those facing mental health challenges.
She played a central role in passing over two dozen laws that expanded access to care and improved how we support people with mental illnesses.
