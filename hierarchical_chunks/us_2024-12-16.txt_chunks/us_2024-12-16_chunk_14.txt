Mrs. Hines can best be described by all who know her as devoted, humble, and ready to act.
Her devotion throughout her career has inspired many people and enriched the lives of countless constituents.
I want to thank Michelle for her work that has put the needs of others first and give recognition to her tenured career as she enjoys retirement spending more time with her husband, Kevin, and daughter, Rachel.
