and honoring the department's rich history.
Beyond his scouting achievements, Matthew is a remarkable student.
He has consistently made the honor roll ten times and has been recognized on the Superintendent's List five times.
As a standout soccer player, he has lettered three times at Delsea Regional High School and has earned a spot on the All-County team for all three years.
Looking ahead, Matthew has clear and ambitious goals: he plans to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering and eventually establish his own engineering firm.
In a beautiful full circle moment, inspired by the tremendous support he received from firefighters during his project, Matthew is determined to serve his community as a volunteer firefighter.
I am confident that Matthew will excel in any path he chooses, and I eagerly anticipate the significant impact he will make in our world.
May God bless Matthew and God bless our United States.
