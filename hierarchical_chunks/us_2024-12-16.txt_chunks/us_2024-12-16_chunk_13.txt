Mr. GUTHRIE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michelle Hines on her retirement from 33 years of working in community service with the Barren River Area Development District (BRADD).
A Logan County native, Michelle was born, raised, and resides in Auburn, Kentucky.
After graduating from Logan County High School and Western Kentucky University, Michelle's first job out of college was with the Barren River Area Development District.
In her tenure, which spans over three decades, Michelle has been a faithful servant to her community, advocating and supporting citizens throughout the region she oversees.
She has been part of many critical initiatives including supporting the 2021 Tornado Relief fund, countless food drives, and BRADD's Veterans Directed Care Services expansion.
