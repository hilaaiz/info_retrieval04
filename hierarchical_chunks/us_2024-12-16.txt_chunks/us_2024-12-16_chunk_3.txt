Mr. NICKEL.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, a remarkable North Carolinian who has significantly impacted both the digital world and our local communities.
Raised in Greenville, MrBeast has become one of the most influential figures in digital media while embodying the values of entrepreneurship, innovation, and philanthropy that drive North Carolina forward.
MrBeast's ventures, including the Team Trees and Team Seas campaigns, have drawn attention to critical environmental causes.
Team Trees raised over $24 million to plant more than 24 million trees worldwide, and Team Seas collected over $30 million to remove 30 million pounds of trash from our oceans.
His commitment to giving back is also seen through the MrBeast Philanthropy channel, which has delivered over a million meals to those in need across eastern North Carolina.
These efforts have not only rallied millions of supporters but have set a new standard for global activism.
With over 330 million YouTube subscribers and millions more on other platforms, MrBeast has turned his success into an opportunity to bring industry, jobs, and creativity to our state.
I honor Jimmy Donaldson today not only for his entrepreneurial success but for his philanthropic endeavors and his efforts to create a more connected and inspired community.
Please join me in recognizing Jimmy Donaldson for his contributions to North Carolina and beyond.
