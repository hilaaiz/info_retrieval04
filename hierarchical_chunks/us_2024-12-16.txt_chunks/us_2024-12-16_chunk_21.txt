Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Brian Johnson and Caroline Reynolds on the occasion of their engagement.
It is with great pleasure and excitement that I share the wonderful news.
Brian, a steadfast friend and dedicated professional, has been a true partner in our work with Veterans Guardian, helping countless veterans across the Nation achieve their well-deserved disability rating increases.
Fate brought Brian and his incredible fiance, Caroline Reynolds, together at the U.S. Open during an event hosted by our mutual friend and colleague, Congressman Richard Hudson.
Their story reached a beautiful milestone over the Thanksgiving holiday on November 26, when Brian proposed to Caroline in her charming hometown of Nacogdoches, Texas.
The engagement was a heartwarming celebration, surrounded by family, friends, and joyous festivities.
Love and marriage represent the joining of two hearts and lives, built on a foundation of trust, respect, and shared dreams.
Brian and Caroline embody the promise to stand together through life's joys and challenges, growing stronger as individuals and as partners.
Their love story is a testament to the beauty of finding someone who not only inspires you but also walks beside you every step of the way.
