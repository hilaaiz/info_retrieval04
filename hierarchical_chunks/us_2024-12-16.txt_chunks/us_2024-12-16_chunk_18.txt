Mr. PANETTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the extraordinary career and service of Mary L. Adams, who has tirelessly dedicated herself to the people.
Today, at her last meeting of the Big Sur Multi-Agency Advisory Council, and upon her well-earned retirement, it is fitting to honor her leadership and enduring contributions to our community.
Mary L. Adams has served with distinction as the Fifth District Supervisor for the County of Monterey, skillfully navigating numerous complex challenges with compassion and foresight.
Her accomplishments exemplify a lifetime of hard work and community dedication.
Mary played a vital role in leading Monterey County through major emergencies, including multiple atmospheric river events and wildfires such as the Soberanes, River, Carmel, Dolan, and Palo Colorado fires.
Her leadership in organizing efforts, like the Big Sur Helicopter Commodity Drop, provided critical support to isolated communities, ensuring the safety and resilience of residents during these crises.
She has been instrumental in addressing key local challenges, including coordination during the Pfeiffer Bridge repairs, implementing safety measures along Highway 1 near Point Lobos State Park and the Bixby Creek Bridge, and overseeing the Scenic Road Carmel Lagoon Environmental Impact Report.
Each of these efforts has significantly contributed to the preservation of Monterey County's natural beauty and infrastructure.
Mary's leadership in infrastructure improvements has also been transformative.
She spearheaded upgrades to Carmel Valley Road and played a key role as Chair of the Carmel Valley Road Advisory Committee, culminating in the finalization of the Carmel Valley Road and Laureles Grade Roundabout project.
A steadfast advocate for housing solutions, Mary worked tirelessly to update the Vacation Rental Ordinance, protect neighborhood character, and champion sustainable, long-term housing initiatives.
Under her leadership, the County invested in the Monterey Bay Economic Partnership Housing Trust Fund, unlocking millions in funding for affordable housing projects.
She also supported innovative publicprivate partnerships and employer-sponsored housing initiatives, while prioritizing the community's best interests in updating the Housing Element.
During the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mary provided steady and compassionate leadership, ensuring critical resources reached those in need.
Her advocacy extended to sustainable water solutions, supporting the passage of Measure J for public water ownership and hosting Regional Water Forums to engage the community on pressing water challenges.
Throughout her tenure, Mary has exemplified transparency and accountability in governance.
Her instrumental role in the hiring of key county officials, including the County Administrative Officer and County Counsel, has strengthened the foundation for Monterey County's future success.
