Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding class of interns who supported my office during the Fall 2024 term.
Whether they were working in the bustling U.S. Capitol or amongst the cornfields of Illinois, their contributions to Illinois' 13th Congressional District have made a significant impact.
In my Washington Office, I was honored to work alongside Daryl Salinas, Wedad Osman, Stella Linn, and Sophia Hinich.
These four interns have worked tirelessly to support my staff, skillfully navigating the complexities of working on Capitol Hill.
They have been instrumental in managing direct correspondence with our constituents, drafting numerous memos and letters, and assisting with in-depth policy research.
I am especially grateful for their work in preparing my office to transition to the 119th Congress.
Back in Illinois, I was honored to work with Avery Martin in my Champaign Office.
Her commitment to constituent service by assisting my casework team has been tremendous, and I applaud her for the dedication she showed to the people of Central and Southern Illinois while also being a full-time student at the University.
The impact that these five individuals left in my office will be felt for years to come as we transition to the 119th Congress, and we will be very sad to say farewell to this spectacular group of interns.
I thank Daryl, Wedad, Stella, Sophia, and Avery for their service.
I wish them all the best as they continue their professional and academic journeys.
