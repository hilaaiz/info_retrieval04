Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the exceptional work of the Marine Corps Attack Drone Team based in Quantico, Virginia, for their groundbreaking achievement in conducting the first-ever armed First-Person View (FPV) kinetic strike demonstration by the Marines in the continental United States.
This milestone event took place during a live-fire exercise on April 25, 2025.
These Devil Dogs used a leading-edge FPV drone integrated with an anti-personnel fragmentation payload, which can support other modular payloads, which exhibited the flexible and scalable solution in contemporary warfare our military urgently requires.
The results were impressive.
The drone engaged and neutralized every target in the strike zone, illustrating not only the technical effectiveness of the platform, but its immense strategic value in highrisk, operational environments.
This capability comes at a time when global conflict is redefining how wars are fought.
Today, over 70 percent of the causalities in Ukraine are from these types of drones.
The recent coordinated drone strikes carried out by Ukraine against Russian military infrastructure are a clear signal: low-cost, highly adaptable drones are reshaping the modern battlefield.
America must be prepared.
This demonstration by our Marines shows we are not just responding, but leading.
As we scale up our investment in unmanned systems, we must prioritize solutions that are fast, flexible, and affordable.
By equipping our Armed forces with reliable, mission-ready tools that can be rapidly deployed and continuously improved, we will maintain both deterrence and dominance.
The Marines at Quantico are proving that innovation doesn't require complexity or high cost; rather, it requires bold thinking and dedicated execution.
After 25 years in the Army, I recognize the uniquely critical importance of innovation, readiness, and a steadfast commitment to success.
These Marines modeled all of that and more.
