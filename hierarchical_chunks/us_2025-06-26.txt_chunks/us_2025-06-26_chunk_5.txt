Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a student from my district, 
Ms. Alana Karam, on receiving this year's Broward County League of Cities' Scholarship.
This prestigious scholarship is awarded each year to a high school senior who has demonstrated a deep investment in public service and intends on leading a life focused on it.
Alana is a recent graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where she has distinguished herself in our community through her passion for law, public policy, and civic engagement.
Her accomplishments speak volumes, not only about her talents, but also about her character and drive.
For her deep intellect and track record of leadership in and out of the classroom, Alana has received well-deserved local and national recognition.
She earned first place in the Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy Essay Contest and third place in the Federal Bar Association's National High School Essay Contest--both highly competitive national honors--and had her Capstone research project published in the Journal of Student Research, a rare accomplishment at the high school level.
Beyond her academic achievements, Alana has been an active member of DECA and several honor societies, and she has sought real-world experience to deepen her understanding of the justice system.
During an internship at the Broward County Public Defender's Office, she encountered firsthand the power of advocacy, and the role reaffirmed her desire to dedicate her life to serving her community.
