Mr. CALVERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Mr. Kiya Batmanglidj on the occasion of his retirement from Federal service.
Over the past 21 years, Kiya has honorably served the United States in both military and civilian service.
Kiya started his career in public service as an Army noncommissioned officer, serving as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division from 1986 to 1989.
He was also voluntarily recalled to active duty in support.
For the last ten years, Kiya has served on the House Appropriations Committee.
He started with the Surveys and Investigations (S&I) staff where he served as the branch chief for the defense portfolio.
He then served briefly on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee working the VA portfolio before transitioning to the Defense Subcommittee in 2018.
On the Defense Subcommittee, while in the House Minority, Kiya managed the Army, Defense Wide, and Defense Health accounts.
When the Republicans assumed the House Majority, Kiya oversaw the Military Personnel account and the international security cooperation accounts.
Kiya considers his greatest Committee accomplishment to be securing the funding for a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted personnel starting in 2025, the largest increase in over 40 years.
Kiya's contributions to America's warfighters will endure long after his tenure in the House of Representatives comes to a close, and I know he will continue to do great work to advance our national defense.
On behalf of a grateful Nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Kiya for his service to our country.
We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
