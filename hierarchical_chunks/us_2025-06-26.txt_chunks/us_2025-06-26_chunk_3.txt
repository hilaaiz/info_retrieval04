Ms. SANCHEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of Yoshio ``Yosh'' Nakamura, and to honor his service to our country as a Staff Sergeant in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
Born in California in 1925, Yosh and his family were forced from their El Monte farm into the Gila River internment camp after the outbreak of World War II.
Despite the violation of his rights, when Army recruiters arrived at the camp looking for volunteers in 1944, 18-year-old Yosh answered ``yes'' to serve.
As a member of the highly decorated all-Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team, Yosh served in the European Theater, participating in the assault on Mount Folgorito that led to further Allied victories in Italy.
The 442nd became one of the most highly decorated units in U.S. military history.
As Yosh said, ``We couldn't hide our ancestry.
We had Japanese faces, but we had American hearts.''
After his discharge in 1946, Yosh used the GI Bill to earn a bachelor's and master's degree in fine art from USC and then dedicated his career to education.
He taught art at Whittier High School and became the first professor hired by Rio Hondo College.
Yosh and his late wife, Grace, became beloved members of the Whittier community.
I thank 
Mr. Nakamura for his service, and wish him a happy 100th birthday.
