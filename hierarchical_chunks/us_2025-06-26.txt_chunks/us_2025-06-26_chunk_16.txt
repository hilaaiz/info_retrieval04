Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable partnership of Annette and Myron Greenbaum of South Orange, New Jersey, who will celebrate their 60th wedding anniversary on July 4, 2025.
They first met on a group ski trip: Annette was there with a friend, Myron with the group.
Their first date came shortly after, when Annette had an extra theater ticket and invited Myron to join.
Neither remembers the name of the play, but both remember it led to the next meeting.
Their second date was a Marx Brothers movie, an early sign that laughter would become one of the cornerstones of their life together.
They were married on July 4, 1965, in a small ceremony at a temple on Central Park West, followed by a luncheon at the Delmonico Hotel, a classic Manhattan venue that's part of the city's long history.
In the early years of their marriage, Annette and Myron lived in a Brooklyn Heights brownstone, enjoying walks along the promenade, afternoons at museums, and everything the city had to offer.
Eventually, they made their home in South Orange, New Jersey, where they raised two children and have lived in the same house for more than forty years.
Along the way, they opened their home to many beloved cats--each one a part of the family.
Today, they are the proud grandparents of three.
When asked the secret to a long marriage.
Annette doesn't give a grand declaration, just a simple truth learn to accept each other's quirks.
It is my privilege to recognize Annette and Myron's 60 years of marriage.
Their story is a reminder that the best partnerships are built not just on love, but on humor, patience, and a shared life welllived.
