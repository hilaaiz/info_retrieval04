Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues to join me in commending these Marines for their bravery, professionalism, and pioneering accomplishments with respect to operational drone warfare.
Their service is indicative of an evolving, strong, and adaptable U.S. military and I hope they serve as an inspiration to all Americans.
