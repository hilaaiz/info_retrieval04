I have continued that conversation in a succession of farming policy information suppers.
There is a keen desire among farmers to take advantage of ELMs; what they are overwhelmingly asking for, though, is clarity about what to go for and when to go for it to achieve the most successful, sustainable and profitable farm business.
My hon.
Friend is truly privileged to represent such a beautiful part of England.
We are collaborating with stakeholders to ensure that our schemes work for them.
We regularly communicate with them through the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair’s farming blog, by meeting them at trade shows, through ministerial visits, and through stakeholder organisations such as the National Farmers Union, the Country Land and Business Association and the Tenant Farmers Association.
We are also providing free business support to farmers and land managers in England through the future farming resilience fund.
Grants and schemes for farmers are published through our single funding page.
