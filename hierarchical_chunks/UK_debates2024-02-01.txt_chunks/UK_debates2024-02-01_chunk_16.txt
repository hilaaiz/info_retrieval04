The hon.
Lady is right that this is matter of huge public concern, and understandably so.
The Government worked very hard during the pandemic to ensure that support was provided, but clearly where people have taken advantage of a system, that must be pursued.
That is why we are looking at the fraud strategy, for example, and the economic crime plan part 2.
We will continue to drive forward to see what further action can be taken.
Every day, older and vulnerable people are preyed upon by fraudsters and scammers, be it online, by phone or on the doorstep.
Will my hon.
Friend reassure my constituents and the country that the Conservative Government, the police and the criminal justice system will do all they can to bring those immoral criminals to justice?
Yes, I can.
My hon.
Friend is right to draw attention to this, as people being taken advantage of is one of the great issues of our age.
It happens to members of society of all kinds, but particularly to those who are elderly and vulnerable.
Work continues on a number of sector charters, which have been successful in bringing forward positive outcomes.
For example, 870 million scam texts have been blocked.
We have taken forward work on the Online Safety Act 2023, as well as the charters I referred to, but I assure my hon.
Friend we will continue to see what more can be done.
