Does my right hon.
and learned Friend agree that the leaking of Law Officer advice for political or any other purposes is not only a breach of the very important Law Officers’ convention respecting the confidentiality of legal advice, but damaging to the public interest and contrary to the rule of law?
My right hon.
and learned Friend makes a characteristically significant intervention.
Having served as both Solicitor General and Attorney General, he will know very well the importance of the Law Officers’ convention to the working of Government.
Legal professional privilege generally is a very important construct and something on which the client relationship relies.
In Government it is, if anything, even more significant, and when Law Officers’ advice is leaked it has a chilling effect on our ability to provide free, frank and honest advice to the rest of Government.
That is something I wholeheartedly deplore, and I agree with everything my right hon.
and learned Friend said.
