Best wishes on your birthday, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Last week was Neighbourhood Policing Week.
I was able to join the local Aldridge and Brownhills neighbourhood teams out in the community.
Will my right hon.
Friend join me in thanking our local teams for all they do?
Does she agree that central to neighbourhood policing is neighbourhood policing hubs?
That is why I continue to campaign against the proposed closure of Aldridge police station—and with only a few months left of the west midlands police and crime commissioner role, there should be a moratorium on any closure.
I congratulate my right hon.
Friend on getting her concerns on the record.
Since 2010, our communities have become safer on roughly the same resources.
Taking out online fraud, we have, in effect, halved crime: violent crime is down 51%; neighbourhood crime, including robbery and theft, is down 48%.
I shall ensure that the Home Secretary has heard what she has said.
