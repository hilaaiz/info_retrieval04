Last week’s report from the Government’s environmental watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection, was a damning indictment of the Government’s record.
It said they were “largely off track”, with just four of the 40 targets being achieved.
When it comes to the environmental land management schemes, can the Minister tell the House just how much environmental improvement they have helped farmers to deliver so far?
I think that two months into a 25-year plan is probably too soon to judge that plan.
We are making huge strides with our stakeholders and farmers, who are working up and down the country to improve the environment.
They have spent generations creating that environment.
We should celebrate what they have achieved, and we should encourage them to do more.
That is what the sustainable farming incentive is designed to do, and what the scheme is delivering.
