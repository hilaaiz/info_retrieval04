The Minister rightly says that we owe them a debt of gratitude, but this is more than that.
It is a debt of honour.
Can we ensure that, both in our administration and in our relationship with Pakistan, we do everything to deliver on that debt of honour as quickly as possible?
We certainly will.
It is important to mention that the Government of Pakistan have often been the subject of questions in relation to ARAP over the past year or so.
In my experience, they have been incredibly co-operative.
We are hugely grateful to them for that.
The limit on the speed of flow is not any problem with the Government of Pakistan, but the challenge of getting people out of Afghanistan.
The reality is that,  no matter how many decisions we review and no matter how many additional people we add as eligible for the scheme, there is a limit to how fast we can move people over the border into Pakistan.
That will take time.
