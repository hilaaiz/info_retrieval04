I thank the Minister for that very long response.
Peatlands in Northern Ireland are extremely important.
They absorb water and moisture and improve the habitat.
This question is as important in this House as it is to us in Northern Ireland.
Given that the Northern Ireland Assembly will hopefully be up and running again, will the Minister have discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister, to ensure that we can work together for the betterment of all?
