Peatlands are such an important habitat, so it is important that we work together.
That is why we are putting huge amounts of money into restoring peatlands in the uplands and the lowlands, and we have just increased our sustainable farming incentive payments for that.
Farmers can get more than £900 a hectare to start to re-wet peat.
