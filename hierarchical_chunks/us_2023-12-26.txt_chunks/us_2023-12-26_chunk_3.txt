Ms. JAYAPAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Northeastern University on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of establishing a campus in the City.
In 2013, Northeastern opened its doors in Seattle with two programs, 32 students and 500 square feet of space in South Lake Union, A decade later, the campus has nearly 1,800 graduates, a dozen graduate-degree programs, hundreds of industry and community partnerships, and is among the largest of Northeastern's 13 global locations.
Northeastern has worked to bring programs in high-growth fields to the Pacific Northwest, such as computer science, data analytics, global studies and project management.
Each program is designed to help students thrive in careers through classroom learning and real-world experiences.
On the occasion of this milestone, I am proud to recognize Northeastern University as a partner and valued member of the Seattle community.
