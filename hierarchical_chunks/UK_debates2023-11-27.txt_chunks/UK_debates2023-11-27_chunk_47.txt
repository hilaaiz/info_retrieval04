I was incredibly relieved to get my constituent’s family, 13 of them, across the border and home through Egypt.
I pay tribute to the staff in the consular section who supported them, but the support was patchy and the cost of them returning was over £5,000 on commercial flights.
What more can the Minister do to supercharge that consular support and to reimburse those families who had to come home on commercial flights?
Would he consider meeting my constituent’s family to learn the lessons that they have experienced of having to flee in the middle of a bombardment?
