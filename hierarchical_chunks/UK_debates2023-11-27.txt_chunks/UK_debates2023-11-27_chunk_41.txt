I welcome the Minister’s words that the Foreign Secretary is exploring other crossings being opened to get aid into the south.
It is essential that that happens.
If the hostilities resume, as most people expect, what representations are the British Government making to try to stop them moving south, where almost 2 million are displaced and there is nowhere else to go?
