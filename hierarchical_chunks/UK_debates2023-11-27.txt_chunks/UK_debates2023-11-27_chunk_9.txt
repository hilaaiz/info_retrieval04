Last week, a woman and a man died while attempting to cross the channel in a small boat; others in their group were hospitalised for hypothermia.
Despite the clear risks, over 400 people in nine boats were detected crossing the channel in the past seven days.
They clearly felt there was no other choice.
The lack of safe and legal routes is putting people at risk.
Will the Immigration Minister consider a humanitarian visa, as the Red Cross has recommended?
All of us across the House abhor the deaths of individuals in the channel, and we are working closely with the French authorities to investigate the circumstances of those individuals’ deaths.
But those individuals, like anyone seeking to cross the channel, are coming from a place of evident safety.
They are departing from France.
They are in absolutely no danger.
They are in a country with a fully functioning asylum system of its own.
There is no excuse for those people breaking into our country, putting themselves in the hands of people smugglers.
We should be united in trying to deter that.
On the hon.
Lady’s second question about safe and legal routes to the UK, she knows that we have issued more than half a million humanitarian visas since 2015—more than at any time in the history of this country.
If she wants to do more, after the debate she should go straight back to the SNP Government and ask them to pull their weight and provide more safe spaces for asylum seekers and refugees back in Scotland.
