Given that, shockingly, the average time it takes for a crime to be charged has trebled since 2016, will the Secretary of State embrace the Police Federation’s “Simplify DG6” campaign and scrap the redaction rules his Government introduced in 2020, in order to cut bureaucracy, get cases to the Crown Prosecution Service quicker, and free up officers’ time to be out fighting crime?
We are actively working with the CPS to simplify and speed up this process.
I will of course look at the proposals put forward, because we want police officers out in their communities on the beat and tackling crime, rather than doing paperwork—important though that is.
The police report a 25% increase in shoplifting in recent months.
There is much evidence, as the Home Secretary will be aware, that organised criminal gangs go into shops to try to steal as much as they can and target shop workers.
As we approach Christmas, what assurance can the Home Secretary provide to shop workers—not just at Christmas, but across the year—that he will start dealing with these gangs and start realising that all retail crime is a problem in this country that needs tackling?
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to highlight this issue.
It is one that we take seriously through Operation Pegasus.
We are working through the leadership of the police and crime commissioner for Sussex on this very issue.
No doubt either the Policing Minister, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp)  or I will have the opportunity to update the House on this work as it progresses.
