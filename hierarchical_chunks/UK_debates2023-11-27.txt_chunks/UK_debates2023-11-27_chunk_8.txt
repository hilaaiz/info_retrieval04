Since the previous Home Secretary was removed from her post, I think it is fair to say that the Immigration Minister has become a law unto himself.
First, he briefed the media that he has been instructing the Prime Minister to tear up all our legal obligations to fix the unfixable Rwanda policy.
Then he set himself on a collision course with his new Home Secretary by appearing to bet the house on the Rwanda flights taking off.
To add insult to injury, he went behind his new boss’s back to present his laundry list to the Prime Minister, including a cap on social care visas and abolishing the shortage occupation list.
Does the Immigration Minister have any respect whatsoever for the authority of the new Home Secretary?
Given that he is said to be on resignation watch, will he confirm that he will resign if his proposals are rejected?
Once again, we heard absolutely nothing from the Opposition about what they would actually do.
The sad truth is that they have complete disdain for the British public.
They do not appreciate that the public that we are sent here to represent demand that we reduce the levels of both legal and illegal migration.
The Home Secretary and I will do absolutely everything in our power to achieve that.
We are working closely with the Prime Minister, and we will set out further plans in due course.
But the public watching the debate should be very clear: if they share our determination to tackle small boats or to reduce the numbers arriving in this country legally, they have only the Conservative Party to support.
