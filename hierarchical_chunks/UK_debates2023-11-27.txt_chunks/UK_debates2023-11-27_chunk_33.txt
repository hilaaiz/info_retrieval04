I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her comments.
She is entirely right that Israel must comply with international humanitarian law, and must not only prosecute but punish those who have been involved in settler violence.
The Government are delivering tough messages to all sides in this dreadful conflict, and we will continue to do so.
