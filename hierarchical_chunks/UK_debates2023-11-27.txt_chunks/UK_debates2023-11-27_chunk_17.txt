It is a privilege to take on this important role.
I pass on my thanks to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Jess Phillips)  for her dedication and commitment.
I am looking forward to getting to work.
A shocking new study has found that domestic abusers are controlling the finances of more than 5 million women in the UK.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
The Government have turned a blind eye to this issue for more than a decade, so what steps is the Minister taking today to tackle economic abuse?
The hon.
Lady and I have worked together a lot on domestic abuse since we were elected.
She will know that economic abuse is basically a derivative of coercive control, which Clare Wade KC, in her review of domestic homicide, says underpins almost all domestic abuse.
Tomorrow the Criminal Justice Bill has its Second Reading in the House.
The Bill will see serious coercive control offences placed under the multi-agency public protection arrangements and offenders placed on the violent sexual and terrorist offender register.
What recent assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the Supreme Court judgment of 15 November 2023 on the Rwanda relocation scheme.
The Rwanda scheme remains an important part of our response to illegal migration and people smuggling.
We will continue to negotiate with the Government of Rwanda on a treaty that will be  underpinned by domestic law so that the Rwanda scheme will join the other effective parts of our response in stopping the boats.
