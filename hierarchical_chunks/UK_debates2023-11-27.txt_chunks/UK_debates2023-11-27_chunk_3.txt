I thank my hon.
Friend for the work he has done in this area, including with his private Members’ Bill.
He is absolutely right that the rural communities of this country need to be supported, and they will be.
Driving down rural crime is an important area of work and we have provided £200,000 of funding to help set up the NRCU.
My hon.
Friend and I, and others in this House, understand the terrible impact this has, and we will continue to work with the rural police forces to drive down rural crime.
