I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He is a tireless campaigner on this issue.
I completely accept the need for a new police funding formula.
We have been working on it extremely hard, with colleagues across government.
I hope to have something further to say on the topic shortly, but in the meantime we are getting as much money as we can to frontline policing.
This year, we have an extra £550 million going to frontline policing and £330 million going to support the police pay rise, which makes £880 million extra for policing this year.
