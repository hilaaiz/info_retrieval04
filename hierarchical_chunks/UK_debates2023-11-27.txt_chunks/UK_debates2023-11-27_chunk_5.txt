I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting this vile type of criminality, which targets the young and the most vulnerable.
As part of our fight against county lines we are investing up to £145 million in our county lines programme, and since it was launched in 2019 police activity has resulted in over 4,700 county lines being closed, over 14,800 arrests and over 7,200 safeguard referrals.
We will keep our focus on this evil criminality.
