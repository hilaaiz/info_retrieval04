We will continue to break the business model of organised crime gangs to keep the people of this country safe.
We are disrupting their activities both domestically in the UK and internationally, including disrupting the work of the gangs behind the illegal small-boat crossings, and it is why the Criminal Justice Bill creates new powers to target organised criminal gangs.
We will also publish a new serious and organised crime strategy soon.
Criminal gangs do not care about the people they are smuggling into our country and they must be stopped.
We must stop the boats in ways that are consistent with our international obligations and end the dangerous journeys that risk human life.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that we must focus on breaking the business model of these criminal gangs?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
The people who are being smuggled are seen as just products; they are expendable in the eyes of the people smugglers, and we must and will do everything we can to break their business model.
I commend the work of my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Immigration, who has recently been to Bulgaria, where in close co-operation with our international partners there we have seized boats and engines.
We are breaking the business model, and we will continue to drive down those illegal small-boat crossings until we have stopped the boats.
Serious organised acquisitive crime is hitting rural communities hard, with high-value agricultural equipment targeted for theft.
The National Rural crime unit has recently recovered over £5 million of stolen equipment, nearly £1 million of which was recovered abroad.
The Construction Plant-hire Association, NFU Mutual and the Construction Equipment Association have put significant funds into the NRCU but what more can my right hon.
Friend do to ensure that it has the resources it needs to tackle these serious organised criminal gangs?
