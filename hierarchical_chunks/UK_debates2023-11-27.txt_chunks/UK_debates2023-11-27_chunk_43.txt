I welcome the pause, with hostages released and aid delivered, and I hope that it continues.
I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for the role that he has played to date, but if this drip, drip of hostage release is to continue, surely more must be done to ratchet up the pressure and ensure that the Red Cross and the Red Crescent gain access to the hostages about whom we have no information.
Is that not a priority now?
