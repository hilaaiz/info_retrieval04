The specialist sexual violence support project is now under way in Crown courts in Leeds, Newcastle and Snaresbrook.
It is at an early stage but is due to report in early 2025.
However, my hon.
Friend should be aware that any victim of rape or sexual assault may now take advantage of section 28 procedures, which have been rolled out nationwide to allow people to give their evidence privately and ahead of trial.
We are also engaging close to 1,000 independent sexual violence advisers in the system to accompany victims every step of the way through the criminal justice system.
As a result, rape prosecutions are higher today than they were in 2010 and sentences are approximately 50% longer.
Can the Minister tell me how many forces are still not providing domestic abuse training to their officers?
I do not have that answer.
I will have to go back to the Home Office and write to the hon.
Member.
