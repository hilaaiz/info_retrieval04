Gentleman for his comments about Hamas and the ceasefire, with which I completely agree.
In respect of building Palestinian capacity, he will know that Lord Cameron was in Ramallah  last week discussing that and many other associated matters with President Abbas, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister there.
