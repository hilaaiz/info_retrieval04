This is a serious matter.
The UK’s priority in the region is security and stability for the whole of the middle east, yet today Netanyahu plans to push forward with a special budget that will fund expansions of the settlements by over $80 million.
As a friend, we have a duty to say to Israel, “Do not proceed with this plan.
It takes us further away from peace and, frankly, it will risk not only the truce, but the ability to get home hostages who are still held by their terrorist kidnappers.”
What is my right hon.
Friend doing to ensure that we speak plainly to our friends?
