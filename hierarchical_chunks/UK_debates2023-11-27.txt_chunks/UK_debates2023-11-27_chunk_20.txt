The Home Affairs Committee has taken a particular interest in small-boat crossings.
We produced a report last year that I suggest the new Home Secretary might want to look at.
We have also visited France and Belgium this year.
Owing to our interest and expertise in this area, will the Home Secretary consider giving the Home Affairs Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights the opportunity to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of any emergency legislation that he plans to bring forward?
There is an urgency to the legislation that we seek to put forward and, although pre-legislative scrutiny has a part to play, I will not do anything that delays the implementation of this incredibly important legislation.
It is imperative if we are to crack the business model of the evil people smugglers that we operationalise the Rwanda scheme.
May I register my profound conviction that the disapplication of elements of the European convention on human rights and the refugee convention will be necessary?
The Court of Appeal cited human rights and the Supreme Court cited refoulement.
What will it be next time, in the absence of Parliament expressly asserting the will of this House?
My right hon.
Friend makes an incredibly important point, although I do not want to prejudge the content of the Bill.
I listened carefully to his points, and he and the rest of the House should understand that we will do everything we can to ensure that we break the business model of the evil people smugglers he highlights and drive down the small-boat arrivals.
He is absolutely right that the deterrent effect of the Rwanda scheme is a key element of that multi-strand approach.
What progress his Department has made on reviewing the police funding formula.
