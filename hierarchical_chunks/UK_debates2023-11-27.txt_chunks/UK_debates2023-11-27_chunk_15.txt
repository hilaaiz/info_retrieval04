I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
I pay tribute to Sandra Conte and her team at Future Living in Hertford for everything they do to support victims of domestic abuse.
As a magistrate, I specialised in domestic abuse courts and I am utterly convinced of  their value, both for justice and for victims.
Will my hon.
Friend share her assessment of the initiatives to increase specialisation in court processes for sexual offending and sexual violence?
