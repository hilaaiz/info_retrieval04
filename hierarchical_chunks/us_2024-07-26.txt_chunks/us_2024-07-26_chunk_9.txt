Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Anna Osinski Perrong, a remarkable constituent from my district, who is celebrating her 100th birthday.
Anna was born on July 27, 1924, in Sellersville, Pennsylvania.
She graduated from Girls High School in 1941 and continued with her undergraduate degree at Temple University School of Pharmacy where she met her future husband, John Pierce Perrong.
She graduated from Temple University in 1944.
She participated in numerous (Rho Psi) sorority functions during her years at Temple University.
Anna and John were married after he returned from World War II, where he served as an Army medic in Germany.
Anna started her career at Dupont as a chemist and later worked at Sharp & Dohme as a research chemist.
Anna and John moved into their new home in Northeast Philadelphia in 1950.
They were blessed with a son and daughter, Robert and Carolyn.
Anna took time out from her career to raise her children but after the children matured, she went back to work as a pharmacist at Germantown Hospital from 1968 to 1991 and later volunteered her time at the hospital for over 20 years.
Aside from her pharmacy career and being a homemaker, she played the cello in the Olney Symphony Orchestra for nearly 50 years and was active in several string quartet groups.
Additionally, Anna served as Personnel Chairman for the Olney Symphony.
She still remains in contact with many friends she made over the years in music.
Her favorite activities have always included making family holiday dinners.
Besides her two children, Anna has two grandchildren, Jon and Rob, and two great-granddaughters, Emma and Ava which happen to be identical twins.
Additionally, she has a very supportive son-in-law, Sean Corsaut, and a loving daughter-in-law, Karen Perrong.
