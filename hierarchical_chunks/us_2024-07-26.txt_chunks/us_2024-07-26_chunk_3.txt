Mrs. KIM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Mission Viejo City Manager Dennis Wilberg for his decades of service to our Mission Viejo community and to Orange County.
His work in the public and private sectors of civil and transportation engineering, including 20 years as City Manager, has left an enormous impact across Mission Viejo and the County.
From helping create the second-largest animal shelter in Orange County and building a water treatment facility, to increasing public safety and maintaining the City's transportation network, there's no question how he has become the longest-tenured city manager in Orange County.
I thank him for his dedication to keeping our communities safe and connected.
We are grateful for his leadership, and I wish him a wonderful retirement.
