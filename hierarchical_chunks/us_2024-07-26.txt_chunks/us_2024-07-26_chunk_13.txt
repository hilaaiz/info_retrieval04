Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me; along with the people of her District, her state, and the American people in recognizing and commending Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers for her dedicated service to people, especially her leadership and advocacy for our Nation's Military Families.
While her leadership will be greatly missed in the halls of Congress, we wish her and her family the best as she embarks upon the next chapter of her life.
