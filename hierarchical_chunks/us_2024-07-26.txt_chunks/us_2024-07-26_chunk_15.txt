Mr. BEATTY.
Madam Speaker, I rise today, I join my Congressional colleagues, the Nation, the city of Houston, and the loved ones of Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee in mourning her passing.
She began her journey to greatness by breaking barriers as a Yale University student, municipal judge, and Houston City Councilwoman before continuing her fight against injustice in the U.S. Congress.
Congresswoman Jackson Lee was a pioneering advocate and a tireless champion for justice and civil rights, standing up for the most vulnerable and holding those in power accountable.
Her legacy includes creating the Juneteenth federal holiday and her relentless fight for reparations to address the painful history of Black Americans.
It features innovations in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and a passionate persistence in reintroducing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in May 2024.
My Congressional sister was tireless in her work for voting rights, healthcare, education, and labor.
As Chair Emerita of the Congressional Black Caucus, I am especially grateful for her guidance, intellectual command of issues, and service as my legal advisor and parliamentarian.
As a Black woman, I felt immense pride watching her on the U.S. House Floor, confidently addressing subject matter experts in any field and prevailing.
I will deeply miss our friendship, debates, laughs, and travels together, but I will always remember her as a ``national treasure.''
Rest in power to my friend.
May her legacy and dedication strengthen and encourage us in the days ahead.
