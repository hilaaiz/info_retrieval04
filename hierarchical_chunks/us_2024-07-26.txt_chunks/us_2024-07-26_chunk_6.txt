Eshoo, Ro Khanna, and Jimmy Panetta to recognize the accomplishments of Teatro Vision for 40 years of community building and social justice work in San Jose, CA.
Teatro Vision was founded in 1984 in San Jose, California, with the mission of inspiring the people of Santa Clara County and surrounding areas.
The theater was co-founded by Elisa Marina Alvarado, who is a director, actress, and dancer.
Through Teatro Vision, Elisa Marina Alvarado established Instituto de Teatro, an educational program that teaches comprehensive training in theater for Latino communities.
For the last 40 years, Teatro Vision has produced and presented projects that have been made accessible to the entire community, emphasizing activist theater and focusing on Latino and Chicano communities, integrating Latin American cultures.
Teatro Vision's recent projects include ``Miss You Like Hell,'' ``Luz: A Shadow Play Inspired by Senior Stories,'' and ``Raices, El Libro de los Caminos,'' performed at the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose.
Teatro Vision's work is centered in the Mayfair neighborhood located in East San Jose where their main stage, the Mexican Heritage Plaza, is also situated.
Over 77 percent of the Mayfair neighborhood is made up of Latinx; 66 percent of which speak Spanish at home.
Teatro Vision's programs give accessibility to Title I schools in Mayfair, where many students come from economically disadvantaged households.
Teatro Vision has shared powerful stories and convictions that speak to the courage, compassion, and power of many minority communities.
The team at Teatro Vision are strong leaders that our community needs now and in the future.
