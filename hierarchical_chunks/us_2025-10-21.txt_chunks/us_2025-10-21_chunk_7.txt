Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kim Castaneda, recognized as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Kim has demonstrated extraordinary leadership and a lifelong dedication to building stronger, more equitable communities throughout Solano County.
For more than twenty-five years, 
Ms. Castaneda has exemplified what it means to serve others.
Through her work in the nonprofit sector, she has guided organizations through growth, crisis, and transformation, with a focus on ensuring that the most vulnerable are not left behind.
As Vice President of Development and Communications at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, Ms. Castaneda has raised millions of dollars to fight hunger and played an instrumental role in doubling private donations, ensuring that thousands of families have consistent access to nutritious food.
Her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was especially remarkable.
At a time when food insecurity reached unprecedented levels, she rallied staff, volunteers, and community partners to secure critical resources and distribute millions of additional meals.
Under her guidance, the Food Bank never turned anyone away and continues today to serve more than 65,000 households each month.
She was also a founding board member of the Vacaville Recreation Foundation and helped establish the first Boys and Girls Club in Vacaville, expanding opportunities for local youth that endure to this day.
She has also served on the Board of SafeQuest Solano, supporting survivors inclusion is reflected in her advocacy for LGBTQ rights, foster youth, and women's empowerment, and in her leadership roles with key organizations including the Solano Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Solano Economic Development Council, and the Travis Credit Union Foundation.
In each of these, she has championed small business development, workforce opportunities, and economic inclusion.
Her work stands as a testament to
