Ms. Pratt has been employed at The Medical Center for six years, where she began her career as a surgical scrub technician before advancing to her current role as a registered nurse.
Recently, she achieved a major milestone by graduating from the Mississippi University for Women with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
Her colleagues speak highly of her commitment and growth.
Terri Donham, Nurse Manager of Surgery, PACU, and SPD, stated, ``Watching Kayla expand her knowledge base over the years has been awesome.
She has grown from the shy, quiet young woman that applied for a scrub tech position to a nurse that takes amazing care of her patients when they come to the operating room.''
Similarly, Chrissy Nicholson, Chief Human Resources Officer, shared, ``Congratulations to TaKayla on earning her BSN and becoming a registered nurse!
We are incredibly proud of her achievement and grateful to have her on our team.''
