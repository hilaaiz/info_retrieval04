Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Terrye Davis, a distinguished leader and trailblazer, as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Her visionary leadership and lifelong commitment to service have strengthened the fabric of Solano County for decades.
Judge Davis began her career as the Founding Director of the Solano College Small Business Development Center, where she empowered entrepreneurs and expanded pathways to economic opportunity across our region.
She later served as Executive Director of the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club, where under her guidance the organization's budget grew more than fivefold, allowing countless young people to access a safe and supportive environment to learn, grow, and thrive.
Today, Judge Davis serves with distinction on the Solano County Superior Court, where she presides over juvenile justice and dependency cases.
In this critical role, she brings compassion, integrity, and structure to some of our community's most vulnerable youth, offering not just legal judgment but also hope and a path forward.
Her dedication to public service extends well beyond the courtroom.
She has contributed her leadership to the Sutter Solano Medical Center, the City of Vallejo Human Relations Commission, the Mare Island Reuse Advisory Committee, and the Board of Trustees at her local church.
Judge Davis's journey is a testament to courage and purpose.
Leaving behind a successful nonprofit career to pursue her dream of becoming an attorney, she graduated from UC Hastings and rose to the bench, proving that it's never too late to follow one's calling.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, I am proud to recognize and honor Judge Terrye Davis for her extraordinary contributions to our community.
