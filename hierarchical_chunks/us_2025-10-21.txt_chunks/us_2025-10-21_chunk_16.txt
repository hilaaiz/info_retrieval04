Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Government Advertising Equity Accountability Act, which would require all federal agencies to include in their annual budget requests to Congress the amount they spend on advertising contracts with small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and businesses owned by minorities and women.
Federal agencies would be required to provide prior and projected total expenditures for such contracts.
At my request, the Committee on Appropriations has required many federal agencies to provide such information each of the last several years, but this bill would codify this requirement and apply it to all federal agencies.
In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined spending on advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses by five federal agencies--the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--and found that only five percent of the $4.3 billion available for advertising contracts went to minority-owned businesses.
In light of these concerning findings, I, along with several other Members of Congress, sent letters to GAO in 2016 and 2022 requesting updated information on the amount of federal advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
In 2018 and 2024, GAO issued reports on the amount of federal advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
The 2024 report revealed that only 15 percent of federal advertising contract obligations went to SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
The federal government is one of the largest advertisers in the United States, and it has an obligation to ensure equitable access to its contracts for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
GAO's findings demonstrate that there is still much progress to be made.
