Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
Mr. Speaker, Hinduism is the third largest religion in the world, and this month, millions of Americans will come together to celebrate Diwali, or Deepavali, the festival of lights.
Diwali, symbolizing unity and renewal, marks the victory of light over darkness and is a significant cultural and spiritual celebration, observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and others in the United States and across the globe.
Virginia, and the United States as a whole, is home to a vibrant and thriving Hindu community.
Hindu Americans contribute meaningfully across sectors, including business, law, government, technology, medicine, science, education, and philanthropy.
Several states, including the Commonwealth of Virginia, have passed legislation to officially proclaim October as Hindu Heritage Month.
I encourage residents across the Commonwealth and the country to join in celebrating Diwali and take this opportunity to learn more about Hindu American civic engagement, history, traditions, and culture.
In this spirit, I join those across the country in celebrating October as Hindu Heritage Month.
May this Diwali bring joy, light, and prosperity to all those who celebrate.
