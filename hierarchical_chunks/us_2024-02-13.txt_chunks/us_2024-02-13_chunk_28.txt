most federal grants go to states--federal statutes that provide federal funding directly to political subdivisions are often silent on whether D.C. is to be treated as a political subdivision.
In the absence of clear language in a statute, federal agencies are inconsistent in their treatment of D.C.'s eligibility for federal funding.
By amending title 1 of the U.S. Code to deem D.C. as both a state and political subdivision for federal funding, this bill would automatically correct imprecise treatment of D.C.'s eligibility for federal funding in existing and future statutes and remove discretion from federal agencies in their treatment of D.C.'s eligibility for federal funding.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
