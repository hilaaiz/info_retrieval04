Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending the work and commitment to services that Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department, Company 1 has carried out over the last 100 years.
Their service to the community is invaluable, and I wish them the best as they continue their work to help our neighbors when they most need it.
