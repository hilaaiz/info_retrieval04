Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and the residents of New Jersey in recognizing Sheriff Richard Berdnik for his outstanding contributions to law enforcement and beyond.
I thank Sheriff Berdnik.
He was a mentor, a friend, and a pillar in our community.
God bless his soul and may his wife Monica, and four children Ashley, Ryan, Alyssa, and Kevin stand proud.
