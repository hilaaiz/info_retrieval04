Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mary Louise Orta as her family gathers to remember her life and the many people she touched along the way.
Mary Louise Orta was the matriarch of the Orta Family.
She was born in New Braunfels, Texas on November 13, 1931.
She met and married Albert Orta in 1949 and began their life together in Texas before moving to California in 1973.
