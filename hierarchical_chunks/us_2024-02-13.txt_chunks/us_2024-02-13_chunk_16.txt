Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and the residents of New Jersey in recognizing the 150th anniversary of the City.
I take this opportunity to congratulate the residents moment to honor the past, revel in the present, and look forward to a future filled with continued growth, prosperity, and fortitude.
