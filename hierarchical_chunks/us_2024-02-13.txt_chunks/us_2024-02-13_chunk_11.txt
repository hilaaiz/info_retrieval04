Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and the residents of the City of Paterson in recognizing 
Mr. Bayram.
I take this opportunity to honor the great work Huseyin Bayram has accomplished.
May his work continue to be a guiding light in our community and inspire others to strive for excellence in service.
