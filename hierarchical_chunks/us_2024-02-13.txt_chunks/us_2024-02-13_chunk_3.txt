Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department, Company 1 for their 100 years of dedicated service toward their mission to aid in the preservation and protection of life and property from and during fires, and their commitment to the Culpeper community.
The Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department was born from a desire to help neighbors in need.
Chartered in January 1924, the department was first led by Chief J. William Swan and was comprised of 19 volunteers ready to answer the call.
In their early days, they relied on their 1923 American LaFrance Brockway ``Torpedo'' Engine, which they housed on the ground floor of the Municipal Building.
Volunteer firefighters used canvas coats with leather gloves bought at local hardware stores, and some donned World War I metal helmets or construction helmets to fight fires.
It was not until the early 1950s that Culpeper volunteer firefighters got their first official fireproof gear.
Soon after, they relocated to West Davis Street where they are still located today.
The Culpeper Volunteer Fire Department is a unique and treasured organization.
Made up completely of volunteers from all walks of life, these brave individuals respond to emergencies in their community in their spare time.
Through their service, they provide fire protection and life-saving aid to more than 54,000 Culpeper County residents and cover 383 square miles.
What began as a dream to help their neighbors has grown into a strong organization that continues to uphold the founding mission set 100 years ago--``to provide emergency services to the citizens of our entire community... achieved through our principles of commitment, education, recognized standards, and professionalism.''
Today they boast a membership of 65 volunteer firefighters.
In 2023, they answered 913 calls with a fleet composed of an engine, a pumper, a rescue engine, and more, all purchased with the help of their community through fundraising and donations.
