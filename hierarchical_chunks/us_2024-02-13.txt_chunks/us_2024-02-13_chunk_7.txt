Mr. PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an esteemed and invaluable member of New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District, Mr. Huseyin Bayram.
His contributions to our community distinguish him as a prominent figure, serving as the proud owner of Toro's Restaurant and the New Corral.
Today I join the City of Paterson as they honor his contributions by awarding him with the Key to the City.
Huseyin is an outstanding community leader, philanthropist, and entrepreneur who continuously demonstrates an unwavering commitment to make a positive impact extending beyond the State.
