Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service.
Clinton Battle.
Born in the 1920s, Dr. Clinton Battle was known for his remarkable medical service to Indianola, Mississippi that contributed to the medical field where he earned nationwide recognition.
In the 1950s Dr. Battle received national press for his renowned delivery of first conjoined Siamese twins to ever be successfully separated.
Outside of the medical field, Battle helped to revive the local chapter of The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), helping over 100 African Americans register to vote.
He always inspired African Americans to rise during the Jim Crow era.
Because of this contribution to civil rights and medicine, Dr. Clinton Battle has been named a recipient of the Civil Rights Trail Marker as a trailblazer for Civil Rights and his medical accomplishments.
Dr. Battle's legacy and his contribution to medicine will continue to transcend time.
