Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and service of Thomas Holleran Neale, a specialist at the Congressional Research Service who served Congress for over 53 years until his death this year.
Tom was born in 1943 and grew up in Auburn, New York.
He attended Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, Syracuse University, and the Universite.
At CRS, he served countless members of Congress and committees with his expertise in American elections, political history, and constitutional theory.
Tom was a public servant, an active member of the community, and a faithful Catholic.
He served as a member of community organizations including serving as president of the Association of Oldest Inhabitants.
He contributed writings to Wilson Quarterly, the Encyclopedia of the United States Congress, and The Encyclopedia of the United States in the 19th Century.
He lectured on American elections at Meridian International, the Organization of American States, and the House of Representatives' Parliamentary Development Task Force and its House Democracy Partnership.
And on behalf of the State Department, he lectured at the Foreign Press Center in Washington, the U.S. Embassy in Austria and several Austrian universities, and the Egyptian Parliament and the American University in Cairo.
He served Congress well and was recognized by many of his colleagues as an outstanding scholar and a dear friend to many.
On behalf of all of Congress, I want to thank Tom for his enduring service to this institution.
