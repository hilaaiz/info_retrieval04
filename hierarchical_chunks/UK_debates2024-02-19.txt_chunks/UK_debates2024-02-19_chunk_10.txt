The Minister and others will be aware that recruitment across Northern Ireland to the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy has always been exceptional.
However, the number of personnel in Territorial Army regiments is set at a figure that those regiments cannot go above.
Will the Minister look at increasing the number of TA soldiers to ensure that recruitment in Northern Ireland can exceed the current numbers?
I pay tribute to the people of Northern Ireland who, as the hon.
Gentleman says, have disproportionately contributed to the defence of our country.
He will know that we are committed to growing our reserve forces across the United Kingdom.
