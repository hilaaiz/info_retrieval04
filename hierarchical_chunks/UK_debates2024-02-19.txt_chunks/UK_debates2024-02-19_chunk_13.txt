I thank my right hon.
Friend for his answer.
AUKUS is a bold project that rightfully identifies the greater need for co-operation in the Pacific between our great nations.
However, I do not think that it should be limited just to defence.
In my own report for the 1922 foreign affairs policy committee, we found that there is not only a need, but an appetite for wider scope—the inclusion of Canada, for example.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that AUKUS cannot just be about defence policy.
Will we be reaping the maximum benefits for Britain by consigning this to be just a defence procurement exercise?
Where is the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in all of this?
