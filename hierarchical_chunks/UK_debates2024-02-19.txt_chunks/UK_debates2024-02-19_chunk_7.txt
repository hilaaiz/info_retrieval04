The Minister has said much the same today.
In response to a question from me last week, however, he would not rule out using that money to cover the UK’s operational costs at NATO bases.
Will he rule that out today?
Will he confirm today that every penny and every pound of the £2.5 billion for Ukraine will go to Ukraine?
I fear that the right hon.
Gentleman has missed something over the last two years.
The £2.3 billion that the Government have provided for operations to support Ukraine has always included not just the gifting in kind that takes the headlines, but Operation Interflex and other avenues through which we support the Ukrainians.
The fact is that next year’s spending and that of the year after will match exactly what we did in previous years, in terms of the breadth of that contribution.
It is also true that the long-term strategic alliance that the Secretary of State set out and the commitment year on year to spend more than any other European ally are not mutually exclusive; we are doing both.
