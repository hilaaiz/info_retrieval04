The Prime Minister said he was going to grow the economy and he has obviously failed: we are now in recession.
In my constituency, families and small businesses are under severe pressure.
Can the Minister possibly explain how he is going to address these very serious problems?
All I would say to the hon.
Gentleman is that we are in a very challenging international context and we have performed better than the international forecasts.
We had high inflation, which really bedevilled this economy a couple of years ago, but we have more than halved it.
We have a plan to grow our way out of this, as was shown by the last fiscal event, where we  unveiled, I think, 110 growth measures.
That is our plan.
The Labour Opposition do not have a plan.
If this country sticks with our plan, we will grow our economy significantly over the coming months and years.
