The Prime Minister has failed to get growth and industry has completely lost confidence in this Government.
With projects cancelled, HS2 cancelled, Building Schools for the Future cancelled, hospitals never built and an absolute failure to bring down high energy prices, it is no wonder that business investment forecasts are down.
With the US and the EU incentivising investment, what is the Minister now going to do to get the investment we need in the green manufacturing industries of the future?
To increase investment we brought in full expensing at the last fiscal event, which should represent an increase over the forecast period of £14 billion of investment and deal with the chronic weakness of our economy over generations.
That is what we are doing to increase investment.
In relation to green investment in particular, what we are not doing is having a huge unfunded £28 billion plan—or maybe now it is not Labour’s plan; maybe it is a secret plan or maybe the Labour Front Benchers have stopped their plan.
We have a responsible costed plan to increase investment; the Opposition do not have one.
Let’s try this again.
Public sector net debt is set to rise from 89% of GDP this year to 92.8% of GDP in 2028-29, according to the most recent Office for Budget Responsibility forecast.
In case the Minister does not understand, that  number is higher than today’s.
The Prime Minister promised to reduce debt, but it is increasing.
The plan isn’t working, is it?
