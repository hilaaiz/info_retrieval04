The Minister says the Government’s priority is backing British business, cutting inflation and reducing the pressure on British families.
When the Government admit this measure will increase inflation, when British business is tearing its hair out at the chaos caused by not knowing what the charge will be and who will pay it—with less than 10 weeks to go—and when British consumers will find that it causes food shortages and an increase in food prices, why on earth are the Government going ahead with the Brexit border tax?
Will the Minister commit here and now to cancelling it, so that we can stop this inflationary measure—yes or no?
