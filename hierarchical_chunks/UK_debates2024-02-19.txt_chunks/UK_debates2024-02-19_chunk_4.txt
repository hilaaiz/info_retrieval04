Of course, we are aware of the scepticism among Republican presidential candidates and in the US Congress about funding for Ukraine.
That is why UK Ministers—the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence, the Prime Minister and I —have been in Washington to make the case for the US continuing to support Ukraine, no matter the outcome of the election.
Second-guessing the outcome of the US electoral system is probably not sensible, but notwithstanding the fantastic efforts, led by Prime Minister Kallas of Estonia, to increase the manufacturing of ammunition in particular, it is clear that European manufacturing capacity is not yet at even half the target set.
That should be cause for all of us to consider how we might urgently ramp up manufacturing if the worst comes to the worst.
