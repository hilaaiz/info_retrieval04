I thank the hon.
Lady for focusing on inflation.
She is right that it is critical, and bringing it down is a focus for the Government.
The House has heard her point about the European Union, but I would add that we have a clear plan for bringing down inflation, which we will continue to carry out.
She has to ask those on her Front Bench why they do not have one.
