I thank the Minister for updating the House.
Does he agree that people in Redditch and elsewhere are concerned about negative economic news—although it almost always turns out to be wrong?
Most of all, does he agree that the greatest risk to my constituents in Redditch and those across the country is a Labour Government?
Labour has said it can somehow magically get £28 billion of green growth benefits without paying for them.
We all know that my constituents will be paying for that through extra borrowing and higher taxes.
