The Government have delayed producing the information required for the invitation to negotiate for the new medium-lift helicopter four times since September 2022.
Can the Minister explain what has caused this 18-month delay?
Given the reports last week about his Department freezing capital spending until at least the new financial year, when will the Government get their act together to get this competition under way?
Can he promise that the delay will not push back the delivery date for this vital capability for our forces?
I am pleased to say two things to the hon.
Lady.
First, we will have the announcement on the next stage of the new medium helicopter very soon.
I am also pleased to confirm that we have been clear on our spending position.
To echo my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Defence People and Families, if the hon.
Lady wants to talk about stuff that is rumoured in the press—we do not have those sorts of capital spending controls—can she confirm whether the shadow Chancellor will honour our defence spending commitments?
What recent progress his Department has made on the AUKUS partnership.
AUKUS partners continue to make good progress on the optimal pathway to deliver conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines to Australia and to develop the advanced capabilities required.
