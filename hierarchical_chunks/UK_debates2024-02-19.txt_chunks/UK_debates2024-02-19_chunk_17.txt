The agonies of the Palestinian people are extreme.
We all want the fighting to stop now, for hostages to be returned now, for aid to be ramped up now, and a ceasefire that   lasts permanently.
What is the Defence Secretary doing to help his Israeli counterpart to accept that their threatened offensive against Rafah just cannot happen?
I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman about the seriousness of the situation.
As he has just heard, I visited Israel before the new year and had those conversations directly.
I believe that it is in Israel’s interest, obviously in Gaza’s interest, and in the world’s interest to see that immediate cessation followed by a permanent ceasefire.
We are doing everything we can to persuade the Israelis of that necessity and to put pressure on Hamas, who still hold hostages—if they were to release them, this thing could finish very quickly.
We are also helping by ensuring that we work on plans for what happens in the north of the country and in southern Lebanon.
Carshalton and Wallington is home to more than 1,700 veterans who have provided, and continue to provide, amazing service to our great nation.
What steps are we taking as a Government to provide better support for veterans in our country?
Since 2011, the armed forces covenant and its consequentials have been the absolute lynchpin of public commitment to those who have served, and they have materially improved the lived experience of the service community.
The Ministry of Defence is responsible for a number of services for veterans.
The Veterans Welfare Service, for example, supports around 50,000 veterans every year, and the Office for Veterans’ Affairs co-ordinates across Government to advance support for veterans and their families.
