I have already laid out the steps that we are taking, and there is a critical need to make sure that all the regions of our country benefit from those steps.
That is one of the reasons why we put so much effort and focus into investment zones over the last couple of years.
We hope that these investment zones will continue to increase growth in the economy, not only at a macro level, but for people in every region of this country—particularly in Northern Ireland and the other regions that perhaps did not benefit from this country’s previous growth.
We are committed to strengthening that regionally.
