The Minister has talked about the growth mission, which is the Government’s raison d’être, but last week we found out that the economy had shrunk.
Has he done any work to find out how much that 0.1% drop will cost the Government?
It will have huge tax implications.
As I have set out to the hon.
Gentleman in a number of debates in recent weeks, the Government have had to take difficult but necessary decisions to restore fiscal responsibility after the completely unsustainable situation that we inherited from the Conservative party.
That fiscal responsibility and economic  stability are essential for greater investment in the economy, which is the bedrock of the growth that we are so determined to pursue.
Will the Minister outline how many billions the Government will spend this year, what percentage £22 billion represents in that amount, and—if I may be so greedy as to ask an additional question, Mr Speaker—how much the flatlining of the economy has cost the Government compared with that £22 billion?
I put it to the Minister that the impact of the national insurance contributions rise has been much greater than that of the mythical £22 billion alleged by the Government.
I am not clear from the right hon.
Gentleman’s intervention whether he finally accepts that we inherited a £22 billion black hole when we entered government.
I know that several of his colleagues have sought to rewrite history, but the facts are there.
We inherited a completely unsustainable fiscal situation, with pressures and a £22 billion black hole, and we had to take difficult but necessary decisions to remedy that.
It was important to do so, because without the basic fiscal responsibility and economic stability that a Government should deliver, investment, which is the basis for growth, will not happen.
