I absolutely agree.
I am more than happy to meet my hon.
Friend and his constituent.
Allegations of any crime involving serving police officers should be investigated robustly and independently by the police.
Outside of criminal investigations, disciplinary investigations, including those involving serious assault and sexual violence, are referred to the IOPC under mandatory referral criteria, but there is more to do.
In my constituency of Stevenage, we have an excellent charity called SADA—Survivors Against Domestic Abuse.
Such charities rely on multi-agency working to deliver essential services to those affected by domestic abuse.
How are the Government continuing to support organisations in working closely together to continue to provide effective services to those who have suffered domestic abuse?
