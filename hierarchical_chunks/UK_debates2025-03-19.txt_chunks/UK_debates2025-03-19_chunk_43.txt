The point that Opposition Members are trying to emphasise is that the Government appear to be giving with one hand, but taking away with the other.
The hospice sector is just one example of many sectors that have been adversely affected by the Government’s cruel tax.
As I said a few moments ago, the way that the Government support central Government, local government and public corporations—that is Departments and other public sector employers—is the same way that the previous Government responded to the health and social care levy.
That is a standard way in which the Government offer support for employer national insurance costs.

Will the Minister give way on that point?
No, I will make some progress.
The Government want to shift healthcare out of hospitals and into the community, to ensure that patients and their families receive personalised care in the most appropriate setting.
