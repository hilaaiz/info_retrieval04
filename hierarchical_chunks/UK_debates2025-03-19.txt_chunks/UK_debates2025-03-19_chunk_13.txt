I thank the Minister for her answers and for her ongoing engagement on this issue with the people in Northern Ireland.
The name Natalie McNally will mean much to the Minister; on  18 December 2022 , Natalie was brutally murdered in my constituency, along with her unborn baby.
Can the Minister update the House on ongoing discussions about a UK-wide strategy for tackling violence against women that will improve conviction rates, get tougher sentencing, and provide more support for victims?
We do this in the name of Natalie and the many other women who have lost their lives.
