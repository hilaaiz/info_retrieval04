I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and I completely agree with him.
Indeed, I also attended a wonderful interfaith iftar in Hounslow on Friday.
Islamophobia is completely abhorrent and has no place in our society.
No one should ever be the victim of hatred because of their religion or belief.
The Government have established a new working group to provide the Government with a definition of anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia, and advise the Government and other bodies on how best to understand, quantify and define prejudice, discrimination and hate crime targeted against Muslims.
