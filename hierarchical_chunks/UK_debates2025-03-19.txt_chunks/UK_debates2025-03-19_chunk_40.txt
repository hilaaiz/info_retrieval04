I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising the question of GPs and the funding and support that the Government are providing them.
We are investing an additional £889 million in general practice, which brings the total spend on the GP contract to £13.2 billion in 2025-26.
That is the biggest increase in over a decade.
The changes to the contract will improve services for patients and help to make progress towards the Government’s health mission—shifting from analogue to digital, from sickness to prevention, and from hospital to community care—as set out in the Prime Minister’s plan for change.
That support for GPs is an essential part of what the Budget, including the national insurance measures we are debating, delivers.
