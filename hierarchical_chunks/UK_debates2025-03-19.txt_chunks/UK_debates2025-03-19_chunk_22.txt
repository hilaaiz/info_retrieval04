I thank the hon.
Gentleman for doing what he was asked to do, and raising that case here.
The loss of a child is unbearable, and I think that most us, including me, simply do not know how we would be able to react.
I am sure that the whole House will want to send its deepest condolences to Laura, and to all Taylan’s family and friends.
