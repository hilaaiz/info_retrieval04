Will the Minister discuss with the Home Secretary how best we can bring to account, albeit belatedly, those still surviving who aided and abetted Mohamed Fayed in the rape and sexual assault of young women and girls?
The Home Secretary and I have very much discussed that.
While there are ongoing police investigations, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment.
However, having met some of those affected, I want to see exactly what the right hon.
Gentleman wants to see.
