I thank my hon.
Friend, who does a superb job for Peterborough.
We are proud of the fact that our Employment Rights Bill is tackling the cost of insecure work, and that we are delivering that pay rise for 3 million of the lowest-paid.
We know that the Leader of the Opposition opposes all that.
She thinks that the minimum wage is a burden, and that maternity pay is excessive.
It is the same old Tories.
They opposed the minimum wage in the first place; they have learnt absolutely nothing.
