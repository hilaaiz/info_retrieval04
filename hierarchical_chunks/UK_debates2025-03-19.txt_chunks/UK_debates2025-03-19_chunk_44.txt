I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving way.
Southern Area hospice, which is located just outside my constituency, has to raise £3.6 million per year, or £300,000 per month.
It is not Government funded, as has been mentioned, so what reassurance can the Minister give to those currently using Southern Area hospice for end of life care that the Government will do the right thing and support our hospices by not including them in the increase to national insurance contributions?
