I thank the Minister for her commitment to mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting.
However, I was disappointed to learn that the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority are rowing back on their proposals to boost diversity in financial services.
I feel that risks pushing away the very best talent from the sector.
Only 4% of financial services firms disclose their ethnicity pay gap.
The announcement will only slow the pace of change that is needed to tackle inequalities.
Does the Minister agree that initiatives that aim to reduce the ethnicity pay gap are not anti-growth, but pro-talent and pro-growth?
