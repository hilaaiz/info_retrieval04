The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 19 March.
Last night I spoke to President Zelensky to discuss progress that President Trump had made with Russia towards a ceasefire, and I took the opportunity to reaffirm our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine.
I am deeply concerned about the resumption of Israeli military action in Gaza.
The images of parents carrying their children—young children—to hospitals that have emerged over the last few days are truly shocking, as is the sheer number of those who have been killed.
We will do all that we can to ensure the resumption of the ceasefire in order to get the remaining hostages out, and to get aid that is desperately needed in.
The whole House will want to celebrate the extraordinary life of Group Captain John “Paddy” Hemingway, the last known pilot of the battle of Britain.
The courage of his generation, the fearlessness, the sense of duty and the service, secured our freedom, and we will never forget them.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer.
From time to time all of us in our surgeries hear stories from our constituents that really get to us and twang the heartstrings.
Last Friday, Laura attended my Sharnford surgery and told me of the tragic death of her energetic, loving six-year-old son Taylan from a brain tumour.
All that she asked was for me to raise this matter nationally, and I am doing that now, but I want to go one step further.
Will the Prime Minister agree to arrange a meeting for Laura, and the brain tumour support group known as Angel Mums, with the relevant healthcare Minister to discuss brain tumour research?
