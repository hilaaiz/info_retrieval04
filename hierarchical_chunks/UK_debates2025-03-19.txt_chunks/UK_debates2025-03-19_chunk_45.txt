I have explained how the Government are approaching employer national insurance contributions and the support that they offer for central Government, local government and public corporations.
That is an established way of responding to changes to employer national insurance contributions, which the previous Government did— rose— The right hon.
Gentleman is being so persistent.
He must have an amazing point to make, so I will give way to him.
I wait with bated breath.
It is an amazing point, and I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will get it, because it was clear that the Prime Minister did not get it at Prime Minister’s questions.
Let’s tell the real truth: the money that is being given by the Government—taxpayers’ money—to children’s hospices such as Shooting Star and Demelza hospices, is for buildings.
The national insurance increase is directly hitting the people who do the work on which very sick children depend.
Why is that imposition being made?
The £100 million that the right hon.
Gentleman alluded to is important funding to help hospices improve their buildings, equipment and accommodation, to ensure that patients receive the best care possible.
As I said a few moments ago, there will be £26 million of revenue to support children and young people’s hospices.
More widely, the Government provide for charities, including hospices, through the wider tax regime, which is among the most generous in the world.
That included tax reliefs for charities and their donors worth just over £6 billion for the tax year to April 2024.
Finally, as the right hon.
Gentleman will know, all charities, including hospices that are set up as charities, can benefit from the employment allowance that the Bill more than doubles, from £5,000 to £10,500.
That will benefit charities of all sizes, particularly the smallest.
