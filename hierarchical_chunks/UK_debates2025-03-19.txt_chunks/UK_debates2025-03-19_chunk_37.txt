During consideration of the Bill in the other place, 21 amendments were made, 20 of which we will address today, but before I do so directly, let me remind both Houses of the context for the Bill.
When we entered government, we inherited a fiscal situation that was completely unsustainable.
We have had to take difficult but necessary decisions to repair the public finances and rebuild our public services.
The measures in the Bill represent some of the toughest decisions that we have had to take as a result.
To restore fiscal responsibility and get public services back on their feet, we needed to raise revenue, including through the measures that the Bill will introduce.
Many of the amendments from the other place put at risk the funding that the Bill seeks to raise, so let me be absolutely clear: to support the amendments is also to support higher borrowing, lower spending or other tax rises.
With that in mind, I now turn to the first group of Lords amendments.
