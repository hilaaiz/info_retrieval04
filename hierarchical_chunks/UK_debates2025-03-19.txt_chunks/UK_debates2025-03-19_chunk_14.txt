I thank the hon.
Lady for her continued support for Natalie’s family.
When I was in Northern Ireland, it was very clear to me that that support had been in place.
A fundamental part of halving violence against women and girls has be looking at exactly the issue she has talked about—the femicide of women, and how we can all work together in a multi-agency way to ensure that I do not have to read out names like Natalie McNally’s.
