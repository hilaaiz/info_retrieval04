I thank SADA for the amazing work that it does.
In December 2024, we prioritised confirming funding for those delivering frontline services.
In the next few weeks, we will work on agreeing decisions about our wider budget that will support the Government’s ambition of halving VAWG in a decade, to deliver on our manifesto commitments.
