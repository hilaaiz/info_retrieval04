We all know that life is more expensive for someone who is disabled, and that investing in mental health and social care would give disabled people the support that they deserve.
Liberal Democrats believe that if the Government were serious about cutting welfare spending, they would get serious about fixing health and social care, and the broken Department for Work and Pensions.
By fixing that, we would reduce the benefits bill in the long term, but yesterday’s changes, which slash the support offered to vulnerable people, will leave many people facing difficult choices.

I am delighted that Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon has agreed to chair that group.
Glasgow’s Muslim community is characterised by its kindness and public service.
Last weekend, I visited my friends at the Hillview Islamic and education centre in Shettleston, and met the convenor of the Muslim Council of Scotland, Dr Muhammad Adrees.
I heard about terrible incidents of anti-Muslim hatred and crimes in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that our Muslim brothers and sisters should not have to live with that hatred, and will she set out the steps that the Government are taking to combat that?
