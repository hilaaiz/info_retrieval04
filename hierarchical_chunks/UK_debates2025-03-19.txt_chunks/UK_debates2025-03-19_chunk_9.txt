I thank the Minister for her answer.
A constituent of mine in Southampton Itchen suffered horrendous domestic and sexual abuse while she was a serving police officer, but inexplicably the rules did not allow her to take her complaint to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, and made her a victim of the very system that was meant to offer her protection.
Does the Minister agree that a woman’s right to get justice should not depend on the job that she happens to do?
Will she meet me and my constituent to discuss the changes needed so that we can better protect dedicated public servants such as her?
