On International Women’s Day, our community in Tamworth came together to not only celebrate the achievements of women, but reflect on the important issue of the safety of women and girls.
Local women Tamanna and Mckenzie took the initiative to  organise a walk-and-talk event, bringing together key organisations, including the UP Creative Hub community interest company and Tamworth Street Angels.
They had never organised an event before, and they managed to pull together 50 women in just two weeks.
Will the Minister join me in congratulating Tamanna and Mckenzie on that fantastic event, and on their dedication to raising awareness of such an important issue?
Absolutely, gladly.
Tamanna and Mckenzie deserve all our praise.
It is infectious; the first time we do such a thing often leads to the second.
The rising of the women is the rising of us all.
I am sure we all agree that securing women’s wellbeing is key to tackling violence against women and girls, so can the Minister assure women across my constituency and the country that the Labour Government, having promised to prioritise women’s health, are committed to continuing the Conservative Government’s work by making sure there is a women’s health hub in every integrated care board, to ensure holistic support for women?
A Minister to my left tells me that these hubs are already in nine out of 10 integrated care boards.
I can assure the hon.
Lady that I am working very closely with the Department of Health and Social Care on the violence against women and girls strategy, because there are real gaps when it comes to how domestic abuse, sexual violence and other related abuses are dealt with by our health services.
That will be absolutely fundamental to both protection and prevention.
