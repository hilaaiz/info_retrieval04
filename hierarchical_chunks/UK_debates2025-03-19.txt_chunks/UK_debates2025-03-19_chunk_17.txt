The Minister and many colleagues in this place will be aware of the groundbreaking new Netflix programme “Adolescence”.
It is chilling, but is rightfully forcing a national conversation about the dangerous content seen by young men and boys, with fatal consequences.
Given the important role that schools play in preventing violence against women and girls, will the Minister provide an update on what is being done with the Department for Education to counter misogyny and extreme violence, in order to enable a safe future for young boys and girls?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right that including men and boys in the conversation about how we prevent future violence against women and girls will be absolutely fundamental.
A huge portion of the new violence against women and girls strategy is focused on prevention, and what we can do in our schools, our workplaces and elsewhere to reach men and boys, in order to change the future.
I have been contacted by a number of women in my constituency who are victims of domestic violence, and whose partners continue to exert control over them through the family court process and the presumption that they will be able to access their children.
Will the Minister meet me, or inform me of what she is doing with the Ministry of Justice to help those women escape that control?
I work hand in glove with my counterparts in the Ministry of Justice on the violence against women and girls strategy, and I have long-standing concerns—as the hon.
Lady does—about the presumption of contact and family court issues.
Those issues will form the subject of part of our reforms, and are being looked into.
I will gladly meet the hon.
Lady.
