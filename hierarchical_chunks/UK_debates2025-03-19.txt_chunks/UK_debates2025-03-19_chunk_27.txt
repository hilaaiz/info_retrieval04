The Prime Minister knows why we are having an emergency Budget.
It is because since the last one—since the Chancellor delivered her Budget in October—growth is down, borrowing is up
and she has destroyed business confidence.
Does the Prime Minister now regret raising taxes on business?
The Office for Budget Responsibility will present its numbers and there will be a spring statement next week.
We have record investment into this country and interest rates have been cut.
The Leader of the Opposition talks about national insurance.
We had to fill the £22 billion black hole that the Conservatives left.
We have invested in the NHS, schools and public services.
We are pressing on with planning, with infrastructure and regulation.
I understand the Leader of the Opposition is straight-talking, so perhaps she can help us with this.
Is she going to reverse the national insurance contributions increase?
If not, what is the point?
If so, what other taxes is she raising to fill the hole—one way or another?
The only black hole is the one that the Prime Minister is digging.
He has shown absolutely no regret, but everybody knows that the Chancellor has made a mistake.
That is why they are having an emergency Budget.
Later today, Conservatives will vote to exempt hospices, pharmacies and care providers from her national insurance rise.
Will he at the very least support exempting those vulnerable services from his jobs tax?
I notice the Leader of the Opposition did not say that the Conservatives would reverse the national insurance rises.
That is exactly it: she wants all the benefits, but they cannot say how they are going to pay for them.
She carps from the sidelines, but cannot make her mind up whether she supports or does not support national insurance rises.
We have made provision for hospices and we have made provisions for charities, but we had to secure the economy.
We had to fill the £22 billion black hole that they disgracefully left.
