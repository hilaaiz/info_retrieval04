The Prime Minister and I disagree on much—the family farm tax, the national insurance jobs tax and the cut in winter fuel payments—but we surely agree that the common good is built on public order.
Crossbows in the hands of killers cost lives: they cost the lives of three innocent women last year.
The previous Government moved to consultation over a year ago on the regulation of crossbows, their sale and use, and yet we have heard nothing since.
They are as powerful as guns, as silent as knives.
Will the Prime Minister agree for one of his Ministers to come to the House before Easter to give us a clear instruction about what the Government intend to do before any more lives are lost?
