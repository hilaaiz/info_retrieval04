I thank my hon.
Friend for his typical care in this area.
I assure him and the House that significant work is taking place across Government in those areas where disabled people have told us that their outcomes must be a priority, whether that is in education, employment or care.
We are focused on that, and the disability action plan will complement that work.
We  are using the insight from the 12-week consultation to deliver improvements in all the areas that matter most to disabled people, in order to improve their daily lives.
