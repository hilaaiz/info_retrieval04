I reassure my hon.
Friend that she is more than enough for me.
There was a really worrying article in The Times a few days ago that talked about the invisibility of disabled people when making employment applications.
We know that disabled people are less likely to be in work and to take up opportunities for entrepreneurship.
Perhaps my hon.
Friend could highlight the important work she is doing as the Minister for social mobility to make sure that across Government, there is a real drive to help disabled people get the best opportunities to work.
