While the Home Secretary was in Rwanda signing his new treaty, his Department put out a contract to manage small boat arrivals until 2030, at a cost of £700 million to the taxpayer.
Does that not show that even the Home Office does not think the Minister’s plan will work?
That is a total mischaracterisation of what was put out, which was an advert, not a commitment.
I am glad that the hon.
Lady now cares about this issue—not something we have seen previously from Labour.
Our track record is clear: we have got the numbers of small boat arrivals down this year by over a third.
That is what we are doing about it.
The Labour party is voting against every measure that we have taken.
I chair the caucus of 38 Conservative Members of Parliament who have Britain’s longest river flowing through their constituencies, and we have presented a business case to the Chancellor for £500 million to try to manage the river holistically.
Our constituencies are now facing flooding every year, causing damage to our businesses and our communities.
This evening, I have an Adjournment debate on flooding of the River Severn.
Will the Prime Minister take an interest, because the business case shows a gross value added uplift for the west midlands of more than £100 billion if we can manage and tame Britain’s longest river?
