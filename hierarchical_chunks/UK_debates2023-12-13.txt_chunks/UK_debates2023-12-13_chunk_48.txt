I thank the Minister for his statement.
Recommendation 16 of the report references pensions.
In his statement, he said that people can apply for pension that had been accrued, but some individuals will have expected a pension for longer service but been dismissed before they could accrue it.
Will that be taken into account, and will next of kin be able to access those pension benefits?
