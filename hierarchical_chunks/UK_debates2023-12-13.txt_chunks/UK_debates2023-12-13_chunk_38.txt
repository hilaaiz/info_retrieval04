What is worse: losing your WhatsApp messages as a tech bro, losing £11.8 billion to fraud as Chancellor, presiding over the biggest fall in living standards in our history, or desperately clinging on to power when you have become even more unpopular than Boris Johnson?
What matters to me is delivering for the British people, and that is exactly what we are doing.
For the final question, I call Theresa Villiers.
Given the appalling reports of sexual violence committed by Hamas on  7 October  and the risk that hostages could have that treatment inflicted on them as well, will the Prime Minister raise this issue in international forums so  that the international community demands, strongly, humanitarian access to hostages in Gaza?
The reports of sexual violence perpetrated by Hamas are deeply shocking.
We have raised our concerns with the United Nations a fortnight or so ago, and we are engaging with the Israeli Government to consider what further support we can provide.
More broadly, we continue to do everything we can to ensure that all hostages can return safely to their families, including the British hostages and those with links to the UK.
My right hon.
Friend can rest assured that the Foreign Secretary and I are working tirelessly to bring about their safe return.
