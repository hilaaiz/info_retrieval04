I thank the hon.
Member for raising this incredibly important question.
I know she has been working alongside my hon.
Friend  the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris)  on this.
I also thank the emergency services in her constituency.
My understanding is that Lancaster City Council, the Environment Agency, the UK Health Security Agency and the emergency services are working together to ensure that the health risks and environmental consequences are minimised, but I will ensure that the relevant Minister understands the absolute urgency of the issue the hon.
Lady has raised and make sure that she meets them as soon as possible.
