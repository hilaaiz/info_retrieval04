I thank my right hon.
Friend for that answer.
Hostages who have been released have reported Hamas atrocities, such as being subjected to physical and sexual violence in captivity.
The Israeli health service also reports that hostages have been drugged to make them look happy on videos.
Will my right hon.
Friend join me in condemning Hamas for doing that and in demanding that the International Committee of the Red Cross has access to every single one of the hostages immediately?
