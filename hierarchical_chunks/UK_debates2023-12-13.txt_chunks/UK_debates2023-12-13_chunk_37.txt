I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that.
I recall that he and I spoke about it when I was Chancellor, and I praise him for his work and   leadership on this issue in his local area.
I will make sure that the Chancellor does look at the business case.
My hon.
Friend will know that we have significantly increased funding for flood defences, to over £5 billion, protecting hundreds of thousands more homes, but if it is an interesting opportunity for the Chancellor, I am sure he will take that up.
