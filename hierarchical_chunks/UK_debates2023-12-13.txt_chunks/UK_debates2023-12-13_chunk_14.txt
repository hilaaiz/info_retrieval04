I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
Yes, we will.
We have raised the reports of sexual violence attacks on  7 October  with UN Women and with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict.
I will make sure that we continue to do this and to impress upon international organisations that the whole world needs to respond to this.
