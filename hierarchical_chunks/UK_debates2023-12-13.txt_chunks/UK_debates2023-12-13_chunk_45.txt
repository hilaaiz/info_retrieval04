The third point was about financial redress.
I welcome the opportunity that my constituent will now have to feed in how he has been impacted—how he has lived a life alone, because he has carried that shame for all these years.
On behalf of my constituent and all the other LGBT servicemen and women who suffered in that way, I put it on the record that they want the opportunity to feed in their own stories so that the financial redress addresses the harm they suffered.
My right hon.
Friend is right that testimonies are vital.
Those testimonies will ultimately be lodged in the National Archives and they will be part of our national story.
I urge her to encourage her constituents to log on and provide their testimony—that is very important.
I can confirm that the debate will be on the Floor of the House and not in Westminster Hall.
