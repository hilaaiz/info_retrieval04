I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that point.
As she has rightly said, we should all aim to reduce the disability employment gap, and that remains our goal.
To answer her question, I am the lead on those matters for Equalities oral questions.
I am disappointed that I am not enough for her today, but I do lead on those matters for the Department.
All Department for Work and Pensions Ministers take responsibility across our portfolios for removing barriers to progress, and updates to ministerial appointments will be made under the usual process.
