I thank my right hon.
Friend for his work on this specific and important issue.
I am happy to tell him that I believe the Health Secretary is attending this afternoon’s event to hear more about that work.
I can assure him that we are focused on fighting cancer on all fronts: prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research and funding.
We are making good progress, but there is always more we can do.
I look forward to hearing from him after this afternoon’s event.
