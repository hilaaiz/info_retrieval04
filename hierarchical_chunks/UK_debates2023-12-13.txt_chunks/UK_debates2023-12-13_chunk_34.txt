I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend and other colleagues to discuss this.

We are increasing capital investment in mental health urgent care centres and, under the long-term workforce plan, providing the largest expansion of the mental health workforce we have ever seen in this country.
Rather than the Government chaos that is dominating media headlines, much more important to the public, businesses and organisations is their deeply unsatisfactory day-to- day experience of engaging with this dysfunctional Administration.

The most pressing issue facing families is the cost of living.
That is why this Government have delivered what we said, which was to halve inflation, and not only that; we are supplementing it with significant tax cuts, which will benefit working families from January—£450 for a typical person in work—demonstrating that we are absolutely on the side of hard-working families.
This Government are cutting their taxes.
Breast cancer survival rates have improved, but we need to go further on harder-to-reach cancers.
In Parliament this afternoon, there is a drop-in session on lobular breast cancer and the research we need.
Could my right hon.
Friend or his excellent new Secretary of State for Health and Social Care find time in their busy diaries to join us?
