The Prime Minister is rightly focused on taking long-term decisions to improve the lives of people in this country, so can I make a suggestion?
Our mental health legislation is 40 years old, and we made a manifesto commitment in 2017 and 2019 to reform the Mental Health Act 1983 because people with learning disabilities and autism who are sectioned under the Act are being kept in inappropriate accommodation for long periods.
People sectioned under the Act are not receiving the compassionate care they deserve and are, in a sense, criminalised.
They have their mental health condition re-stigmatised by the act of sectioning.
In the absence of a Bill in the King’s Speech, will the Prime Minister agree to meet me and other like-minded colleagues to discuss how we might take forward the reform of the Mental Health Act, because it simply is not fit for the 21st century?
