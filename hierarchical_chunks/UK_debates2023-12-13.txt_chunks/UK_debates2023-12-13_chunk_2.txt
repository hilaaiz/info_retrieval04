The disability pay gap has risen under the Conservatives from 11.7% in 2014 to 13.8% in 2021.
Labour will act to close the gap and to support disabled people by introducing disability pay gap reporting for large employers.
That is good for disabled people, good for business and good for our economy, so why will the Government not follow suit?
We are absolutely committed to supporting disabled people.
Frankly, we are very proud of our record: we have supported more than 1 million disabled people into work, hitting the target five years early, and we are rewiring our benefits system to give a renewed focus on what people can do rather than what they cannot, so that there are opportunities for people to improve their lives and get the pay that they want through their employment.
Disabled people are also being hit hard by the Conservative cost of living crisis that my hon.
Friend  the Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck)  referred to.
On average, the extra cost of disability is equivalent to 63% of household income before housing costs.
I would ask the Minister what discussions she has had with the Minister for disabled people about this important issue, but there is no Minister for disabled people.
Will she tell the House when one will be appointed?
