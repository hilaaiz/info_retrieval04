I welcome the Minister’s statement.
Last week, I met Fighting With Pride and one of my constituents, who I will not name because he has not given me permission to do so.
Three points came across in that meeting.
The first was the importance of testimonies.
He was a grown man who had been discharged in the 1980s and whose mother had received a letter from his commanding officer outing him as gay.
He was still traumatised and crying in my office last week.
This is about making sure that those testimonies are heard.
The second point was about having the debate on the Floor of the House and not farming it out to Westminster Hall.
Will the Minister make sure that the debate happens on the Floor of the House?
