Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of my constituents, Sue and George Cannella.
Sue has worked at the Pregnancy & Family Life Center (``the Center'') as a volunteer two days a week since 2015.
She is the lead volunteer in the Food Pantry and, as such, shoulders the lion's share of responsibility for ensuring that USDA and non-USDA food items are received, maintained and provided to the Center's clients which includes pregnant Moms, Dads, and families.
Sue is extremely dedicated to the clients at the Center and her work pays off.
Last year alone, more than 6,000 clients were helped in the food pantry and 65,000 pounds of food distributed.
Additionally, Sue ensures moms receive essential items needed for their infants and young children to include formula, diapers, pull ups, baby wipes, and wash, as well as age specific clothing items such as onesies, pajamas, shirts, shorts, pants, and shoes.
She does all of this with a warm smile to greet clients, families, staff, and volunteers alike.
No job is too large or challenging for Sue.
Sue and her husband, George, are quite the team.
George comes to the Center at least one day a week to break down numerous boxes which previously contained food or donations from big box stores such as Big Lots or CVS.
George also performs maintenance as needed throughout the Center.
Sue and George distribute nutritious food boxes monthly to five veterans who otherwise would go without much needed food.
They have selfless, generous, and kind hearts in service to Our Lord and the Center's clients.
They remain a source of inspiration and hope for women experiencing planned and unplanned pregnancies.
They understand that a smile, a kind word, or a joke makes all the difference to families in need.
It is clear that 
Mr. and 
Mrs. Cannella have made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for their service.
