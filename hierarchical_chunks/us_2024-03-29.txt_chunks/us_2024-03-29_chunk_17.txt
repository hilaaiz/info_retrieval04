Mr. EMMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Andrew Heger, who was recently sworn in as the Chief of the Chanhassen Fire Department.
Andrew began his career as a firefighter in 2001 in his hometown of Victoria, and after 15 years of service to the department became the city's first full-time fire chief.
But after more than two decades of service with the Victoria Fire Department, Chief Heger was ready for a new challenge.
When he got the offer to serve as the Chief of the Chanhassen Fire Department, Andrew jumped at the opportunity.
Chief Heger was officially sworn in as Chief earlier this month and will be leading a crew of 26 paid-on-call and 10 full-time firefighters.
Being a firefighter isn't just a job, it's a calling.
It's about being there for people when they need help the most, whether it's a fire, a medical emergency, or just lending a helping hand.
For over two decades, Chief Heger has served communities in Carver County with dedication and bravery.
Chanhassen is fortunate to have such a qualified and experienced leader at the helm of its fire department.
I have every confidence that Chief Heger will continue to build upon the department's strong foundation and work to ensure the safety of the Chanhassen community for years to come.
