Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Helen Bandyke, Dearborn resident and one of Michigan's Rosie the Riveters, as she celebrates her 103rd birthday.
During World War II countless women like 
Ms. Bandyke from across the Nation and right here in Southeast Michigan took over jobs that had been previously performed by men and held our country down during extremely trying times.
Ms. Bandyke proudly worked at Chrysler's DeSoto Plant in Dearborn in 1942 while her husband served overseas.
She was among those strong women who blazed the trail for women in the workforce.
I am so proud of 
Ms. Bandyke and her incredible contribution to our Nation's labor movement and our history.
Please join me and the people of Dearborn and Michigan's 12th District Strong as we honor 
Ms. Helen Bandyke and wish her the happiest
