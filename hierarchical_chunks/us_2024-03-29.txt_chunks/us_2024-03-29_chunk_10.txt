Mr. DIAZ-BALART.
Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I rise today to pay tribute to Miriam Urra, an exemplary leader whose dedication and tireless efforts have profoundly impacted Allapattah for decades.
Born in Las Villas, Cuba, Miriam's journey to Miami in 1961 marked the beginning of a life dedicated to service and strengthening her community.
After graduating from Miami Senior High, Miriam pursued higher education at Miami Dade Community College and Florida Memorial College, setting the stage for a career defined by compassion and commitment.
Miriam's professional journey began in the optical field before she and her husband, Orlando Urra, established their own business.
