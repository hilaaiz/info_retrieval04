Mr. Asbury is a father who knows what it is like to have kids in the hospital.
He decided to dedicate his time outside of being an EMT by turning into Batman and visiting kids in hospitals and cancer centers.
He also works with bullied kids and even adults going through hard times.
This man has seen the most horrific things in life, yet still makes time to bring light into people's darkest moments.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that 
Mr. Jack Asbury has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
