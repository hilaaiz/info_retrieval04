Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Betty Burke, who volunteers countless hours each week helping others.
Betty Burke believes that one person can make a difference in this complicated world.
Nearly 20 years ago as a Rotarian, Betty partnered with Farmworkers' Self Help Inc. to establish a mentoring program for young daughters of migrant workers.
The Rotary Program ended in 2020, but Betty continued the program.
She invested time, resources, and money to make certain weekly gatherings at the Clubhouse would continue to broaden the girls' horizons.
The best estimate for the time she spent with them is a remarkable 5,400 hours.
Betty was also a founding member of San Antonio Rotary Club, served as President for two terms, and Assistant Governor for one.
She spearheaded Rotary's taking over the Rattlesnake Festival.
Along with others, Betty started a Farmer's Market, which created a wonderful sense of community.
Additionally, she helped create St. Leo's Pasco County Fair Community Booths, made a giant gingerbread house for the St. Leo/SLU Christmas Village, and continues to support St. Leo.
Betty also works to help children in foster care establish a sense of belonging as they transition from placements and works with partners to make sure their primary needs are met.
It is clear that 
Ms. Betty Burke has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
