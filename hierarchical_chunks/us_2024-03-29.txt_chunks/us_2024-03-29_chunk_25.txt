Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Bicentennial of Seneca County, Ohio.
The values of the pioneers and settlers who overcame the challenges faced during the early years of the county's history have persisted throughout the past 200 years.
The hard work and spirit shown by generations of county residents have made Seneca County an outstanding example of American ingenuity.
Native American tribes inhabited Seneca County before Christopher Columbus arrived in the Americas.
Initially, these tribes were the mound builders.
but they were followed later by the Seneca and Wyandot tribes.
European settlers arrived in the region after General William Henry Harrison established Fort Ball in 1813.
In 1824, the Ohio Legislature enacted legislation creating Seneca County and named it after the original tribes that inhabited the area.
In the 1830s, agriculture spurred commercial activity throughout the county.
With the construction of the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad, the county began to build its economy and population.
Currently, the county encompasses roughly 553 square miles and has a population of over 55,000.
The county is an asset to the great State of Ohio through its many contributions in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture.
