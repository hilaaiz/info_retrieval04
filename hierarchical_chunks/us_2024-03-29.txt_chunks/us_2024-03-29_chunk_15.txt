Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brendan Pardue for being named the Royal Gorge Chamber Alliance's 2023 Distinguished Citizen.
Brendan was raised in Canon City and has spent his life in Colorado.
He attended Regis University and graduated with majors in history, philosophy, and religion and then went on to earn his master's degree in guidance and counseling from the University.
In 2005, Brendan purchased the Gibson Mansion and spent years restoring the house and reviving a historic part.
Since completing the restoration, Brendan has offered free use of the house to nonprofit organizations for fundraisers and other events.
He has also restored 12 other historic buildings in the area.
Brendan's readiness to assist his community is one of many reasons why he is a fitting recipient of the Royal Gorge Chamber Alliance's recognition.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Brendan Pardue for earning this award and thank him for his long standing dedication to our community.
