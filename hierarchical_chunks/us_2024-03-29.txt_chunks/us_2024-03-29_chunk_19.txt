facility in Florence, rescued a man caught in his vehicle after an avalanche, and helped maintain power for a family with a young child who relies on a supplemental oxygen supply.
Under some of the most extreme conditions possible, Fremont County OEM and DOT did an exemplary job of saving lives and serving our community during this storm.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Florence County Office of Emergency Management and Department of Transportation for their outstanding work and service to our communities.
