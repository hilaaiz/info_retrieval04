Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fremont County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) and Department of Transportation (DOT) for their lifesaving work to keep roads clear and restore power during a record-breaking winter storm in March of 2024.
This harsh winter storm brought over thirteen inches of snow and caused major power outages throughout the county.
Staff from the Fremont County Office of Emergency Management, led by Emergency Manager Mykel Kroll, and the Fremont County Department of Transportation, led by Director Mike Whitt, worked overtime and over weekends throughout inclement weather conditions to clear roadways and restore traffic to over 700 miles of mountainous roadways in the county.
Together, they freed an elderly woman who had been trapped in her car by the snow, secured housing for a family who were victims of a fire, restored power to a residential care
