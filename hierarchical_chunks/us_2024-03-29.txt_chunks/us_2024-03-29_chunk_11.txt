A leader, paratrooper and Prisoner of War in the first battalion of the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front Bay of Pigs operation, Orlando Urra remains nothing short of a hero and a legend in the Cuban South Florida community.
A beloved friend and personal source of inspiration as he was, it is a surprise to no one that his wife, Miriam, should have taken up his mantel with equal strength, vigor, and dedication In 1981, Miriam's path took a pivotal turn as she embarked on a new role with the City of Miami, serving as a Counselor for the Entrant Assistance Program.
Through her work, Miriam provided invaluable support to refugees, such as the Cuban Marielitos who sought refuge in our South Florida community, offering counseling, referrals, and guidance to ensure their successful integration into society.
Miriam's dedication to community development only grew stronger as she transitioned to the Department of Community Development, City of Miami, where she served as a Community Involvement Specialist.
In this capacity, she tirelessly advocated for residents, disseminating information about vital city programs and services while championing citizen participation in policymaking processes.
Following the passing of her beloved husband, Orlando, Miriam retired from the City of Miami and embraced a new chapter as the Executive Director.
Under Miriam's leadership, Allapattah Community Action has flourished, overseeing vital programs for the elderly and childcare while also championing affordable housing initiatives.
Her visionary approach and unwavering dedication have transformed lives and uplifted communities.
Miriam's influence reaches well beyond her professional achievements.
As a pillar of our community and a cherished friend, she embodies the essence of what makes Allapattah great.
Serving as a true leader and mentor to countless individuals, myself included, it's with great pride that I recognize her today.
In recognition of her outstanding service and unfaltering dedication, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude to Miriam Urra for her exemplary leadership, love, and commitment to South Florida.
