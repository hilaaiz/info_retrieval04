Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, Jackson Davis, who is currently in his first year of college.
As part of his Eagle Scout Project, Jackson raised enough funds to buy a bus and all the supplies needed to convert the bus into a food pantry on wheels.
He then donated the mobile food pantry to Messengers of Hope for use throughout the community.
For his tremendous efforts, Jackson was recognized as the Eagle Scout Project of the Year for 2023.
Jackson further inspired his family, extended family, friends, and fellow scouts to volunteer at Messengers of Hope to serve groceries and participate in other service projects.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that 
Mr. Jackson Davis has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
