Ms. Contreras Tebbutt's cycling work has also given her the opportunity to connect with our local leaders.
She has built partnerships with the City of Davis's Public Works Program, the City of Woodland's Department of Transportation, the Woodland Chamber, the Woodland City Council, and the Davis City Council.
She has also been an influential voice in the planning of various community cycling events, such as the Zombie Ride, Ice Cream Ride, and the Polar Bear Ride.
