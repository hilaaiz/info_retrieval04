Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Bernardsville on its 100th anniversary.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with them all.
Over the past 100 years, Bernardsville has blossomed into a vibrant town with exquisite natural scenery, rich culture, and a bustling town center.
Bernardsville is also home to my congressional district office, so I can personally attest to its unique charm and history.
I am proud to have such a remarkable town within the 7th district, and I look forward to watching it continue to flourish in the coming decades.
I wish Bernardsville a wonderful centennial anniversary.
May their next century be filled with as much success as this one.
