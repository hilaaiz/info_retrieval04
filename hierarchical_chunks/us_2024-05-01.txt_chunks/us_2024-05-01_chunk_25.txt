Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Thomas Leiser of Dallas, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Thomas has dedicated himself to serving and uplifting our community.
In 1974, Thomas graduated from Indiana University and earned his Juris Doctor from Indiana University School of Law four years later.
He began his career as a clerk and bailiff for Marion County Criminal Courts before being selected to serve as a Deputy Prosecutor.
In 1982, Thomas stepped into the real estate industry and worked as an investment advisor for Leiser Real Estate Advisory in New York City.
After a brief moment serving as an associate business law professor, he began working for the Trammell Crow Company in Dallas and rose up its ranks to become its Senior Managing Director.
With plenty of experience in the commercial real estate market, Thomas co-founded Bandera Ventures in 2003.
Since then, his agency has completed over a hundred real estate projects throughout the United States worth nearly $3 billion dollars.
Currently, Thomas is working on a billion-dollar project to construct a data center.
Separately, Thomas has supported numerous humanitarian initiatives around the world.
He worked closely with the Agape Manna nonprofit to develop a bakery to provide orphaned children in North Korea with food.
Thomas also supported efforts to help North Koreans seek freedom from the Communist regime and begin a new chapter in life in South Korea.
He is the co-founder of Crosswater Ministries, which supports Mission activities for the Highland Park Presbyterian Church to deliver food and medical supplies to Cuban families.
I am proud of the outstanding work Thomas has accomplished for our community and those in need.
I wish him continued success for many years to come.
It is an honor to bestow Thomas with the Patriot Award for his exceptional service to the people.
