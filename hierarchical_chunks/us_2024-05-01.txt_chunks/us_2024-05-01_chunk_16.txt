development.
Students are recognized in their junior year and rewarded for their aspirations to enter public service.
After being selected, students receive a scholarship for graduate or professional school, participate in leadership development activities, and have special opportunities for internships and employment with the federal government.
Congratulations to all of this year's nominees, and I look forward to seeing where each of them go in their future.
