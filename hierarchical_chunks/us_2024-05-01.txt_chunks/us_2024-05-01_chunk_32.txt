Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the department for 76 years of service and in thanking all of the brave volunteers who do not hesitate to drop everything when the community calls in need of help.
To all of these men and women who put themselves in harm's way to protect our residents I say: ``Stay safe.''
