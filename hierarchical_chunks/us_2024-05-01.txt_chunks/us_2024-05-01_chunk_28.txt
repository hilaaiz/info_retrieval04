Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
I am pleased to announce that Nicholas Geraci of North Ridgeville, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Nicholas's offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2028.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies offers the opportunity to serve our country and receive a world-class education.
At the same time, these young men and women undertake one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
Nicholas brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2028.
While attending North Ridgeville High School, he participated in Key Club, coached middle school track and field, coached powder-puff football, and was on the honor roll.
Throughout high school, Nicholas was involved in track and field, earning his varsity letter.
After high school, he attended the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio, majoring in Aerospace Engineering.
