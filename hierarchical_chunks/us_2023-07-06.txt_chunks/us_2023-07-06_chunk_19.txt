Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Muenster State Bank on their 100th Anniversary, celebrating their opening to serve North Texans on July 2, 1923.
Early in 1923, a group of local leaders from the small German Catholic community of Muenster, Texas decided that if the town of less than 450 residents was going to continue to grow and prosper, a bank was necessary.
This group, made up of businessmen and farmers, met in J.W. Meurer's hardware store to request that J.W. take on a leadership role in the formation of this new bank.
The group was apprehensive that the required funds could be raised to supply the necessary capital and deposits, considering that the previous private bank had already failed twice.
Assured that adequate stock could be sold, the group prevailed upon 
Mr. Meurer to continue in his leadership role and to take charge additional assistance and discovered through interviews that experienced bankers could be found but were unaffordable for this new bank venture.
