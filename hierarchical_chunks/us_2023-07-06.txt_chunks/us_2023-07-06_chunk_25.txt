Mr. BACON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General Daryl Bohac, the Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard, on the occasion of his retirement after serving in this position since July of 2013 and as an Air Force officer for 35 years.
As the Adjutant General, he is the senior military officer for the more than 4,500 Army and Air National Guard personnel serving in the state of Nebraska and during his tenure, the Nebraska National Guard deployed over 1,300 Soldiers and over 2,000 Airmen for worldwide combat and peacekeeping missions.
General Bohac is a visionary leader who successfully garnered more than $45 million to modernize and enhance the National Guard in Nebraska to meet and sustain future requirements by constructing a new vehicle maintenance facility in North Platte, Nebraska, a new multimission Readiness Center in Bellevue,
