Nebraska, and new barracks in Mead, Nebraska.
General Bohac and the Nebraska National Guard's disaster response capabilities were tested most notably when a state of emergency was declared following a ``bomb cyclone'' that hit the state in March of 2019, causing severe blizzard conditions in the western panhandle with extreme thunderstorms and historic flooding in the east.
More than 450 Nebraska National Guard Soldiers and Airmen executed 113 flood-related missions, the most significant disaster response operation in state history.
In the wake of the 2019 historic floods, he successfully advocated for more than $43 million in funding to rapidly reconstruct the decimated facilities at Camp Ashland in record time, while also rebuilding the levee to be more robust and resilient to future floods.
On the heels of this historic disaster, the Nebraska National Guard was called upon to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic and response.
The National Guard partnered with the University of Nebraska Medical Center in providing Camp Ashland facilities as an initial housing location for 57 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China.
Further, Major General Bohac worked with the Governor, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other state agencies to set up a State Emergency Operations Center to coordinate and manage COVID-19 emergency actions in Nebraska, directing Soldiers, Airmen, and Emergency Management civilians in response planning, mobile testing teams, personal protective equipment distribution, food bank support, and housing accommodations.
I thank General Bohac for his many years of sacrifice and service to our Nation and the state.
We owe him a debt of gratitude we can never repay for his impactful leadership and achievements that will be felt for many future generations.
