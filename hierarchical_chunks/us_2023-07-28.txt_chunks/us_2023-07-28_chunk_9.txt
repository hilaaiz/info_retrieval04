Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the work of World Harvest United Churches during their 2023 National Holy Gathering in Dumfries, Virginia.
An annual event, the National Holy Gathering brings people together in the spirit of service.
This year's theme is ``Ignite 2023,'' and it is guided by Matthew 5:14-16: ``You are the light of the world.
A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.''
Guided by Presiding Prelate Bishop Calvin B. Davis, Sr., and hosted by Virginia State Bishop Kenneth W. Jones, Sr., this gathering provides attendees with activities, classes, and worship events.
It culminates with a day of volunteerism and outreach in conjunction with Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Women of Worth, and Project-Mend-A-House.
Finally, ``Ignite 2023'' would not be possible without the hard work of community leaders like Bishop George W. Thigpen, III, Bishop of Outreach, Pastor Kathleen Deane, National Director of Outreach, Elder Daniel M. Deane, Sr., Adjutant General, Bishop Rick Boykin, Co-Adjutor to the State Bishop, and Lady Michelle Thigpen, Director of Women of Worth Virginia.
