Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Goodfellows, a charitable organization, based in the city of Dearborn in Michigan's 12th District Strong, as they celebrate 100 years of giving.
Founded in 1923 as the Good Cheer Club, Goodfellows is Dearborn's oldest charitable organization.
Local business owners came together to raise money by selling newspapers to ensure ``no child without Christmas.''
That became the organization's motto.
Over the years, Goodfellows has grown in its reach and capacity, partnering with local fire and police departments to serve families in need from far beyond its beginnings in Dearborn.
Countless families can count on their holiday gift distribution program, an event I happily volunteer my time to each year.
And even more families are served by their school supply drives, scholarships and even emergency funding.
