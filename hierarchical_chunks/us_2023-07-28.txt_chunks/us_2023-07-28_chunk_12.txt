Mr. Speaker, I proudly support a resolution calling for Marc's immediate release and I urge my colleagues to do the same, today, on his birthday.
I also encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4388, the Marc Fogel Act, to ensure transparency and accountability at the State Department when wrongful determinations are considered.
