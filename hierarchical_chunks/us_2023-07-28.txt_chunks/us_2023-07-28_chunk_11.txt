Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart on Marc Fogel's 62nd birthday.
Marc, a native of Butler County, Pennsylvania, isn't celebrating with his family today because he's wrongfully detained in Russia.
On August 14, 2021, Marc was returning to Russia for the start of the school year at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, where he teaches.
But instead, he was arrested at the airport.
Since his arrest, Marc was sentenced and is currently serving an exorbitant 14-year hard labor sentence.
His situation qualifies for a ``wrongly detained'' status from the U.S. Department of State, yet this determination has not been made despite repeated requests from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including me.
