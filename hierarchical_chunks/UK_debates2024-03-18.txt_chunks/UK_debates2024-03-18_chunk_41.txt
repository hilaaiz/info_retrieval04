The last Labour Government lifted 1 million children out of poverty.
After 14 years of Tory Government, we have 1 million children in destitution.
What has gone wrong?
I have to take issue with the hon.
Gentleman.
He needs to look more closely at his party’s record in government.
Fact No. 1 is that the Labour party always leaves office with higher unemployment.
Fact No. 2 is that economic inactivity in our country is lower than in any year in his party’s time in office.
Fact No. 3 is that absolute poverty has declined in our country since his party was in office.
Fact No. 4 is that there were more children in workless households on his watch than there are on ours.
Perhaps most tellingly of all, during his party’s time in office, over 1 million people languished on long-term benefits for almost a decade.
That is a disgraceful record.
One of the most challenging groups of people to get back into the workforce is those in their 50s and 60s whose jobs disappeared during covid.
They have possibly fallen  back on their personal pensions, although with inflation, that money is being eaten away.
What actions is my hon.
Friend taking to get those people back into work, and to encourage them into jobs that are valuable and improve our productivity?
