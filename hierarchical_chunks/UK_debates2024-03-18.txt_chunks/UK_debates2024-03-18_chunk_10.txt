I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting this point.
There is the household support fund, help to claim, and opportunities to pop into the local library to get additional support, for example.
There is also an extra £500 million out there on top of the £1 billion through to the end of this month.
I would say to anybody: “The benefits calculator is out there, and do talk to the CAB and your local council”—perhaps in Swindon.
