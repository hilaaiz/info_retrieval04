I thank my hon.
Friend for his reply.
South Derbyshire pensioners have been in touch with me following the Budget, emailing to say that it seemed to offer them nothing.
Would he be kind enough to set out today the help that the Government have given and are giving to pensioners, to help them realise that “nothing” is far from the reality of what a Conservative Government are giving them?
