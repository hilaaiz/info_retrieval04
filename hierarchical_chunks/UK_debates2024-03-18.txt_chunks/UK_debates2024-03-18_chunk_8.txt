I thank the hon.
Lady for her point about vulnerable customers who have come into our curtilage and purview.
The Minister for Employment has reminded me that we will take this very slowly, and will engage with and support customers.
Customers can speak to help to claim advisers at Citizens Advice, and we will ensure that we listen to them.
