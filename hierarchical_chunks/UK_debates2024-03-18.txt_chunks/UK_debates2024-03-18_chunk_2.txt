The Secretary of State was asked— What steps his Department is taking to support financially people unable to work due to serious medical conditions.
My Department does a great deal to support the long-term sick and disabled, including through universal credit and its health element, and through the personal independence payment, which is a contribution to the additional costs of sickness and disability.
My constituent Jenifer Picton is currently undergoing extensive treatment for cancer and is consequently unable to work.
I wish Ms Picton all the very best with her treatment.
She has come to my office, which has helped with universal credit, PIP and the new-style employment and support allowance.
She has now managed to get PIP, but given that she is seriously ill, why should she have to come to my office for help?
Why do we make it so arduous and difficult for people who need treatment to get help?
