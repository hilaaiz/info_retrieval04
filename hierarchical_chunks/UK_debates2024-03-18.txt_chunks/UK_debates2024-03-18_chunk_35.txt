The Resolution Foundation highlights that scrapping the two-child limit would be one of the most efficient ways to drive down child poverty rates, and would lift 490,000 children out of poverty overnight.
Surely one child growing up in poverty is one child too many.
The Secretary of State should reverse course on this, and the Labour party should also commit to scrapping the two-child limit.
Does the Secretary of State agree that no child should grow up in poverty, and will he take action to ensure that that stops now?
The hon.
Lady raises the same point as her colleague,  the hon.
Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald) , about the two-child limit.
I will not detain the House by repeating exactly the same answer, other than to agree passionately with her that one child in poverty is one too many, and to say that, although we have further to go, it is important to recognise that we have reduced the number of children in absolute poverty, after housing costs, by 400,000 since 2010.
As chair of the all-party parliamentary group for disability, I thank the Minister for recognising Sign Language Week in the Chamber.
It is so important for disability inclusion in the workplace.
Will she recommend that hon.
Members from across the House meet representatives of the British Deaf Association, who are now welcoming people in Dining Room A at an event I am co-sponsoring?
I am delighted to welcome Sign Language Week, which is marking its 21st anniversary of recognising British Sign Language as a language in its own right.
I encourage Members to join the British Deaf Association reception after these questions have ended.
The Government will move thousands of my constituents across to universal credit over the next year.
They will be forced to wait five weeks for their first payment or  up to nine weeks if they receive child or working tax credits.
According to DWP data, 60% of the people across Merseyside who are in that situation will take out an advance loan.
Does the Minister think it right that my constituents, who are among the most deprived in the country, should be pushed into debt or face weeks without the bare minimum that they need to afford the essentials?
The plan is to roll out those migration notices by  31 March .
We intend to publish data for the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency.
We are committed to ensuring that the transition works as smoothly as possible for everyone.
Has the Minister made any recent assessment of what trades or occupations are short of workers at the moment,  and what steps are being taken to persuade people—perhaps more experienced people—back into the workforce to fill those vacancies?
We are working with other Departments, employers and stakeholders to isolate where those vacancies are, and on sector-based work academy programmes.
We have put over 266,000 people through construction, care, tourism, hospitality—all those gaps that we need to fill.
Of people currently claiming tax credits, 20% are not moving over to universal credit in the migration.
The Department tells us that those who are not claiming would have got a median amount of £3,200 a year.
Will the Minister assure me and the House that she is doing everything she can to ensure that people are getting the money that they are owed?
I assure the hon.
Lady that we are keeping a close eye on the issue, but ultimately it is the customer’s responsibility to claim.
I gently point out that we have been rolling out the migration in her constituency since May ’23, with not one complaint.
There is plenty of help available to those people as they transition.
As my right hon.
Friend will know, fast diagnosis and treatment are key to getting people back into work.
What representations has he made to his departmental and Cabinet colleagues to ensure that that is the case?
