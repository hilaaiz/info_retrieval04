I thank the Minister for giving way.
The Rwanda plan will not work as the deterrent that Ministers claim it will, not least because it will only account for less than 1% of all those seeking to cross the channel irregularly.
Where is the plan for the other 99%?
Will the Minister concede that instead of fixing their broken asylum system, the Conservatives have spent an eye-watering £5.4 billion on this, including over £4 billion on asylum hotels and accommodation?
That is what is at the crux of the matter, and that is what they need to resolve.
