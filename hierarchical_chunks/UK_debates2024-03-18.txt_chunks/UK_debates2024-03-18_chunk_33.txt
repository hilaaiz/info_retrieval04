In the Budget, the Chancellor said that he wants to end national insurance contributions because the “double taxation of work is unfair.”—[Official
Report,  6 March 2024 ; Vol. 746, c. 851.]
People’s NICs records help to determine their entitlement to the state pension, so if national insurance is scrapped how will they know what pension they will get?
I am not surprised that the hon.
Lady brings that up, because I am well aware of the position that her party has taken on the announcements that we have made.
She will be clear in her own mind that the Chancellor has not guaranteed that we will reduce at one stroke national insurance contributions; it is an aspiration that has been spoken about as occurring over a number of years, if not Parliaments, so the problems that she is conjuring up to frighten pensioners are nothing short of political scaremongering.
