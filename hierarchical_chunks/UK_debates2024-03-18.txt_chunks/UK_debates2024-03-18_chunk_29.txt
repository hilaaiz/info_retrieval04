What recent estimate he has made of the average time it takes for claimants to complete medical assessments for personal independence payment claims.
We treat all claimants individually, recognising the differing needs of health conditions and disabilities, and the impact on claimants’ daily lives.
The length of time for an assessment is not included in the contract between the DWP and providers, but I can confirm that the average time for 2023 was 63 minutes.
I was heartbroken to hear the experience of a constituent who had to go through an enhanced medical assessment for PIP.
A bowel cancer survivor with severe arthritis, she was made to stay on a phone call for over three hours to be assessed.
That meant that, due to her needs, she had to suffer the indignity of soiling herself just to complete the assessment.
How on earth can that be okay?
I would like to understand what steps are being taken to reduce the times of these assessments and to hear what can be done to ensure they are finally undertaken with basic human compassion.
