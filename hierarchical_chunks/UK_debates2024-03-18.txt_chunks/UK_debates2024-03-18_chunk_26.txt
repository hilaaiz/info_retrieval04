I thank my hon.
Friend for drawing attention to her jobs fair.
She is a local dynamo in standing up for her constituents.
When I arrived there recently thinking I was very special to support yet another jobs fair—a disability jobs fair—I was quickly reminded of the fact that I was the 32nd Minister to have been to her constituency in, I think, the past 12 months.
