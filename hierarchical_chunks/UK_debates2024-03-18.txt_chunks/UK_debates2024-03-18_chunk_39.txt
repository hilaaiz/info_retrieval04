The number of the long-term sick has risen from 2.1 million pre-pandemic to 2.8 million today.
This huge increase started in spring 2021, at the same time as the roll-out of the experimental, emergency-use vaccines—or does the Secretary of State have an alternative explanation for the unprecedented rise in long-term sickness in the UK since spring 2021?
Among the major drivers of the increase to which the hon.
Gentleman refers are mental health issues and musculoskeletal issues.
I am not entirely sure that he is accurate when he says that the upward trajectory in the number occurred just as vaccination occurred—I think it predated that moment—and I certainly do not subscribe to the view that vaccination is in any way unsafe.
For many years, the Department published statistics giving a breakdown of welfare claims by nationality.
Although the Department still has the data, it no longer publishes the statistics.
Will the Minister look again at that, and start publishing those important statistics once again?
