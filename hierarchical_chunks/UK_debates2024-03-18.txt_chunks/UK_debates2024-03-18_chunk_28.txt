I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
The challenging fiscal environment means that we need to prioritise resources and ensure that support is targeted effectively to maximise impact for citizens.
I chair a cross-Government group with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities on quality issues and other matters, such as subsidy loss, which she raises.
We will continue to review and monitor the concerns that she and other local authorities have raised.
However, I point to the local housing allowance uplift, which is a central focus for me.
