I thank my hon.
Friend for her answer, and may I be the first in the Chamber to wish her a very happy birthday?
In addition to the issues that she has highlighted, may I highlight the wonderful work that Darlington jobcentre has done in setting up its Facebook page?
Does she agree that it is a template for others to follow, and will she come to Darlington and meet my fantastic work coaches?
