I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising a distressing case.
The DWP is committed to assessing people as quickly as possible.
I am happy to look into that particular situation to see why, in this case, the support the claimant was entitled to did not come promptly.
Prioritising the reduction of processing times to maximise the number of assessments completed without affecting quality is key, but I am very happy to take that case away.
