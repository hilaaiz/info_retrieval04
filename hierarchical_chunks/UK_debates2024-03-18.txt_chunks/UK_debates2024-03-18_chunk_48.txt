The Minister seemed to try to brush over some of the costs involved.
Is he aware that Virgin Galactic can send six people into space for less than this Government want to spend sending one person to Rwanda?
Is it not time to rethink this absurd policy and its extortionate costs?
We had a debate on Thursday on the costs of the scheme and not a single Labour Back Bencher was there.
There was only  the right hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson) , who proposed the debate, and the shadow Minister.
Of course, I do not treat the right hon.
Lady as an ordinary Back Bencher, because she is the Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee.
It was her debate, and not a  single other Labour Back Bencher was there.
That shows the lack of priority that Labour Members give to this matter.
