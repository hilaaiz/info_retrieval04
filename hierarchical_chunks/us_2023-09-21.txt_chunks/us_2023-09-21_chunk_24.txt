with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
Her service to this nation and community speaks to the best.
Ellen enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1994.
Recognizing her innate leadership capabilities, the Air Force sent her to officer training after only two and a half years as an enlisted Airman.
During the five years she served as a commissioned officer, Ellen rose to the rank.
Before leaving the U.S. Air Force in 1998, she served as Commander of a communications unit in Alaska.
During her active service she was recognized with the Air Force Commendation Medal w/1 device, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award w/1 device, and the National Defense Service Medal, together with a Good Conduct Medal, Air Force Longevity Service Award, Air Force Overseas Long Tour Ribbon, and Air Force Training Ribbon w/1 device.
Ellen has given much to her community.
In 2007 she joined the Crockett Noon Lions Club and was instrumental in forming the Leo Club where she served as Sponsor.
She established a new Evening Lions Club and served as its first President.
She has spent countless hours investing in the lives of the members and youth, teaching leadership, character, and kindness.
She is a member of First United Methodist Church.
Whether working to keep her community clean or distributing food to the needy, Ellen can always be counted on.
In 2020, the Crockett Area Chamber of Commerce recognized Ellen's service to the community with its highest honor, Citizen of the Year.
Her leadership will have a long-lasting effect on young people for years to come--and it is my honor to award Ellen M. Brooks of Crockett, Texas, a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
