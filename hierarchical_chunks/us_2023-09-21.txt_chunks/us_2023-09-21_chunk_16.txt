the approach Conservation Beyond Borders and Dr. Benjamin-Fink take to incorporate rural communities that live alongside wildlife into their work.
I commend Conservation Beyond Borders for their tireless work and advocacy to ensure wildlife across the world have the opportunity to flourish.
I look forward to continuing to work with Conservation Beyond Borders and Dr. Nicole Benjamin-Fink.
