Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Owens Community College's Findlay Campus in Findlay, Ohio.
Throughout the years, Owens has been a comprehensive community college providing educational opportunities and training to the residents of our communities.
The hard work and spirit shown by generations of students and faculty have made Owens an outstanding educational institution.
Originally, Owens Community College was founded in 1965 in Wood County.
The college was name after Michael J. Owens, a Toledo-based inventor of automated glass bottle-making technology.
In 1983 Owens opened their Findlay Campus which occupies more than 60 acres.
With their new campus, Owens was able to expand its coverage and continue to provide education to students from all walks of life.
Currently, Owens's service district includes Lucas, Wood, Hancock, and parts of Ottawa counties.
Owens Community College offers more than 160 programs and certificates to its students who are preparing for a career, retraining for a new career, seeking professional development, or obtaining credits to transfer to a 4-year college or university.
Their dedicated faculty members bring industry knowledge, information, and ideas into the classroom to provide students with a better understanding, how studies will translate into careers.
Outside the classroom, students can experience an enriching campus life through student activities, clubs and organizations, athletics, and volunteer activities.
