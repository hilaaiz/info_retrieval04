Ms. TITUS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saturday, October 7th, as Ageism Awareness Day.
Ageism Awareness Day provides us all with an opportunity to recognize the existence and impact of ageism in our country.
We are fortunate to live in a time in which medicine and technology can allow individuals to live long and full lives.
As society begins to grow older, however, too many individuals experience ageism, or stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based on age.
Ageism is the most widespread and socially accepted form of prejudice.
It can be found throughout society, from our workplaces to our health systems to stereotypes broadcast in the media.
Not only is ageism harmful in and of itself, but it also exacerbates many of the other ``isms'', including racism, sexism, and ableism, which compound and worsen mental and physical health outcomes for affected individuals.
I am proud to represent Southern Nevada, a place that has long been a welcoming home to nearly 375,000 seniors.
They enrich our community tremendously, and their value should not be diminished by undue prejudice and discrimination.
Organizations such as Nevada Senior Services provide essential services to individuals across Southern Nevada as they age and ensure that aging is not viewed with fear or hostility.
Nevada Senior Services not only operates the Adult Day Care Centers of Las Vegas and Henderson, but also Caregiver Support Programs, Respite and Personal Care, RAMP Home Modifications, Hospital 2 Home Assistance, and the Care Partner Institute.
I applaud and support the goals and ideals of Ageism Awareness Day which sheds light on the plight of many individuals and brings the Nation together to promote acceptance and appreciation of the gifts of aging persons.
I thank all the family members, professionals, and volunteers who assist aging individuals every day and help fight the stigma of ageism.
