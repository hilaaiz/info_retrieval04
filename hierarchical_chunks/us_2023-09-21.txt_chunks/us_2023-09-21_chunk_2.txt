Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the work of the Women Inspiring Women Leaders chapter of the American Business Women's Association (ABWA) in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
ABWA's Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter held its first meeting on May 22, 2019.
Since then, the organization has provided opportunities for local business leaders to network, empower one another, and focus on growing Virginia's economy.
Entrepreneurship is a defining characteristic of the American spirit.
That's why I am proud to join them and their sister chapters in celebrating American Business Women's Day.
