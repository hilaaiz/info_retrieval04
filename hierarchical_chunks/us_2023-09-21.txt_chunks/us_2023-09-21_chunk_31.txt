Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Owens Community College and its students, faculty, and administration on this remarkable occasion.
By celebrating the 40th anniversary, community members and Ohio residents recognize Owens's contribution to its students and the surrounding communities.
Congratulations to Owens Community College on this significant milestone.
