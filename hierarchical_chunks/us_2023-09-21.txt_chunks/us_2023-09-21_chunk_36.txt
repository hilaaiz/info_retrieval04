Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Colonel Pitliangas during his time representing the United States Transportation Command on Capitol Hill.
On behalf of our grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of Mark, his wife, Eleni, and their children, Stephanos, George, and Nicholas.
I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in our United States Air Force.
They have dedicated their lives to the service of our great Nation.
Aim High...
Fly, Fight, and Win.
