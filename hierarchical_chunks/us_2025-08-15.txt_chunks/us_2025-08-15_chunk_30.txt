Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Detective Paul Gesi for his service, for his sacrifice, and for the countless lives in my district made better by his work.
May we remember him always, and may God grant comfort and peace to all who mourn his loss.
May he rest easy.
We have the watch from here.
