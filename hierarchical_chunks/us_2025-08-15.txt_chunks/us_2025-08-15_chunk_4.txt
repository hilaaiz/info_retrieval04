Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor California Waterfowl as it celebrates 80 years of dedicated conservation service.
This organization's decades long work protecting California's waterfowl and wetland resources has made it the largest state-based waterfowl group in the United States and a vital force for environmental stewardship in our state and district.
California Waterfowl was founded in 1945 as the Duck Hunters Association of California by hunters concerned about the rapid loss of wetlands.
At the time, California had already lost 90 percent of its original wetlands, and few resources were dedicated to reversing this trend.
In 1985, the organization partnered with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to conduct studies that revealed most mallards harvested by hunters in the state were hatched locally, a finding that underscored the importance of in-State habitat to the health of the entire Pacific Flyway.
Today, California Waterfowl includes more than 20,000 members united by a shared vision of a California abundant in waterfowl, vibrant wetlands, and thriving hunting communities.
Over the past four decades, the organization has invested $280 million in conservation efforts and completed more than 1,500 projects to protect, restore, and enhance nearly 730,000 acres of waterfowl habitat statewide.
More than half of these projects occurred on public lands, including significant work in the Suisun Marsh and California Delta.
Recognizing the importance of agriculture to conservation, California Waterfowl has also partnered with landowners through programs such as the Delayed Wheat Harvest Incentive, Rice Levee and Agricultural Corridors Program, and Fallow Agriculture Program to support nesting waterfowl and pollinators while maintaining productive farmland.
The organization's research and education efforts have contributed significantly to wildlife science and public awareness.
Its Wood Duck Program has successfully hatched more than one million ducklings and distributed over 165,000 wood duck boxes.
More than 180,000 students have participated in their conservation education programs.
In 2009, the Hunt Program was launched to improve land access for hunters, now serving nearly 2,000 participants annually.
The Veteran Hunt Program has supported over 5,000 service members, while broader outreach efforts have introduced more than 28,000 Californians to hunting and outdoor stewardship.
