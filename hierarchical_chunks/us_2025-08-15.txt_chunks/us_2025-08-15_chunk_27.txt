Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the groundbreaking for the first expansion phase of Jerry Richardson Stadium at my alma mater, UNC Charlotte.
I look forward to the positive impact these renovations will have on the UNC Charlotte football program, student-athletes, fans, and the entire community.
I am proud to be associated with a university that is shaping North Carolina's future through education, innovation, and now, world-class athletic facilities.
