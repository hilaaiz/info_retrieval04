Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the groundbreaking first expansion phase at my alma mater's, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Jerry Richardson Stadium.
It is a privilege to honor UNC Charlotte and the 49ers community on this occasion that represents progress, pride, and great potential.
On August 27, 2025, the ceremony for the first expansion phase at Jerry Richardson Stadium, home of the UNC Charlotte 49ers football team, will commence.
The renovations will include a new west tower that will house team dining, recruiting space, and a community event area.
This groundbreaking will support Charlotte's growing role as a college football and sports tourism hub, as well as lay the foundation for the next generation of milestones, championship seasons, and moments to inspire pride across our entire state and region.
The renovations will significantly enhance fans' experiences by offering premium seating, including suites, club seating, boxes, ledge seating, and an east and west deck outdoor patio space.
The beginning stages of the new project will increase capacity from just over 15,000 to over 18,000, with the potential to expand to 21,000 in future phases.
These renovations will provide UNC Charlotte with new opportunities to host bowl games, high school championships, concerts, and community events.
