Mr. Speaker, Dario Sattui and V. Sattui Winery's 50 years of winemaking excellence, environmental stewardship, and community service have profoundly shaped Napa Valley's cultural and agricultural landscape.
It is fitting and proper that we honor them today for their remarkable contributions to our community and their unwavering commitment to preserving our valley's heritage while inspiring future generations.
