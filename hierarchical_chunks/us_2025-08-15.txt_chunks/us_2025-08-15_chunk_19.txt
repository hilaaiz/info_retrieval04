Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker I rise today, along with my colleague, 
Mr. Huffman, to honor Dr. Lynn Cominsky, an esteemed member of the Sonoma County educational community.
After 39 years of service to Sonoma State University, Dr. Cominsky will assume the title of Emerita EdEon Director, marking a major milestone in her remarkable career championing public science education and outreach.
Dr. Cominsky earned her bachelor of arts in physics from Brandeis University in 1975, graduating magna cum laude with honors in chemistry.
She went on to earn her Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981.
In 1986, she joined the faculty of Sonoma State University as an associate professor of physics and astronomy, becoming a full professor at the university in 1991.
She served as Chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 2004 to 2019, and twice as Chair of the Chemistry Department from 2005 to 2007 and again from 2018 to 2019.
Through her cross-disciplinary leadership, Dr. Cominsky helped shape the academic direction of Sonoma State for nearly four decades.
Throughout her tenure, Dr. Cominsky worked to expand equity in STEM education, especially for underserved and underrepresented students.
She was instrumental in supporting Sonoma State's designation as a Hispanic-Serving Institution and helped develop national resources for autistic learners.
She secured tens of millions of dollars in grant funding to support inclusive science programming and reduce bias and harassment in academia.
Dr. Cominsky also founded and led EdEon STEM Learning, Sonoma State's education and outreach center focused on space and Earth science.
Under her direction, EdEon developed K-14 curriculum and classroom tools that engaged students and educators in cutting-edge research and inquirybased learning.
In partnership with NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education, EdEon created innovative ways to
