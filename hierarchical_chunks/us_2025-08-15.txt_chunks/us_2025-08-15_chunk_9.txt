Mr. Sattui's commitment to our community extends far beyond winemaking.
He has donated $1.6 million to support the Calistoga Boys & Girls Club and contributed $1 million to the Calistoga School District to expand its preschool program.
His generosity has also benefited St. Helena Public Schools Foundation, Napa Valley education programs, and disaster relief efforts, including a $100,000 contribution to support victims of the 2017 fires.
Through conservation easements with the Land Trust of Napa Valley, Mr Sattui has also protected more than 600 acres from future development, ensuring these lands remain available for agriculture and open space in perpetuity.
