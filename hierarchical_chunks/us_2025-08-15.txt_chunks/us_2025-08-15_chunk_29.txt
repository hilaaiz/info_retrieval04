Mr. EVANS.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life and service of Detective Paul Gesi--a hero whose dedication to the ideals of justice and the protection of his community spanned more than four decades.
Paul devoted 41 years of his life to public service through law enforcement, 39 of them with the Northglenn Police Department, where he served as the department's Homicide Detective.
That noble work is demanding in every sense--it calls for skill, persistence, and deep compassion.
Paul brought all of those qualities to the job and more.
He passionately pursued the truth and justice in the cases that he worked to honor the victims of serious crimes.
When families in our community grappled with the grief that accompanies the loss of a loved one, Detective Gesi was a gentle presence and steady hand to help comfort those suffering unimaginable pain.
But Paul's service was not confined to his career.
He served as a teacher at the Citizens' Police Academy, spoke with students in local schools, and was a trusted friend to many in the community.
He lived out his faith in Christ every day, and he was a devoted single father to six children, raising them with the same love and strength he projected in the force.
Last week, after a long battle with post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the burdens of his work, Paul left us.
The loss of this titan in the Northglenn Police Department is a sobering, painful reminder of the unseen wounds that can come with a life spent protecting others.
During their career, the average police officer will experience 178 life-threatening situations; the average citizen will experience three.
Detective Gesi leaves behind a deep void--in his family, among his fellow officers, and across the City.
Yet his example of courage, integrity, and selfless service will endure.
As we, alongside his family and the City of Northglenn, make our final goodbyes, we do so with gratitude for his life and with a renewed commitment to care for the first responders and protectors who bear the weight of protecting our communities.
