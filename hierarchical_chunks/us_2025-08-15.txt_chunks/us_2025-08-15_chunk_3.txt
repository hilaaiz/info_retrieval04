Mr. Lambert served in the Asiatic Pacific Theater of Combat Operations where our troops not only halted the Japanese advance, but pushed them back island by island, freeing the inhabitants of those communities.
It is my distinct honor to acknowledge the service of Cabe Monroe Lambert to the United States of America and to our world.
