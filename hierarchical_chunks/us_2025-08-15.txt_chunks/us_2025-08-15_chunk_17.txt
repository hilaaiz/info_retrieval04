Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. James Horn on his upcoming retirement as President and Chief Officer of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation.
After over a decade as the leader of Jamestown, the site of America's first permanent settlement, Dr. Horn will conclude his illustrious career.
Dr. Horn's passion for history has helped expand our understanding of America's beginning.
He has served as the President of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation since 2015, steering the organization through a period full of novel discoveries, enlightening research, and critical preservation efforts.
While President, Dr. Horn oversaw the restoration of Jamestown's Memorial Church and its famed 17th century tower, ensuring that the site, which hosted Virginia's first General Assembly in 1619, stands as a beacon of democracy for years to come.
During his time at Jamestown, Dr. Horn ushered in new educational and community programs, sharing a critical time in American history with the public.
He also aided in fundraising over $16 million dollars to help protect Jamestown from flooding risks, preserving the park for future generations.
Beyond his service at Jamestown, Dr. Horn remains an active and prolific historian, having published nine books and numerous articles on colonial America.
He also has worked for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and taught several classes at the University of Virginia and the College of William & Mary.
Dr. Horn has dedicated his life's work to researching, writing and teaching about our most treasured institution: our democracy.
