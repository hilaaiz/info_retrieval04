Mr. Speaker, California Waterfowl's 80 years of conservation leadership have helped restore and protect hundreds of thousands of acres of critical habitat while educating generations of Californians about the importance of wetland conservation.
Their work continues to benefit our state and district's wildlife, agriculture, and outdoor recreation opportunities.
It is fitting and proper that we honor them today for their outstanding service to our region's natural resources and conservation heritage.
