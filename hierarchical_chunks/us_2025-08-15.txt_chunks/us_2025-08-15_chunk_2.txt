Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Cabe Monroe Lambert, the last living World War II Veteran of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians.
Mr. Lambert was born on September 25, 1926, and currently lives in the Wolftown community on the Qualla Boundary in Cherokee, North Carolina.
Mr. Lambert is deeply loved by his community and family.
As a member of the greatest generation, 
Mr. Lambert answered the call II.
While in combat, Cabe Monroe Lambert fought the Axis Powers that were advancing across independent, sovereign countries.
Mr. Lambert prevented forces with evil intent from reaching our great country and liberated countless people.
We owe a debt that we can never repay but will always remember and honor.
Without brave men and women like Mr. Lambert, our world would undoubtedly be a much darker place.
