Mr. Groff began his service as a firefighter, joining the then-called Liberty Fire Company at his friends' invitation when he was 17 years old.
From his early days with the department, he demonstrated a heartfelt dedication to bettering his community, saving countless victims from fires, and of all kinds of danger, particularly vehicular incidents.
Having entered prior to the implantation of modern rescue technology, such as the Hurst Power Rescue Tool, 
Mr. Groff rescued victims by hand and demonstrated an undeterred spirit for service.
For 19 years, he served as a career emergency medical technician, or EMT, with Brickerville Fire & EMS Company.
He went on to become GSFR's EMS sergeant, where he played a key role in securing a Quick Response Service certification from the Pennsylvania State Department.
Throughout his time with Garden Spot Fire Rescue, he has helped further the department's reputation for safety, excellence, and efficiency.
Despite battling cancer, 
Mr. Groff remains committed to serving his community.
His unwavering stamina toward making a difference deserves recognition.
I am grateful for his selfless years of service to his community and for all he has done for Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District.
I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
