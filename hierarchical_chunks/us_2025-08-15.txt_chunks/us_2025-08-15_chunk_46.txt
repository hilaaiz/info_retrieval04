Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. Parker for his 27 years of service to the Quakertown community, and I am honored to congratulate him on his welldeserved retirement.
His efforts have made an everlasting impact on generations of students, enriching their lives through music education and inspiring a deep appreciation for the arts.
