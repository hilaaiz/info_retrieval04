and commitment to environmental stewardship have made V. Sattui one of our most treasured wineries and a cornerstone of Napa Valley's agricultural heritage.
Born in San Francisco in 1941 to George and Lucille Sattui, Mr. Sattui grew up understanding the importance of family legacy and hard work.
He earned his bachelor of science in accounting and finance from San Jose State University in 1965, followed by his master of business administration with an emphasis in Marketing from the University of California, Berkeley in 1969.
The story of V. Sattui Winery began in 1885 when 
Mr. Sattui's greatgrandfather, Vittorio Sattui, immigrated from Genoa, Italy, and established a thriving San Francisco winery that operated for 35 years before Prohibition forced its closure.
In 1975, nearly four decades later, 
Mr. Sattui revived the family dream by re-establishing V. Sattui Winery in our Napa Valley.
When the winery opened its doors on March 4, 1976, it became the 46th winery to operate in Napa Valley since Prohibition, with 
Mr. Sattui's vision of creating a Napa d'Italia where guests could experience the good life through exceptional wine and warm hospitality.
V. Sattui's commitment to excellence has been widely recognized.
The winery has been named ``Winery of the Year'' at the California State Fair four times, earned the title ``Best Winery in the Western U.S.'' at the Critics Challenge Wine Competition, and received ``Domestic Winery of the Year'' from the San Diego International Wine & Spirits Challenge.
In 2023, V. Sattui converted to 100 percent organic farming across 200 acres spanning four counties, demonstrating 
Mr. Sattui's dedication to sustainable agriculture and environmental protection.
