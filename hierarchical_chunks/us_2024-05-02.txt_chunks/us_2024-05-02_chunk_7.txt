Mr. KELLY.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to serve on the Board of Trustees of the John C. Stennis Center for Public Service which, as part of its mission, seeks to encourage young people to careers in public service.
Public Service Review, a quarterly publication produced by the Center, does just that.
I would like to encourage anyone seeking hope for our nation's future to read the recently released Fall 2023 edition.
In this issue you will find students' reflections from their time serving on their college campuses and in their state and federal governments as well as interviews of public servant leaders.
Featured students include Arielle Galinsky of Tufts University, Sam Guerrero of the University of Alabama, Rohini Achal of the University of Washington, Jacob Greenberg of the University of Vermont, Kennedy Guest of the University of Mississippi, Weiss O'Connor of the U.S. Air Force Academy, Anusha Fathepure of the University of Oklahoma, and Avraham Spraragen.
The work of these students shows their passion for serving and their commitment to bettering our country.
On behalf of my fellow Stennis Center Board of Trustees members, U.S. 
Senator Chris Coons, 
Mr. Tom Daffron, U.S. 
Representative Terri Sewell, and U.S. 
Senator Roger Wicker, I would like to congratulate the Stennis Center on a wonderful publication and encourage everyone to read Public Service Review Fall 2023 at <a href='http://www.stennis.gov.
