Mr. PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the legendary career of New York Yankees broadcaster, John Sterling.
A resident of Edgewater, New Jersey, John began announcing Yankee games on the radio in 1989.
After a distinguished 35-year tenure with the Yankees, John recently announced his retirement.
