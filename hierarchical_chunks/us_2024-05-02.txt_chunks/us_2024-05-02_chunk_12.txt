Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Hayward City Manager Kelly McAdoo Morariu as her 13-year tenure serving Hayward comes to an end this Friday, May 3. 2024.
Kelly graduated from The University of Kansas, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in political science, economics, and international studies in 1998, going on to receive her Master's in Public Administration in 2000.
Kelly joined the city of Hayward in 2010 as an Assistant City Manager and transitioned to City Manager in 2016.
As chief executive, she worked to tackle issues of homelessness, financial stability, and infrastructure.
Kelly effectively led city efforts to respond to the homelessness crisis by implementing compassionate city policies, declaring a homelessness emergency, and negotiating increased housing in the city.
Under her leadership, the Hayward Navigation Center opened in 2018 along with the Depot Community Apartments to help transition unhoused individuals to permanent housing.
Kelly also helped negotiate agreements with the California Department of Transportation to repurpose land held for a freeway bypass for market-rate and affordable housing.
As city manager, Kelly also helped maintain a financially stable city budget by paying down unfunded retirement liabilities and securing numerous grants at the state and federal levels for infrastructure, social services, and more.
Hayward's Measure C, passed in 2014, provided funding for a new Downtown Public Library, Heritage Plaza, retrofit city fire stations, and build a new Fire Training Center and Fire Station No. 6 in partnership with the Chabot-Las Positas Community College District.
For 13 years, Kelly has diligently served the Hayward community.
Her dedication to community engagement and collaboration has made her an asset at Hayward.
I know that her presence will be deeply missed in Hayward.
I wish her and her family success as she enters this new chapter as Santa Barbara's City Administrator.
