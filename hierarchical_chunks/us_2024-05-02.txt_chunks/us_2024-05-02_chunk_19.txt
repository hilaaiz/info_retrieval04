Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate French & Parrello Associates on its 50th anniversary this year.
A multidiscipline engineering firm, French & Parrello Associates has provided valuable contributions to the infrastructure of New Jersey since 1974.
Founded by Laurence E. French, Argo T. Parrello, James B. Heller, and Joseph M. Edwards, French & Parrello Associates has transformed from a branch office of Raamot Associates PC into the independent full-service engineering and consulting firm it is today.
In its 50th year, French & Parrello Associates (FPA) is headquartered in Wall, New Jersey and has three additional offices in New Jersey as well as offices in Pennsylvania, Atlanta, and New York.
It is led by President and CEO Steven Tardy, PE and employs a staff of over 200.
FPA has contributed to both private and public projects, offering a multitude of services encompassing construction, structural, geotechnical, telecommunications, and environmental engineering, bridge and highway design, surveying, and landscape architecture, among others.
They have provided services for several projects across the Sixth Congressional District of New Jersey, including the South Amboy Ferry Terminal, the 
Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Bridge, and the Beachfront North Condominiums in Long Branch.
