What assessment he has made of the adequacy of economic growth in Wales.
This Government have put in place steps to deliver growth and to level up across the whole of the United Kingdom.
The IMF now predicts that cumulative UK growth over the 2022-24 period will be higher than that in Germany and Japan, and the Bank of England made one of the biggest upward revisions to its growth forecast for the UK.
In Wales, the Government have invested in two freeports and will guarantee at least one investment zone to support economic growth.
But the most recent data is not pretty reading as far as the Welsh economy is concerned.
The Welsh economy still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, unlike in England, and unemployment in Wales is going up, unlike elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
Does my right hon.
Friend share my concern about what is going on inside the Welsh economy under the Labour Administration in Cardiff?
Does he agree that  what we need is a laser-like focus on supporting growth, supporting business and unleashing all the opportunity and potential in Wales?
My right hon.
Friend is correct.
It is deeply disappointing that growth in Wales is now below pre-pandemic levels, whereas in England it is above pre-pandemic levels.
The Welsh Labour Government need to ask themselves some difficult questions and perhaps stop concentrating on nanny state policies, such as the ban on meal deals, the 20 mph limit and the ban on new roads and start thinking about what they can do to deliver jobs—I do not mean the £100 million scheme to create a whole load of extra Senedd Members.
