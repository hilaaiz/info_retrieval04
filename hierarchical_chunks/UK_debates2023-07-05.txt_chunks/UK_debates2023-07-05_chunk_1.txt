I am pleased to respond to the debate.
When my hon.
Friend  the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) , the former Schools Minister and now the Chair of the Education Committee, said that he had applied for the debate, I welcomed it because I wanted a good debate on further education.
Despite the kind words of  the right hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) , I do not know if he is quite the secret weapon I would take with me when I have negotiations with the Treasury, but his point was well made.
I heard a lot of rhetoric from the shadow spokesperson,  the hon.
Member for Chesterfield (Mr Perkins) .
Warm words butter no parsnips.
Last year, FE Week reported that: “Labour cannot commit to boosting FE funding levels”.
The article went on to say that speaking to FE Week,  the hon.
Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) “said the economic landscape had changed significantly and could not pledge any uplift in cash for further education or address the disparity between FE and higher education funding until the economic outlook was clearer.”
So despite what the hon.
Member for Chesterfield says, the Opposition are not guaranteeing any uplift in further education funding.
