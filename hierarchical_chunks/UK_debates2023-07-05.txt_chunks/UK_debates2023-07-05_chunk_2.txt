I thank  the hon.
Member for Wirral West (Margaret Greenwood)  for opening the debate.
She is passionate about adult education; I am with her and I understand the absolute importance of community learning.
I have seen that in my own constituency and I champion it in the Department.
I will say more about adult and community learning later in my remarks, but looking at all the programmes together—the skills boot camps, the level 3 offer, Multiply and adult apprenticeships—we are spending well over £3 billion.
