Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, I returned home to Green Bay, WI and was unable to participate in Roll Call Nos.
44, 45, 46, 47, 48, and 49.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 44; YEA on Roll Call No. 45; YEA on Roll Call No. 46; YEA on Roll Call No. 47; YEA on Roll Call No. 48; and YEA on Roll Call No. 49.
