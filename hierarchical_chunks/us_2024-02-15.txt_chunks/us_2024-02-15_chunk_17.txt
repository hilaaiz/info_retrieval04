Mr. Amoroso has served for decades as an instructor at the Tulare-Kings Counties Police Academy, where he teaches young recruits the skills, responsibilities, and dedication required of future Central Valley law enforcement officers.
From 2017 to 2019, 
Mr. Amoroso served as the Academy's Director.
It is because of the dedication of public servants like 
Mr. Amoroso that our future law enforcement officers are prepared to protect our Central Valley communities.
Mr. Amoroso's dedication to his colleagues, his work, and his community is a true testament to his character and leadership.
I know that his service to the Department and his commitment to the safety of Kings County will have a lasting impact for years to come.
