been identified with a potentially life-threatening Primary Immunodeficiency requiring lifesaving medical care far away from home.
Jeffrey asked Vicki to ``Do Something,'' and she did.
As I stand today and extend my heartfelt condolences to Vicki's husband, Fred, as well as her family, friends, and colleagues, I am inspired to continue to work with them and the Jeffrey Modell Foundation to honor Vicki's memory by making a difference in the lives I look forward to the day when we realize her ultimate dream of finding a cure.
I know I, like so many others, will keep the memory of Vicki Modell close as we continue this important work.
