Mr. Momaday also reminded us of the importance of the land.
He wrote, ``We Americans must come again to a moral comprehension of the earth and air.
We must live according to the principle of a land ethic.
The alternative is that we shall not live at all.''
Today I say thank you to N. Scott Momaday for these stories that preserve the beauty of our lands so that in a changing world, they remain indispensable to our collective well-being for years to come.
