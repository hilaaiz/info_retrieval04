Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Garrett, Indiana's FFA Chapter as they celebrate 90 years of community service, leadership, and agricultural education.
Agriculture is at the very heart.
Indiana has some of the best farmers in the nation, and America has the best farmers in the world.
Perhaps no organization has had more to do with this than the FFA, which teaches the longstanding values of American farming to each subsequent generation.
Farmers don't just cultivate the land and grow America's food; they serve in other ways too.
The Garrett Chapter of the FFA is an excellent example of this service on display.
The students spend many of their days in Northeast Indiana giving back, showing up to community events, and advocating for farmers at every level of government.
The Garrett FFA Chapter has experienced nine decades of often tumultuous history.
Since its founding in the 1930s, its members have persevered and fed America through droughts, wars, and other perilous conditions.
As such, the students who currently constitute this chapter are the recipients of an impressive heritage of Northeast Indiana farmers.
They and their children can be proud to carry on this legacy for the next 90 years or more.
