Mr. RYAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the 5th annual Sojourner Truth Life Walk, happening this Saturday, February 17th, at Kingston Plaza in Kingston, N.Y.
Truth was an advocate for civil and women's rights, abolition, and temperance.
Born in Ulster County, NY, in my district, Sojourner Truth endured the brutal and violent punishments of slavery.
In 1826, a year before New York's abolition law went into effect, she and her young daughter ran away to the household of an abolitionist family in New Paltz, New York.
Truth became the first Black woman to sue a white man and win, after her son was illegally sold to a plantation owner in Alabama.
Truth joined the Northampton Association of Education and Industry, an abolitionist organization, where she launched her activist career.
In 1851, at the Ohio Women's Rights Convention, Sojourner Truth spoke powerfully about equal rights for Black women and her experience, as an emancipated Black woman living in America.
Her speech moved audiences and captured the attention of many.
As I commemorate her life on Saturday with the Kingston community, I would like to thank the organizers of the event, Black History Month Kingston, My Kingston Kids, Harambee, the City of Kingston, and Seasoned Gives, and all they have done to put this together.
Their work has not gone unnoticed.
