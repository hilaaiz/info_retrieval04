Mr. Lynch's passion for the fire service began 40 years ago as a volunteer firefighter for Kings County Fire Department.
After a few years with the department, 
Mr. Lynch joined the Hanford Fire Department as a professional firefighter.
He quickly moved up the leadership ranks, and was promoted to Captain in 1995, Assistant Chief Fire Marshal in 2004, and Deputy Chief in 2008.
In 2011, 
Mr. Lynch was named Kings County Fire Chief following 24 years of dedicated service with the Hanford Fire Department.
After his retirement from the department in 2016, he returned as the Fire Chief in 2020.
Over the course of his career, 
Mr. Lynch has received many professional certifications by the California State Fire Marshal's Office, including Fire Instructor, Fire Investigator, and Fire Prevention Officer.
Mr. Lynch has served as an instructor of fire technology at College of the Sequoias, as well as an instructor of hazardous materials for the California Standardized Training Institute, where he teaches students the skills required to protect their communities from fire hazards and other dangers.
Throughout his entire career, and in his many different roles, Mr. Lynch continually demonstrated his commitment to ensuring the safety of our community.
Mr. Lynch's decades of service to his community serve as a true testament to his character and leadership abilities.
I am confident the impact he has left on the Kings County Fire Department and the broader Central Valley community will be felt by generations to come.
