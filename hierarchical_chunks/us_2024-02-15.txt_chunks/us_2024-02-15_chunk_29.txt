Ms. WEXTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the dedicated public service of Chaplain Charlie Grant of Loudoun County Fire and Rescue.
Before his passing on December 6th of last year, Chaplain Grant was one of the leading members of our community who was known for his dedication to others, integrity, and passion for helping those in need.
Throughout his life Chaplain Grant worked tirelessly in his service to others.
He filled his time working to help those in need and to make his community a better place.
This is seen in the countless hours he spent serving the members of his community although he did more than just serve.
Rather, chaplain Grant established many of the systems and programs still used to help people in our community to this day.
Chaplain Grant was instrumental in creating multiple institutions in our community such as the LINK Against Hunger and the Good Shepherd Alliance which provides housing services for those in need.
Further, it's this desire for service and compassion for his community which led him to establish the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Chaplain's Program, the program for which he is perhaps most well-known, in which he was instrumental in providing support and services for the brave men and women of Loudoun County Fire and Rescue.
This legacy of service will be fondly remembered in the community as Chaplain Grant exemplified the ideals of service, dedication, and compassion.
The services and programs he established are being carried on by his successors.
Even after his passing, Chaplain Grant is still watching over his community.
I want to formally recognize the service of Chaplain Grant to our community and the Nation.
He exemplified the ideals of service, charity, and compassion and has irrefutably benefited the lives of countless people of the 10th District of Virginia and our Nation.
