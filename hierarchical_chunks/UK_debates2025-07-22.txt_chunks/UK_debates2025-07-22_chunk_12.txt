I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and commend the work she has done on this issue and her wonderful contribution to the Westminster Hall debate that I responded to recently.
It is a really important issue and something we are keen to explore further.
The Secretary of State and I would be delighted to meet with her and other campaigners.
