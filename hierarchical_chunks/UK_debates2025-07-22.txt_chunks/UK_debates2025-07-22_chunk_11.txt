The Minister talks about her 10-year health plan, with “Fit for the Future” splashed across the front cover, but really, it is a plan from “Back to the Future”, with no new ideas that have not been discussed since Alan Milburn tried to do this in the year 2000.
It will only be successful if the Government deliver, but there is no detail in there on how they will deliver.
Can the Minister help us: how will she deliver on the priorities, including preventive ill health?
Where can we read the “how”, or is it all still fermenting in Ministers’ heads?
We are already delivering.
As I have said, the Tobacco and Vapes Bill is making its way through Parliament at the moment.
We are tackling the obesity crisis through tackling junk food advertising to children.
We are working on school food standards, and we are also bringing in rules around planning for junk food establishments near schools.
We are supporting people to make healthier choices when it comes to alcohol, and we are tackling air pollution, which particularly affects working-class communities.
The list goes on and on, and I would be more than happy to give the hon.
Member another list if he needs one.
Urinary tract infections are estimated to impact on the lives of up to 5 million women and girls.
In 2023-24, there were over 679,000 hospital admissions, and in 2023, 4,323 deaths.
Outdated diagnostic techniques and inadequate treatment for acute UTIs results in the condition becoming recurrent and chronic.
Better education of clinical staff and updated guidelines, diagnostics and treatments can help prevent the spiral of ill health that destroys so many women’s lives.
Will the Secretary of State engage with me and other campaigners to recognise chronic UTIs as a condition and work to prevent this horrendous, pervasive illness?
