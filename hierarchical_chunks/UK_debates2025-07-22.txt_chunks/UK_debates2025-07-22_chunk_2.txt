The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to help reduce waiting times at A&E departments.
What steps he is taking to help reduce waiting times at A&E departments This Government inherited an intolerable situation in A&E, where over a decade of Tory failures left patients waiting in pain.
We are doing the hard work needed to start repairing that damage.
Our new urgent and emergency care plan is backed by nearly £450 million, which will mean 800,000 fewer A&E patients waiting more than four hours this year, new urgent treatment centres, mental health crisis centres and almost 400 replacement ambulances.
Those are just some of the steps that we are taking to rebuild our national health service.
