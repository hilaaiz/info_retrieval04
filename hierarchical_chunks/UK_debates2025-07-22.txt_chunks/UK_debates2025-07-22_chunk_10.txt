The Government are committed to addressing health inequalities experienced by people living with rare conditions such as sickle cell disorder.
Pioneering research is a cross-cutting theme of the UK rare diseases framework, but we know that there are a small number of rare conditions with a large amount of research, while many more have little or no funded research.
I want to confirm for my hon.
Friend that the National Institute for Health and Care Research welcomes funding applications for research into all and any aspects of health or care, including sickle cell disorder.
