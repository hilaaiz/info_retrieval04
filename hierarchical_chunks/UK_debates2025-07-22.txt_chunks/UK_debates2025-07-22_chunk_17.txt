I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter.
Lily’s story really lays bare the heartbreak that rare diseases can bring and the vital role that early diagnosis can play.
I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend and Lily’s family.
May I suggest that we meet when the UK National Screening Committee has completed its review, so that the Government have received advice on this important matter?
We can then discuss that advice together.
