Last month, the Government published their 10-year plan.
It took a year to write, and it contains promises to make even more plans—a cancer plan, a maternity and neonatal plan, a workforce plan and an HIV plan—which we are still waiting for.
Careful planning is important, but taking too long will delay improvements in care, so when do the Government expect to publish those plans and to start delivering?
We are already delivering.
The hon.
Lady is absolutely right to identify that a number of plans are being brought forward.
We take this matter  very seriously, and we want to ensure that we get it right.
We plan: we plan so that we perform effectively, and we plan for success.
The national cancer plan will be coming later this year, and I am sure that we will be able to outline a timetable for all other plans.
I assure her that planning is not doing nothing; planning is making sure that we get this right
and that we deliver.
