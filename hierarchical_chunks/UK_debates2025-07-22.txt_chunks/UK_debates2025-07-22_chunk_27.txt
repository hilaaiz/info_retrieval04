I thank the hon.
Member for her question, and for making everyone aware of the powerful protest taking place today, which so visibly reminds us that lots of people’s voices may not be heard if they cannot participate in person.
It is a reminder of the challenges that people face.
I will undertake to raise her  concerns with my right hon.
Friend the Work and Pensions Secretary, and I give carers across the country the assurance that we are working as fast as we can.
Having delivered the biggest expansion of carer’s allowance since the 1970s, we want to ensure we deliver for this extremely important group of people, whom we are lucky to have in our society.
