Carers across the country have launched a protest from home today, with the Carers Trust.
Their faces are projected on screens around Parliament Square because they are unable to leave their loved ones to protest in person.
The Government’s pledge for the carer’s allowance review to report by early summer looks set to be broken.
Can the Secretary of State today commit to ending the cliff edge for carer’s allowance and to introducing a statutory guarantee for respite care so that carers know that he is listening?
