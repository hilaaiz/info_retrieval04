What steps he is taking to increase rail connectivity between Cambridge and Norwich.
Greater Anglia currently operates an hourly direct rail service between Norwich and Cambridge using its new rolling stock, with a journey time of around 80 minutes.
It is also possible to travel between Norwich and Cambridge at other times by changing trains at Ely station.
When the Ely area capacity enhancement scheme is delivered, it could create improved regional journeys for passengers across East Anglia.
Costs are rising for growing a business in Cambridge, yet Norwich, a finer city, is just down the road and, more importantly, just down the railway.
We need a greater frequency of trains, and faster trains, to make the Norwich-Cambridge tech corridor a greater reality.
It is being held back by the delays in getting the Ely junction fixed.
How soon will that be sorted out by the Department?
