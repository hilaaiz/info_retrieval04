Gentleman is right to put the safety of ships and seafarers at the centre of the issue, as we and the IMO do.
We work very closely with the sector to ensure that it has the best possible information, both at policy level and in the region.

What steps he is taking to increase transport connectivity between towns and cities in the north-west.
Network North will see a further £19.8 billion- worth of investment in the north of England following the redirection of funding from High Speed 2.
That is in addition to what has already been committed through the £3.5 billion to northern city regions from the first round of the city region sustainable transport settlements; the development of Northern Powerhouse Rail, which will transform rail connectivity between the north of England’s key economic centres; and £11 billion for the trans-Pennine route upgrade.
In the light of the Government’s commitment to level up through Network North, will my hon.

You could meet in Chorley, at Coppull station.
I am always happy to meet my hon.
Friend, and I pay tribute to his doughty campaigning on the reopening of the Burscough curves.
