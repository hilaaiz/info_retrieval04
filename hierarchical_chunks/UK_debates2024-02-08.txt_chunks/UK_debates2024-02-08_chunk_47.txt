I thank my hon.
Friend for the campaign he has been running on this issue and his diligence in holding all Departments to account for what they are doing to recognise the vital contribution fathers make, not just to their families but to wider society.
That would be an excellent topic for debate and he will know how to apply for one.
He will also know that he can continue to raise this issue directly with Ministers at Question Time.
It is highly appropriate that he has spoken about this issue; as I said in my opening, we are starting a celebration week of the family.
We know that when families have strong father figures and role models, they are strengthened.
