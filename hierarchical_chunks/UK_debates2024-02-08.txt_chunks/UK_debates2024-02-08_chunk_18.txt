I thank the hon.
Member for her question.
It is my responsibility to help roll out electric vehicles.
We introduced the zero emission vehicle mandate  to ensure that 22% of vehicle sales this year are zero emission.
I should say that, throughout the life cycle of an electric vehicle, they are cheaper than petrol or diesel cars to drive.
This Government have given £2 billion-worth of support to owners of electric vehicles and to charge point companies to help smooth that introduction.
The specific question that she raises is about VAT, and that is a matter for the Treasury.
