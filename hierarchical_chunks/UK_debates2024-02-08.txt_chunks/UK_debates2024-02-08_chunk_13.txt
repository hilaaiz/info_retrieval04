I thank the Minister for visiting my constituency back in January.
Following that visit, he became aware of the important economic impact of the A64 on York and North Yorkshire.
May I stress to him again how important the upgrade is to safety on the road?
A few days following his visit, the road was again closed due to a serious accident.
Sadly, that followed another fatal accident on the road in December.
This is  becoming an ever more frequent occurrence, so when he looks at the upgrade of the A64, will he ensure that the safety impact plays an important role?
