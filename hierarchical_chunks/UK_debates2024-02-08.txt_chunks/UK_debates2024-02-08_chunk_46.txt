The life expectancy for the less well-off in south-east Northumberland barely scrapes 70 years of age, due to the industrial heritage and legacy in my region, like many others.
Right-wing think-tanks are mooting the idea of increasing the pension age to 71, which would basically mean that people in my constituency and other constituencies would pay in all our life and get absolutely nothing from the pot.
Can we have a debate in Government time to discuss the huge discrepancies in life expectancy and the potential for people to receive no pension for a lifetime of contributions?
The hon.
Gentleman raises a good point.
There are clearly legacy issues in certain parts of the country because of the industries that were there.
People in certain professions in the modern workplace, such as shift workers, are also at a disadvantage in terms of their health.
All of that needs to be fed in when policy is made, which is why it is important that we have evidence-based policy and a system across Government so that every Department is involved in the formulation of policy.
Given that the question session to the relevant Department is not for some time, I will ensure that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has heard the hon.
Gentleman’s point today.
Since being elected, I and many colleagues have spent much time raising issues that affect men and boys.
However, this House has barely raised the importance of dads and the challenges they face.
They play a vital role in bringing up their children, supporting their family and supporting our country.
Too many are blocked unfairly from seeing their children after a divorce and too often their role in bringing up children is not seen as important, yet we all know families need their fathers, daughters need their dads, and lads need their dads.
Does the Leader of the House agree that we should have a debate on the vital role dads play and the challenges they face?
