I thank the hon.
Gentleman for sending such a positive and thoughtful message not only to His Majesty the King, which I am sure is very welcome, but to all Brits who are living with cancer.
There is a huge amount to celebrate, including treatments, our amazing research base and our fantastic third sector organisations.
It is not just about the treatments, the drugs and the healthcare professionals; it is also about the financial advice and moral support that are often provided by our fantastic cancer charities.
Of course, it is also about the people who work in the NHS and the agencies that support them.
I think this would be a wonderful topic for a debate, and the hon.
Gentleman will know how to apply.
