I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter and for all the work he does to empower his community to get more involved with shaping their local plans.
He will know that our revised national planning policy framework addresses some of those concerns and the weaknesses in the planning system.
The next questions to the Secretary of State will be on  4 March , where my hon.
Friend can raise this matter directly with the Minister himself.
