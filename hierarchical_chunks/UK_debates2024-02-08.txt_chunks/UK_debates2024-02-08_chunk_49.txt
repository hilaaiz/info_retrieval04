I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work he continues to do not just to champion the interests of farming communities in Wales, but to highlight their critical importance to our resilience as a nation.
When we study the potential job losses and the potential reduction in livestock numbers, the assessment of the NFU in Wales—that the plans are “catastrophic”—is right on the money.
I will certainly make sure that the Secretary of State has heard my hon.
Friend’s concerns.
I encourage him to keep campaigning against the plans.
He will know that the next Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions are on  14 March .
