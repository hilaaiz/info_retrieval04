Further to a question at last week’s business questions from a Conservative Member about SSB Law, I have at least 10 constituents affected by this issue.
What can only be described as cowboy outfits offered constituents cavity wall insulation, and put it into homes where it should not have been, resulting in mould, damp and damage to properties.
Those constituents were then approached by SSB Law, which took on those claims in a no win, no fee basis.
When it went under, my constituents received enforcement notices telling them that they owed up to £19,000.
It is a scandal on top of the scandal.
I wrote to the Justice Secretary as a matter of urgency back in December, but I have not had a response.
Can the Leader of the House help me to find ways in  Parliament to co-ordinate all those across the north who have been affected—we expect there are hundreds, if not thousands—and to get a response so that we can look after those people, some of whom are among the most vulnerable and have received extortionate bills telling them that they owe thousands of pounds?
I am very sorry to hear about this ongoing situation.
From memory, I wrote to the Department last week about this issue, and I will make sure that the hon.
Lady is cited in the reply.
I will also raise it again with the Justice Secretary, and chase up the hon.
Lady’s correspondence.
My office stands ready to assist her in getting this matter resolved for her constituents.
It is both intolerable and heartbreaking that hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after more than 100 days.
Who knows what horrors are being inflicted on them as we sit here today?
Can a Minister come to the House to make an urgent statement on what the Government are doing to get the hostages home?
