This week, I met Annabel, who is helping the Sharabi family, who lost multiple members of their family in the  7 October  attack.
Very sadly, the family recently confirmed that another relative, Yossi, who was taken hostage, has been murdered.
Yossi was described as a pillar of their family; he was also a football fan, and a supporter of Manchester United.
The family are hoping that Eli Sharabi, who was also taken hostage, will be returned to them, and that eventually Yossi’s body will be returned to them so that they can bury him.
Sadly, Eli’s ordeal will not end there, as his wife and two daughters were among those murdered in the attack, which I do not think he will know yet.
