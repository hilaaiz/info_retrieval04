I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and for giving me advance notice of it—It is helpful and diligent of Members to do that.
I have uncovered an administrative saga that I will not bore the House with, but I will update my hon.
Friend.
The fact that he has put the situation on record will help it to be resolved.
I have received some reassuring news from the Department.
