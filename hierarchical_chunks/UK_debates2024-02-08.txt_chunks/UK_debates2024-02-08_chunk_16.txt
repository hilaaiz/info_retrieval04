I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that matter.
I am very sorry to hear about the burden that the Mayor of London has forced on the poorest motorists in London, particularly when we hear that his scrappage scheme is underfunded and slow to process payments.
This is a direct consequence of a Labour Mayor who did not keep his word to Londoners.
The only remedy for Londoners is to vote him out and vote in Susan Hall in May.
