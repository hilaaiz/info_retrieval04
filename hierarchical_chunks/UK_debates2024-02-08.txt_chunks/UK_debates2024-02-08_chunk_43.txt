I thank the hon.
Lady for her words about His Majesty the King.
Many Members will know the merits of the household support fund, which was given to local authorities to provide them with the flexibility to respond to particular situations where  people have fallen through the cracks for other types of support.
That is why we have provided the fund.
It is still in operation, and I know the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Treasury will want to ensure that Members are given good notice about what will follow.
I shall ensure that both those Departments have heard what the hon.
Lady has said today.
