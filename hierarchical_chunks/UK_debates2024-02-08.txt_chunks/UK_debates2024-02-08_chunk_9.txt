I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
As I have just said, we will shortly publish the low-carbon fuel strategy, which will set out the different sources of low-carbon fuels.
We will publish our response to the SAF mandate by the spring.
A great deal of detailed analysis and work is being done in relation to different fuel sources.
We will also publish a revenue certainty mechanism to ensure that we have a UK SAF industry.
We engage regularly with the industry on this, and it is very confident about and supportive of the Government’s policies.
We do have a detailed plan, and I want to commiserate with the hon.
Gentleman, because I am sure that as Energy Minister he too had a plan, but the Opposition’s plans seem to have been U-turned today.
