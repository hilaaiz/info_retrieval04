I thank the hon.
Gentleman for all his work on the Backbench Business Committee and for welcoming two weeks of business—nothing makes me happier than to come to the House and announce that.
He knows that I take very seriously our obligations to provide the Backbench Business Committee with time to have its debates on the Floor of the House.
I hope to update him shortly on when we can give him some additional time.
