I welcome my hon.
Friend’s campaign for the Ely junction capacity enhancement scheme, which is one of the schemes referenced in the Prime Minister’s Network North plan.
Network Rail has developed the scheme to outline business case stage, and next steps will involve further investment case development and delivery planning.
I am keen to see it delivered, because it will deliver for rail freight.
