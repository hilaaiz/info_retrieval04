Last week, we had to pull a debate due to shortage of time.
That was understandable, given the importance of the Government business tabled for that day, but the sad point from our perspective is that unless we are allocated time other than on Thursdays for Back-Bench debates, we will probably have no further time to allocate in the Chamber before the Easter recess.
Monday 26 February  might fit the bill, since a general debate has been announced for that day.
We are of course open for applications, particularly for business in Westminster Hall.
I know this has been mentioned, but could the Leader of the House give an indication of the progress made on bringing forward legislation for the appointment of the football regulator?
I have a particular interest in that.
Television’s impact on travelling football fans is worsening, with Newcastle United fans alone—I am one of them—having had inconvenient and almost unworkable away-game fixtures imposed on them no fewer than eight times this season.
We have had away kick-off times of 8 pm on new year’s day, 5.30 pm in Brighton and Bournemouth—this is when travelling from the north-east of England—and Saturday night kick-offs in London at 8 pm on two occasions and 7 pm on one occasion.
Those times makes it unworkable for people to get back from those fixtures on public transport, and it is happening on a  much more regular basis.
The football regulator is much needed, and I am sure that is something that it would like to focus on.
