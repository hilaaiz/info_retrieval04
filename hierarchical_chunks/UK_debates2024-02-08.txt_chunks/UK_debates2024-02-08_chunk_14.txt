It was a pleasure to visit my hon.
Friend’s constituency and meet him and other parliamentary colleagues who were so passionately concerned about the improvement of the A64 and its safety issues.
I take the point he raises on board.
I know that National Highways is developing options to address the concerns that he, local people and businesses have identified with the road.
We will look at them very closely.
I welcome the fact that he continues to champion this important matter.
What steps he is taking to support low-income motorists.
The Government are helping low-income motorists by keeping down the cost of motoring.
There has been no increase in fuel duty since January 2011, 13 years ago.
Furthermore, recognising the fuel price volatility after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, we cut 5p from fuel duty in March 2022.
This was extended for another year in March 2023.
This cut, along with the inflation freeze, has saved the average car driver around £100 this year.
