I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that important question.
While our legislation and the things that arm’s length bodies use need to be legally accurate, it is important that people can use language and words such as “mother” and “father”.
Actually, that is not only the right thing to do but what the guidance they operate under says they should do.
May I ask him to let my office have the details of that case?
In addition to perhaps having a debate—he will know how to apply for one in the usual way—I could follow that up for him with relevant arm’s length body.
