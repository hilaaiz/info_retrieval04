The hon.
Gentleman raises an incredibly important point about football, and I find it amazing that it has been allowed to endure for some time.
It is probably very unfair on not just the players but the travelling public.
I will make sure that the Secretary of State has heard his concerns, and he will know that the next Culture, Media and Sport questions are on  22 February .
Collecting food waste from domestic properties is an expensive service both to set up and to carry out.
Every local authority in west London has had the service for a long time—certainly before March 2023.
In west London, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is providing £230,000 in funding for Hounslow, £201,000 for Brent, £406,000 for Ealing and a massive £606,000 for Hillingdon.
In my borough of Harrow we have had zero, yet we provide food waste collection to 4,136 flats, and the borough wants to roll out the service to over 18,000 more flats.
It is clearly unfair that Harrow has been singled out.
It is not getting the funding it deserves, and has not for many years.
Could right hon.
Friend arrange for the DEFRA Secretary of State or a Minister to make a statement on the Floor of the House on how that funding is allocated, and why Harrow does not receive its fair share?
