I welcome my hon.
Friend’s commitment to the important community assets in his constituency, such as the historic grade II-listed Southport pier.
I am pleased that he has succeeded in getting the Government to provide £2 million to undertake improvements as part of the coastal community fund, and that comes alongside the landmark £35.5 million town deal for Southport—the second largest town deal in the country.
