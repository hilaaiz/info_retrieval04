I thank my hon.
Friend for pointing that out.
He is absolutely right: whatever the Opposition say today, one of the measures they did not vote for in the Environment Act 2021 was to enable Ofwat to hold water companies to account where they do not demonstrate a link between dividends and performance.
They must have sound performance and be performing for their customers, otherwise they cannot pay out their dividends.
