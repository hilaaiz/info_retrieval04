I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend.
Thames Water is a big water company that delivers on a wide scale.
Ofwat is working very closely with the company on its plans, which will be looked over and submitted, and accounts will be submitted in due course, so that we have a resilient pathway.
Customers, including his constituents, should rest assured that both their water and wastewater supplies will be protected.
