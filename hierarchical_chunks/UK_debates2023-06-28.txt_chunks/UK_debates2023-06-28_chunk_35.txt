I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the issue of bathing water quality.
Since privatisation we have virtually the best quality water coming out of our taps of almost anywhere in the world.
We also have phenomenal results for our bathing water areas—93% are classed as good or excellent.
He has concerns about his area, but I hope those beaches will soon be back up to blue flag status.
The Environment Agency works closely on individual cases where concerns have been highlighted.
I am happy to put him in touch with the Environment Agency or work with him to find out what those individual cases were, so that we can get those beaches back up to the fantastic standard that they deserve.
