Thames Water, which is on the verge of going under, provides a quarter of the population with their water supply.
When was the Minister told about its financial plight?
What is the plan if the worst comes to the worst and it does go under?
The hon.
Member is right that Thames Water supplies an enormous part of our population.
Ofwat has been working closely with Thames Water, as it does all water companies, and the Government work with Ofwat, giving it our strategic policy statement on what its priorities will be.
Overall, the water companies are considered resilient, and much work is going on behind the scenes with Thames Water to ensure that customers will not be affected.
If necessary, there is a process in place to move us to the next stage.
Swindon residents will be concerned about the future of Thames Water, so I ask my hon.
Friend please to keep me and colleagues updated on any issues relating to that.
Underlying this issue, Labour’s model will clearly never work—we must understand that only the private sector will be able to invest.
[Interruption.]
Labour Members bleat now, but they did nothing about it when they were in government.
Is the point not that where we have in effect a private  monopoly, the regulator must be as effective as possible?
Will my hon.
Friend do everything possible to ensure that Ofwat is working in the full interests of customers?
Aspects of its operation do not seem to pass that test.
