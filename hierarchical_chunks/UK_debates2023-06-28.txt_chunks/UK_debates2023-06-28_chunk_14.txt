Mr Speaker, may I join your tribute to John and wish him all the best on behalf of the House?
I also join the Prime Minister in his comments about the holocaust memorial.
I would also like to wish Muslims across the country a happy Eid.
Last week, the Labour party lost Margaret McDonagh, our first female general secretary and a trailblazer in every sense of the word.
Margaret provided guidance, leadership and loyal friendship to so many in the Labour movement.
It was not long after I started in this job that Margaret was at my door, and I will be forever grateful for the advice and support she gave me.
We will all miss her terribly.
