Many of my constituents are hugely worried about reports of Thames Water being on the brink and what that could mean for their bills.
Thames Water has been managed appallingly: leaks have not been dealt with, sewage has been continually dumped and the former chief executive officer Sarah Bentley needed to be asked to forgo her bonus.
All the while, the Government have been missing in action.
Why are the Government yet again running to catch up—nothing in the Minister’s statement gives confidence that they have a grip—with our constituents paying the price?
Where water companies underperform and do not meet their targets, a process is in place whereby basically they have to credit the money back to their customers.
Last year, £143 million was credited back in that respect.
So the regulator does have the tools to do that.
It has tightened up so many of its measures, all of which will affect all the water companies.[Official Report,  10 July 2023 , Vol. 736, c. 1MC.]
