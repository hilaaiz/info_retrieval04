The staggering complacency we are hearing from the Minister will come as no comfort to my constituents who were flooded out three years ago in the west London floods, which were the second 100-year event in less than a decade.
If Ofwat has been doing such a good job in holding the water companies to account, as she is now apparently telling us, why are we in this situation?
What exactly has Ofwat been doing?
It has to be remembered that privatisation occurred in 1989.
We have had a succession of different Governments during that time, and it has been this  Government who have accelerated clamping down on water companies and opening up transparency.
The hon.
Lady asks what Ofwat has done, and I will name just a few things.
Since 2020, Ofwat has updated the licences so that if a water company loses its investment credit rating, it is barred from making payouts to shareholders.
In July 2022, it set out additional proposals to increase financial resilience, including companies having a stronger credit rating.
In March, it announced that it would take enforcement actions against water companies that do not link dividend payments to performance.
We have done more than any Government before to ensure that we have a fully functioning, strong regulator.
On financial resilience, has the Minister taken the opportunity to consider the hotchpotch of policies coming from Opposition Front Benchers on the subject?
Under their prescription, they would seek to take all the profit of water companies to invest in capital expenditure.
That would undermine the financial resilience of those companies that rely on private capital for investment in tackling this problem.
In the one part of the country where Labour does have responsibility—Wales—has she noticed that the sewerage overflows are almost double the rate per overflow pipe as in England?
