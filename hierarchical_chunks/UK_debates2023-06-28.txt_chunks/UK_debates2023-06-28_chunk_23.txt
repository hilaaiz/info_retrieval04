In assessing, as the Minister has explained, the resilience of the water industry, what assessment is she making of the impact on UK pension funds if a major company such as Thames Water fails, as is being widely suggested in the press?
There is a structure and a process for working through this matter.
It is up to the individual water companies and the regulator working with them to ensure that they are resilient.
That is why Ofwat reports annually on how resilient each water company is.
If that flags any issues, Ofwat works closely with them, because we need our water companies to be fully functioning.
We need to attract investment—a huge sum of money has been invested since privatisation, as I mentioned earlier—in infrastructure to give our customers the kind of service they deserve.
We should also be mindful that it is not all piled on to customers; we have to share the load.
It is worth making the House realise that it was the Opposition who voted against the Environment Act 2021, which gave Ofwat more powers.
Can my hon.
Friend assure me that the water regulator Ofwat will be able to clamp down on excessive cash payouts and ensure that water companies put their customers first?
