The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 28 June.
Today, we will have the Second Reading of the Holocaust Memorial Bill.
For decades, survivors such as the late Sir Ben Helfgott showed extraordinary courage in sharing their testimonies so that we would never forget.
I hope the whole House will unite today to get this Bill through and put those testimonies at the heart of our democracy for generations to come.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
For three years, since I was elected, I have been campaigning to improve health facilities in my community.
I am pleased to see significant investment in Leicestershire, with £14 million for a community diagnostic centre in Hinckley and, as part of a £20 billion programme, hospital improvements at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and the Glenfield Hospital.
But I am looking for a hat-trick of health in Hinckley—I am looking for a day case unit.
The money is already there but it is tied up in red tape.
I have raised this issue with the Health Secretary.
Will the Prime Minister look to see what he can do, and would he like to come to open the unit next year in Hinckley?
I am delighted that since its opening last month the Hinckley CDC has already delivered more than 300 additional tests to the local community.
My hon.
Friend will know that it is for the local health authorities to determine how to allocate the NHS budget in their area, but I have no doubt that he will continue to make the case to them for a day case unit in his community.
