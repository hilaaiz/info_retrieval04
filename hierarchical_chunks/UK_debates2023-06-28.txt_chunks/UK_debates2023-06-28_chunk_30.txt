I thank my hon.
Friend for that.
It is essential that we have fully functioning regulators.
Since the Government came to power, Ofwat has done an enormous amount to streamline what it does, improve transparency, change licences and make changes so that dividends are not paid if any environmental damage is being caused.
The Government have directed that through the strategic policy statement.
Indeed, our targets will ensure that the regulator enables the water companies  to put the right measures in place.
He is right, however, that one should never be complacent, and if things need to be improved through the regulators, they should happen.
But I assure him that a big effort is being made.
