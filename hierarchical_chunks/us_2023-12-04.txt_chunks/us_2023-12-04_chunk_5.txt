His wife, Sabina; sons, Gabriel and Daniel; brother Ed; parents, Benito and Mirta; all his loved ones, and to the entire CTU family, are in my heart and in my prayers.
Together, as we mourn his passing, let us celebrate the blessing he was in all of our lives, the impact he had on our community, and the mark he has left in our great City of Chicago.
Oscar vive, la lucha sigue.
Rest in power, Oscar.
