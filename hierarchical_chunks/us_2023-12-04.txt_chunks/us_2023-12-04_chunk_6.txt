Mr. SIMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, since 2016 Charlene Maher has served as the president and CEO of Blue Cross.
Charlene came to Idaho with decades of experience in multiple different facets of the healthcare industry.
This broad range of understanding has made her an invaluable asset to the company and to Idaho's larger business community.
As a trained nurse herself, Charlene is keenly aware of the importance of ensuring communities have quality and affordable healthcare options.
Her innovative approach and her dedication to improving access to healthcare for all Idahoans has truly distinguished Charlene as a leader in the industry, as evidenced by her seat on the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Board of Directors, her time as president of the Idaho Association of Health Plans, her participation as a member of the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, and her contributions to various other state and national industry groups.
Charlene's contribution to Idaho's healthcare landscape throughout her time as CEO of Blue Cross of Idaho has been immense.
I am grateful for her work and wish her the best of luck in her retirement.
