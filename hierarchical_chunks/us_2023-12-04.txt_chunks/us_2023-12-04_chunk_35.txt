incredible work ethic to our office.
I am inspired by their dedication to service and helping the people of Central and Southern Illinois.
I thank Madison, Rochelle, Thomas, Jameel, Colin, and Cameron for their service.
I wish them all the best as they continue their professional and academic journeys.
