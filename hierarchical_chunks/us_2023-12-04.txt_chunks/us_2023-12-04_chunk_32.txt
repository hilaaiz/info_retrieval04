Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of my staff, Mike Davin, who will be leaving our office this week.
Hailing originally from Philadelphia, Mike has dedicated his career to public service.
Mike has worked on behalf of the people of Ohio's Fifth District for the past ten years, where he moved up through the ranks from Intern to Legislative Director.
He has worked tirelessly to advance common-sense energy policies, recognize deserving veterans, and streamline government regulations.
Recently, Mike was a critical part in ensuring members of the U.S. Army's 720th Military Police Battalion who served our nation in the Vietnam War received a Bronze Star for their service.
As Legislative Director, Mike has instilled a sense of comradery in the office, showcasing the positive impact of working together.
Mike is a loving father and husband, and I know that as he enters this next chapter in his career, he will have the love of his family supporting him along the way.
I am eternally grateful for Mike's work on behalf of the District and our Nation, and I wish him and his family the best.
