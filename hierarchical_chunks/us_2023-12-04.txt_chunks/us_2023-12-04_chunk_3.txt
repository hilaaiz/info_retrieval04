Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th anniversary of Texarkana, Texas.
On December 8, 2023, the City of Texarkana celebrates its sesquicentennial anniversary--that's 150 years of bringing together the best that Texas and Arkansas have to offer.
Two states, one city.
It's twice as nice.
And, it is a great place to call home.
This remarkable milestone is a testament to the values, resilience, culture, and rich heritage of the citizens of Texarkana for fifteen decades.
Since its founding in 1873, Texarkana has grown from a small settlement along the Texas-Arkansas border to a thriving city that stands as a beacon of innovation, progress, and unity.
The city's commitment to fostering a strong sense of community and preserving its unique State Line heritage is unsurpassed.
From its vibrant manufacturing and industrial base, support for the Red River Army Depot, and its deep roots in agriculture to its investments in education, health care, technology, infrastructure, and planning, Texarkana stands as a shining example of what can be achieved when a community comes together with a shared vision and a commitment to excellence.
I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the 150th anniversary of Texarkana's founding.
Congratulations to Texarkana on this momentous milestone.
May the next 150 years be filled with continued growth and prosperity.
Happy anniversary, Texarkana.
