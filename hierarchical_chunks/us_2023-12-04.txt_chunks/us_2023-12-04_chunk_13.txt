Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating all that Dr. Swift was able to accomplish for the children of Ann Arbor over her decade at the helm of AAPS.
Her work has set AAPS with a stronger base and a promising future.
We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.
I thank Dr. Swift.
