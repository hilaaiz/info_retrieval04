Mrs. Dingell.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeanice Swift, Superintendent of the Ann Arbor Public School system in Ann Arbor, MI for a decade of tremendous service.
Her daily passion and drive to improve the educational opportunities for all our area's children is worthy of commendation.
Dr. Swift came to AAPS in 2013 with more experience than most gain in a lifetime.
She earned a Bachelors and Masters in Education, as well as her Ph.D. in Educational Leadership.
Before she arrived in Michigan, Dr. Swift spent almost 30 years working her way up the educational ladder, beginning as a classroom teacher in Texas before moving to Colorado Springs, CO.
There, she was Assistant Principal, Principal, and Executive Director of her school district before taking the role as Assistant Superintendent.
Since coming on as Superintendent of AAPS in August of 2013, Dr. Swift has been a great asset to our students.
Her tenure has seen an increase in graduation rates, SAT scores, and a substantial reduction in suspension rates across the district.
Under her leadership, AAPS made significant expansions to its preschool and early learning programs as well as the adoption of a comprehensive LGBTQ policy.
Dr. Swift's strong leadership on behalf of our children cannot be understated.
In 2017, she was named as a Superintendent to Watch by the National School Public Relations Association and in 2018 she was named as the Michigan Superintendent of the Year.
In 2019, she worked on and successfully passed a $1 billion capitol bond for the district, the largest the state had seen in almost 30 years.
Faced with an unprecedented pandemic, Dr. Swift successfully navigated the district through two school years of staffing challenges, safety protocols, and a transition to remote-virtual schooling.
