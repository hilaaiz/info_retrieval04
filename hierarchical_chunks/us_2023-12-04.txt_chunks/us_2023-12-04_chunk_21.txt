Michael has been a staunch supporter of cancer prevention and treatment initiatives throughout his entire life, having established the Herman Schoen Memorial Cancer Research Endowment Fund in honor of his late grandfather and serving on the James Foundation Board at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.
When his mother tragically passed away from small-cell lung cancer, Michael turned his grief into action.
He rode in his first Pelotonia in 2010 and promised to ride every year until the battle against cancer is won or until he no longer can.
Michael's commitment to finding a cure for cancer has become an inspiration to his community and to all those who know him.
This year, Michael became the first individual rider in Pelotonia history to raise over $1 million for cancer research, raising $115,000 in 2023 alone, and was awarded the 2023 Pelotonia Legacy Award for his outstanding leadership.
