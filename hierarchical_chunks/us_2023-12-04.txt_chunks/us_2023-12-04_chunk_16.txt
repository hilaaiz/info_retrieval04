Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Kerreen Conley for her lifetime of dedication to serving Wayne County's local communities as she wraps up her tenure at the helm of the City of Belleville.
For the last three decades, Kerreen has worked tirelessly to benefit those around her and has made significant contributions to preserving and providing invaluable local services.
We thank her for her tremendous efforts, and wish her all the best as she embarks upon her next endeavor.
