Mr. DUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the undefeated Florida State University Seminole football team, who recently secured the 2023 ACC Championship title.
Under Head Coach Mike Norvell's leadership, the Seminoles are 13-0 despite a devastating injury that prematurely ended the collegiate career.
This team plays with their hearts, and it shows.
Throughout this season, they've displayed incredible grit, determination, and perseverance even when the odds were against them.
Sadly, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee failed to recognize this team's incredible talent by excluding them from the 2023-24 College Football Playoffs.
This was a devastating blow to the team and the city of Tallahassee, who proudly displayed the Seminole spirit all season.
It's a shame that an undefeated team, who earned every bit of their perfect season, won't get a shot in the College Football Playoffs.
Make no mistake, Florida's Second Congressional District knows our Seminoles are champions even if the selection committee denies them a chance to prove it.
I congratulate Florida State University on a perfect season.
I thank them for playing with their hearts and making our district proud.
Go Noles.
