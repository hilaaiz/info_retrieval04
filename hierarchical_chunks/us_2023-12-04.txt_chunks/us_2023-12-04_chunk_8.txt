Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Charles J. Hardy for being named a Knight of the Legion of Honor, France's highest civilian honor.
Hardy joined the 282nd Engineer Combat Battalion on July 16, 1943, and was one of many brave soldiers who risked their lives during the Second World War.
He fought valiantly in the battle of Saint-Malo and captured enemy submarine pens throughout his time on the Western front.
He also contributed to the liberation of the Ardennes, the Rhineland, Central Europe, and France.
During these grueling compaigns, Hardy consistently demonstrated fearlessness and determination.
Today, Hardy will be remembered and honored for his courageous service 79 years ago by receiving France's highest honor.
