On the middle east, we welcome the reiteration of the G20’s commitment to the two-state solution and the calls for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon.
But with the United States once again vetoing a UN resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, does the Prime Minister agree that now is the moment for the UK to recognise the independent state of Palestine?
On Ukraine, we welcome the new approvals on long-range missiles.
We must give our Ukrainian allies whatever they need to win this war.
The reality is that that support should have been given sooner.
Why has it taken the threat of a second Trump presidency for there to be action?
This is a war for our security and for the values we hold dear.
Does the Prime Minister agree that now is the moment for the UK to lead in Europe?
Will the Prime Minister convene a summit of European leaders to seize the Russian assets which are at our fingertips?
We must not and cannot look back at this moment and wonder whether we could have done more.
