I thank the Minister with responsibility for roads for meeting my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Salisbury (John Glen)  and me last week to discuss the future of the A303 and the north-south routes through Wiltshire; village roads are clogged with heavy goods vehicle traffic.
Seeing as the Government have scrapped the Stonehenge tunnel, saving billions of pounds, I implore the Minister, as she  considers the road investment strategy for next year, to think about mitigation of the unsustainable traffic problems that we have in Wiltshire.
We have been waiting years for improvements.
Please could that be considered as part of the next RIS?
