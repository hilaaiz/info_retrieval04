I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
On UK leadership, we are back leading on the stage.
The sentiment among other leaders is that they are glad to see the UK back, leading on these issues.
Their words to me are that they feel there has been an absence under the previous Government.
On finance, this is really important.
There are a number of ways we should and can leverage private money to meet very important challenges, whether the global climate challenge or other challenges.
We took steps at COP to set out how those mechanisms could be improved.
