I thank the Minister for that answer, which is incredibly helpful.
To support the participation of small and medium-sized local bus companies in bus franchising schemes, they also want to be energy-efficient.
That enables them to apply for the franchises and do better.
How can the Minister help those small and medium-sized bus companies to be energy efficient—with hydrogen buses, for example—and thereby gain the franchises and contracts?
