I welcome the Secretary of State’s comments on simplifying ticketing.
That will doubtless help to get people back on to the railways.
Affordability is also critical to increasing the use of public transport.
Alongside her 50% hike in bus fares, the Chancellor buried on page 97 of the Budget an above-inflation rail fare increase of 4.6%.
That kicks in from March 2025, just when we expect public ownership of the railroads to begin.
