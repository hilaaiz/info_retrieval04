The Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Hendy and officials continue to work closely with Chiltern Railways to support delivery of an improved passenger experience.
To reduce crowding, Chiltern periodically adjusts its timetable, responding to passenger demand.
It is exploring options for procuring additional trains, in order to relieve crowding while ensuring value for money for the taxpayer.
Haddenham and Thame Parkway train station is a key transport hub for my residents who commute regularly to London.
However, constituents face overcrowded trains; some even report fainting on hot, stuffy trains.
I understand that Chiltern Railways has an active business case with the Department for Transport.
Will the Minister approve, as a matter of priority, the replacement trains and carriages that it is requesting?
