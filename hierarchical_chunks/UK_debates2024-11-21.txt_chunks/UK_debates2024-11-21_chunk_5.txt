We are absolutely clear and the figures are absolutely clear, because they are based on actual claims for agricultural property relief that have been made in recent years.
Those figures show that around three quarters of claims would be unaffected by the changes we have made.
Does the Conservative party accept the principle that 40% of the total value of agricultural property relief comes from ownership of the top 7% of claims by land value?
Do Conservative Members think that is a fair system?
Is that fair to young farmers trying to get into the industry?
Do they support the additional £6 billion we have put into farming as a result of the Budget?
They cannot support the funding going in if they do not support the measures needed to raise that investment in the first place.
Before we begin proceedings, I regret to have to inform the House of the death of Lord Prescott.
John served the people of Hull for 40 years as a Member of this House, 10 of them as Deputy Prime Minister.
He was a towering figure in the Labour and trade union movement, and a campaigner for workers.
He was a fearless, loyal, active unionist, a dedicated parliamentarian and an advocate for his constituents.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Pauline and the family.
There will be an opportunity for the House to pay fuller tributes next week.
