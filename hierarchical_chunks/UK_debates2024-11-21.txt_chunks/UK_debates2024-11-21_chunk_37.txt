With your permission, Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity to express heartfelt condolences on my behalf and that of my party on the death of Lord Prescott.
He was a titan of British politics in the 1990s, one of this country’s greatest examples of social mobility, and a true patriot—no one who had two Jags could not love this country.
We all especially remember that moment when he connected with the electorate during the 2001 general election.
Many of us across the country, as well as the public, were very much on his side during that altercation.
May he rest in peace.
