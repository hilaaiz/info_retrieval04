Before I start my speech, I would like to pay a huge tribute to Lord Prescott, even though he caused great consternation to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Newport East  (Jessica Morden)  when she was standing right behind him as general secretary of Welsh Labour during a certain incident in north Wales.
I am sure John would have welcomed today’s debate, campaigning as tirelessly as he did to extend opportunities, champion worker’s rights and, as mentioned by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson,  the hon.
Member for Winchester (Dr Chambers) , open up on his own mental health.
My sincere sympathies go to his family at this time.
He will be sorely missed, but fondly remembered.
We have had a very positive and constructive debate today, in that lovely consensual way on a Thursday afternoon when we look at the real issues and think how we can tackle them and what we need to do.
I am pleased to respond in this debate, celebrating International Men’s Day and joining 80 countries in marking the contribution that men make to our world.
I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bishop Auckland (Sam Rushworth)  for making sure we have this opportunity.
He is the vice-chair of the APPG on men and boys’ issues, and now we have found out who the chair is: the shadow spokesperson,  the hon.
Member for East Grinstead and Uckfield (Mims Davies) .
I am sure there is a great partnership there and that we will hear a great deal more from them about the priorities and the things that we need to tackle.
