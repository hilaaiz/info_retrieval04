Mr Speaker, may I echo your words about the passing of John Prescott?
He dedicated himself to serving people and his enormous influence will be felt long into the future, not just in this country but around the world, with his incredible achievement of securing the world’s first international agreement on climate change at Kyoto.
Our thoughts are with his family and friends, and with those across the House, too.
