I am proud of the last Conservative Government’s contribution to Ukraine: £12 billion-worth of military, humanitarian and economic support; a commitment to spend at least £3 billion a year on military support; and hitting Russia with the largest sanctions package ever imposed on a major economy.
I said we would be a constructive Opposition, and I meant it.
We will work with the Government to ensure that British support for   Ukraine is steadfast and continuing.
However, at the G20, the Prime Minister was not able to achieve his goal of getting leaders to double down on support for Ukraine.
As Chancellor Scholz said: “It is too little when the G20 cannot find the words to make it clear Russia is responsible.”
