Greater London is the most heavily populated and most economically active area in the whole country.
It also has the highest level of bus use.
In the last financial year, the level of bus subsidy in London amounted to £646 million.
In the Secretary of State’s statement on Monday, of the £1 billion of funding that she indicated, £700 million will be spent on producing bus planning documents, and only £243 million is going to bus services.
That will not touch the sides, will it?
Is the truth not that, far from it being generational reform, it is publicly funded window dressing?
The way that the previous Government approached bus service improvement plans was to force local authorities to waste money on developing those  plans.
This money is going directly to authorities to make sure they are delivering public services.
Public transport is a public service and it should always be funded.
John Prescott was a good friend, and condolences go to his wife Pauline and his family and friends.
Northumberland’s biggest town, Blyth, is in desperate need of a relief road.
It was much promised by the previous Government, and the plan was submitted before the general election in 2024.
Can the Minister update the House on that plan’s progress?
Like my hon.
Friend, we are all thinking of Lord Prescott and his family today.
My officials have had meetings with Northumberland county council, which is working to strengthen the case and provide further analytical work before the scheme can be fully appraised.
I would be happy to update my hon.
Friend on those discussions when I can do so.
