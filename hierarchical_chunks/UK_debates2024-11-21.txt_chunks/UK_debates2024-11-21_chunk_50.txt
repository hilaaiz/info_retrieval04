I was pleased to set out our emissions targets and of course we will set out our plan, but the single most important issue is achieving clean power by 2030.
That is the game changer and one of the Government’s five missions.
On Sudan, he rightly raises an important issue, which I did raise at the G20.
On Gaza, we supported the UN Security Council resolution, as I referenced in my words earlier.
We have a long-standing policy on recognising Palestine as part of the process.
A two-state solution is the only way for a political solution to this awful and ongoing conflict.
On Ukraine, careful decisions are made, co-ordinated and collaborated with our key allies.
On Russian assets, action is being taken.
That is already being done in a number of forums, as I think the right hon.
Gentleman knows.
I congratulate the Prime Minister on the restoration of UK leadership.
Lord Prescott, who did so much to lead on Kyoto, would be truly proud of my right hon.

I was very proud to lead the UK Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation to Baku this weekend, where we heard loud and clear a report from finance experts who say that we need $1 trillion a year in climate finance between now and 2030.
The UK has led from the front, but the reality is that we cannot hit that target without building a bigger World Bank.
We could lead that charge by recycling some of the £3 billion we get back from the European Investment Bank.
Is that an initiative the Prime Minister could look into?
