I thank my hon.
Friend for that fantastic invitation on 2028.
This Government’s manifesto was clear that we want to forge ahead with infrastructure improvements as part of our mission to kick-start economic growth.
As with all schemes in the major road network programme, the Department’s contribution is fixed once the scheme is approved, and Newcastle city council was awarded over £35 million towards the total cost of the scheme.
However, I absolutely commend her for championing this important project.
As she says, it is one of the world’s most iconic bridges, and we are happy to keep this in mind in the context of the spending review.
