I thank all Members who have taken part in the debate.
We have certainly had a very thoughtful array of contributions.
In particular, my hon.
Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland, who opened the discussion today, was man enough and brave enough to open up about his own issues and how he shared those with one of his local groups.
So many local groups and the excellent work that they have done have been mentioned in today’s debate.
As my hon.
Friend outlined, some of the main issues are health, suicide, crime—whether it be committing a crime or being a victim of a crime—exclusion from schools, social and cultural expectations, and the need for positive male role models.
There was, of course, also a large focus on mental health, education, entertainment and the position of influencers.
