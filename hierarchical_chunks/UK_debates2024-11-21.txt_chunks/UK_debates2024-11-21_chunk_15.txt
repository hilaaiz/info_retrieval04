I thank the Secretary of State for agreeing to meet me and  the hon.
Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)  about the A66.
While there is a strong economic case for dualling, the road safety considerations concern me most.
As she will know, 12 people tragically lost their life on the road last week.
I recently met constituents in Ravensworth who live near one of the single carriageway sections of the road.
They live daily with those fears.
Will she reassure them that she and her team will keep road safety considerations uppermost in their mind as they think about the future of the A66?
