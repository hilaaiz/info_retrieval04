I very much welcome this White Paper, which reiterates the importance of eliminating gender-based violence.
Last week I worked with parliamentarians from across the Commonwealth, thanks to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and my right hon.
Friend’s Department, and we resolved that there is a real need for international leadership to effectively challenge what are still called cultural norms—things such as forced marriage, female genital mutilation and rape.
Will he join our calls for eliminating gender-based violence to be at the heart of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Samoa next year?
My right hon.
Friend makes a very interesting point about the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Samoa next year; I will take that away and see what we can do on the matter.
Gender-based violence, for the reasons she has often said, is central to what we are doing.
We cannot understand all these matters unless we see international development through the eyes of girls and women, so she is absolutely right about that.
On gender-based violence, she will be well aware of the work led by my noble Friend Lord Ahmad in the other place, which he continues to do with great vigour and success.
