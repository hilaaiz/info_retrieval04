The Prime Minister and certain other senior Government figures have suggested that the European convention on human rights should be disapplied in some asylum cases, and the deputy chairman of the Conservative party,  the hon.
Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson) , has said that the Government should simply ignore last week’s Supreme Court ruling.
Does the Justice Secretary agree?
The Government are confident that we can deliver on the priorities of the British people while remaining within the four corners of our international legal obligations.
Make no mistake, we are determined to ensure that our borders are secure.
This is a rule of law issue.
It should not be the case that those who try to jump the queue and arrive illegally should derive some sort of advantage from that.
We understand that clearly on the Government Benches and we will do everything we can to stop the boats.
One of the primary reasons for adjournment and relisting in magistrates courts is a lack of trained probation officers to carry out pre-sentence stand-down reports.
Could the Minister outline what steps he is taking to address this so that courts can get through caseloads more speedily?
My hon.
Friend speaks with great authority as a magistrate, and I know from my own experience as a practitioner how important stand-down reports are.
They provide the bench with information about the offender—their relationship situation, their record of previous convictions, their mental health problems and so on—so that the court can tailor a disposal that punishes the offender but also progresses their rehabilitation.
We are working closely with the probation service to ensure that that resource is properly allocated so that we can have more stand-down reports to ensure better justice on the facts of each case.
