Now that the Government have left themselves with no choice but to send fewer people to prison and let more out early because there is simply no space for them, how many convicted criminals are currently on bail awaiting sentence, compared with this time last year?
When do the Government expect normal service to resume?
I am proud of the fact that, unlike the previous Government, we are rolling out a prison expansion programme—something that entirely defeated the Labour party when it was in office.
Labour said it was going to roll out three Titan prisons.
How many did it produce?
Absolutely none.
On bail, it is the case that the number of those awaiting trial is higher, and up by 6,000 compared with the pre-covid period.
That is why this Government are expanding capacity on the estate.
We have 1,000 more judges, we are increasing the amount of legal aid, and we are ensuring that when people come to be sentenced, unlike under the Labour Government, they are going to prison for longer.
