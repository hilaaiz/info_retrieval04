I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman, who is absolutely right to highlight just how much veterans, even when they have got themselves into bother, can offer the community through rehabilitation and through work.
Although I have not yet had the opportunity to engage with my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, I intend to do so.
A whole range of opportunities can work for veterans.
Just this weekend, I saw the ex-jockey Ryan Hatch on ITV Racing talking about his work highlighting equine job opportunities—which are often appropriate for veterans—in prisons.
I look forward to working with my right hon.
Friend—and, indeed, with the hon.
Gentleman, if he wishes—on this issue.
What steps he is taking to increase the number of prison places.
What steps he is taking to increase prison capacity.
This Government have embarked on the biggest prison building programme since the Victorian era, to create 20,000 modern, secure, rehabilitative places.
To date, we have already delivered 5,600 places, a third prison at HMP Millsike is under construction, and last week we secured outline planning permission for our fourth prison, near the existing HMP Gartree in Leicestershire.
