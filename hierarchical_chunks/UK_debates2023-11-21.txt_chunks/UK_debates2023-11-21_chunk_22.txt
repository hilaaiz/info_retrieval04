I thank the Minister for his response.
Veterans very often fall on hard times, find themselves in prison and then become ex-offenders.
Has the Minister had any opportunity to work alongside  the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to ensure that priority can be given to help veterans get over the bad times and to re-engage in society again?
They have offered so much during their time in the services, and they can do so again if given the opportunity.
