I welcome the Minister to her place.
We need to be doing much more to tackle the culture of toxic masculinity that, sadly, still exists.
We recently had a situation in Midlothian where one of our councillors faced sexual harassment at a public event.
When they complained and raised the issue, the perpetrator’s colleagues simply said, “But he’s a good guy.”.
We need to do much more to tackle that sort of attitude.
Despite the complaint being made and the complainant being believed, no action was ever taken.
What more can this Government do to ensure that in these situations action is taken so that we protect women and girls from such unfortunate situations?
