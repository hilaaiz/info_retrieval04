Minister, welcome.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Since 2010, this Government have transformed the legislative landscape on tackling violence against women.
We have created new criminal offences of stalking, non-fatal strangulation and coercive control, recognising that the most pernicious abuse is not always physical.
We have implemented comprehensive modern slavery and domestic abuse laws, and outlawed insidious harms, such as revenge porn and the so-called “rough sex” defence to murder.
We are prosecuting more rape cases today than in 2010, with sentences that are about 50% longer.
But we are going further still, in our Sentencing Bill, our Criminal Justice Bill and our Victims and Prisoners Bill.
