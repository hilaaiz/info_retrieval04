I thank the hon.
and learned Lady for her question, and I certainly condemn the conduct that she has described.
Even though holding a gender critical belief is protected in law, both under section 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and, more widely, under article 9 of the European convention on human rights, I am aware of the polarisation and, sometimes, intimidation that surrounds this debate.
I have seen the letter that Sex Matters wrote to the Prime Minister, and the hon.
and learned Lady should be in no doubt about how seriously this is viewed.
I have made reference to the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act 2023, which creates an offence of intentional harassment where there is any causal connection, even a weak one, to a person’s sex, under which such conduct may fall.
She has asked for a rapid review, and I would like to meet her to discuss that further and any next steps.
