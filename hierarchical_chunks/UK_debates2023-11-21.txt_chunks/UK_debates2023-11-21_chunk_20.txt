I thank my right hon.
Friend for that answer.
We know that ex-offenders are at high risk of homelessness, particularly immediately on release.
We also know that being in work significantly reduces that risk, so the link between the probation service and Jobcentre Plus in supporting ex-offenders into work is of critical importance.
Will the Minister do everything possible across Government to ensure that ex-offenders leave custody with the best possible chance of getting a job?
