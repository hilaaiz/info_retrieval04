I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
As he will know, our Victims and Prisoners Bill is making its way through Parliament as we speak.
He has talked about victim-focused support; I draw his attention to things like Operation Soteria, which is directed at rape victims and has now been rolled out on a national basis.
That places victims’ rights at the heart of the inquiry and focuses all the effort on the suspects and their behaviour, so to be honest, what he has described is consistent with our current models of policing and investigating crime.
I hope the Victims and Prisoners Bill will conclude its passage through Parliament and receive Royal Assent soon.
