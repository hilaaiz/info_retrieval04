I thank the hon.
Lady for her co-operation and her kind personal remarks.
She will know that, in order to get buy-in from our friends and experts around the world and from the civil service, the White Paper needed to run to 2030.
In the unlikely event that my party is not in government after the next election, any other Government would, I hope, build on it to make it a huge success.
