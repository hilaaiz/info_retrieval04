The Lord Chancellor is currently facing a judicial review over the failure to ensure that immigration legal aid is available to those who need it.
For example, the south-west  has capacity for fewer than 300 people per year, yet the Bibby Stockholm has capacity for almost 500.
Is this not an abject failure of the legal aid system?
It is operating exactly how the Government have designed it to: abandoning the most vulnerable to navigate a complex and hostile environment without any recourse to legal representation.
Is this moral bankruptcy or incompetence, or is it a combination of both?
I do not accept that characterisation at all.
In fact, this Government are putting legal aid in place to support those affected by the Illegal Migration Act and especially the uplift in fees to ensure that qualified legal advice is available to people, whether physically or through telephone advice.
Access to justice, and access to legal aid, is there.
What progress he has made on improving employment opportunities for ex-offenders.
I am pleased to say that the proportion of prison leavers in employment six months after their release has more than doubled in the two years to March 2023.
We have delivered significant reforms in this area, among which are prison employment leads to match prisoners to jobs on release, and business-led employment advisory boards that partner prisoners with industry to benefit from their expertise.
While this is very significant progress, there is always more to do, and we are determined to continue to see that figure climb higher.
