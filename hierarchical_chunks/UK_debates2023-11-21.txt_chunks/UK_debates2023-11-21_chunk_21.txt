May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor as prisons and probation Minister, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) , for his work in this space?
My hon.
Friend, as always, is absolutely spot-on that securing employment and preventing homelessness are essential to tackling reoffending.
Those in work are nearly 10% less likely to reoffend.
We work closely with the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that prison leavers have effective support to prepare for employment on release.
For example, prisoners can meet a DWP prison work coach from 12 weeks before release to provide advice on benefits and employment, including day one access to DWP employment programmes, and we continue to foster those strong links.
