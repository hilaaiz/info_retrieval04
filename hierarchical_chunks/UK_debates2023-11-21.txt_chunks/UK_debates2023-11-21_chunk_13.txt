I welcome the Minister to her well-deserved appointment.
She will be aware of the case of David Fuller, who, as well as murdering two women, abused the corpses of over 100 women and girls in the mortuaries of the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust.
For these crimes, he will rightly die in prison.
However, the current legislation is shockingly inadequate on the abuse of dead bodies.
It covers only penetrative sexual assault and not other acts of sexual assault on dead bodies.
Will the Minister meet me, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)  and other colleagues to discuss how we can rectify that in the Criminal Justice Bill, which comes before the House next week?
