I thank the hon.
and learned Lady for her point.
At the risk of harming her political career, the respect is entirely mutual.
In a rule-of-law country, people can disagree with the decision of a court but they must respect it.
We respect the ruling and of course we will abide by court orders, but it is also right that we carefully consider what the Supreme Court said and seek to adjust appropriately.
We will do what we properly and lawfully can do to stop the boats.
That is our mission and the mission of the British people, and we will deliver on it.
