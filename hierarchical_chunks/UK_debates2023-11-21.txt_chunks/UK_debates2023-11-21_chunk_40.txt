Contrary to the claims of Ministers at every Question Time that they are getting the courts backlog sorted out, they are not, and the pain just drags on for victims.
The Crown court backlog reached a record 65,000 cases at the end of June.
Nearly 5,000 of them have been waiting for two years and 36,000 cases have defendants on bail.
Why are things still getting worse?
I have to say, Mr Speaker, that God loves a trier.
Yes, the backlog has gone up.
The hon.
Gentleman will know that post covid and post the Criminal Bar Association strike, the backlog did increase.
On top of that, this Government have cracked down on crime with more police officers, and that has meant more people being charged and appearing in court.
We are addressing this with unlimited sitting days.
We recruited 1,000 judges across all jurisdictions last year and we are doing the same this year.
We have invested in the court estate to improve resilience, and we have extended 24 Nightingale courts to ensure that we have capacity.
Come on now—we know that the statistics tell a very different story.
The Crown courts remain in crisis, and what about the civil courts?
The quarterly civil justice statistics from April to June 2023 show that the average time taken for small claims and multi-fast-tracked claims to go to trial was 52 weeks and 78 weeks respectively.
Is it the same excuse for the crisis in the civil courts?
Since the Government have increased the amount of money spent on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, we have recruited judges across the jurisdiction to help in the civil courts, increased the number of days that fee-paid judges can do from 30 days to 80 days a year, introduced regional virtual pilots to support London and the south-east, and invested in mediation.
All of this is ensuring that people have access to justice in a court system that is dealing with higher numbers of cases than ever before.
