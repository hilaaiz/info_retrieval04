I thank my right hon.
Friend for the tremendous contribution she has made on the matters she is addressing.
Chapter 5 directly addresses tackling climate change and biodiversity loss, and delivering economic transformation, and I am glad it has her approval.
Chapter 3 deals with mobilising the money and what I described in my response to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Esher and Walton (Dominic Raab) , the former Deputy Prime Minister, as the “multipliers” and how we ratchet in private sector money.
Those will make a fantastic difference and we also have to make sure that this money reaches the poorest people in the world.
Britain’s role in the G7, in these international organisations, has always been to focus on the poorest people in the world.
We are proud of doing that and the House would expect us to do it.
This White Paper amplifies that mission.
