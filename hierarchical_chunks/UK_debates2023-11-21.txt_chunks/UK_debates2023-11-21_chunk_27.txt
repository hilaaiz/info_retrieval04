I am grateful to my hon.
Friend, who is such a champion on this issue.
He is right, and to increase the number of staff we have increased pay, accepting the recommendation of the independent pay review body in full.
That means an increase of 7% for band 3 to band 5 officers, which is wing officers up to custodial managers.
We are also backing our officers with the roll-out of body-worn videos for every officer on shift, as well as PAVA spray in the adult estate.
The net result is that the resignation rate is down significantly.
That means more people remaining on the wings, improving the quantity and quality of our prison places overall.
May I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Justice,  the hon.
Member for Newbury (Laura Farris) , to her well-deserved place on the Treasury Bench?
As well as expanding prison capacity, has the Secretary of State looked at the possibility of investing in women’s centres?
That was part of the Government’s female offender strategy, but it also has a proven track record in cutting reoffending?
