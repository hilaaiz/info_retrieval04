A recent large-scale study by the Open University on societal attitudes and experiences of online violence against women and girls found that seven in 10 believe that the current legislation is not effective in tackling such violence.
Almost three quarters  of women in Scotland, and more than half of men there, want online violence to be made a crime—that is a higher level than was found among those surveyed in England.
Platforms have a duty of care to their users, so what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that new guidance in the Online Safety Act 2023 is effectively enforced and encourages women and girls to come forward with cases of online abuse?
The hon.
Lady makes an excellent point.
There is no doubt that some of the toxic content, including violent pornography, has a serious impact on the way that women and girls are treated and the attitudes that certain men have towards them.
As she will know, the Online Safety Act 2023 only received Royal Assent a month ago, and there is an extended implementation period.
She will also know, I hope, that one of the later amendments to the Bill accepted by the Government placed a statutory obligation on Ofcom to publish guidance which summarises the measures that all online services need to take to reduce the risk of violence to women and girls.
That is not on its own, but in consultation with the Domestic Abuse Commissioner, the Victims Commissioner and other experts.
The Act also places an obligation on social media and pornography providers to prevent children from being exposed to harmful content through new and robust age verification exercises— Order.
Sorry; I will come back to the hon.
Lady on that.
