We placed the safety of domestic abuse victims at the heart of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021.
Local authorities have been given £25 million to ensure that all domestic abuse victims receive priority for housing.
In addition, the Act places a legal duty on tier 1 local authorities to provide a wide range of support, including refuges.
To date, the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has allocated £377 million for local authorities to comply with the duty to provide housing.
It is vital that victims of serious sexual assault are supported through what can often be a lengthy and traumatic process, yet we know that many rape victims do not access early mental health support because their therapy notes can be requested as part of the criminal investigation.
That happens far too often and treats the wrong person with suspicion.
Does the Minister agree that a specialist legal advocate for victims could allow them to challenge invasive requests for private information and access the support they need at the time they need it most?
This is an issue that the Law Commission is looking into, and it already appears in our Victims and Prisoners Bill, so that such requests will never be  more than necessary and proportionate.
On the subject of whether there should be a dedicated legal adviser, I respectfully draw the hon.
Gentleman’s attention to the fact that since 2010, there are now 950 dedicated independent sexual violence advisers, who can support victims of rape and serious sexual abuse every step of the way.
We have quadrupled victims funding to ensure that we continue to grow that cohort.
