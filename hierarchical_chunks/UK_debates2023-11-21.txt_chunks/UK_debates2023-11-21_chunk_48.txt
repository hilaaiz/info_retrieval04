The catastrophe in Gaza is a strong reminder not just of the need for humanitarian assistance and expertise, but of the heavy responsibility that we all face to play our part in the world through the painstaking hard yards of diplomacy, and of the crucial role of development in providing the hope that breathes life into any peace process.
I thank the Minister for his personal efforts to bring some energy and direction to this agenda again.
In fact, I would go as far as saying that I do not believe that the House would be in a position to consider a new White Paper were he not in post—a view that I think is shared by many on the Opposition Benches.
However, to have an honest conversation about where we are heading, we need a frank assessment of where we have been.
There was the mindless vandalism of the decision to take one of our most respected, influential contributions to the world—the partnerships, thought leadership and innovation—and trash the lot to deflect from a domestic crisis.
There was the former Prime Minister who, shamed by a young footballer into abandoning his decision to allow children to go hungry in a pandemic, pulled the rug out from under the poorest people in the poorest countries.
Make no mistake: that cost lives, but it also cost Britain its reputation as a gold-standard leader in the field.
As the Minister said then, it was “a strategic mistake with deadly consequences.”—[Official
Report,  2 March 2021 ; Vol. 690, c. 118.]
He knows that I admire his determination to speak out against those decisions, and I know that he does not shy away from acknowledging the damage that they have done.
Although the former Prime Minister may be gone, his second in command, whose signature is scrawled across those documents, now sits in No. 10.
His short words at the start of the White Paper leave me in no doubt that, although his posture has changed, his position has not.
Frankly, asking the man who signed off the devastation of this vital agenda, only to breathe new life into it again, is like calling out the arsonist to put out the fire.
For much of the agenda that the Minister set out today, he will have our support.
The question is whether he will have that of his Prime Minister.
