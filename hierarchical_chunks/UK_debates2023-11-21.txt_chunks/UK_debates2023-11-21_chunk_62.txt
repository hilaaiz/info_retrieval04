I thank the Chair of the International Development Committee and, through her, all of its members, who bring their expertise and enthusiasm to this subject with eloquence and skill.
She mentions the importance of debt relief and localism, and she is absolutely right on that.
She also mentions the work on atrocity prevention, which we have particularly been doing in Sudan since the crisis emerged there.
That work is very important and we are finding new ways of amplifying it.
What she says about biodiversity may well be true.
The White Paper runs to 148 pages.
If she and I had our way, it would have been longer, but we have to draw a line somewhere
and I yield to no one on  the importance of the point she makes about biodiversity.
She will know that there has been argument about loss and damage, and a holding position has now been secured, ahead of the COP.
That is very important, but loss and damage must do two things.
It must get a broader spectrum of where the money is coming from, otherwise we will just be reorienting it within the international development budget and that will be robbing Peter to pay Paul—there is no sense in doing that.
The other thing is that it must bring in a wider group of countries, not just the narrow OECD ones that account for aid—it must be wider than that.
Those two things are required to make loss and damage work.
