I have three short questions.
First, the Minister referred to the Prime Minister asking him to try to make the merger work.
We all know it has been a disaster.
It was in the press last week that there was no rationale or reason for it to have happened in the first place.
I would like to know why there is no thought put behind restoring that separate Department, because it was world-class, and the world looked to it for leadership.
Secondly, the Minister talked about ODA being legal.
It might be legal, but one third of the budget—over £3.7 billion—is being spent on domestic issues of asylum seekers, not on extreme poverty, which he just said is a priority.
Lastly, to reiterate the point made by the Chair of the International Development Committee,  the hon.
Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) , loss and damage was not mentioned.
Two years ago in Scotland, we were world-leading, with the first pledge made by the Scottish Government.
When I was at COP27 last year, the UK  Government asked me to go and speak to partners on this.
I am happy to do that when I am at COP28 in two weeks’ time.
