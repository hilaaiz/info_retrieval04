My hon.
Friend makes an important point.
Between January 2019 and March 2023, 14,700 foreign national offenders were served with deportation orders and removed.
As he has indicated, we have expanded the early removal scheme to allow for the removal of FNOs up to 18 months before the end of the custodial element of their sentence, so that we can bring forward the deportation of criminals who should not be here.
On his specific point, we work closely with the Home Office to ensure that the right people and processes are in place to resist legal challenges.
