Not for the first or last time, my hon.
and learned Friend has got absolutely to the point.
We have deliberately constructed the policy so that if an individual presents a significant threat to a particular individual—often a spouse or a partner—the presumption would not apply.
That is critically important and I was happy to discuss that point with Women’s Aid and other relevant bodies.
We are on the side of victims of domestic abuse and violence, and nothing that we do will cut across that important principle.
Supporting offenders in practising their faith is regularly cited as playing a key role in their rehabilitation in prisons.
However, as the Minister will know from my frequent correspondence with the chief executive of His Majesty’s Prison Service, many prisons either do not provide the facilities required or actively hinder offenders in practising  their religion.
HMP Full Sutton has been brought to my attention as one such example.
Given its importance, will the Minister assure me that a full review of faith provision across the prison estate will be conducted and guarantee that no one will be denied the ability to freely practise their religion?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He is absolutely right to highlight not only the right of people to practise their religion, but the important role that that can play for those individuals in coping with prison life, rehabilitation and getting on the straight and narrow when they come out.
I am happy to engage with him directly on any specific case that he wishes to bring up, and it is an issue that I am happy to look at.
