I welcome my hon.
Friend to his position.
It is over a year since Parliament legislated to increase the maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving to life imprisonment.
However, three members of my constituent Summer Mace’s family were killed in a horrific incident, and in June the offender got only 10 and a half years.
That is totally inadequate.
As RoadPeace has shown, far too many sentences are too short.
Will my hon.
Friend meet me to discuss those sentencing guidelines, so that we can ensure that they reflect what Parliament actually legislated for?
