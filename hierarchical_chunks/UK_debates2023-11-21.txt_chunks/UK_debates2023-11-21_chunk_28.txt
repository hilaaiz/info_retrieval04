I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his kind words about my hon.
Friend.
Yes, absolutely; where the court determines that an alternative disposal is appropriate, we are keen for non-custodial options to be available.
That is why we are investing heavily in alternatives.
There are cases where women offenders must go to jail, but where that is not necessary we want to ensure that alternatives remain so that rehabilitation can take place in the community.
