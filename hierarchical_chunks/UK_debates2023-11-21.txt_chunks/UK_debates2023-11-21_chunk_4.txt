I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I know that he does a lot of work on perpetrator programmes through the White Ribbon scheme in Scotland.
I am sorry to hear about the experience of one of his local councillors, and I draw to his attention the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Act 2023, which recently received Royal Assent.
It creates an offence of intentional harassment carried out because of a person’s sex.
It is quite possible that that covers his friend’s case, so I would be grateful if he wrote to me or came to see me to discuss it further.
