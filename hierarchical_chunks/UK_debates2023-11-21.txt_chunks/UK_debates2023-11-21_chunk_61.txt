Let me start by giving my huge congratulations to the Minister.
I hope that the whole House has recognised his personal involvement and the tenacity with which he has got this document out.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
] I also congratulate our civil servants, who for the past three years have been doing an amazing job in challenging circumstances.
I really hope that this White Paper re-establishes our position on the international stage.
I particularly welcome the embedding of localism; more money to the poorest; debt relief; and the focus on atrocity prevention.
The White Paper outlines several initiatives aimed at increasing the amount of climate finance available for vulnerable countries such as small island development states, which is welcome.
The Minister referenced biodiversity loss a couple of times in his statement, but will he explain why no specific mention is made in the White Paper of the loss and damage fund, which I predict will be at the centre of COP28 in the coming weeks?
