The Secretary of State was asked— What his policy is on the use of brownfield land for new developments.
The Government strongly encourage the reuse of suitable brownfield land.
Our national planning policy framework makes it clear that local authorities should give substantial weight to the value of using suitable brownfield land within settlements for homes and other identified needs.
The Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill will further empower local leaders to regenerate urban centres by strengthening and adding to existing measures.
Homes England proposes to build up to 10,000 houses on greenfield sites west of Ifield in my constituency.
What directive has my right hon.
Friend’s Department given to the executive agency Homes England on the Department’s brownfield-first building policy?
I am very grateful to my hon.
Friend for raising that question.
I cannot go into individual planning cases, but Homes England is leading a programme of urban regeneration.
The work that we are doing in London’s docklands and in Leeds, Sheffield, Wolverhampton and other areas demonstrates our commitment both to levelling up and to making sure that, for environmental and economic reasons, we develop brownfield land first.
My I help out the Secretary of State?
He is aware of the Grove Lane site on the Sandwell-Birmingham border, in which the West Midlands Combined Authority and its Mayor are also interested.
It is opposite the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital site and it is an ideal brownfield site for housing.
Will his Department get on with it?
I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman, who refers to the Mayor of the West Midlands Combined Authority, the only metro Mayor to significantly exceed housing targets in the delivery of new homes.
He is that rare thing: a Labour MP who welcomes house building in his own constituency.
Of course I will support him.
