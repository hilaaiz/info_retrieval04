Last week, a freedom of information request showed that the Lib Dem-Labour controlled Greater Cambridge Partnership, which handles city deal money in my constituency, spent £4.7 million developing plans for a congestion charge that was then dropped because it was opposed basically by everyone.
It also spent £16.5 million on the Cambridge South East Transport bus route, also now dropped, and £18 million on new car parks, none of which are actually open.
That is a total so far of £160 million on transport projects, and virtually none of them functioning.
It is now asking the Government for £200 million more.
It is no wonder that in Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire, people think that the Greater Cambridge Partnership is unelected, unaccountable and a waste of public money.
Does the Minister agree that we have to ensure public value for money?
Will he meet me to talk about the details?
Order.
That question is too long, and I am not quite sure how it fits in with first-time buyers.
I will ask the Minister later.
I don’t think you will.

Through the Levelling Up Parks Fund we have made available £9 million for local authorities in areas of high deprivation  to create or significantly refurbish green spaces.
The fund also includes the planting and maintaining of trees and encourages projects to work towards green flag award status.
