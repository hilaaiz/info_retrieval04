We all know that this Government claim a lot, but now they are claiming that they have a long-term plan for towns while continuing to build them without any of the infrastructure that people want and need.
Residents of Mid Bedfordshire know that all too well: like many others, they struggle to see a GP or get a dentist, and the council’s budget is half what it was in 2015.
The Tories have gutted the elements that make a town a home.
Can the Minister please explain why they persist in prioritising developers in our towns over the people living in them?
