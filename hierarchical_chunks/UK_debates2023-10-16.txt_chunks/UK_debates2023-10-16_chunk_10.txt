I welcome the Minister to his new job.
Several months ago, Essex MPs met his predecessor to talk about the possibility of a combined authority for Essex.
We were overwhelmingly against it.
The people of Essex do not want this ridiculous white elephant; there is no demand from them.
This is all being brought about by some highly ambitious Essex county councillors and some officers who think they would do well out of it.
As most people in Essex do not even know that it is going on, will he and his boss meet me and other Essex MPs to hear our objections?
