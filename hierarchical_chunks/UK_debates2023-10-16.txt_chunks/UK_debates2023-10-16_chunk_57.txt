I join this House in its condemnation of the bloodshed in Israel and Palestine.
The 2 million Palestinians in the open-air prison of Gaza faced a dire humanitarian emergency long before today, yet indiscriminate airstrikes and siege tactics have turned what was a critical emergency into a devastating catastrophe.
Will the Prime Minister make it clear to the Israeli Government that laying siege to civilians in Gaza by cutting off food, water, power and  medical supplies and through indiscriminate airstrikes killing civilians is in clear violation of international law?
Just what is the international community doing to stop the horrific and inhuman treatment of Palestinians?
I again point out gently to the hon.
Gentleman that Hamas are the entity responsible for the suffering we are seeing, and Hamas alone.
Of course we in the international community will do our best to alleviate the impact on innocent people, which is why we have today announced further aid to the region.
We will make sure that we provide as much humanitarian support as we can and indeed, in all our conversations with leaders around the region, we are discussing the humanitarian situation and finding ways to work together to alleviate the impact on innocent lives, and that is what we will continue to do.
Does the Prime Minister accept that what Hamas did was not terrorism for its own sake, but an act of calculated barbarism with a strategy behind it?
The present war will not feature Egypt and Jordan as enemies of Israel as was the case in previous wars, so does he agree that that strategy is to try and prevent similar peace agreements with countries such as Saudi Arabia?
Does he accept that Hamas are a creature of a client state of Russia, and while we are talking about this we must remember that Russia is still at war in Ukraine?
