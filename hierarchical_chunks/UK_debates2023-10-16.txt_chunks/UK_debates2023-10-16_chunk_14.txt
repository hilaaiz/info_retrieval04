What steps he is taking to support first-time buyers.
The Government have a range of schemes available to first-time buyers, including First Homes and shared ownership.
The mortgage guarantee scheme helps to increase the supply of 95% loan-to-value mortgages.
We have also doubled the threshold at which stamp duty land tax becomes due to £250,000, and expanded first-time buyer relief.
In West Fenham recently, Mr and Mrs Joyce told me how their daughter and prospective son in-law had lived with them for five years while they tried to realise their dream of home ownership.
Even after saving a deposit, the failure of the Minister’s Government to build houses meant that they were constantly outbid on the few homes available.
Labour has set out plans to get Britain building again.
Will the Minister match our ambition, or is living with the in-laws the new Tory dream?
The hon.
Lady asks whether we will match Labour’s ambition.
I have news for her: from what I picked up from the Labour party conference, it announced the same targets that we are getting on with.
I draw her attention to the fact that more than 860,000 households have been helped to purchase a home since spring 2010, through Government-backed schemes including Help to Buy, Right to Buy and First Homes.
