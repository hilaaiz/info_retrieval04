Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
May I use this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bishop Auckland (Dehenna Davison) , who bravely used this moment to raise the challenges faced by people with chronic migraine?
I thank her for her work and wish her the best of health.

Members: “Hear, hear!”
] We have established 12 levelling-up missions principally aimed at tackling regional inequality and ensuring that, wherever someone lives—in cities, towns, island, rural or coastal communities—their opportunities are the same.
Progress on the missions will be formally reported through an annual report as set out in our landmark Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill, which returns to the House of Commons tomorrow.
