I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his remarks.
Let me say at the outset that this is an unprecedented and extraordinarily difficult situation.
It is likely to remain difficult for all of us in the days and weeks ahead, but we must always have at the forefront of our mind that responsibility for this crisis lies with Hamas, and with Hamas alone.
It was a barbaric act of terrorism that has inflicted untold suffering and misery on so many people, and we have felt that acutely here at home.
