I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his remarks, and I agree that this crisis demands that the United Kingdom steps up diplomatically to make a difference—to bring about peace and stability.
That is what we have done over the past week, as I alluded to in my statement.
The Foreign Secretary was the first person to visit Israel and has spoken to multiple counterparts.
In the same vein, I myself have been working with allies across the region to make sure that we can work together to bring about a successful and peaceful resolution.
We also recognise the scale of the humanitarian situation that is unfolding and are playing a leading role in helping to alleviate it, not least with our announcement today of considerably more aid for the Palestinian territories, building on our strong track record as one of the leading providers of aid to the region.
That will continue.
