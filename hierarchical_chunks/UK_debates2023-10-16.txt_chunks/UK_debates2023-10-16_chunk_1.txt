We are supporting 101 towns through our £6.1 billion towns fund, helping to level up across the country.
I thank my hon.
Friend for all his efforts locally in ensuring that the £25 million Dewsbury town deal delivers the positive outcomes that we all wish to see for his constituents.

I know that Members across the House will have been shocked by the recent terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas.
I invite the House to stand with me and observe a minute’s silence in recognition of all those innocent Israelis, Palestinians and others who have lost their lives, all those taken hostage and all those affected by the conflict in the region.
Please join me now in standing.
The House observed a one-minute silence.
