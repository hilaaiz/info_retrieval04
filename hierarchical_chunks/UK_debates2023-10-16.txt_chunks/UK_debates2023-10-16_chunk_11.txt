I am happy to meet my right hon.
Friend.
Given the Prime Minister’s recent announcement on High Speed 2, when will local government leaders and Metro Mayors in the midlands and north of England get to know what additional resource they will get as a consequence?
That question is best answered by the Department for Transport, but I will write to the hon.
Gentleman when I have further details.
I am absolutely delighted to hear that the Minister met the leaders of Lancashire County Council, and Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool councils this morning to discuss the enormous opportunity that devolving transport and skills responsibility to Lancashire presents.
Will he and the whole of the Treasury Bench look favourably upon this?
It is an opportunity that we are keen to take to deliver for people in Lancashire and South Ribble.
Maybe we could have a meeting with Lancashire MPs as well as district leaders.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her question and to you, Mr Speaker, for your point.
I hope to meet Lancashire MPs next week to discuss devolution.
I hope that we are able to announce a devolution deal in advance of Lancashire Day at the end of November.
