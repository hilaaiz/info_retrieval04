Friend for that answer.
However, as he develops these policies further, will he remember that even in apparently affluent areas, there are pockets that would benefit significantly from levelling-up investment, especially across Basildon  and Thurrock?
Will he therefore tell the House what plans he has to include those areas in the next round of investment?
