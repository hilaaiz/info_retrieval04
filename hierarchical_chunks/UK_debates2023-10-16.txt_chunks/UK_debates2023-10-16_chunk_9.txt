Thank you, Mr Speaker—[Interruption.]
Order.
Will  the hon.
Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)  sit down, please?
I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Minister on his new post.
May I remind him of the huge opportunity and pent-up potential in former industrial mill towns such as those in my constituency?
One of the most gratifying things about the Government’s levelling-up programme has been how it has seen the potential in towns such as Rossendale, Rawtenstall, Bacup and Darwen and supported that with real money, with £120 million of town deal money for Darwen and £17.8 million for Rossendale.
Does he think that this is the right Government to drive forward the ambition of people who live in mill towns?
I completely agree with my right hon.
Friend.
This morning, I met the leaders of Lancashire County Council, Blackburn with Darwen, and Blackpool, and they all agree with me that a devolution agreement in Lancashire will be fantastic.
I am sure that you agree as well, Mr Speaker.
I am sure that the Minister should meet the district leaders as well.
