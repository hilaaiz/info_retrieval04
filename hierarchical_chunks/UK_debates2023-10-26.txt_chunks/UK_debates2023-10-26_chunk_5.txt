I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
The phase 1 benefit-cost ratio process for HS2 captured some of the benefits of released capacity, including new demand for existing services.
It did not include all the benefits from new services, but I know that the rail Minister will be happy to meet him to discuss that in more detail.
