I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Swansea East (Carolyn Harris)  for all her hard work in this area, which is well known right across the House.
I congratulate her on securing this debate.
I am only sorry that she is unable to be in her place today, but I know how dedicated she is to this issue and I am sure that her important work will be reflected throughout the debate, because, as many of us know, there is no stopping her when she gets going.
