My hon.
Friend knows that the Government have supported the use of hydrogen in road vehicles for over a decade, including the installation of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure where there is sufficient demand.
I should also say that notably, Toyota recently announced the tremendous progress that it appears  to have made in commercialising solid-state batteries.
That is a very encouraging sign across the piece, not just for hydrogen but for electric.
We have already heard that the uptake of electric vehicles is closely linked to charging points.
When will the Government close the gap in charging costs between those who have the ability to charge at home and those who rely on a public charging point?
As the hon.
Lady knows, there is wide and differing experience across the charging network.
Many people are able to charge at home and many people are able to charge through the increasingly large public network.
The way in which electricity prices have changed has tended to dominate changes overall, but she will, I am sure, share my pleasure that the new charge point regulations mean that we can now have a much more competitive market for charging across all the different forms of infrastructure.
What steps he is taking to support bus services.
Using the savings from HS2, we will extend the £2 bus fare right across England until the end of December 2024.
This means that the Government have committed over £600 million to cap bus fares.
We have also announced that the Government will continue to provide increased financial support to community transport operators, to help them protect key services by uplifting their bus service operator grant by 60%.
