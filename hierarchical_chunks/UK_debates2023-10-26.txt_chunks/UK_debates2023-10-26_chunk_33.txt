I thank my hon.
Friend for everything he does to push for more open access.
It is something the Secretary of State and I are keen to do.
I met this week with the Office of Rail and Road chief executive, our regulator, and we discussed what he can do to allow more open-access applications, and what we can do, and we then met with another bidder.
There is another service planned with regard to Wales on the western line, and there is also one in the offing that could work on CrossCountry, plus one for the channel tunnel.
I hope my hon.
Friend will keep on working with me.
We want to deliver them.
