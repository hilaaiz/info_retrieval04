Pothole repairs halved since 2016; insurance premiums up; fuel prices up; electric charge point roll-out 10 years behind schedule; £950 million EV charge point fund still not open three years after being announced; 10% trade tariffs threatening consumers and manufacturers—which of those is not an example of where this Government have failed drivers over the last 13 years?
The hon.
Gentleman had a number of things that he purported to suggest were facts.
Let me just pick one of them: the roll-out of EV charging.
That is absolutely on track according to the independent assessment from the National Infrastructure Commission.
The number of public charge points is up 43%.
As the  Minister of State, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman)  set out, we have published and laid before the House the legislation to implement our zero-emission vehicle mandate, which gives the industry the confidence to invest in and roll out those charge points, to drive the roll-out of electric vehicles.
We are absolutely on track to do that, and I am surprised that the hon.
Gentleman does not welcome it.
What his policy is on delivery of a third runway at Heathrow Airport; and if he will make a statement.
As the House will know, Parliament has voted in principle to support a third runway at London Heathrow, but the Government have always been clear that that expansion remains a private sector project.
To go ahead, it would be required to meet strict criteria on air quality, noise and climate change, as well as being privately financed.
It is for any scheme promoter to decide when it submits a development consent order application as part of the statutory planning process.
