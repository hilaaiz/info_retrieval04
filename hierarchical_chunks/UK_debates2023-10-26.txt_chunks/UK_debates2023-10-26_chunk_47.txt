I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that intervention.
Given that my wife, myself and her GP did not fully understand what the symptoms were and at what age they could arise, it is completely understandable that an employer might be challenged in terms of providing such support.
That is why it is vital that we do our best to ensure that everybody is as well informed as possible, because, exactly as the hon.
Gentleman says, such symptoms might start to appear at any age, so it is important that their root cause is identified quickly and people can provide that support.
