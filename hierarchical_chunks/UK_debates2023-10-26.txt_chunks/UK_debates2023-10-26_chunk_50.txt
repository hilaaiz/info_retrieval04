This is a timely debate, which I will use as an opportunity to draw attention to the link between osteoporosis and the menopause.
The menopause is an important time for bone health.
When women reach the menopause, oestrogen levels decrease, which causes many women to develop symptoms, such as hot flushes and sweats.
The  decrease in oestrogen levels also causes loss of bone density, so the menopause is an important cause of osteoporosis.
While one in five men develop osteoporosis in their lifetime, half of all women over 50 will have to learn to live with it.
This summer, the all-party parliamentary group on osteoporosis and bone health, which I chair, has worked in partnership with the Royal Osteoporosis Society to run the Better Bones campaign.
Our campaign calls for a timely diagnosis for the 90,000 people—most of them women—who currently remain undiagnosed and untreated.
I am calling on the Government to introduce universal access to fracture liaison services, the world standard for fracture prevention.
We know that osteoporosis is one of the world’s most urgent health issues.
Seventy five per cent of 90,000 people missing out on anti-osteoporosis medication are women.
That is why the Fawcett Society and the British Menopause Society are among the many charities and organisations supporting the Better Bones campaign.
