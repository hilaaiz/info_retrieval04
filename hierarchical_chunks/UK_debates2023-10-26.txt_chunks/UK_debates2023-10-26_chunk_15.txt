I thank the Minister for that reply, and for his recent visit to Southend West.
He is very aware that last year, elderly residents were left stranded, literally overnight, when First Bus withdrew the No. 21 service, cutting them off from Southend Hospital, from Leigh Broadway and from many community groups.
Despite successfully working with First Bus to reroute the No. 3 bus, this is not good enough; it only runs once every two hours.
Will he meet me and First Bus to make sure that Southend City gets the best bus services possible?
