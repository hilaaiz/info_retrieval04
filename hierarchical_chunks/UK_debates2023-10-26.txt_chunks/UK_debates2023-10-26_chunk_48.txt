I am delighted to say that, now that my wife has a very senior role in her company, it is easier for her to drive that ethos throughout the company.
I pay credit to phs Group for its work countrywide.
I have invited the hon.
Member for Swansea East to come and speak at one of its offices in the south of Wales—I hope we can arrange that soon.
I pay tribute to all colleagues in the Chamber today, particularly the men in our role as champions, fighting side by side with the women to ensure that this topic is completely understood by as many people as possible, so that we can all provide the support that is so well deserved.
It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bootle (Peter Dowd)  stepping in to lead it so ably, showing that menopause is not just a woman’s issue, but a health issue that affects more than half the population.
As such, it should be of concern to us all, as was so ably highlighted by  the hon.
Member for Walsall North (Eddie Hughes) , whom I am pleased to follow in this debate.
