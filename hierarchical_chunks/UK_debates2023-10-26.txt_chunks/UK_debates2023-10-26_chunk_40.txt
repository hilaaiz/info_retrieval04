On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I provided advance notice of it to Mr Speaker earlier.
A few days ago, The Sunday Times reported on its front page that a “Hamas fugitive” who “‘ran the group’s terrorist operations in the West Bank’” lives here in London.
Muhammad Qassem Sawalha is designated by Israel as a senior Hamas operative in Europe and accused of fleeing the country with fake documents.
He is now believed to hold UK citizenship.
Zaher Birawi lives in Barnet not far from Sawalha.
He was designated by Israel in 2013 as a senior Hamas operative in Europe.
He is listed as a trustee of a UK registered charity, Education Aid for Palestinians.
A publicly available video shows him hosting a 2019 event in London titled “Understanding Hamas”.
Two weeks ago, Hamas launched the deadliest terror attack the world has seen since 9/11.
This House rightly voted to proscribe Hamas in its entirety in November 2021.
It is therefore a serious national security risk for Hamas operatives to be living here in London, especially where at least one appears to have done so through the use of fake documents in obtaining British citizenship.
Madam Deputy Speaker, can you advise me on how I might raise this with the Government as a matter of great urgency and ask if you have had any indication of a Minister seeking to come to the House to provide an urgent update on this matter?
