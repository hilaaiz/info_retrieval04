What steps he is taking to increase the availability of electric vehicles.
The Government are committed to accelerating the transition to zero-emission vehicles.
Last year, 16% of new cars and around 6% of new vans sold were fully electric.
To continue to support the uptake of zero-emission vehicles we are, as the House knows, introducing a world-leading zero-emission vehicle mandate.
That will support the future supply of zero-emission vehicles by setting a minimum percentage of manufacturers’ new car and van sales to be zero-emission each year from 2024.
I am delighted to say that this week we have laid the new public charge point regulations to facilitate charging for electric vehicles.
