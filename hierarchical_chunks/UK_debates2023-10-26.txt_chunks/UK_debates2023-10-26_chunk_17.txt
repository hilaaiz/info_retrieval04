I welcome the hon.
Lady to her place.
This Government have put in unprecedented amounts of support for bus services, including £150 million for the midlands and the north in the past week alone.
The Bus Services Act 2017, which we passed, allowed franchising to be expanded across the country.
It is this Government who are delivering on that greater reach for local authorities, whether it is via franchising or enhanced partnerships.
I urge her to speak to the county council in her region and try to get it to allocate some of that money to support local services.
This Government are putting in the money, but it is up to the local authorities to deliver.
