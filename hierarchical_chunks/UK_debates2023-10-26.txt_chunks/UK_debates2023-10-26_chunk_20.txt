I always take onboard the advice of the Transport Committee, because it does a great job and always has done.
On ticket offices, these are industry proposals, which, pursuant to the process set out in the ticketing and settlement agreement, are currently being consulted on between the train operators and the passenger bodies.
We expect that consultation stage to conclude shortly.
I have made it clear at this Dispatch Box, and the Secretary of State has also been clear, that this should be a redeployment and multi-skilling of staff exercise to enhance the passenger experience.
Serious overcrowding persists on Chiltern railway services serving my constituents, particularly at rush hours and weekends.
The long-term solution is whole-fleet renewal, but there are some short-term fixes that Chiltern is asking for, such as being permitted to bring its extra set of Class 68s back into use.
Can my hon.
Friend assure me that he is doing everything possible at pace with Chiltern to improve rail services for my constituents?
My hon.
Friend is another excellent member of the Transport Committee, and he always champions the need for more capacity on his busy railway lines.
He is accurate: overcrowding is becoming an increasing concern for Chiltern, which is assessing options to mitigate the issue, such as further utilisation of the Class 68 units in and out of Marylebone to maximise capacity.
There are issues with the diesel fleet, but we want to ensure that we can continue to provide the service for his Chiltern customers.
In the longer  term, I know that Chiltern is working with the rolling stock company providers to assess hybrid trains, with an aim to moving away from diesel.
