A new city centre station and a fast rail connection to Manchester are vital to unlocking Bradford’s economic potential, and I welcomed their inclusion in the Government’s Network North strategy.
However, the Prime Minister has since stated that many projects in the strategy are not final but illustrative.
So will the Minister confirm that this Government will, at long last, firmly commit to a new high-speed, high-capacity line, without interchanges, between Manchester and Bradford?
Yes, I can confirm that.
The day after the party conference I went to Bradford and met the leader of the council and the West Yorkshire Mayor to talk about our plans for the station at Bradford, their ambitious plans for the growth of Bradford and the new rail lines.
They very much welcomed the plans we have made.
I hope that the hon.
Gentleman does too, and it would be nice if the Opposition Front Benchers shared the same views as their party colleagues.
