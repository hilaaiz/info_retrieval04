I thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting my hon.
Friend  the Member for Swansea East (Carolyn Harris)  this important and timely debate in October, which is World Menopause Awareness Month.
Regrettably, she is unable to attend or open the debate, so she has asked me, as a member and the treasurer of the all-party parliamentary group on menopause, to open the debate in her place.
I am pleased and privileged to do so.
I hope to do justice to her work, and that of the APPG and its supporters in this vital area affecting the lives of millions of women.
