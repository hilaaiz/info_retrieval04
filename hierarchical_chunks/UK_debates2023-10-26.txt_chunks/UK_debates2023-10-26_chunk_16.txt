I was delighted to visit my hon.
Friend, and also my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rochford and Southend East (Sir James Duddridge) .
I would be very happy to meet her and representatives from First Bus.
Her work to champion her constituents’ local transport needs is second to none.
I was delighted to see that that additional piece of bus funding of almost £1 million from central Government to Southend to help protect and enhance local bus services is going through, but I will happily meet her to see how we can best ensure that it is spent in a way that protects her residents.
It is not possible for people in Tamworth to reach Burton hospital by bus if they need to do so.
Will the Government commit to supporting Labour’s take back control Bill, which will devolve the running of bus services to local authorities, so that bus routes that communities need can be delivered by the people who know where they are needed most?
