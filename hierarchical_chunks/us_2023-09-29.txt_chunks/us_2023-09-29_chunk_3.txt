Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with my colleagues, Representative Lee and 
Representative Khanna to recognize the Community Child Care Council of Alameda County, which will celebrate 50 years of serving children and families in Alameda County on Thursday, October 5, 2023.
The Community Childcare Coordinating Council of Alameda County, which later became the ``4Cs'' of Alameda County, was founded in December of 1972 to offer essential resources to assist families with a network of community services.
4Cs provides access to affordable childcare and family-focused services including childcare referrals, payment assistance, playgroups, free tax preparation assistance, car seat installation checks, and family workshops.
4Cs also supports local childcare providers by offering health and safety trainings, best practices seminars, and ongoing consultation support.
Operating with locations in Hayward, Oakland, and Fremont, 4Cs is governed by a 14-member Board of Directors which employs 75 team members providing services in 18 languages, including English, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Hindi.
As a leading family resource agency, 4Cs has provided over 3,500 personalized referrals, 91 trainings, and over $28 million in payments to cover childcare costs for 1,961 families in Alameda County in 2022.
For 50 years, the 4Cs of Alameda County played a pivotal role in ensuring families can secure culturally competent, high-quality childcare in Alameda County.
They have truly embodied their values of diversity, accountability, professionalism, teamwork, growth, innovation, and friendship for all children and families.
We join the Community Child Care Council of Alameda County in celebrating its legacy and wish it many more productive years to come.
