Mr. SESSIONS.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to present James Manuel Villa of Waco, Texas with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
James Villa's dedication is evident from his three combat deployments in Iraq with the Marines First Division, Second Battalion, 5th Regiment.
Joining the Marines in 2002, his initial engagement in 2003 saw participation in the Battle of Al Faw, capturing pivotal regions around the Rumaila Oil Field, and ensuring security and stability in Samawah, Iraq.
His subsequent deployment in 2004 to Ramadi earned him the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with combat distinguished service, a testament to his leadership as a fire team leader.
Even after fulfilling his enlistment and intending to pursue education at Baylor University, duty called him back.
His third deployment brought more accolades for distinguished service in Fallujah, coupled with the significant responsibility of training 70 Iraqi police recruits.
He attained the rank of Sergeant, receiving his honorable discharge in 2009.
Following his service with the Marine Corps at Camp Pendleton in 2009, James transitioned to education.
He achieved his Bachelor of Arts from Rockhurst University in 2011 and later a Master of Education from Tarleton State University.
Besides his academic achievements, James's impact in the community of Waco is profound.
As an eighth-grade science teacher, he was celebrated as the 2017 Waco ISD Secondary Teacher of the Year.
Today, he stands as a beacon of leadership and hope as the principal of La Vega High School, holding a deep-seated belief in the potential of every student and their ability to effect change in their community.
James, alongside his wife Ivy, are the proud parents of five daughters and three sons, reflecting his commitment both to family and nation.
For his relentless dedication to his country, and now his community, it is with deep respect that I present the Congressional Veteran Commendation to James M. Villa.
