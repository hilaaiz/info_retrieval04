Mr. CARL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Shell for his service to Alabama's First Congressional District.
John Shell initiated the Eagle Reef Project, which involves deploying reef structures to foster marine life.
These reefs are installed under docks or wharfs to filter and clean up to 10,000,000 gallons of water annually.
They provide homes for many species of fish and crabs.
John raised $52,000 for 175 reefs in aims to expand the project to reach 1,000 reefs along the coast of Alabama, and eventually to Mississippi and Florida.
He hopes to do a similar project in coastal areas along the Gulf and the Atlantic.
His environmental impact on our waters is remarkable.
We wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
