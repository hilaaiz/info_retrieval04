Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Dave Cort's 32 years of service as the San Geronimo Valley Community Center's Executive Director.
Dave became the Community Center's first executive director in June of 1991.
This part-time job was the first paid position for the organization and came with only three required qualifications: owning a truck, being able to lift 100 pounds, and possessing people skills.
His role and the services provided by the Community Center expanded exponentially over the next 3 decades.
Dave ensured the Community Center was a successful resource for the San Geronimo Valley residents.
He reformed the local delivery service, partnered with Lagunitas School District to facilitate after-school and daycare programs, and managed the expansion of senior services to include a new Senior Lunch program in the early 2000s.
Understanding the need for recreation opportunities to promote community wellness, Dave also worked to build the Community Gym in 2010.
In 2019, Dave rallied community donors to seed the Deepening Roots Endowment with $2 million.
A year later, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for financial security for the Center in order to provide critical services to the San Geronimo Valley community emergencies.
During the pandemic, Dave assembled the Community Center's resources to bring vaccines, tests, food, emergency funds, accurate information, and a sense of community to the residents.
Today, the San Geronimo Valley Community Center has a staff of 22 people and a comprehensive mission to foster healthy communities within the San Geronimo Valley and Nicasio.
Thanks to Dave Cort's dedication and leadership, the organization has become integral to the quality of life for the community, ensuring local residents have access to quality programs in the arts, youth services, senior services, community events, and more.
