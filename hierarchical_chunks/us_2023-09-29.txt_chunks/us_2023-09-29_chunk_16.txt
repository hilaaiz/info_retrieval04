(NCO) leaders, the Army developed a solution based on the proven Officer Candidate Course.
If a carefully selected soldier can be given 23 weeks of intensive training that would qualify him to lead a platoon, then others can be trained to lead squads and fire teams in the same amount of time.
From this seed, the NCOCC was born.
Army Chief.
Harold K. Johnson approved the concept on June 22, 1967, and on September 5, the first course at Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), Georgia, began with Sgt.
Maj. Don Wright serving as the first NCOCC Commandant.
Potential candidates for the course were selected from groups of initial entry soldiers who had a security clearance of confidential, an infantry score of 100 or over, and demonstrated leadership potential.
Based on recommendations, the unit commander would select potential NCOs, but all were not volunteers.
Those selected to attend NCOCC were immediately made corporals and later promoted to sergeant upon graduation from phase one.
The select few who graduated with honors would be promoted to staff sergeant.
The outstanding graduate of the first class, Staff Sgt.
Melvin C. Leverick, recalled ``I think that those who graduated [from the NCOCC] were much better prepared for some was designed to maximize the two-year tour of the enlisted draftee.
Though over 300 hours of instruction was given, eighty percent was conducted in the field.
The final basic phase was a ``dress rehearsal for Vietnam,'' a full week of patrols, ambush, defensive perimeters, and navigation.
Twice daily, the Vietnam-schooled rangers critiqued the candidates, and all training was conducted tactically.
These men, many now of advanced age, served our country with great honor under challenging circumstances.
Four were awarded the Medal of Honor.
Six are still missing.
Many--1,118
in all--never made it home.
