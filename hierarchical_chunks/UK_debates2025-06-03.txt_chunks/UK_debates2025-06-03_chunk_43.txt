I thank the Chair of the Justice Committee for that important question.
He will know that our manifesto committed to reforming cohabitation law, and we will be bringing forward that reform shortly.
The Law Commission’s report made 57 recommendations for reform of wedding law, including enabling non-religious groups such as humanists to conduct legally binding weddings, and we will be bringing forward information on our package of reforms shortly.
