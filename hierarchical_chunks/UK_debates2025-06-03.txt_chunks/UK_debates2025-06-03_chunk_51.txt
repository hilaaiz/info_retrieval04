I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
There is a procedure to be followed for special administration, and we stand ready should that be required, in this case or any other case involving the regulated industries.
He may have had a chance today to look at the interim report, on which Sir Jon Cunliffe is inviting comments ahead of the final report in about a month.
That report will form the basis of future legislation to fix the regulatory mess we inherited from the Conservative party.
