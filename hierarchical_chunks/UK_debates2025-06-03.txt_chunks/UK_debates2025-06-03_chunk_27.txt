I thank the Minister for his preview.
As chair of the all-party parliamentary group on women affected by the criminal justice system, I welcome the independent sentencing review’s final report.
I note that the review encourages the Government to consider introducing statutory defences for victims of domestic abuse, including where coercion has been a factor in their offending, to prevent unnecessarily criminalising them.
Will the Government look further at those proposals?
