I thank the Chair of the Justice Committee for that important question.
It is vital that victims be notified.
That is why we are boosting probation and ensuring that victim liaison officers have that vital information.
He will be aware that in our Victims and Courts Bill, which has been presented to this House, we are introducing a new victim notification scheme, and a dedicated helpline to ensure that victims get the vital information that they so desperately need.
