In March, I met people from the Justice for Victims campaign group.
One family told me that their young daughter was killed by an unlicensed, uninsured driver.
They were asked to alter their victim impact statement several times to avoid offending the defendant and were denied the chance to fully express their grief.
That experience is shared by many others.
Will the Justice Secretary take steps to ensure that victims’ families have full autonomy over their statements, so that they can express their experiences freely in court?
