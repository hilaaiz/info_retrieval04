Recently, I attended a service marking 40 years since William Heenan was murdered by the IRA for being a Protestant.
While we honoured his memory, the self-proclaimed “First Minister for all” in Northern Ireland was visiting the newly erected statue of IRA terrorist Bobby Sands, glorifying the movement responsible for the cold-blooded murder of men such as William.
Will the Minister agree to meet me and innocent victims from Northern Ireland regarding the review and improvement of the glorification of terrorism legislation that applies to Northern Ireland?
As I think the hon.
Lady will be aware, that is primarily a policy area for our colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office, but I will make sure that we raise those issues with them.[Official Report,  1 September 2025 ; Vol. 772, c. 1WC.]
(Correction)
Yesterday, a man was convicted of a public order offence after burning a  Koran outside the Turkish embassy.
The judge said that the fact that the man was attacked was proof that he was guilty of disorderly behaviour.
This is grotesque, and means that in effect, we have a blasphemy law.
Does the Justice Secretary believe that this should hold, or will the Government back my Bill to put an end to all of this madness next week?
We do not have a blasphemy law, and we are not going to have a blasphemy law in this country.
As the hon.
Gentleman will be aware, I believe that that specific case is going to be subject to an appeal, so it would be inappropriate for me or any other Minister to comment on the details of the matter.
However, I am sure that once all other channels are exhausted and we have a final resolution, we will be debating these matters in detail in this House.
