I declare an interest as a Thames Water customer.
The reality is that Thames Water is bankrupt.
It cannot pay its debts and it cannot meet its legal obligations to Ofwat, the state and its customers.
Therefore, surely the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery, and put it into special administration for £1.
The shareholders and the debt holders know—caveat emptor—that they have all blown their dough.
If the Government buy it for £1, which would be a good deal for the taxpayer, it will not have to pay huge, egregious rates of interest and taxpayers and customers will be the beneficiaries.
I respectfully point out to the hon.
Gentleman that Reform cares so much about the problems facing our water system that it did not mention it even once in its general election manifesto.
What he is proposing—nationalising the water sector—would cost in excess of £100 billion, which is money that Reform would have to take away from the services, such as the national health  service, on which his constituents rely.
I think they would be very ill-served by him if he were to take away that funding, and push up the waiting lists we have just started to see coming down as a result of this Government’s investment.
As a neighbouring MP, the Secretary of State will know the level of outrage in my constituency at the continuous failures of Thames Water, including the five-day period earlier this year during which residents were left without water.
Given that this Labour Government have introduced measures to make polluting water company executives criminally liable and to ban unjustified bonuses, does he agree that we are finally seeing accountability brought back to the water sector?
