Across my constituency I hear the same thing from parents, school staff and youth workers: early signs of offending behaviour are often missed or not acted on until it is too late; and in rural areas, stretched services and limited access to youth provision make the problem worse.
Given the success of the Haslemere youth hub, will the Lord Chancellor consider expanding community-based justice schemes to ensure young people are not drawn into the criminal justice system when they do not need to be?
The hon.
Gentleman is right that those sorts of schemes are exactly what are needed.
That is why we have increased funding for youth offending teams and protected funding for the Turnaround scheme, which is highly successful in moving people who are on the edge of youth crime away from crime.
We are continuing with that funding and we have the Young Futures prevention partnerships coming in.
A constituent who came to see me recently was significantly impacted by finding out about the release of somebody who had perpetrated a non-violent but heinous crime against him.
What more can we do to ensure that all victims are notified when the perpetrator is released?
My sympathies are with my hon.
Friend’s constituent.
It is vital that victims are notified.
Those victims who are currently eligible for the victim notification scheme should be given a victim liaison  officer to find out about their cases, but we know that there is more to do.
We are bringing forward a new victim notification scheme in our Victims and Courts Bill, which will for the first time provide a dedicated helpline to get such information to victims and survivors.
