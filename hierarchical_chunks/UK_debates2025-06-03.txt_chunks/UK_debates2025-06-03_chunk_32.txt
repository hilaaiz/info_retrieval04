Does the Secretary of State agree with the chair of the Prison Governors’ Association that the Conservative proposal to arm prison officers with lethal weapons is just “headline-grabbing nonsense”?
Does she agree that, on top of providing  body armour, the serious means to protect prison officers is by ensuring that they get the years’ long training they deserve, not the weeks’ long crash course that the last Government left them with?
I agree with the hon.
Gentleman.
Again, people who pay attention to the detail will know that there are already mutual aid agreements in place between prisons and local police forces to ensure that if an armed response is required, it is available.
I am sure that hon.
Members from all parties will be looking forward to Olivia’s law, in memory of Olivia Pratt-Korbel, coming into force, thanks to a huge amount of support from my hon.
Friend the Member for Knowsley (Anneliese Midgley), Olivia’s family and other families.
What else can be done to ensure that murderers, rapists and other violent criminals are forced to answer in court for their crimes?
