My hon.
Friend raises such an important point.
I have been struck by so many meetings with victims in which they feel that the exclusion zones,  as currently constructed, effectively make them constrained, rather than the offenders.
That is why I want to move to restriction zones for offenders, and we will bring forward our proposals in the upcoming sentencing Bill.
Rural communities often find it even more difficult to access legal aid providers than in urban areas.
What steps is the Minister taking to help to provide access to legal aid to people in rural areas?
It is vital that those who need legal aid—some of the most vulnerable people in our society—can access it.
We are funding provisions such as Advicenow, which is an online provision.
We also ensure through our contracting process through the Legal Aid Agency that there is provision right across the country to ensure that no one, including those in rural areas, struggles to access legal aid.
My constituent Claire Ball was sexually abused as a child.
As an adult, she faced her abuser in court.
He was allowed to provide character references.
Her good character was called into question, yet she was not allowed character references.
Will my hon.
Friend take steps to rectify this unfairness for victims such as Claire?
