I thank the hon.
Member for raising that case.
I am pleased that the review is taking place.
Victims of child sexual abuse are victims of some of the most heinous crimes in our society.
That is why it is important that we get on with addressing the recommendations of the Alexis Jay review.
We are putting measures in our Crime and Policing Bill and strengthening the Victims and Courts Bill to ensure that victims of such crimes are put at the heart of the criminal justice system and that the perpetrators feel the full force of the law.
