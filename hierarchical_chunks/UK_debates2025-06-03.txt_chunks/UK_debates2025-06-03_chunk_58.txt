I thank my hon.
Friend, and indeed neighbour, for his question, and I know what a strong water champion he is on behalf of his constituents.
His constituents, much like everybody else’s, will now benefit from increased compensation when there are failures.
I agree with him that one of the problems we inherited from the previous Government was having a failing system with no accountability at all, so it is quite right that we have introduced new criminal liabilities and potentially prison time for polluting water bosses, and that we have given the regulator the power to ban the unfair and undeserved multimillion-pound bonuses they got away with under the Conservatives.
