I thank the hon.
Member for pointing out the failures of the previous Government, and their refusal to exempt domestic abusers and offenders who have committed violence against women and girls from their early release scheme; this Government ensured that measures were in place to ensure that victims were kept safe.
He will know the importance of the new domestic abuse identifying tool that we are bringing forward.
It is a vital for identifying and tracking data  through the criminal justice system, and it will be important as we go forward with the reviews that we are putting in place.
