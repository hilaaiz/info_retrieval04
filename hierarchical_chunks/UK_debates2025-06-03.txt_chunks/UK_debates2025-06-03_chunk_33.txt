I thank my hon.
Friend for that vital question.
We are giving judges the statutory power to order offenders to attend their sentencing hearings.
We are also making it clear that reasonable force can be used, where it is necessary and proportionate to do so, to ensure that any adult offender attends when ordered to do so.
I pay tribute to the families of Jan Mustafa, Zara Aleena and Sabina Nessa, as well as to the family of Olivia Pratt-Korbel, who have all fought tirelessly to bring about this law.
This is a law for all of the victims and it is in their memory that we bring it forward.
