I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I also had the privilege of meeting those families in March, and I heard their concerns.
I know personally how important victim personal statements  are to ensuring that victims’ and families’ voices are heard.
I do not want there to be any circumstances in which they feel unable to make a statement.
However, these statements are considered evidence, and the rules of admissibility apply, as they do to all witness statements.
That is a matter for the courts, but we will keep looking at the issue.
