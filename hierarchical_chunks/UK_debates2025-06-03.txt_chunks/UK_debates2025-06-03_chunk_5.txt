I thank the Minister for his response.
It is so important that we break the cycle of reoffending, particularly for young offenders.
In Gloucester, we are really lucky to have amazing organisations working with young offenders, including Young Gloucestershire and the Nelson Trust, which offers holistic trauma-informed support for women of all ages.
Will the Minister join me on a visit to the Nelson Trust to see the great work being done in my city of Gloucester?
