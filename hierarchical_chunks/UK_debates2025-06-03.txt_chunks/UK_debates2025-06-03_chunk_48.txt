I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I reassure him that the Government stand ready for any eventuality and will take action as required.
We are not looking at nationalisation because it would cost over £100 billion of public money, which would have to be taken away from other public services, such as the national health service, to be given to the owners of the water companies.
It would take years to unpick the current model of ownership, during which time pollution would get worse.
We know that nationalisation is not the answer, because we need only look at the situation in Scotland to see that.
