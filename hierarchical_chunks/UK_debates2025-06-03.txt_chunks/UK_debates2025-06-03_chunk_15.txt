Can I first say how sorry I was to hear that the Minister was the subject of intimidation and an attack on her office?
I think all of us across the House would like to wish her and her staff well, and to say how pleased we are that the vile individuals behind this have been caught and punished.
In September, the Justice Secretary designed an early release scheme for prisoners.
She let out Lawson Natty, who supplied the machete used to kill a 14-year-old, and Adam Andrews, who shook a baby so violently that he was left blind and paralysed.
She is now halving prison sentences for killers and rapists, while Lucy Connolly remains behind bars for a reprehensible but swiftly deleted tweet.
Does the Justice Secretary really believe that her choices are making the public safer?
This Government are making choices to keep this country safer, and are cleaning up the mess left after the previous Government led our criminal justice system to rack and ruin.
They left this Government to make the difficult decisions, when we came into office, that were necessary to prevent the total collapse of our criminal justice system.
It is worth reminding the House again, because the Conservatives seem to have very short memories, that they only built an additional 500 prison places.
This Government are rolling up our sleeves and getting on with the difficult job of building the prison places necessary to keep violent offenders in prison, while putting victims back at the heart of our criminal justice system.
