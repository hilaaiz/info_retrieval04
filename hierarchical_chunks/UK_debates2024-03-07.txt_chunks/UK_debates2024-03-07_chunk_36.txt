The hon.
Gentleman raised particular Budget measures.
We have a balanced Budget—that is why the Chancellor made the decisions that he made.
It is the Government’s Budget and the Government’s plan.
It is rather cheeky of the hon.
Gentleman to lecture us about use of public funds; I refer him to what I said earlier about the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology.
The SNP is legendary in this respect.
Indeed, I had wrongly assumed that the appalling Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow had been laid on by the SNP, given its high-cost poor return, and the fact that the police were called.
However, the presence of a bouncy castle put paid to that theory, given that bouncy castles have been banned by SNP local authorities on health and safety grounds.
The lives of people across north Staffordshire have been blighted for far too long by the stench coming off Walleys Quarry landfill site in Newcastle-under-Lyme.
There is delight that the Environment Agency has now issued a suspension notice, so will my right hon.
Friend join me in paying tribute to our hon.
Friend  the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Aaron Bell)  for the work he has done on this incredibly important issue?
Given that this issue affects communities up and down the country, including yours, Mr Speaker, will the Leader of the House find time for a debate on landfill sites?
