May I thank the Chair of the Procedure Committee for a timely and affirmative response to our request to examine the Westminster Hall Standing Orders?
To that end, I have written to the Leader of the House this morning, and I hope she will give a similarly timely and affirmative response.
The Backbench Business Committee welcomes applications from Members across the House, particularly for Westminster Hall debates, where they can probably be facilitated after the Easter recess as we are pretty booked up until then.
I again thank the hon.
Gentleman for his helpful advert for his Committee.
He knows that I very much agree both with his ask and with the advice of the Procedure Committee, so we will make that good innovation very swiftly.
May we have a debate on defending the environment and quality of life in the London suburbs?
Transport for London and its development partner Ballymore want to build 25 tower blocks in Edgware town centre, including a 29-storey skyscraper, which is completely unacceptable and inappropriate.
We need a debate to make the point to the Mayor of London that he must demand that TfL withdraw from the project.
