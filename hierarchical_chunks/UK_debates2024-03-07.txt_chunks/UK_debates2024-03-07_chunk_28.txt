I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and for his continual interest in us getting a high-quality trade deal with India, for which he has long been a passionate advocate.
Of course, the most important thing is what is in the deal, rather than the date that it is delivered.
We remain in round 14 and we recently welcomed Government of India negotiators to London.
The prize remains large—with tariffs as high as 150% for whisky and 125% for autos—and we want to ensure that we get our key service sectors able to export into a market of 1.4 billion people.
