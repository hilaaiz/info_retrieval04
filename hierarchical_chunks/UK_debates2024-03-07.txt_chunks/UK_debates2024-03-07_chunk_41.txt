This week, on  9 March , it will be 10 years since the death of my dear friend, Adjuah Annan.
She was just 28 years old.
Adjuah had sickle cell anaemia, the UK’s fastest growing genetic condition, but her untimely death was the direct result of serious failings in her care.
Her experience and those of many others are outlined in the landmark report by the Sickle Cell Society and the all-party parliamentary group on sickle cell and thalassaemia, “No One’s Listening”, published in 2021, but since then the Government have failed meaningfully to engage with its findings and recommendations.
It cannot be right that 10 years after we lost Adjuah, those with sickle cell and thalassaemia continue to experience inequalities in treatment, substandard care and avoidable death.
When can we expect the Government to finally listen and put forward policy that implements in full the recommendations of the “No One’s Listening” report?
