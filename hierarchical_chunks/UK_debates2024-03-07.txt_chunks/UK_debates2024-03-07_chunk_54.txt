I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for affording the whole House the opportunity to send the message to all the hostage families that they are still very much in our thoughts.
Of those women and girls still kept hostage, the youngest is 19 and the oldest is 70.
We can only imagine the horrors they are  facing.
This week the UN published its report on the sexual violence suffered by Israeli women and girls on  7 October .
It looked at over 5,000 photographs and over 50 hours of footage of those attacks, and it concluded that there was evidence at the Nova music festival of rape, gang rape and murder.
It is the most appalling situation, and I am glad that the UN now has that evidence on record and has produced that report.
We cannot let these poor women and girls suffer what they must be suffering a moment longer.
We must bring them home, and I am sure that is the sentiment of everyone in the House.
