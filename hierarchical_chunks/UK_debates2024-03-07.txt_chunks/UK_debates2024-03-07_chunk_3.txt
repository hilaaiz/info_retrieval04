The Office for Budget Responsibility said yesterday that exports, including from SMEs, will fall even more than expected this year; growth in exports will be less than 1% in each of the next three years; and other countries will not be hit the same way.
There have been cuts in the funding to help businesses start exporting and there has been no deal with the United States, no Diwali deal with India, and no veterinary agreement with the EU to cut red tape and slash costs.
What does the Minister think is the best explanation for the Government’s dismal performance on exports so far?
We can get the best explanation from looking at the data behind what the hon.
Gentleman set out.
He obviously omitted the international reality.
In the same report, the OBR referenced the “sluggish growth” in “global economies” and mentioned that  British goods and services will outperform, on average, G7 countries.
Those are the facts on the ground.
When it comes to exports, we are exporting not only into the EU but outside the EU.
As I said earlier, professional and business services are increasing outside the EU by 19%.[Official Report,  12 March 2024 , Vol. 747, c. 6MC.]
(Correction)
We have substantial programmes in place to help small and medium-sized enterprises.
We are keen to learn and do as much work as we can.
There will be far more work coming through as this is the year of the SME.
