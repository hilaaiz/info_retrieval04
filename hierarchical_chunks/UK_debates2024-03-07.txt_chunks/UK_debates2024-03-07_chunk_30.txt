The Secretary of State will have seen the recommendations that our Committee set out this morning for ending the circus of the Post Office administration of the redress schemes for victims of the Horizon scandal.
I know that she takes this incredibly seriously
and so I know that she will study our cross-party recommendations for the new legislation that she is about to bring before the House.
The question for today is this: if we put all the ongoing investigations to one side, on the basis of the facts as they are known today, does she still have full confidence in Nick Read as the chief executive of the Post Office to run the redress schemes currently under way?
We thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his work.
I have taken a quick look at the report, although it was only issued this morning.
All the recommendations he makes in that report we have either fixed or are fixing with the assistance of the Horizon compensation advisory board.
We agree with him that we need to bring the compensation schemes in house.
The GLO—group litigation order—scheme is already being delivered by the Department for Business and Trade.
We believe that further compensation will flow from our overturning of convictions.
We will be overturning hundreds of convictions through legislation in this House very shortly, as quickly as possible, and that will provide a flow of hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation for those individuals.
That will be done by the Department for Business and Trade.
As the trade envoy to the western Balkans, the issue of Government-to-Government agreements is raised with me frequently.
There is no doubt that if they were available, more deals could be done with the Balkan countries.
Will the Minister give an update on the Government’s position, please?
