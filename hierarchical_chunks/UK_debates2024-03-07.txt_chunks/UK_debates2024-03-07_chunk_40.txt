I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that issue.
All communities want to ensure that new homes are built—that is very important—but we must ensure that they are the right type of homes and do not affect the character of an area, and that the needs of local people and their views are taken into account.
I know my right hon.
Friend has been campaigning hard on such matters, and that the development must be to a gentler density that is in keeping with the local character.
I congratulate her and the Save Edgeware campaign, which is working flat out to ensure that the character of that community remains.
I stand ready to assist her as she progresses that campaign.
