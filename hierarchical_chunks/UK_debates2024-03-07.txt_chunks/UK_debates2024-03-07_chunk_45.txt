The Budget means net tax cuts of £9 billion taking effect in an election year, but that is dwarfed by the £27 billion of tax increases that took effect last year and the £19 billion  of tax rises that will come into effect after the general election, because of the actions of her party.
The Chancellor has given with one hand and taken with the other.
Does the Leader of the House think that her party is fooling anyone?
I encourage the hon.
Lady to re-read the Chancellor’s Budget speech to see what progress we are making on growth and inward investment into this country.
This year, our investment summit had a record amount of money being put into this nation, with more than £30 billion garnered in just that week.
She will know that yesterday we had revised forecasts on returning to our target for inflation.
These are tough times, but the plan is working, and we are determined to see hard-working families through.
Before the pandemic, Transport for London’s finances were in a complete mess, because the Labour Mayor of London refused to raise fares in line with inflation.
Now, after receiving from the Government the final instalment of the £6.2 billion to cover the covid period, he freezes fares again, refuses to pay the police the money they need to reform and keep London safe, and raises the council tax precept by 8.7%.
Will my right hon.
Friend arrange time for a debate so that we can point out the errors of the London Mayor and put us on course for proper government in London?
