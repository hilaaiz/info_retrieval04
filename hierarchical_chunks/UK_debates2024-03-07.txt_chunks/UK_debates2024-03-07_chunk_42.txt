I thank the hon.
Lady for remembering her friend Adjuah, and allowing us to pause and pay tribute to her.
I thank her also for raising the important work the APPG did on the matter.
As the next Health questions will not be until late April, I will write on behalf of the hon.
Lady to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and ask her to respond directly to her.
