I thank my hon.
Friend for that question and his commitment to the Commonwealth.
As a constituency MP with a huge Commonwealth diaspora in Chelsea and Fulham, I totally understand his sympathies and look forward to celebrating Commonwealth day with him and others next week.
He knows that the Commonwealth does not make trade rules, nor is it a trade agreement body like the Gulf Co-operation Council, the European Free Trade Association or the CPTPP.
We think that the better course at present is to ratify our CPTPP membership and continue to have reduced tariffs under our developing countries trading scheme.
However, we are always open to new ideas at the Department for Business and Trade and I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss this further.
