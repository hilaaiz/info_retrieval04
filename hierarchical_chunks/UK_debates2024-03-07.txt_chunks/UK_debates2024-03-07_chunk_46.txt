I thank my hon.
Friend for again raising the appalling maladministration of the Mayor of London.
Londoners are paying more to prop up the Mayor’s budget, not just in the increased headline rates, but also in a whole series of stealth taxes and fines that are being levied.
Even the most fundamental services in London, such as the police, have enormous black holes in their budgets.
It is an absolute scandal, and I hope that Londoners will rectify that situation in the coming months.
