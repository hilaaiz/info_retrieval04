While the UK Government struggle to support small and medium-sized enterprises exporting to Europe, they are providing a £600 million export guarantee to INEOS so that it can build the largest chemical plant in Europe for 30 years in Antwerp, Belgium.
Why can the UK Government find £600 million to support that investment, but not match the £500 million that the Scottish Government are investing in domestic energy transition at home?
UK Export Finance does not give the money; it provides guarantees to loans that are being provided by banks.
There is quite a significant distinction: we have not given that money; we have guaranteed a loan.
The reason why we provide those guarantees is that they guarantee jobs to British businesses.
There is a big difference between a loan guarantee and giving money.
If he would like more of an explanation on that, we are happy to provide one to him.
As chair of the British-Switzerland all-party parliamentary group, I am delighted to commend the Government on the forthcoming new trade agreement with Switzerland, but will the Secretary of State please update the House on progress?
Particularly, will she tell us which of the 20-plus working groups the Government intend to prioritise as part of the negotiations?
