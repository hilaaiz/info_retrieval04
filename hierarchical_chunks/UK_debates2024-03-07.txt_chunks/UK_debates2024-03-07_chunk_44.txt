I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important point.
The Royal Air Force Museum is amazing; I was there recently at the RAF gallantry awards dinner.
At most times, such work would be very unfortunate for one of our most impressive national museums, but anniversaries coming up this year will mean more people will want to visit the museum, particularly to see the reconnaissance aircraft.
This matter is devolved to the Mayor of London, but I know my hon.
Friend has done service by getting the concerns of many people on the record.
I will ensure the relevant Department has heard his concerns, to see what pressure can be brought to bear on Transport for London and the Mayor of London.
