I thank the right hon.
Lady for raising that important point, and I am very happy to set the record straight.
It is not the intention to kick the can down the road on this issue.
The Paymaster General and I have a weekly update on it, and he is working very hard.
The right hon.
Lady will appreciate that, of all this process, this is the hardest bit—coming up with the scheme in short order and ensuring that it will deliver for those who are infected and affected.
I do not think the House will have to wait long before it is updated by the Paymaster General.
He is planning a tour across the UK to meet particular groups, and I hope he will be able to update the right hon.
Lady on that very swiftly.
This is a moral issue, and we have taken it seriously.
That is why we did the inquiry.
That is why we did the compensation review.
The Paymaster General will have to balance the issues the right hon.
Lady raises against being swift.
He feels that very deeply, and he will deliver for the House and all the victims.
