Constituents in West Lancashire have this week been deeply concerned about the threatened closure of our dial-a-ride service.
Yesterday, I learned that, unlike Conservative-led Lancashire County Council, Labour-led West Lancashire Borough Council has managed to find some additional funds for this year, and dial-a-ride has announced that it will be able to continue for the next financial year.
Could we please have a debate about the impact of over a decade of cuts to local government on the valuable community and voluntary sector, which all our constituents rely on?
The voluntary and community sector is thriving, and 13 million Brits volunteer every single month.
The services that the hon.
Lady talks about are incredibly important.
Different councils will be doing different things.
Some have dial-a-ride services, and others have tokens for taxis, depending on whether they are urban or rural.
This issue is incredibly important, and the hon.
Lady will know that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has put an enormous focus on supporting the community and voluntary sector through new initiatives such as the national citizenship programme.
However, I will ensure that the relevant Department has heard her concerns.
Further to the question from  the right hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson) , my constituent Dave Farry, from Ferryhill, is one of the many who have been impacted by the infected blood scandal.
I understand that we are nearing the final compensation settlement for victims of this appalling scandal.
Will the Leader of the House please advise me on how people can best engage with Ministers on this subject?
