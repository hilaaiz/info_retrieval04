My constituent John, despite having been born in North Lanarkshire and having lived in Scotland his whole life, had to apply to become a British citizen, pledge his allegiance to the King and pay £260 for the process to apply for a passport because he does not have access to his mother’s birth certificate.
Will the Leader of the House make Government time available for MPs to raise and debate various passport issues?
Is she aware of any recourse to allow my constituent to be reimbursed?
I am happy to facilitate a meeting between Home Office officials and the hon.
Lady’s office —or indeed herself—to talk about that case and anything that the Department can learn from John’s experiences of going through that process.
He will know that we have clear line-of-sight reporting on the costs charged for particular things, but if there has been some injustice, I am sure that meeting will help to rectify the situation.
Last week saw the launch of the independent report that I, together with the Department for Work and Pensions and the leading research charity Autistica, prepared as result of a 10-month review into autism and employment.
There is still a huge gap in the number of people in work, with fewer than three in 10 adults who are autistic working, which is way below the disability average.
I am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for allocating time in April for a debate in this Chamber on the report and its findings.
Will my right hon.
Friend use her good offices to ensure that that time is preserved as much as possible, so that colleagues across the House can debate the report’s important recommendations?
