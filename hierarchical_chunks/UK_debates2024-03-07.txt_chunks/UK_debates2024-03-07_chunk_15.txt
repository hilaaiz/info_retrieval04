I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
Many of the issues that businesses have been raising with us are specific not to the TCA but to member countries.
That is why Ministers and I, along with officials, go to all these countries, and we have removed many of the market access barriers, which are not specific to the TCA.
The hon.
Lady will know that the TCA will be up for review.
If she has specific things she would like us to take to EU Trade Commissioners, we are very happy to do so.
