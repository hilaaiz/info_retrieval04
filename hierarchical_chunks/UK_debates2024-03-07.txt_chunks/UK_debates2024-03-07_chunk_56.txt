I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter on behalf of his constituent.
As I outlined earlier, the Paymaster General is keen not just to bring forward proposals in swift order, but to meet directly with those who have been infected and affected, in order to hear their views and get feedback on the scheme to ensure that it meets with their approval.
My latest information is that there will be 25 meetings around the country.
I know that the Paymaster General feels strongly that that is the right thing to do.
I will make sure that he has heard my hon.
Friend’s interest on behalf of his constituent and that my hon.
Friend is updated as soon as those dates and venues can be announced.
