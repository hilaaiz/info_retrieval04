I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for all he does for women in entrepreneurship and on the APPG, on which he has worked for many years.
The Small Business Council has excellent entrepreneurs on it, such as Emma Heal from Lucky Saint and Julianne Ponan from Creative Nature, who we rely on for expert advice.
We also have the investing in women taskforce, which has helped to increase the number of female entrepreneur businesses from 56,000 in 2018 to 150,000 in 2022.
The investing in women code has 240 signatories.
We are keen to do more and to work alongside my hon.
Friend to ensure that the world of entrepreneurship is as friendly as possible to female entrepreneurs.
