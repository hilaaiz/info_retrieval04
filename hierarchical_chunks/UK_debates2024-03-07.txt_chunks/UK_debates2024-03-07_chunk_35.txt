I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his questions.
I have spoken to the leader of his party in Westminster regarding future Opposition day debates, and he knows that we will give more time to the SNP.
I think SNP Members were badly treated and we will make that right.
As I have explained, I also want to ensure that the Procedure Committee looks at what happened, because I do not want minority parties to receive more time on the Floor of this House and be in any doubt about how those debates will be conducted.
I understand that Mr Speaker has written to the Procedure Committee to ask it to do a quick piece of work, and I will announce future Opposition-day debates for the SNP.
I hope SNP Members will have confidence in what the Procedure Committee says.
