The sorry saga of Teesworks continues, including the mysterious £20 million paid out to the joint venture partners over rubble.
Putting to one side the bizarre hailing by the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities of Lord Houchen as Teesside’s best champion since Sunderland won the FA cup in 1973—the Leader of the House might want to send him a map of the north- east—will she prevail upon him to come to the House and make a statement to explain how the £560 million of public money so far invested, which is providing eye-watering incomes for the joint venture partners without them putting in any money of their own, is in any way consistent with his claim that the remediation of the site was achieved by bringing in private investment?
There has been no such private investment; the taxpayer has paid for the lot.
Can she please ask the Secretary of State to come to the House and explain himself?
I dispute what the hon.
Gentleman says, and I think it goes to the heart of his prejudices against private sector involvement.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the employment rate in Teesside is now 3% above the national average.
I am sorry he does not welcome that success.
We do, and we want it to continue.
The Leader of the House will be fully aware that I welcome the Prime Minister’s remarks outside No. 10 Downing Street last week, when he said: “It is not enough to live side-by-side, we must live together united by…a shared commitment to this country.”
He is right.
Immigration is only successful when integration is successful.
In the light of that, will the Leader of the House agree to a debate on the Floor of the House concerning a new proactive integration strategy, ensuring that those who come to Britain are encouraged to learn English, become part of UK communities and embrace British values?
Does she agree that we need a coherent UK integration policy?
