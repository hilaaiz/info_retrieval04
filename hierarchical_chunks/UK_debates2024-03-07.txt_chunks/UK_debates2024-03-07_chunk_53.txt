Tomorrow is International Women’s Day, and today marks five months since the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel.
Of the 134 hostages still cruelly held by Hamas, 19 are women, and of those, five are teenage girls.

Friend join me in marking International Women’s Day by supporting the campaign called #BringBackOurGirls?
Will she also take this opportunity to send a message to their families, who are enduring unimaginable pain and the living nightmare of these young women being in the hands of vicious rapist terrorists?
