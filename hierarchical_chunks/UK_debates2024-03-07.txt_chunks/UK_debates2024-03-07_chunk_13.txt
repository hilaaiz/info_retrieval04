I thank my right hon.
Friend for her reply.
Measured by tonnage, the port of Immingham in my constituency is the largest port in the country, with almost 50 million tonnes of cargo each year.
It is also a vital part of the renewable energy sector.
Immingham is surely an example of the fact that not only EU trade but worldwide trade is important to the UK.
If my right hon.
Friend were able to visit at some time, she would be able to see that for herself.
