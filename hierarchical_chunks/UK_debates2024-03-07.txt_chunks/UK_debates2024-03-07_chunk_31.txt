I thank my hon.
Friend, in particular for his brilliant work as a trade envoy.
He covers more markets than any of our other trade envoys with great skill and dexterity.
Back in 2017, this Department and I were pioneers in putting in place a G-to-G agreement with Peru for the UK to be the delivery partner for the 2019 Pan American games.
A great deal of business with and in Peru has resulted since.
We remain open to  future G-to-G agreements on a case-by-case basis.
I am happy to meet him to discuss what specific things he has in mind that would work in the western Balkans.
