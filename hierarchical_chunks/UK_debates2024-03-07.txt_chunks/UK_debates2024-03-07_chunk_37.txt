I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
It is unacceptable that residents in Newcastle-under-Lyme have, for far too long, had to put up with the appalling smells emanating from that quarry, and she is right to pay tribute to our hon.
Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme.
He has raised the issue many times in this House and has been fighting for his constituents.
I think he secured two Westminster Hall debates on the issue, and it is in very great part down to his efforts that it is being resolved.
