Will the Minister ask the Small Business Council to wake up to the opportunities in the hydrogen sector, not only in terms of the engineering that supplies that sector, the coming replacement of batteries and all that transportation stuff, but in the infrastructure of our country?
We have great engineering that is ready to go with a hydrogen future.
When will he wake up to that opportunity?
We already have woken up to that opportunity.
As the hon.
Gentleman knows, we have great opportunities in hydrogen in Teesside and in Yorkshire, with the Humber hydrogen cluster.
It is something we are keen to support as a Government, and I would appreciate it if he offered his support, too.
