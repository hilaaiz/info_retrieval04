I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for all the work he has done on the report and on many other areas of deep concern to people with autism and their families.
It is a landmark report, and it is wonderful to hear that it will be debated on the Floor of  the House.
I will ensure that the time is protected and that nothing happens to it.
I also congratulate my colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions on the work they have done and the proactive way in which they commissioned these findings.
