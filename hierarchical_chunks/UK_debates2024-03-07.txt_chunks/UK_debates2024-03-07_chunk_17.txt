I thank my hon.
Friend for his report and letter to me all about that.
I am pleased with the high-level meetings he had on his recent visit and a lot of the media coverage.
Our embassy is following up by preparing for the Zimbabwe international trade fair in April, and it is expecting a strong UK presence.
My hon.
Friend’s return visit in April will be a perfect chance to progress the deals that we have and boost British investment for this year and beyond.
