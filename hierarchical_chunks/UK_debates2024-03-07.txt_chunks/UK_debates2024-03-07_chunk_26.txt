I thank my hon.
Friend, who is a leading member of the British-Switzerland APPG, for his interest.
Both the Secretary of State and I met the Swiss Trade Minister in Abu Dhabi last week.
The trade talks are progressing well.
We are seeking high-ambition outcomes in all areas, including services and investment, mobility, digital, and the environment, which are not covered by our existing FTA.
In short, there are a large number of high-priority areas for us, building on the agreement that we did on financial services in Bern at the end of last year, to ensure that this UK-Switzerland FTA really takes forward the bilateral trade relationship.
The fourth round of negotiations is taking place in Bern this week.
