Can the Secretary of State give me some assurance that any free trade agreement with Israel will not allow the importation of goods produced in settlements on the west bank?
Yes, I can give the right hon.
Member that assurance.
We are clear under our existing UK-Israel trade and partnership agreement that Israeli goods originating from the State of Israel receive tariff preferences.
We also have a separate interim agreement between the UK and the Palestinian Authority.
I confirm that that will continue to be the case with an upgraded FTA with Israel.
We will not compromise our long-standing positions on the middle east process throughout this negotiation, including with respect to settlements.
What steps she is taking to increase trade with Commonwealth countries.
The United Kingdom has trade deals with 33 Commonwealth countries, and our new developing countries trading scheme offers more generous tariffs, rules of origin and trading conditions to developing countries, including 19 Commonwealth countries.
The UK-Australia FTA has seen sharp rises in many UK export sectors, including furniture tripling year on year and car exports doubling.
Meanwhile, of the 11 parties to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership, six are Commonwealth countries, and that agreement gives us new or improved access to those important markets.
Mr Speaker, I know that you will be celebrating Commonwealth day on Monday with the raising of the Commonwealth flag.
Will the Minister take this opportunity to expand our trading relations with the Commonwealth and look at the idea of an opt-in, opt-out WTO-style organisation involving all Commonwealth countries?
Surely this is a great opportunity to expand our trade with some of the world’s emerging economic powerhouses.
