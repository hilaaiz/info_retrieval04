I thank the Secretary of State for her statement, and am pleased to hear that this will be a thorough and meaningful consultation, because even though my constituency is not near the airport, my constituents in Camberwell, Stockwell and Brixton write to me regularly to say that they are suffering from air and noise pollution.
The Secretary of State talked about infrastructure; a key point will be ensuring that more people use public transport to get to Heathrow.
The reality is that some upgrades to the airport have not had the funding over many years, as the Chair of the Select Committee, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ruth Cadbury) , highlighted.
I want to tease out more from the Secretary of State on private funding, because in a number of cases, developers commit to something, but then the viability issue comes up, and the money never seems to appear.
Will she ensure that there is funding to secure the transport infrastructure that will be vital if there is any new airport runway?
