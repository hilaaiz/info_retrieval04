Well over 1,000 youth clubs have closed in this country since 2010, having a huge negative impact on our young people.
This is despite the fact that youth clubs have a long positive history of helping young people to mature in a healthy fashion.
In particular, Phab clubs help disabled and non-disabled people to build friendships in an inclusive environment.
The Phab charity is here in Parliament later today to gain support for its work.
Will the Prime Minister commend its work and consider how best to support the youth club movement to help the next generation of young people grow into well-adjusted adults?
