I thank the hon.
Member for raising that.
Added to the list of shocking things  the last Government left us is the shocking state of  NHS dentistry—broken, like everything else under the last Government.
We are rolling out extra urgent care appointments.
In Somerset, the integrated care board is expected to deliver over 13,000 extra dental appointments  this year; I will give her more details in due course.
We are also reforming the dental contract, which will shift focus on to retaining NHS dentists.
