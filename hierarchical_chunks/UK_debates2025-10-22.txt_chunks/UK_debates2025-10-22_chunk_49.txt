How people get to and from an airport is as important as the number of planes landing and taking off, so I can give my hon.
Friend an assurance that we will look at these issues closely.
I point out that Transport for London is buying a new fleet of Piccadilly line trains that have higher capacity.
It is part of a larger fleet replacement programme, and 10 new Elizabeth line trains are also being built.
We will look at the whole issue of how people get to and from the airport, because I agree that it is absolutely vital.
The Chancellor has staked her economic credibility and growth strategy on a third runway at Heathrow.
The Secretary of State said that she is committed to seeing flights take off from it in 2035, yet at the same time, she talks about taking an evidence-led approach, putting this project to her four tests, taking the advice of the Climate Change Committee and doing a thorough economic and environmental impact assessment.
Could she clarify a point for the House, because I fear my hon.
Friend  the Member for Didcot and Wantage (Olly Glover)  did not get a straight answer?
If the evidence shows that the environmental costs are too great and the economic benefits are too little, will she and, crucially, her Chancellor be prepared to do a U-turn and can this whole project?
We see the huge opportunities and benefits associated with expanding capacity at Heathrow and having a third runway there.
There will be a thorough process, which we are starting today by reviewing the policy framework in which any planning application will be judged.
The Planning Inspectorate will look at that and consider all the issues to do with economic need, air quality, noise and carbon, and then a decision will be taken.
We have an ambition to see planes taking off from the runway in 2035, but that does not mean that we will not have a thorough process.
We are committed to that, and that is what I am setting out today.
