I thank the right hon.
Lady for raising that on behalf of Fiona.
Let me give Fiona and the House my answer.
The grooming scandal was one of the worst scandals of our time.
Women and girls were abused and exploited by predatory gangs of men, and survivors have been ignored for many years, including by the state, which of course is supposed to protect them.
My vow to Fiona and to them is that this national inquiry will change that.
