I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that devastating case.
My thoughts, and I am sure those of the whole House, are with the family and friends.
Through our Crime and Policing Bill, we are increasing penalties for the illegal sale of knives and giving police new powers to seize knives likely to be used for violence or cause harm.
We have also launched a coalition to tackle knife crime, to bring together campaigners and community leaders to tackle the root causes of knife crime and help protect the next generation.
