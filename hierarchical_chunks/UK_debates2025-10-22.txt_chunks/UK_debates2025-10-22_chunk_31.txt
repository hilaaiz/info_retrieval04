I thank my hon.
Friend for his question; he is a credit to his community.
I know at first hand that he has done so much hard work to help to heal, to rebuild and to look to a brighter future for Southport.
I welcome the Phab charity to Parliament; it does fantastic work to help break down barriers.
I am proud that Labour is backing our youth clubs with £30 million of grant funding, doubling the number of youth hubs and providing a youth guarantee with earning or learning guaranteed for our young people.
Our national youth strategy will be set out in the autumn.
