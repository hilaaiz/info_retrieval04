Ahmad Al Ibrahim was only 16 years old when he was fatally stabbed in Huddersfield.
His life was cruelly taken away in what the police described as an “unprovoked” and “motiveless” attack.
Following a visit to Netherhall learning campus in my constituency last week, I know how important this issue is for young people.
Will the Prime Minister commit to redoubling efforts to tackle serious violence and knife crime through more visible policing, stronger prevention and investment in youth services?
