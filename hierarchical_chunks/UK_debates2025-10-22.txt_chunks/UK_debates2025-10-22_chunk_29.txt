I thank the hon.
Member for raising this serious issue, as he has done on a number of occasions.
It affects both his constituents and others across the country.
It is simply unacceptable that customers and staff have been so badly let down.
I know he will be meeting the relevant Minister, but let me update him now in a couple of respects.
Officials are currently reviewing whether the integrated care boards and General Pharmaceutical Council need additional powers to address  pharmacy businesses that do not play by the rules—I think that is exactly the point he raises.
That could include powers for the council to go after business owners in addition to the pharmacy professionals.
More detail will be provided when the hon.
Member meets with the Minister, but I thought it helpful to give those two indications.
