I welcome Millie to the Gallery—I appreciate that Members on the Opposition Benches cannot see her, but she is looking down at us and   smiling with the courage and positivity that I know is everything to her.
We absolutely salute that; we are humbled by it.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
] I really do find it hard to understand how a school trust could make a decision like that in relation to the ramp.
Rather than berate those in the trust from the Chamber, I would just implore them on behalf of everybody here and Millie in particular to look again, and hopefully, with the endorsement of the whole House, to reconsider that decision, put in that ramp and match the positivity and the courage that Millie has shown all of us.
I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that campaign.
