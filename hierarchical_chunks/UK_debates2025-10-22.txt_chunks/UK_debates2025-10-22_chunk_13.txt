The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 22 October.
On Sunday we unveiled Labour’s plan to recruit hundreds of thousands of workers into clean energy, creating quality, well-paid jobs in every quarter of the United Kingdom.
On Monday we announced the new V-level qualification, to make sure that every young person has the skills to realise their potential.
On Tuesday our first ever regional investment summit in Birmingham secured £10 billion of investment.
And today we are announcing tough  new penalties to end the scandal of pollution in our rivers and seas.
That is national renewal with a Labour Government.
Yesterday I met Claire Throssell, who is with us in the Gallery today.
Her two young sons, Paul and Jack, were murdered 11 years ago this week by her abusive ex-husband after a family court ordered that he should have unsupervised contact with them.
Claire’s bravery and her campaign are humbling, and today I am pleased that we can announce that we will repeal the presumption of parental involvement, putting children’s safety first.
This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s sympathies extended towards Claire, and I commend her for her bravery.
I regret to inform the House that yesterday there was a very serious breach of national security, when my Prime Minister’s question was photographed heading into No. 10 in a transparent folder.
The nation can rest easy, as on this occasion no state secrets were revealed.
However, it does make me wonder whether this Government can be trusted with a digital ID scheme that is mandatory in all but name.
[Laughter.]
I like to keep the Prime Minister on his toes.
Will he reverse this misguided scheme, or will he persist with a plan that makes all of our personal data vulnerable to hacks and attacks?
