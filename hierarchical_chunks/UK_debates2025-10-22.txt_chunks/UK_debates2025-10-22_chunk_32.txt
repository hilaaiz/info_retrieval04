Last week, I invited the Prime Minister to match the Conservative pledge to scrap business rates for our  high streets.
However, he declined.
Instead, he pointed me towards the small business strategy.
Since then, businesses have been in touch to tell me that the strategy will make little or no difference to their future.
With 14,000 high street businesses expected to close this year alone, and with retail businesses in my constituency facing a doubling of their business rates, when will the Labour Government deliver on their commitment to reduce business rates, given that they are unprepared to accept our policy of scrapping them altogether?
Our small business plan was drawn up with small businesses.
I sent the hon.
Member a copy online; I hope that she shared that with the 3,000 small businesses in her constituency.
That shows what we are doing.
[Hon.
Members: “Rubbish!”]
Well, Conservative Members shout “rubbish”, but this is what small businesses asked us to do.
There is £1 billion of additional lending to small businesses and £3 billion extra for small businesses to scale up, and we are dealing with late payments in the biggest reform for 25 years.
As Britain faced peril in world war two, Winston Churchill took a radical step: he changed the clocks to shift extra daylight into the evenings.
As the clocks go back this weekend, will the Prime Minister take a look at the evidence on trialling Churchill time again to cut carbon,  reduce bills, improve road safety, boost the hospitality industry and be the Prime Minister who will brighten up all our lives?
