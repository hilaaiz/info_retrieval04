I thank the Secretary of State for her statement, which made the Government’s intent of supporting the proposed third runway at Heathrow very clear.
It was good to hear her recognise the complexity of all that will be needed to deliver it, including major diversionary works on two of the country’s busiest motorways.
We Liberal Democrats continue to support the right infrastructure in the right place, which is why we have always supported schemes such as East West Rail and Northern Powerhouse Rail.
However, we need the right infrastructure to tackle the right problems, and there are many unanswered questions about the Heathrow third runway.
