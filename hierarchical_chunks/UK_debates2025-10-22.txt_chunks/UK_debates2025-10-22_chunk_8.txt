I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman back to the Dispatch Box as Secretary of State for Scotland after his sabbatical over the last 20 or so years.
The messianic zeal of his colleague the Energy Secretary to see the destruction of our oil and gas industry is having real-life consequences.
Scottish workers are being made unemployed in their thousands, while this Government ban the drilling and exploration of oil and gas in British waters, and import more gas from Norway, which gets it from the very same sea that we are prevented from exploiting.
Come on, Secretary of State; it is all a little unhinged, isn’t it?
