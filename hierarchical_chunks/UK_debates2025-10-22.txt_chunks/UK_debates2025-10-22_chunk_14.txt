I thank the hon.
Member for her question.
The whole point of digital ID, of course, is that you cannot see it, so that should at least deal with her first concern.
It is important that we make access to public services as easy as possible for people.
We all know the difficulties that so many people have with accessing services, and digital ID has been shown in other countries to help.
I do think this is an important step forward.
I also think it is very important as part of our plan to tackle those who are entering our country illegally.
