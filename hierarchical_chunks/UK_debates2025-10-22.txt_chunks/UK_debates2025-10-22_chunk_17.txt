May I first pay tribute to the former Conservative MP Oliver Colvile, who has very sadly passed away after a long illness?
Colleagues will remember him for his love of cricket and, of course, hedgehogs.
He will be very much missed.
Four victims on the rape gangs survivors panel have resigned, and they have resigned because they have lost all confidence in the Government’s inquiry, so I am giving my first question to one of them—to Fiona.
She said: “Being dismissed and contradicted by a minister when you’re telling the truth takes you right back to that feeling of not being believed all over again.”
Fiona’s question is simple: “what’s the point in speaking up if we’re just going to be called liars?”
