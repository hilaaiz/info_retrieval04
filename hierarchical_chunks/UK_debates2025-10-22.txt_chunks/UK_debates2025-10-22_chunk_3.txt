What assessment he has made of the potential impact of changes to inheritance tax relief on Scotland’s agricultural sector.
This Government appreciate the role of farmers and everyone involved in our agricultural sector, and I have been delighted to meet representatives of the National Farmers Union of Scotland and other stakeholders on numerous occasions.
On each, I have reiterated that the Government want to strike a fair balance between supporting farmers and fixing our public finances and the public services on which our rural communities rely.
As both hon.
Members will be aware, the vast majority of farmers will not be affected at all.
They will be able to pass the family farm down to their children, just as previous generations have always done.
Only the richest estates will be asked to pay, not small family farms, and that is a policy that we on this side of the House are proud to support.
