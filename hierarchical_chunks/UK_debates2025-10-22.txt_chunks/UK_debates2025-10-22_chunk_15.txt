The number of households in Cornwall in temporary accommodation has increased by 265% in five years, so I am delighted that this Labour Government are investing £39 billion in social and affordable housing.
In Cornwall we are developing a strategy to provide housing at sites such as Pydar in my constituency, which needs support from Homes England.
Will the Prime Minister arrange for us to meet the Housing Minister at our Homes Cornwall launch next month, to accelerate discussions on a strategic partnership for Cornwall so that we can build the right homes in the right places for local people?
I know that the Housing Minister will be delighted to meet my hon.
Friend to help unlock new homes for her constituents.
We are working closely with local authorities through our small sites aggregator to build new affordable homes on brownfield sites.
My goal is to restore the dream of home ownership, which was stolen by the Opposition when they were in government.
