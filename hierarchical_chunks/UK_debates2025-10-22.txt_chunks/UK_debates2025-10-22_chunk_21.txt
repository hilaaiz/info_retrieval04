The Prime Minister is talking about mandatory reporting.
I will remind him what Fiona asked: what is the point, if the victims are not going to be believed?
What would be the point of mandatory reporting?
All of this is happening now—all that he is saying—is because four of those victims resigned from the survivors panel.
If they had not done that, the Government would have continued with the watering down, which we all know they were carrying out.
So yes, the victims are right to be worried.
