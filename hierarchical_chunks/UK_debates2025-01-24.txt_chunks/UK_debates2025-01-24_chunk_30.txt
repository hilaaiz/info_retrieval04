I thank the Minister for a very positive statement—it is always good to have positive statements, and today is one of those occasions.
It is great news to hear of the wonderful investment, which is needed to shore up not only defence but our manufacturing industry.
Looking at the job allocation, I see that there are 800 jobs for Derby in England, and 200 for Glasgow in Scotland and Cardiff in Wales.
I have no doubt whatsoever about the Minister’s commitment to job creation, but will she outline how the Government will ensure that businesses and factories in Northern Ireland can be involved in the supply or provision of parts?
Particularly, will she outline whether the skills of Harland and Wolff can be utilised in fulfilment of the contract, and whether UK-wide involvement was a stipulation of the deal with Rolls-Royce?
