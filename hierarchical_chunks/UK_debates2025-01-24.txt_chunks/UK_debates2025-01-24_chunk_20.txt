I thank my hon.
Friend for making that point.
She knows a lot about the subject, and she is correct that it is a landmark deal.
It is particularly beneficial for Derby.
As she said, there are many skills there already, but the Nuclear Skills Academy will be creating 200 apprenticeships and opportunities a year for young people to get into nuclear skills.
Of course, those are transferable skills that are relevant not only on the military side but on the civil side, which will give young people with those skills great opportunities in life.
That is one of the most important parts of the deal.
