I thank my Dorset neighbour for giving way.
As always, I find myself agreeing with a lot of what he says, not least on the cost of inaction being far greater than the cost of action.
He makes many good points about the fact that we have outsourced our carbon emissions to places far away, but does he agree that we often fail to sell the opportunities around tackling climate change, especially for British businesses, such as those provided by tidal and wave technologies?
We should celebrate those opportunities.
The Government talk about growth; there is so much opportunity for growth in this sector, and we should do more.
