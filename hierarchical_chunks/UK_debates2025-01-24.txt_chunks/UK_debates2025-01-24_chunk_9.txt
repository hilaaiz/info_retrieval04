I thank  the hon.
Member for South Cotswolds (Dr Savage) , the promoter of the Bill, for the hard work that she has done to get to this point—it has, I believe, been a baptism of fire.
I am sure many people across the House would like to thank her for what she has done to get the Bill back before the House once again.
I also thank the Zero Hour campaign—or the Climate and Nature Bill campaign, as it is sometimes called—and all my constituents who have not given me pause to breathe in telling me to get here today, once again, to vote for the Bill.
I am sure many other Members have experienced that, too.
