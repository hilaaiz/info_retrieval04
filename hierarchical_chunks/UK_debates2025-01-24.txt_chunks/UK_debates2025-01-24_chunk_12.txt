Choices need to be made here.
Many of my constituents cannot afford to fly.
Everyone wants to see their constituents benefit from the economy, and if we go down that path of expansion, we will be heading in the wrong direction.
There will be many Members on both the Government and the Opposition Benches who do not want to see that.
I believe that expanding Heathrow is incompatible with having a genuine approach to biodiversity and climate.
The Climate Change Committee has already stated, before we even get to the seventh carbon budget, that this should not happen.
We will need to have a very hard, honest conversation about that.
I do not think it should happen.
I pay tribute to  the hon.
Member for South Cotswolds (Dr Savage)  for bringing forward the Bill, and to all the academics and campaigners behind it.
Listening to the debate, I think the one point we need to draw out is that we need robust scrutiny, and we need to be able to hold Government to account through tighter mechanisms.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that it is crucial that the mechanisms in the Bill are expedited, to ensure that Government get on with achieving the targets that we have all been talking about?
