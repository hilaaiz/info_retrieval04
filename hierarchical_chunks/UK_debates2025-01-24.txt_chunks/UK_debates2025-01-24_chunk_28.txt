I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He is right that there is much innovation in the defence industries in our nations, and often with dual-use technology, which means that it is not just about defence but about a broader range of potential opportunities.
I see no reason why all those opportunities cannot be exploited using our defence industrial strategy to kick things off.
I hope to see that in future.
