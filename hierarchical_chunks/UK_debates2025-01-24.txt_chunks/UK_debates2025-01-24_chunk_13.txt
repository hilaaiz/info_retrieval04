I thank my hon.
Friend for that contribution, and indeed for the work she has done on climate and nature throughout her political career.
Of course I agree.
Everyone understands that in government, there are pressures on Ministers—there are pressures from the Treasury, from business and from vested interests, many of them big and powerful, with big PR and the ability to lobby Ministers in ways that our constituents cannot and in ways that nature cannot.
Squirrels, bats and newts cannot lobby like BlackRock and others who want economic growth and profit.
This needs to be locked in and legislated for; that is what the Bill is all about.
