I thank my hon.
Friend for her intervention, and applaud her for her work as an effective spokesperson on behalf of the farming community.
Indeed, she pre-empted what I was about to say.
Farmers should be properly rewarded for restoring soils, planting hedgerows and reducing pesticide use, with an expanded nature-friendly farming budget at the upcoming comprehensive spending review.
They need a clear long-term strategy from the Government so that they are able to plan and invest accordingly.
