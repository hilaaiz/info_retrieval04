It is right that we celebrate this success for British industry and its skilled workforce.
However, while we welcome this development, the Government must go further to create the stability and certainty that businesses need to thrive.
Long-term growth requires an industrial strategy that incentivises investment in ethical, inclusive new technologies such as artificial intelligence and clean energy.
We must position the UK as a global leader in these sectors, so that we tackle the climate crisis while creating good jobs and driving economic growth.
Furthermore, we urge the Government to work in closer partnership with businesses of all sizes.

Our security is inseparable from Europe’s, and we must work towards a UK-EU defence and security agreement.
Recent agreements with Germany are promising, but they must be a starting point for deeper co-operation.
What steps are being taken to strengthen the AUKUS partnership with the United States and Australia, particularly in the light of concerns about potential shifts in US foreign policy?
National security and economic growth— Order.
The Liberal Democrat spokeswoman will be aware that she is allocated two minutes, which she has already exceeded significantly.
