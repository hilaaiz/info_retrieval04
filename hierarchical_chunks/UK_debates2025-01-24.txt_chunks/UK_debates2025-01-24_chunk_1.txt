Second Reading I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
The Climate and Nature Bill has been four years in the making.
The enormous amount of support that it has garnered from campaigners, trade unions, scientists, faith leaders, non-governmental organisations, businesses and especially young people means that it is both an honour and an enormous responsibility to set out what it entails, what it adds to existing law and why I believe it addresses the most important existential challenge of our generation: the intertwined climate and nature crises.
This country has signed up to various international commitments, but we still have work to do to fully connect them to real and measurable action.
We need to close the ambition gap between what is needed and what is promised, and the delivery gap between what is promised and what is actually happening.
That is what the Bill aims to do, because too many metrics are still heading in the wrong direction.
It is important, as the hon.
Lady has underlined, that we move forward together.
She has not mentioned the National Farmers Union.
Can she reassure me and others in the House that the National Farmers Union, and the Ulster Farmers Union in Northern Ireland, are happy with the Bill and accept the impact that its proposals will have on them?
