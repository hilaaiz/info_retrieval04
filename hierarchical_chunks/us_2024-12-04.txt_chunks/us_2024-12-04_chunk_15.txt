Mr. CASTRO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Mr. Jorge Cortez, who passed away on November 11, 2024, at the age of 81.
Known for his signature red apron, white guayabera and white hat, Jorge was not just an icon of San Antonio's culinary world but also a visionary artist and a champion of the city's vibrant cultura.
A proud son of my hometown of San Antonio, 
Mr. Cortez leaves behind his seven children--Pete, Deborah, Christina, Paloma, Carino, Alexandra, and Sol Jorge, twelve grandchildren, and one greatgrandchild.
In 1941, 
Mr. Cortez's parents, Pedro and Cruz, purchased a small three-table cafe that would become an iconic and beloved community institution.
Mi Tierra Cafe was more than a place to dine--it became a haven for comunidad, filled with musica, murals, and the aromas of their authentic comida.
After their father passed away in 1984, Mr. Cortez and his siblings committed themselves to preserving and expanding his legacy, creating a thriving business rooted in honoring and promoting their Latino culture.
Under their leadership, La Familia Cortez grew to include five beloved restaurants, employing more than 600 San Antonians.
Mr. Cortez's creative spark was also behind the invention of sizzling fajitas, a dish that has become synonymous with Tex-Mex cuisine.
