Mr. Cortez was more than a restaurateur; he was an artist and a visionary leader who believed in using art and culture to uplift the community.
His artistry extended beyond the murals of Mi Tierra to shape the cultural fabric of downtown San Antonio.
Mr. Cortez played a key role in the establishment of Zona Cultural, a 44-block historic district designated by the City of San Antonio and the State of Texas that celebrates the diversity, creativity, and commerce.
His vision for Zona Cultural transformed it into a hub of heritage and innovation, ensuring that future generations could experience and cherish the richness of the city's history.
La Familia Cortez is the definition of the American dream, and the Cortez family continues to shape San Antonio for the better.
Mr. Cortez was a lively and much-admired member of our community, and he will be greatly missed.
