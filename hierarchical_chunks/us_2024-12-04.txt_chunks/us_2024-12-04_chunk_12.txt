Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Staff Sergeant Mark Russell of Sherman, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
Staff Sergeant Russell honorably served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam war.
Staff Sergeant Russell trained in Radiology, Radiation Technology, and medical physics.
During his time serving in the U.S. Air Force, he was given the responsibility to open and establish a Radiation Oncology treatment center to qualify the Wright-Patterson AFB as a comprehensive cancer treatment center.
Additionally, he received the National Defense Service Medal, the AFM 900-3, and a Sharp Shooter Badge for his service in the U.S. Air Force.
Staff Sergeant Russell is a graduate of the Hobe Sound Bible College in Florida, where he received a bachelor's degree in educational administration in 1970.
He began working at the Wright-Patterson AFB Medical Center's Radiation Oncology facility that same year while completing postgraduate studies.
Staff Sergeant Russell later received his Master of Science in Radiological Physics from Ohio State University and a Master of Health Administration from Washington University.
Throughout his extensive career, he has published numerous studies on the topic of oncology and worked diligently to bring us one step closer to defeating cancer.
From 2007 to 2012, Staff Sergeant Russell served as the Director for Physics and Technology Services at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida.
I am honored to represent Staff Sergeant Russell in Texas' 4th Congressional district.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas.
