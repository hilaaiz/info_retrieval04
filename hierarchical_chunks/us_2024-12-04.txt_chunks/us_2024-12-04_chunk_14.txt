Ms. LOIS FRANKEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office (PBSO)
Deputy Sheriff Jahmar Robinson, a diligent public servant, to congratulate him on being named the Field Operations Awardee at the 7th Annual Attorney General Awards for Distinguished Service in Policing.
During his time with PBSO, Deputy Robinson has become a trusted presence and role model in the community.
Deputy Robinson's knowledge of the County and its residents has prevented potential violent cnmes before they happen and has allowed him to respond effectively when incidents arise.
He serves our local residents through community-oriented practices in policing, while combating crime and decreasing recidivism.
Deputy Robinson serves as a positive role model for at-risk youth, and his work goes above and beyond crime prevention and response.
From facilitating outreach to local schools to connecting local residents to childcare resources and domestic violence crisis resources, his dedication to enhancing safety and fostering civilian relationships has lasting impacts on building a safer and more connected community.
Jahmar's dedication to public safety and his service to the people of Palm Beach County is truly admirable.
I am proud to celebrate him today and wish him continued success.
