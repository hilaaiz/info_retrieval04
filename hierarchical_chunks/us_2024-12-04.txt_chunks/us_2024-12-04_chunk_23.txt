work on behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
In August, Zehra departed my office for a new opportunity to attend Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Science for Political Science, and I could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
As a Minnesota District Three native, Zehra grew up in the district she so proudly served.
After graduating from The Blake School, she attended and graduated from the University of Minnesota earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in political science.
Her public service spans time working in State Legislative Offices and at the federal level.
Zehra has strong ties to her cultural identity and community.
She has a passion for global women's issues, even serving as a delegate to the 68th UN Commission on The Status.
Zehra's colleagues have had the honor of watching her evolve from a shy intern to a confident, capable Staff Assistant during her time in the office.
Equally adept with pop culture critiques and international affairs analysis, Zehra has made our office both smarter and more relevant.
Her deep roots in MN-03 allow her to both connect with constituents and offer the best local restaurant recommendations.
The people of Minnesota's Third Congressional District were lucky to have her dedication and leadership, and she is dearly missed.
However, we look forward to watching her succeed in graduate school and beyond.
