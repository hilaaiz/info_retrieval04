Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my congratulations to Commissioner Janet Weir Creighton for her service as a Stark County Commissioner, and my sincere gratitude for all that she has done for the people of Ohio's 13th Congressional District, the ``Birthplace of Champions.''
I have appreciated her partnership as we worked together to expand opportunity and deliver results for our shared constituents.
Her drive to lead is commendable, and I have no doubt that she has bettered countless lives as a result of her steadfast service.
Throughout her 40 years in public service, she has proven to be a true advocate and leader.
She led by example through her perseverance, compassion, and dedication in her role in the community and those she served.
As a woman in a position of influence, and sometimes the first woman in her various roles throughout her career, she has undoubtedly inspired the coming generation of young women to stand strong for what they believe in and strive for positions of leadership.
For her outstanding devotion, she has earned the respect and esteem of many, and in the wake of her departure, I know her numerous contributions will not be forgotten I am confident that her fine character and decisive leadership will be sorely missed.
As she goes on to continue serving our community in new ways, I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.
Again, on behalf of Ohio's 13th Congressional District, I would like to thank Commissioner Janet Weir Creighton for her commitment to the people of Stark County and to Northeast Ohio.
