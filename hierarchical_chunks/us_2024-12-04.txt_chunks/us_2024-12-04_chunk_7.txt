Throughout his career, Lieutenant Richmond exemplified what it means to be a public servant.
His courage, resilience, and professionalism set a standard for others to follow.
The impact of his service will be felt for many years to come, as the countless lives he touched--whether as a soldier or as a police officer--will continue to carry the lessons he imparted through his actions and leadership.
Lieutenant Richmond is also an exemplary father and husband.
Throughout his career, he worked hard to ensure that his family was taken care of, and that they had all of the opportunities.
I am honored to represent Lieutenant Richmond in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a privilege to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people.
