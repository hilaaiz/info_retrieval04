I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I know he was at Cali.
There was some progress on such issues as digital sequence information, but more needs to be done.
We are very seized of the need to join up action on the nature and climate crisis.
When I head out to COP29 tomorrow, Members will hopefully hear more from us on our efforts to protect forests and on the support we are giving to countries at risk of deforestation.
We are also looking at nature-based solutions to climate change.
The nature Minister—the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Coventry East (Mary Creagh) —will be out there as well, and we will have more to say, but I entirely agree with my hon.
Friend  the Member for Chesterfield (Mr Perkins)  that we cannot deal with one crisis in isolation from the other.
