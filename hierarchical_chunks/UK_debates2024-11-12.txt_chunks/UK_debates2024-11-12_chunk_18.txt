We have spoken a lot about the Conservative party’s record in government, and I am very proud of our record on fusion.
We launched the Fusion Futures programme to provide up to £55 million of funding to train more than 2,000 people, we became the first country in the world to regulate fusion as a distinct energy technology, and we launched the process to build the spherical tokamak for energy production—I cannot say that as quickly—at what will be the first fusion power plant at West Burton in Nottinghamshire.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
] Members are very welcome.
Will the Minister confirm that it is still the Government’s intention, as it was ours, to have fusion power on the grid by 2040?
As I mentioned, I am very much looking forward to visiting West Burton soon.
The Budget announced significant support for fusion energy in 2025-26 and, yes, we remain as ambitious as the previous Government for the potential of fusion energy.
Having confirmed that 2040 is still the ambition, which does the Minister think will come first: fusion on the grid or the final investment decision on Sizewell C?
The final investment decision on Sizewell C, as I understand it, is expected soon.
We will hear more about support for that in the next spending review.
Fusion energy has huge potential, not just in the long term but from the innovation we are already seeing in that sphere, which I very much welcome.
What plans he has to support the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage projects at Acorn.
What recent steps his Department has taken to support carbon capture and storage.
On  4 October , the Government announced £21.7 billion over the next 25 years to launch the UK’s carbon capture, utilisation and storage industry.
We will provide further details on the next steps for CCUS, including track 2 projects such as Acorn, in the coming months.
