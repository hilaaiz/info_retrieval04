The Minister knows well the Liberal Democrats’ commitment to community energy.
Will the Government establish a clean community energy scheme, look at the barriers that currently face community energy projects and look at supporting the National Grid to deliver community energy?
The hon.
Lady and I have had a number of conversations, and I recognise her commitment on this issue.
We have committed in the local power plan to delivering investment in community energy across the country.
Importantly, we want not only to invest in schemes, but to deliver across Government the mechanisms needed to make it more possible for communities to deliver such schemes.
That will build capacity in communities so that we can see more community energy.
What is the beef behind the Government’s reluctance to embrace with enthusiasm locally generated community energy?
Why did they vote against the amendment tabled to the Great British Energy Bill by  the hon.
Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse) ?
I think the right hon.
Gentleman thinks that was a “gotcha” question, but, of course, the Conservative party did not vote for the Bill at all.
Amendment or not, I do not think he can really speak about what Great British Energy might deliver, because, despite it being one of the most popular policies at the last election, the Conservatives failed to bother to vote for it.
