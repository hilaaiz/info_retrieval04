I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question.
I am afraid that I cannot commit to extending the deadline.
It is important that we encourage as many pensioners as possible—I know that he is working on that in his constituency, and I did a pension credit surgery in my constituency last week—to check whether they are eligible for pension credit.
We have 160 local authorities up and down the country helping us to check the eligibility of those in need and those on the lowest incomes.
That is the right thing to do.
Those claims can be backdated by three months, and anyone who is eligible for pension credit in the qualifying week will also be passported to other benefits, such as the winter fuel payment.
