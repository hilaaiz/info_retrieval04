I completely agree with my hon.
Friend.
There is a direct link between taking action to protect the British people at home and leading on climate action abroad.
If we want to protect our country from future energy shocks and the runaway cost of climate chaos, we must work with other countries to protect our planet.
We now have the credibility to do that because of the action we have taken since entering government, as was apparent when I attended pre-COP meetings in Baku last month and as the Prime Minister will demonstrate in Baku today.
I warmly welcome the new Government target to cut carbon emissions, and I know the Secretary of State and the Minister thoroughly understand the importance of joined-up action on climate justice.
Can she tell us whether every single Government policy across every Government Department will now be assessed to check  whether it is compatible with 1.5°?
What steps are the Government taking to ensure the global south is properly compensated for climate loss and damage?
On the second point first, at this COP we want to ensure that we fully operationalise the loss and damage fund, so we then start getting money into it and channelling money to developing countries.
We also want to do that through the new collective quantified goal, which we hope will be ambitious and multi-layered.
On the question of looking at our policies across the piece, that is very much my job.
We will be responding soon to the Committee on Climate Change’s report, which the hon.
Lady will know was quite critical of the previous Government’s action.
We will be setting out our plan to implement the NDC and looking at the next carbon budget.
All those things require effort share across Departments to ensure we actually meet them.
It is about not just setting ambitious targets, but making sure that, unlike the previous Government, we have a strategy to get us there.
