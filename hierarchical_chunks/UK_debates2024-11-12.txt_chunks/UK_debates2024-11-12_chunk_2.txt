Today, the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Doncaster North (Ed Miliband) , is already at COP29 in Baku, where he will be leading climate negotiations.
He sends his apologies.
The Prime Minister is also at COP29 and will be speaking at the global leaders summit, announcing our ambitious 1.5°C-aligned nationally determined contribution and showing that the UK is truly back on the international stage.
A written statement will also be made later today.
