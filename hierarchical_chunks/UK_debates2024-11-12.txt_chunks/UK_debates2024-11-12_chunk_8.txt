For the UK to be an international leader on climate change we need to bring the business community with us.
The Summer Berry Company in my constituency recently invested £8 million in ensuring it is carbon neutral, but it was then quoted a further £3 million to be able to feed its excess energy into the grid.
What is the Minister doing to make additional grid connections affordable and accessible for green businesses?
The energy Minister—the Under-Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rutherglen (Michael Shanks) —is very much involved with that issue.
We have also set up the energy superpower mission board, headed by Chris Stark.
I had a conversation with him yesterday about what we can do to ensure grid capacity and grid connections in the right places.
If the hon.
Lady has a specific issue to raise and would like to write to me, I will make sure it is passed on to him.
