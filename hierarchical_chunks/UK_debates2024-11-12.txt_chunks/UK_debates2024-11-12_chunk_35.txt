The advisory committee made several recommendations related to getting assistance to people who should be in  receipt of pension credit.
Could the Minister indicate whether the Government intend to accept those recommendations?
We are deploying an additional 500 staff to deal with the substantial increase—over 150%—in claims.
That is the right thing to do.
It is an operational focus for the Department to get through those claims as quickly as possible, to make sure that we get the help to those most in need.
The Social Security Advisory Committee estimated that more than 70% of people with a disability will lose their winter fuel payment this year.
Does the hon.
Lady really think that cutting benefits from this vulnerable group of pensioners is the right thing to do?
If the hon.
Lady looks at the equality analysis, she will see that those with a disability will be disproportionately likely to retain the winter fuel payment.
I urge her to have a look at that.
