I recognise the hon.
Gentleman’s point, and I am looking forward to meeting him and his colleagues this afternoon to discuss the particular issues in his area.
We need to build more network infrastructure across the UK to make this endeavour a reality, but he is right: we want to bring communities with us on this journey.
That is why we have said that we are looking again at what community benefits will look like, building on some of the work that the previous Government did in consulting on this issue.
Crucially, however, if want to bring down bills and deliver energy security, we will have to build the infrastructure, and that is what this Government are committed to doing.
