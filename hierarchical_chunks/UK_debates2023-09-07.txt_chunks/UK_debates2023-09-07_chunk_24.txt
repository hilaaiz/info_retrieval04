I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important issue, and I hope the approval for his question that I have just heard across both sides of the House was audible to others.
I believe that this appalling incident is still subject to a police investigation, but it appears that roads leading to the pub were blocked to prevent emergency vehicles from reaching the fire.
I hope I speak for all of us when I say that this is an appalling and disgraceful situation.
I was encouraged by the statement from Andy Street that it would be dealt with, and that if it turned out that there had been foul play, people would be held to account.
I am sure that if my hon.
Friend applied for a debate it would be extremely well attended, and that he has the support of everyone in this place.
