I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point, and he is absolutely right in what he says.
Small shops are lifelines for communities; it is a sorry state of affairs if they are not able to thrive and are disincentivised from continuing their business.
He will know that, leaving aside fraud and computer crime, we have halved crime since 2010, on roughly the same—slightly more—resource.
That is a tremendous record, but there is more to be done, with a particular focus on antisocial behaviour and these kinds of crimes.
He will know that the Home Office recently said that every crime of this nature needs to be followed up and investigated.
I will make sure that the Home Office has heard what my hon.
Friend has said.
I think such issues will be the focus of many colleagues in the coming weeks.
