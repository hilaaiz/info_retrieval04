I thank my hon.
Friend for his very important question.
Alongside a lot of the support mechanisms we have introduced—Operation Fortitude, Operation Courage, Operation Restore and Operation Nova—we have a  series of missions or sector initiatives for accelerating veterans who have come out of the military with specialist skills into a job and making sure those skills are not going to waste.
Having a job remains the No. 1 factor in improving the life chances of veterans.
Veteran employment is at 87%—it has never been higher—but there is more to do, and I look forward to working with my hon.
Friend in the months ahead.
