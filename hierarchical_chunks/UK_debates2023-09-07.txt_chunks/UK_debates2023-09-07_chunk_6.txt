Last year, the Prime Minister said that his Government would do “everything we can” to recover covid fraud losses, yet the crony PPE VIP lane helped Tory-linked business owners over small and medium-sized businesses, meaning that £15 billion of taxpayer money was wasted on useless PPE.
The Public Accounts Committee found it “unacceptable” that the Government are not prioritising recouping misused money, with only £21 million—only 2%—recovered from fraudsters.
What steps is the Secretary of State taking to fulfil his Government’s pledge to reclaim misused taxpayer money?
Or is that, like the Prime Minister’s promise of integrity and accountability, another failed vow?
What we saw during the crisis was the Prime Minister, who was then Chancellor, acting decisively and rapidly to save the economy and millions of jobs.
Since we have passed out of the covid period, we are taking action to recover fraud and error losses.
As set out by my hon.
Friends, in the past two years alone, we have recovered more than £3 billion.
I would gently say to the hon.
Lady that people in glasshouses should perhaps not throw stones, given the experience of her party’s leaders being frogmarched by the police to investigate the misuse of funds by her own party.
What assessment he has made of the adequacy of the remit of the independent adviser on ministerial interests.
