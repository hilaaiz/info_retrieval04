I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and pay tribute to all those working locally in her constituency to prepare to welcome Afghan families to the area.
North Devon is steeped in military history.
I am pleased to see her long-standing support for veterans extend to those who assisted the UK in Afghanistan as well.
