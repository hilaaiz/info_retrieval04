I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that and giving us the opportunity again to celebrate the successes of women in sport, as well as the fantastic news of our hosting the next women’s rugby world cup.
That is wonderful news and we have a great record of hosting such events.
Since 2012, we have hosted over 130 sporting events, which is a great record to be proud of.
I will make sure that her enthusiasm has been heard by the relevant Minister.
