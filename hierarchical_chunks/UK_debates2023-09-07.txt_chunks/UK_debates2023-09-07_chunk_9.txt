I record my admiration for, and thank, the many public and voluntary agencies and individuals in Fife for the dedication and compassion that they have shown to the Afghans they have hosted over the last two years.
Sadly, those Afghans are becoming victims of the biggest mass eviction that Scotland has seen since the highland clearances.
When we remember that those people are here because they risked their lives for us—they risked their lives in Afghanistan for democracy—why have the Government not even considered a Homes for Afghans scheme, similar to the Homes for Ukraine scheme that made such a difference to desperate Ukrainian refugees?
Largely because these are two different cohorts.
Ukrainians are looking to return to Ukraine in the future; the Afghan cohort are staying here and will be in this country for an indeterminate period.
We are looking at all ways that we can continue to assist those who have come over from Afghanistan.
I, too, pay tribute to all the Home Office liaison officers and all the staff in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and in the Ministry of Defence who have worked hard to get this over the line.
I said that we would honour our commitments to the people of Afghanistan and we will continue to do so.
