I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
I have great sympathy with what he outlines.
I would not just say, “What is the fair and right thing to do?”
If we want to be successful in making this transition, and helping other countries to do so, we can do that only with technology, solutions and innovation that people will love and want to adopt, and that will make their bills cheaper and their lives easier.
That is the only way we will be successful in meeting our environmental ambitions.
I encourage him to apply for a debate, and to focus on not just the costs, but the value of innovation and how we can encourage British businesses to be at the forefront of it, and take their ideas and sell them to the world.
