I thank my hon.
Friend for the work she is doing to ensure that these much-needed facilities can continue in her constituency.
She is absolutely right, and I know that many Members of this House very much value sports clubs and societies, and particularly the sports she mentions.
She will know that, if she were to apply for a debate, it would be well attended.
We have had a number of debates on these issues quite recently.
