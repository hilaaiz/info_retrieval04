Osteoporosis affects about 15% of the UK population, especially women.
Early diagnosis is vital and could lead to many thousands of preventable deaths.
The Royal Osteoporosis Society is based in Bath, and I am sure the Leader of the House and everybody here will join me in congratulating it on its excellent work.
The Royal United Hospital in Bath has a specialist fracture clinic, but only half of NHS England trusts provide such clinics.
Can we have a debate in the House on support for fracture liaison services and on people living with osteoporosis?
