I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman to his spot and I look forward to debating with him on this and other issues.
I do not quite accept his categorisation of us as sneaking out a document by publishing it and sharing it widely on social media.
As I explained to  the hon.
Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney) , we have delayed implementation in response to the challenges the country has faced.
We are now ready to move forward with a brand-new border target operating model, which has the support of businesses, of vets and of those dealing with sanitary and phytosanitary checks.
It will be a very good thing for the country and will help us to secure our borders in new ways.
