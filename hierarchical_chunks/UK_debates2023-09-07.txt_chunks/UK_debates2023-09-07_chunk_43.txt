I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this matter and advertising this event.
She is absolutely right, particularly as the covid inquiry looks at these matters, that the experiences and concerns of those who lost loved ones should be at the forefront.
It was a terribly traumatic few years for everyone, with the isolation and the additional pressures that people faced.
To lose, in some cases, multiple family members during such a time is incredibly hard to metabolise and bear.
She will know how to apply for a debate, but if she sends the details to my office I shall look at ways I can support this.
