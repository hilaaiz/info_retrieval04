Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker; it is great to see you in the Chair so early in the day.
Members will be aware that the Government attempted to sneak out in the summer that announcement about the utter chaos they have created over the border target operating model.
I say to the Minister that inflation is of central relevance to this matter, because the cat is out of the bag.
The Government’s own document concedes that these measures, when introduced, will have an impact on inflation and will make the cost of food even higher.
Can the Minister set out what assessment has been made of the wasted money and the cost to taxpayers and businesses as a result of the Government’s chaos on this issue?
