I thank the Leader of the House for announcing next week’s business.
I note that she did not announce the business for Monday 18 and  Tuesday 19 September , but I understand that the Government intend to award the Tuesday to the Backbench Business Committee.
If that is the case, we would propose a pre-recess general debate on matters to be raised before the forthcoming Adjournment.
The one that took place before the summer recess was very well subscribed and time limits were imposed, and I am sure that this would also be a popular debate.
