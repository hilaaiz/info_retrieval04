I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend the Chairman of the Select Committee.
I am wary of giving too many assurances, because we are talking about a time beyond the next general election, when there will be a new Conservative Government, who will have priorities that they will wish to update.
We know about the success that the shared prosperity fund has had in Northern Ireland.
I have visited projects that it has funded.
I would like to think that it will continue strongly across the next spending review period.
