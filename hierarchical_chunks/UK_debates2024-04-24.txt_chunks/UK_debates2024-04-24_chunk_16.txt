I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question, because there is a genuinely interesting point about the growth in the number of people who live in Northern Ireland who declare themselves to be Northern Irish.
I would like to think that it is reflected in the way that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister go about their business.
They are working together in a respectful and positive way, respectful of each other’s communities, and wanting the best for the place they represent.
I believe that signifies a healthy development for the future of Northern Ireland politics.
