I thank the Minister for his positive response.
He will be aware of the ecological disaster at Lough Neagh, which supplies 40% of Northern Ireland’s drinking water.
It is partly caused by the run-off of agricultural fertiliser, climate change and the spread of the invasive zebra mussel, but has been exacerbated by sewage dumping.
Can he say a bit more about this issue?
In the past, I have found that his Department and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have not been willing to work with Stormont to address environmental issues in Northern Ireland.
What can he do to address them?
