I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I agree that there is a fantastic opportunity, which we are trying to take, for the UK Government to collaborate with and support the Northern Ireland Executive in transforming public services.
The UK Government have high hopes that Ministers in the Executive will move quickly to deliver on their commitments to set up a transformation board, and we are excited to work with Northern Ireland Ministers to produce plans that will deliver transformation for Northern Ireland.
Indeed, I met the First Minister and Deputy First Minister last week; we talked about this work and how we can further it in the very short term.
