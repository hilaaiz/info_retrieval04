My right hon.
Friend makes an interesting point about what we could do with older equipment.
I have to say to him that right now, I am much more minded to send that equipment to Ukraine.
That is why, yesterday, I pulled together the biggest donation package to date, in what is now the third year of the war, of equipment to Ukraine.
For the time being, I think we will be sending it in an easterly direction.
Can I ask the Secretary of State what he believes a war footing is?
Very simply, Ukraine has taught the world a great deal about this.
When it comes to, for instance, producing sufficient munitions to restock  the Ukrainians’ supply, it is very difficult—in fact, impossible—to do that instantaneously.
When there is global competition for 155s or other missiles, we want to ensure that our own industrial defence estate is able to produce such items by telling those in the industry that they are on a war footing.
By putting in £75 billion more and, critically, naming the date by which we will get there, we will put them on that war footing.
I commend my right hon.
Friend for his stalwart stubbornness in securing this important increase in defence spending.
He and I both know that much more money is needed, but this is a step in the right direction.
He is off shortly to meet NATO members, and I fear that he will have a great deal of work to do.
For example, only two NATO members are prepared to open fire on the Houthis in the strait of Hormuz, one of the major trade routes for NATO and the west.
Does my right hon.
Friend feel that there will be a lot of work for him to do when he goes to meet those NATO members and asks them to step up and spend 2.5% on defence, as they should do and as we are going to do?
