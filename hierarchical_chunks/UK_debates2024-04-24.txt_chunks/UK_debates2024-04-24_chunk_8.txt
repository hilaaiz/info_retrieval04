I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question, and look forward to working with him in his new role.
I can assure him that His Majesty's Government are working apace and will deliver on our Command Paper commitments in full, including our commitments on checks.
He asked about a range of bodies and pledges that we have made.
Just last month we held the inaugural meeting of the East-West Council, which gave Ministers from the United Kingdom Government and the Northern Ireland Executive an opportunity to come together to discuss the main priorities of the council’s work programme.
We are committed to strengthening and safeguarding the Union through our implementation of that programme, and we are committed to safeguarding the UK internal market by establishing new bodies such as InterTrade UK, which will promote and facilitate trade in the United Kingdom.
I will respond to the right hon.
Gentleman’s other points when time allows.
