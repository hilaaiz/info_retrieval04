The commitment that this Government and my right hon.
Friend have shown in pushing for the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive is clearly demonstrated in the £3.3 billion for transforming public services, but what help are the Home Office and civil service providing to their colleagues in Northern Ireland to make sure that people there have the modern and efficient public services that they deserve, and how will that benefit all four nations?
Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.—(Aaron Bell.)7.3 pm Order.
Before we begin today’s sitting, I regret to inform the House of the death of a former Member, Lord Field of Birkenhead.
Frank navigated a career as a formidable MP, notably as the Minister tasked by Tony Blair with “thinking the unthinkable” on welfare reform.
His sharp intellect and independent spirit made him a formidable campaigner against hunger, food poverty and climate change, and for numerous causes related to the Church of England.
In recent years, I have been grateful for his championing of Parliament’s commitment to stamp out modern slavery from our supply chains.
I am in no doubt that his efforts have saved many lives from this shameful criminal activity.
He was one of a kind, and he will be sorely missed.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”]
