On behalf of my colleagues, may I extend our deepest sympathies to the family of Frank Field?
He and I shared four years in the House, and I always found him to be a very warm and engaging colleague—someone who had time for young parliamentarians like me, and who believed very much in this place and our country.
May I also thank the Secretary of State and the Minister of State, Department for Business and Trade,  the hon.
Member for Thirsk and Malton (Kevin Hollinrake) , for the inclusion of Northern Ireland in the Horizon scandal Bill?
That is incredibly important.
As a Unionist, I believe in this country and will work every day to strengthen our place in it.
We recognise the “Safeguarding the Union” Command Paper as an important stepping-stone in maintaining and securing our position.
The Secretary of State mentioned the Government’s commitment to eliminating all routine checks in the UK internal market system, and we look forward to his faithful delivery of that.
However, while we have seen the creation of the East-West Council, we have heard little about the construction of InterTrade UK or the establishment of the independent monitoring panel.
May I ask the Secretary of State to update the House on those issues?
