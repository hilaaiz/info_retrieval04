I thank my hon.
and gallant Friend for his comments.
He is right to point out the need to be prepared to use the abilities that we have.
Ours is one of the only countries with both the global reach and the desire and preparedness to use those abilities, which is why we have ended up defending ships in the Red sea from the Houthis.
I can report that a specific incident along those lines has taken place today, with our armed forces in action, and we can be very proud of everything they do for us.
