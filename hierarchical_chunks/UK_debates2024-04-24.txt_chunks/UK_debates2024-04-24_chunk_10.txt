I thank the Minister for his answer.
We have a massively skilled workforce in Northern Ireland, as everyone here knows, including the Minister.
However, in order to increase investment, we must create more skilled jobs and employ more people in the aerospace sector.
What discussions has the Minister had with Cabinet colleagues about securing more jobs in our aerospace community in Northern Ireland?
We can do more; we just need a bit more help.
