I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I have visited Spirit AeroSystems, as well as other related companies, and there is a terrific pool of talent and skill in Northern Ireland.
We work with the Department for Business and Trade to ensure that the same advantages are available to people and businesses in Northern Ireland as across the rest of the UK.
I sense that brevity requires that I do not elaborate on DBT’s full offer, but it is certainly there.
I will write to him to set out the detail.
If he will hold discussions with the Northern Ireland Executive on the long-term sustainability of Northern Ireland's natural environment.
The UK Government regularly engage with the recently restored Northern Ireland Executive on a range of issues, and we will continue to work together for the benefit of Northern Ireland.
Only yesterday, I met Minister Muir, who is responsible for agriculture, environment and rural affairs, to discuss the implications of the Windsor framework, and to work through how I can help him to succeed across his full spectrum of responsibilities.
