The Secretary of State clearly has a herculean task to find £75 billion, so let us seek clarity on where it may be found.
I welcome the investment if it is in capability.
I agree with the shadow Secretary of State on why it was not in the Budget.
I think we all know why: it does not stand up to scrutiny.
Let me also welcome the Secretary of State’s investment in Ukraine, on the back of the US commitment.
I have to say to our US colleagues that it was long overdue.
Let me ask some specific questions.
It is the duty of Opposition to challenge Government, and we will have our differences.
With no increase in borrowing or debt, the implication is that there will be deeper cuts to other public services.
If the Government have assumed a baseline with spend frozen in cash terms as of GDP, as I think was alluded to by the shadow Defence Secretary, it comes nowhere near £75 billion.
As I come from a services family, I wonder if the Secretary of State will commit to a direct increase in spend on accommodation, training and recruitment as part of this proposal, given that we  are at a near Napoleonic decline on the frontline and have pushed members of the armed forces into food banks and near penury?
