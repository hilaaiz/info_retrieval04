I entirely agree with my hon.
Friend about our leadership in NATO in getting to 2.5%.
I was talking about that to the Secretary-General of NATO yesterday.
We must ensure that 2.5% is the new level at which people operate.
If they did—if everyone joined us at 2.5%—there would be £135 billion per annum more in the collective NATO budget, which would make a huge difference.
Labour is absolutely committed to reaching 2.5%, and we welcome the additional £500 million for Ukraine, but time is of the essence.
What is the Secretary of State doing to speed up the delivery of much-needed military supplies to the frontline in Ukraine?
I warmly welcome the hon.
Lady’s comments, and I hope very much that those on her Front Bench, who have not attached themselves to the timeline that she urges, have listened closely to what she has said.
As for the delivery of items to the frontline, we will be very fast; we will deliver in a matter of days or weeks quite a lot of the items outlined in the very extensive package announced yesterday, although they come in a number of different forms and some, by their physical nature, will take longer to deliver than others.
