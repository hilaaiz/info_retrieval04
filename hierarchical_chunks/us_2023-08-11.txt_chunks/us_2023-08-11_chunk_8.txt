Ms. LOIS FRANKEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor founders Tracey & Amaris Graham, and each of the members of the Ladies.
on the occasion of their 10 year anniversary.
Amaris is a member of my team as a Staff Assistant and Legislative Correspondent.
Amaris and her mother, Tracey Graham, founded the Ladies of Futurity, Inc. nonprofit organization on May 26, 2013, to equip and empower young girls of diverse backgrounds to become ladies, obtain a higher education, and to be servant leaders in their community with essential life and leadership skills to create a pathway to educational success and career development through workshops, sisterly gatherings, and exceptional community service in Palm Beach County, Florida.
With over 312 inducted members since its inception, Ladies of Futurity continues to accomplish its mission of helping girls realize their true potential as they establish and ultimately achieve their future goals.
Their dedication to ensuring each of its members is ``empowered to achieve, educated to succeed, and forever evolving as a lady'' is truly admirable.
Tracey and Amaris Graham strive to provide the tools necessary for each young lady to ``possess a favor, fulfilling, future.''
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending congratulatory wishes to the Ladies of Futurity, Inc. for 10 years of remarkable service.
I am honored to recognize them today and wish them continued success in the years to come.
