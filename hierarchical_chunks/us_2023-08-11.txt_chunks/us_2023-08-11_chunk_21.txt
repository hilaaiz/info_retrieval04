Mr. Speaker, as both Ranking Member and Chair of the House Armed Services' Seapower Projection Forces Subcommittee, I have had a front row seat to view his tenure.
It was not an easy time, contending with an unstable budget environment, historic turnover in the Office of Secretary of the Navy from 2017 until 2020, and a global pandemic.
Through it all, he maintained a steady hand on the helm of our fleet and the marine corps.
Overcoming adversity is I believe the sternest test of leadership, and in my opinion, Admiral Gilday passed that test with flying colors.
The weightiness of his sea legs will be incredibly difficult to replace, but we will welcome the new perspective brought on by the next Chief.
As Admiral Mike Gilday enters this new era of retirement with his wife, Linda, I ask that my colleagues in the House, and particularly those who serve on the House Armed Services Committee, to join me in recognizing his life of service to the Navy and the United States.
