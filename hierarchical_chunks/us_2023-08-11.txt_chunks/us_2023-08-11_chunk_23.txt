Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Eddie Williams for his 17 years of service to the congregation at Lakeridge Ministries Church of God in Christ.
Lakeridge Village Ministries was founded on the principle of uplifting people from all walks of life in spirituality and that the gift of spirituality is not limited to clergy.
Pastor Williams has sought to lead his flock under that guidance, fostering a true sense of community and caring for the most vulnerable.
In addition to his work in ministry, Pastor Williams has sought to expand resources and options for people suffering from the pain of addiction and mental illness.
His work at Lakeridge Village has accomplished so much in fighting the stigma around mental health issues and connecting those struggling with substance abuse to the assistance they need.
In short Pastor Williams has performed outstanding service to the community through his ministry and charitable work.
