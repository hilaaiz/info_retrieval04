Mr. HERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the end of World War II and the 78th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, otherwise known as V-J Day.
The sacrifices of our World War II veterans paid for the end to what was one of the most horrific wars in human history.
On this day in 1945, Japan signed the terms of surrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay.
This day marks the heroic triumph of American forces for the good of the whole world.
Our World War II veterans may be dwindling in number, but their legacy as the greatest generation continues to grow.
We must continue to esteem the truly incredible men and women who showed what a unified America can do to secure hope and liberty in the face of the most formidable adversary.
I am grateful for the work of Frank Reisinger who recalls the celebrating of V-J Day in downtown Tulsa with his father as a young man.
Frank has diligently held a celebration of this important day in Broken Arrow for the last 8 years so that his community understands the cost of war and the price of freedom.
May we never forget that freedom is never free and that we are but 1 generation away from losing what so many have fought and died to secure.
