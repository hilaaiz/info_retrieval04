Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Consulate General of Ukraine in Houston, and all the people of Ukraine, on their Independence Day.
The spirit of Ukraine is an inspiration to all freedom loving peoples in the world.
The rights that we so often take for granted are under constant threat from dictators like Vladimir Putin.
There is no stronger example of what it takes to stand up for liberty in the world today than the struggle fought every day in Ukraine.
I take a special pride in offering this congratulations as Texans and Ukrainians are most assuredly kindred spirits.
In a book he wrote after a 1946 trip to the Soviet Union, the late John Fischer concluded that Ukrainians are ``Texans in Fur Hats.''
It's no surprise that a significant portion of the first wave of Ukrainian immigrants to the United States settled in Texas.
Our histories are intertwined, as is our love of liberty.
Glory to Ukraine (Slava Ukraini).
