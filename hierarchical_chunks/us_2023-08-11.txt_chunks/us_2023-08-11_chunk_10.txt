Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).
Over the last seven decades, the U.S. Small Business Administration has played a vital role in supporting and empowering small businesses.
Providing entrepreneurs important guidance on financial products, the SBA has proven to be an invaluable resource.
Small businesses and their employees drive growth and innovation and play an essential role in the American economy.
In the United States, there are over 33 million small businesses that employ approximately 61.7 million Americans.
In the past 28 years, these businesses have created 17.3 million net new jobs, which accounts for 62.7 percent of jobs created since 1995.
The Lower Rio Grande Valley District of the U.S. Small Business Administration serves 14 counties in south Texas.
In 2020, over 179,000 jobs were supported by approximately 10,000 establishments in the 34th Congressional District alone.
Through their various programs and initiatives, the SBA has provided small businesses access to capital, Federal contracting certifications and opportunities, and disaster recovery.
