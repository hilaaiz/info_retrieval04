represented their fellow classmates with unmatched pride and skill and it is heartening to see this program be rewarded with such an honor.
I also want to pay special recognition to the members who graduated with the Class of 2023.
Since they began high school in 2019, their graduating class has faced a gauntlet of trials and tribulations that many of their contemporaries or even most adults have not.
After the tragic shooting in November of 2019, they were immediately confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and virtual learning which forced them to press on with rehearsals over Zoom.
These challenges were of course coupled with the typical obstacles a teenager faces when navigating high school: homework, crushes, college applications, and anxiety about the future.
As their representative in the halls of Congress, I could not be prouder of their resilience in the face of the impossible, and the manner in which they relied on each other to overcome the odds.
Once again, I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to the Marching Centurions for this great honor that they had to commemorate our Nation's heroes who have been killed in the defense of freedom for Memorial Day.
As a Saugus alumnus myself, my heart swelled with pride seeing these students clad in blue and silver marching along the streets of Washington to honor our great country.
