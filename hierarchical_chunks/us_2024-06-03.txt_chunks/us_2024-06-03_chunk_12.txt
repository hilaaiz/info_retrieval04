Ms. Trotter completed basic training at Camp Pendleton, California and she remained there to faithfully execute her duties driving a jeep for a Major she was assigned to.
The only problem was that she didn't know how to drive.
Ms. Trotter and the other 18,000 women that joined the Marine Corps Women's Reserve didn't make excuses, they learned, and did their jobs with honor.
Our Nation stands on the strong shoulders of courageous, determined, and resourceful women like 
Ms. Trotter who answered the call to serve our Nation in one of our greatest hours of need.
Happy birthday to Miss Minnie.
She has done Franklin, and this entire Nation proud.
