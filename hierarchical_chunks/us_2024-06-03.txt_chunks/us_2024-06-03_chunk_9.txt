Mr. Ding's courageous efforts to defend the lights of marginalized communities and promote greater government accountability made him a target of the regime's ruthless crackdown on dissent.
His arbitrary detention, which included solitary confinement and physical abuse, serves as a stark reminder of the grave risks faced by those who dare to challenge the authoritarian rule of the CCP.
Together with the Congressional Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission's Defending Freedoms Project, I am committed to advocating for his release and reunion with his family.
As we remember the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre and honor their memory, we must reaffirm our commitment to the values of democracy, human rights, and freedom.
We stand in solidarity with the people of China, Hong Kong, and all those around the world who continue to courageously resist oppression and dream of a better future.
Let us continue to pursue a world where freedoms are protected, and people like 
Mr. Ding Jiaxi, are not wrongfully imprisoned and silenced, but instead honored for their work to improve society.
The image of a single protestor who stood in the way of a column of tanks rolling through the streets of Beijing in June 1989 will continue to inspire those who will bravely face brute force for the sake of freedom.
In confronting tyranny and injustice, we draw inspiration from the courage and resilience of those who have dared to challenge authoritarian rule.
Their struggle is our struggle, and their cause is our cause.
