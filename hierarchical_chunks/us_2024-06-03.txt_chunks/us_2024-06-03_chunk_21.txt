Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Mr. Robert (Bob) M. Iamello whose dedication to the Amerigo Vespucci Society and his Italian heritage will be recognized by the organization with its ``Man of the Year'' award on June 8, 2024.
Robert Iamello maintains his Italian heritage through his family and his involvement with the Amergio Vespucci Society (AVS).
Raised in West Long Branch, New Jersey, 
Mr. Iamello grew up in a household that embraced its Calabrian lineage.
His parents and grandparents often conversed with each other in Italian, introducing 
Mr. Iamello to the language.
In college, he studied abroad in Venice, and has visited Italy many times since.
Together with Diane, his wife of nearly 45 years, he has two children and three grandchildren.
He takes great pride in his family and heritage, sharing his experiences with other members of the AVS.
