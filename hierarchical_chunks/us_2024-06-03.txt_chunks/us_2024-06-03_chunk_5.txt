Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Somerset County 4-H on the 50th anniversary of the Ted Blum 4-H Center.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with you all.
Named after Ted Blum, one of the most important and beloved figures in New Jersey's 4-H community, Somerset County's 4-H Center was touted as the largest building of its kind in the nation when it opened in 1974.
The Ted Blum 4-H Center has served as a model for 4-H facilities nationwide, providing meeting spaces for clubs and events as well as office space for the dedicated staff and volunteers who continue to ensure that ``4-H Is Tops''.
I wish all the best to Somerset County 4-H on the 50th anniversary of the landmark Ted Blum 4-H Center, and I extend my thanks for all that they do for our community.
