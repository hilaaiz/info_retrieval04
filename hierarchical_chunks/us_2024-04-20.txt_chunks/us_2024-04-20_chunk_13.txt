Mr. JAMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of Michigan debate team for winning the 2024 National Debate Tournament, the first in their history.
As an alumni of the University of Michigan, I am incredibly proud of your accomplishment!
On April 8, 2024, the 78th annual National Debate Tournament took place and in a unanimous decision, the University of Michigan's debate team made headlines by bringing home the National Championship.
This achievement is the culmination of hours and hours of hard work and preparation and is truly commendable.
In the elimination rounds, Michigan bested many other qualified teams before defeating Kansas in the championship round.
U-M is proving once again that our great state of Michigan is yielding the next generation As a Michigan alum, I'd like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the entire U-M Debate Team, Coach Aaron Kall, and the University of Michigan.
Go Blue.
