Mr. JAMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my dear good friend, Frank Jonna, as he is honored as the Chaldean American Chamber of Commerce's 2024 Businessperson of the Year.
Frank's entrepreneurial instincts can be traced back to working with his older brother, Jimmy, after he founded Jonna Construction in 1965.
Early on, Jimmy's leadership taught Frank the meaning of hard work, patience, and perseverance firsthand, propelling him to later become CEO.
With over 40 years of dedication to the Metro Detroit area, Frank has served on the numerous Boards including Henry Ford Health, Catholic Central High School, Angel's Place, and Detroit Public Television.
Alongside these accomplishments, his legacy will forever live on in the community Jonna Construction has contributed to and built, including Michigan National Bank Building, the Henry Ford Detroit Pistons Performance Training Center, Mother of God Church, St. Thomas Church, Shenandoah Country Club, and the Chaldean Community Foundation Headquarters.
Frank is the embodiment of the American Dream.
In every step of his career, he has showcased a neverending commitment to the Southeast Michigan community, so on behalf of all of Michigan's 10th Congressional District, congratulations to Frank Jonna.
