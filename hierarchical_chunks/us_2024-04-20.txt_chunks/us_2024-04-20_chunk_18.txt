Through the Community Engagement Division, he worked to make sure that the Chula Vista Police Department was actively connecting with community members including residents, students, and business owners.
Assistant Police Chief Collum was also deeply involved in charity work.
He volunteered at his church.
He went to Tijuana every month to support orphanages and help children in need as part of the Corazon de Vida Foundation--his empathy and compassion for others on full display.
And, Assistant Police Chief Collum was a true trailblazer.
He was the Chula Vista Police Department's first Black lieutenant, first Black captain, and first Black assistant chief.
He was also the first openly gay male officer in the department.
In his own words, during an interview in 2022, Assistant Police Chief Collum said that he was proud to be a member of the LGBTQ community.
He was proud to be a law enforcement officer.
He was proud of his husband.
He was proud of his community.
And that he wanted to celebrate that.
I can't think of a better way to sum up his incredible contributions to our community.
He broke down barriers and was a role model for so many.
Assistant Police Chief Collum is survived by his loving husband, William Lopez, and my heart is with his family, his friends, his colleagues, and our entire community as we mourn this immense loss.
We will always remember Assistant Police Chief Collum.
