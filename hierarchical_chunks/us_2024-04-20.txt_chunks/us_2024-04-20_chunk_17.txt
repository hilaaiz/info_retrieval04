Ms. JACOBS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chula Vista Assistant Police Chief Phil Collum, a 29-year veteran of the department who we sadly lost to cancer.
His service and his legacy will always be remembered.
Those who knew Assistant Police Chief Collum best emphasize his empathy, his compassion, his reputation for being fair, his work ethic, and more than anything, his dedication to his community.
Community was at the heart of everything Assistant Police Chief Collum did.
He gave the directive in 2022 to create the Community Engagement Division to help foster community relationships--and he personally led this division.
He was committed to building bridges between officers and the community they serve.
