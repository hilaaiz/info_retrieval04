The Liberal Democrats have been calling for an overhaul of the parental leave system, to give parents a genuine choice about how they manage their responsibilities in the first months of their child’s life.
If I could gently correct the shadow Minister,  the hon.
Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith) , it was the Liberal Democrats who were proud to introduce shared parental leave in government.
However, years later, millions of parents are still being denied the choice to spend more time at home, with around a quarter of fathers ineligible for paternity pay.
As we welcome this review into parental leave, I urge the Government to look more broadly into the prevalent inequality in caring responsibilities.
What steps are they taking to support the millions of family carers who are looking after disabled or elderly relatives and who have no paid leave at all?
Will they commit to a similar review into provision for unpaid carers and to make carer’s leave paid?
Will they commit to reviewing the needs of carers and those of the families who have taken on kinship caring responsibilities?
I welcome that commitment in the statement today, but do the Government plan to introduce statutory kinship care leave?
We call on the Government to use the review to finally deliver meaningful reforms that address the long-standing concerns of carers and their loved ones, as well as making changes to the circumstances of working families that can make parenting a joy rather than a burden, and end the dilemma of having to choose between work and family.
