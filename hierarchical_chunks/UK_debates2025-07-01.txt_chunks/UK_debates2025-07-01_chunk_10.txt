It is becoming clear that one year in, the public still do not know what Labour is all about, and the same could be said for its so-called National Wealth Fund.
Not only has the National Wealth Fund invested less equity in clean energy than before its costly £7 billion rebrand, but it is also now rightly subject to a Treasury Committee inquiry, at which expert witnesses could not name a single thing it is doing differently.
The CEO of the British Business Bank now says the Government did not understand what they were setting up.
Can the Minister tell us why the National Wealth Fund has invested less in clean energy than before the costly rebrand and why the Government U-turned on incorporating the British Business Bank?
The shadow Minister forgets to mention the fact that we have had £30 billion of investment in green energy since the general election.
I am sure he has consulted the spending review documents closely—I know he is a diligent shadow Minister in that regard—and he will have seen the investment that we are putting into Great British Energy, Sizewell C, small modular reactors, fusion, nuclear R&D, the warm homes plan, and carbon capture and storage.
All of this is to make sure we improve our energy security and bring down bills for good.
Whether she plans to provide additional Barnett consequential funding to the Northern Ireland Executive for the winter fuel payment.
I can reassure the hon.
Member that there will be an increase in the Northern Ireland Executive’s funding through the annually managed expenditure forecasting process.
This will be confirmed at the autumn Budget in the usual way.
More importantly to pensioners in Northern Ireland, he will be aware that in June, the Communities Minister in Northern Ireland confirmed that winter fuel payments will be available in Northern Ireland on the same basis as in England and Wales.
