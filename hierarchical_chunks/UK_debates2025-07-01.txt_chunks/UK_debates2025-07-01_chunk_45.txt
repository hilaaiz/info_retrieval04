I welcome the Liberal Democrats’ support for this review.
The hon.
Lady is right to point out that it was the coalition Government who introduced shared parental leave, although that is the first time in a long time that we have heard anyone admit that they were part of the coalition Government.
She raised some very important points, a number of which will be covered by the carer’s leave review, which is also taking place.
Kinship caring will be a part of that.
I know that the Liberal Democrats have a long-standing policy on carer’s leave and pay, and the review will be cognisant of that.
