I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question; he has engaged with me about the loan charge previously.
As he knows, there is an independent review of the loan charge at the moment, and I think it is important that I as a Minister do not comment on that.
Let the independent reviewer complete his work and report back to us as a Government.
