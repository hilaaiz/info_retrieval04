From responses to my written parliamentary questions, we know that the median earner can expect to pay £273 more in tax this year under Labour.
When the Chancellor sat on the Opposition Benches, she described freezing tax thresholds as “picking the pockets” of working people.
Does the Chancellor accept that she is now the one picking the pockets of working people?
In the Budget last year, we increased taxes by £40 billion, but without affecting the pay packets of ordinary working people.
We did not increase their national insurance, their income tax or their VAT, and we did not go ahead with the wrong-headed increase in fuel duty that was put in place by the Conservative party.
We are protecting working people; the Conservative party picked their pockets time and again.
Ports are engines for economic growth in sectors such as energy and critical minerals.
Falmouth port, in the constituency neighbouring mine, is surrounded by massive tin and lithium deposits, and it has ambitious plans to play its part.
In line with our manifesto commitment for a £1.5 billion ports fund, will the Chancellor outline what mechanisms the National Wealth Fund and GB Energy can deploy to invest in ports?
