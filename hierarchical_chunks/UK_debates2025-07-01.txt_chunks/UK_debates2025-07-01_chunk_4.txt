First, it was a humiliating reversal of the Chancellor’s winter fuel cuts.
Now, welfare cuts that she rushed to meet her fiscal rules have been shredded, leaving unfunded spending to pay for.
In October, the Chancellor said that extending the freeze in income tax thresholds “would hurt working people.
It would take more money out  of their payslips”—[Official Report,  30 October 2024 ; Vol. 755, c. 821.]
Does she stand by the commitment to end that freeze from 2028—yes or no?
It was the hon.
Member’s Government, when they were on this side of the House, who froze those allowances, taking more money out of the pockets of working people.
Despite that, they left a £22 billion black hole in the public finances.
I will take no lessons from Conservative party, which has opposed everything that is needed to invest in our public services.
We are in the mess we are in because of the damage that it caused.
What assessment she has made of the potential impact of planned increases in funding for transport infrastructure on economic growth.
What assessment she has made of the potential impact of planned increases in funding for transport infrastructure on economic growth.
The Government recognise the critical contribution that transport makes to our growth mission.
The Government increased the capital envelope by over £100 billion at the autumn Budget last year, and by a further £13 billion at the spring statement.
Taken together, that represents a big increase in capital investment.
As a result, the transport capital budget, excluding High Speed 2, will increase by 1.9% per year in real terms over the spending review period.
That investment will improve connectivity in our towns, cities and villages, reduce journey times and increase transport reliability.
For areas of transport that are devolved, it is up to the Scottish and Welsh Governments to allocate their funding and be accountable to their respective Parliaments for those decisions.
