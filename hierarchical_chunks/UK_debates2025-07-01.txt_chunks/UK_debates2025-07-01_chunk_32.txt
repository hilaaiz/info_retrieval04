I thank my hon.
Friend very much for her question.
I can reassure her that, alongside the loan charge review, the Government have published a consultation on a comprehensive package of measures to close in on the promoters of marketed tax avoidance schemes.
As we know, these contrived schemes both deprive public services of funding and leave their clients with unexpected tax bills.
