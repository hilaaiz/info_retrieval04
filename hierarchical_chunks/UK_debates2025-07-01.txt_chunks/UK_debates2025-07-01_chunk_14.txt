I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and I extend the thoughts of the House to his constituents and the communities that he represents.
He will know that I have always kept the service and sacrifices of the mining communities in my mind, both in opposition when campaigning for changes to the mineworkers’ pension scheme, which this Government implemented at the last Budget, and now in considering proposals from the BCSSS.
I will be looking at those issues in more detail over the summer, and I hope to say more in the autumn.
