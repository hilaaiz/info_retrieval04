The Minister will no doubt be aware of reports of the so-called exodus of millionaires.
Those reports are from “high profile individuals” and city spokespeople, but there are rarely hard numbers behind them.
Are Treasury Ministers able to verify the Tax Justice Network’s research that says that just 0.3% of millionaires have exited the UK and that that number has remained low and stable over the past decade, and will they publish their own figures as well?
When considering fiscal measures or financial changes, the figures that matter are those provided by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
The OBR has certified that the non-dom reforms that the Government have implemented will raise £33.8 billion in total revenue, and that figure accounts for some non-doms who are ineligible for the new regime choosing to leave the UK.
Public investment makes us all more prosperous, but clearly that public investment, in our roads, rail and energy infrastructure, needs to be paid for.
Will the Minister set out how we are funding that public investment by taxing the very richest people in this country?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely correct that our changes to the non-dom reporting regime are essential to raise billions of pounds to support the public finances and get our public services back on their feet.
I contrast that with some of the proposals set out by opposition parties.
Indeed, Reform UK’s plans are for a tax cut for foreign billionaires.
