I thank the Minister for advance sight of the statement.
The Liberal Democrats welcome the Government’s commitment to the much-needed review on parental leave.
Every child deserves the best possible start in life and the opportunity to flourish, no matter their background or personal circumstances.
Too often, parents struggle on inadequate parental pay and without good enough access to shared leave.
Childcare costs are eye-watering, and the balance between family life and work has only become harder to strike.
