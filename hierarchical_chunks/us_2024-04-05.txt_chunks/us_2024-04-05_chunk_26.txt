Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in expressing our deepest gratitude and best wishes to President Dr. Marion Ross Fedrick for her dedicated service to Albany State University.
May God continue to bless her and her family as she enters a new chapter in her remarkable life.
