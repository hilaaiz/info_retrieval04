Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Hot Springs World Class High School Education Accelerated by Service and Technology (EAST) team on winning the 2024 Founder's Award at the 2024 EAST Conference.
This award is given to students who demonstrate a commitment to EAST's core values of authenticity, innovation, collaboration, dedication, and service.
Mr. Speaker, it is evident that these students exemplify all of these and more.
The team's accomplishment stems from an interactive map they created for the solar eclipse passing through the state of Arkansas on April 8, 2024.
The map allows individuals to see all viewing options for this once-in-alifetime event happening across the country.
I am proud of the students for collaborating with the local community, working as a team, and accomplishing their goals.
I'm proud to recognize the students on this team and their EAST facilitator, 
Ms. Breanna Burris, for all their hard work on this extraordinary project.
They have not only achieved a prestigious national award, but they have simultaneously improved the lives of their peers in Hot Springs.
