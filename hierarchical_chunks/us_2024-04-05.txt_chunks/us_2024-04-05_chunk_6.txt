Mr. Speaker, we at the University of Maryland, College Park, could never have known just how lucky we were to have Dr. Wylie join our community more than a half century ago.
She has propelled the university and its students to greater heights and leave an indelible mark on campus.
I ask that all my colleagues join me in wishing my fellow Terp well as she marks this terrific milestone.
May they also join me in thanking her for her many years of service and leadership.
