Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Alzheimer's Association on their 5th Annual Gala and thank them for their work to increase awareness and understanding of this disease and other related dementias.
I'm grateful for how they empower North Texans with knowledge and strategies to cope with the complexities of Alzheimer's disease.
The Dallas and Northeast Texas chapter of the Alzheimer's Association advocates for those in our community impacted by Alzheimer's disease, while pushing forward vital research endeavors focused on treatment, prevention, and finding a cure.
Leading the way in Alzheimer's research, the association is a critical piece of expediting global advancements towards ultimately ending the heartbreaking effects of this disease on individuals and families.
As they celebrate their 5th anniversary, I sincerely thank the Dallas and Northeast Chapter for their tireless work in our community.
