Mr. Nicholas graduated from the State University of New York Maritime College and served in the United States Naval Reserve from 1999 to 2010.
His contributions during Operation Iraqi Freedom aboard the USNS Algol earned him well-deserved recognition.
Furthermore, he served with distinction on the USNS Mendonca and Pililaau from 2006 to 2008 and as Captain on the USNS Brittin from 2008 to 2010.
Beyond his service in the Naval Reserve, 
Mr. Nicholas continued to serve his country as a professor of Nautical Sciences and Simulation at the United States Merchant Marine Academy until his untimely passing on November 19, 2023.
His dedication and commitment to his Nation exemplify true heroism.
My heartfelt condolences and profound appreciation for his service extend to his beloved wife, Heather, and his entire family.
May the United States and the State of New York forever cherish patriots like Scott Nicholas.
May his legacy endure, and may he find eternal peace.
