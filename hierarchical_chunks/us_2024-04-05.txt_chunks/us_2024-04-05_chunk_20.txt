Mr. Azaiza has focused his life's work on capturing the daily life of Palestinians in Gaza.
Since the war began, he has bravely used his platform to document the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the lives of the innocent people who have been killed.
Mr. Azaiza's images on the ground have exposed the war crimes being committed by the Israeli government for the world to see.
We applaud his efforts and bravery for risking his life to report on these atrocities.
Please join me in recognizing the numerous contributions of Motaz Azaiza in the field of journalism
