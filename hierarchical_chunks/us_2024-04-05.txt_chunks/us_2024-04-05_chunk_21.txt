Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rabbi Bennett Miller as he celebrates his 50th year in the Rabbinate.
It is my honor to join with the members of Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple and the greater community in celebrating this milestone.
Upon becoming a rabbi in 1974, Rabbi Miller served under Rabbi Harvey Fields at Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple.
In 1977 he became Senior Rabbi at Anshe Emeth, where he continued to serve until his retirement in 2018.
Following his retirement, Rabbi Miller became Rabbi Emeritus of Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple; he also served for one year as the Interim Senior Rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in Westfield.
He also served as National Chair of the Association of Reform Zionists of America (ARZA) and currently serves as Chair of the URJ/ARZA Herzl Society.
As Rabbi Emeritus, Rabbi Miller provides pastoral guidance and leadership to the congregation and continues to support Anshe Emeth Memorial Temple's mission of religious education, spiritual growth, and social action.
Rabbi Miller attended Hebrew Union College--Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati and earned his Doctor of Ministry degree from Princeton Theological Seminary.
In 2024, he received the Builders of Zion Award and in 2023 he was the recipient of Matan's Trail Blazer's Award.
Despite his retirement, Rabbi Bennett Miller has continued to provide outstanding rabbinical leadership and contributions to the community.
I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Rabbi Miller on his 50th year in the Rabbinate and thanking him for his ongoing service.
