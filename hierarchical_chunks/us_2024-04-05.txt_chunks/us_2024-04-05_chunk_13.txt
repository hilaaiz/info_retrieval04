Mr. LaLOTA.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the memory of the late Scott Nicholas, a remarkable individual from Smithtown, New York.
Scott Nicholas was not only a Captain in the United States Naval Reserve but also a dedicated professor at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY.
