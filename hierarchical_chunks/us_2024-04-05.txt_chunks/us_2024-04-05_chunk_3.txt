Mr. GROTHMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the remarkable leadership and service of Van Mobley, President of the Village of Thiensville, whose unwavering dedication has significantly enriched the lives of his constituents and propelled the progress of his community over the last twelve years..
Throughout his dedicated career, Van Mobley has demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to public service and community development.
His journey began in 2006 when he was appointed to the Village Board as a Trustee, filling a vacant seat, and subsequently earning the trust of his constituents through two additional three-year terms.
In 2012, he was elected Village President, a position he has since held for four consecutive three-year terms.
Under President Mobley's stewardship, Thiensville has experienced remarkable growth and advancement.
His visionary leadership has spurred significant infrastructure improvements and development projects throughout the village.
Notably, he spearheaded the development on South Main Street, overseeing crucial water infrastructure installations and the establishment of key properties, including the Thiensville Health Alliance, Reuter Insurance, and a new Village parking lot.
His pivotal role in the Pigeon Creek flood control project has been instrumental in safeguarding Main Street from flooding during major rain events.
President Mobley's commitment to collaboration and intergovernmental cooperation has been exemplified by his efforts to merge fire and EMS services with the City of Mequon, resulting in the formation of the Southern Ozaukee Fire and EMS Department.
This innovative partnership has garnered recognition from the Wisconsin Policy Forum for its effectiveness and efficiency.
Beyond infrastructure, President Mobley has overseen numerous enhancements in Village Park, including the construction of the Port Washington State Bank River Stage, new Comfort Station, playground upgrades, and boat launch improvements.
Van Mobley's dedication to preserving Thiensville's rich history and heritage is evident in his personal investment in the historic Thiensville State Bank building on Green Bay Road, which he purchased and meticulously renovated.
In recognition of his exceptional service and tireless efforts on behalf of the residents of Thiensville, I extend my heartfelt gratitude and congratulations to Van Mobley.
His accomplishments have had a profound and lasting impact on the community, and I wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.
