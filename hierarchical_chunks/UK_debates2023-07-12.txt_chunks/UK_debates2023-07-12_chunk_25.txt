I thank the hon.
Member for giving me notice of her point of order.
As I said last week, the responsibility lies with the Minister to make any necessary correction to the record.
It is on the Government to look at themselves.
If the ministerial code is not being adhered to, I really think that the rules need to be looked at again so that Ministers—do not forget that elections change Ministers as well—ensure that this House hears the facts.
I will leave it at that.
