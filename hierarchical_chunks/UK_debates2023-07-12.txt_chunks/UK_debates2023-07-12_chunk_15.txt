Under the Conservatives, just 12% of executive directors of FTSE 250 companies are women—a gap that will not close until 2058 at the current rate.
Women who want to go into business cannot wait for the Conservatives to get their act together.
They need a new deal for working people, a review of the gender pay gap, and a menopause action plan in the workplace.
That is Labour’s pro-business, pro-women plan to smash the glass ceiling and break down the barriers.
Does the Minister have a plan?
I am afraid that the shadow Front-Bench spokeswoman is confusing all sorts of different things.
FTSE directors are not the ones who need support getting into the workplace.
She is talking about a menopause action plan, but we have had one, completed and delivered it, while Labour Members are just talking about bringing one in, which shows that they are not paying attention.
We are the only ones who will be doing what is right to promote gender equality in the workplace.
If she will hold discussions with Cabinet colleagues on the potential merits of including policy relating to men on the list of Government Equalities Office responsibilities.
The Government are already taking action to improve outcomes for men and boys.
For example, through the introduction of shared parental leave, men now have more opportunity to take time away from the workplace to care for their children.
We continue to work closely across Government to embed equalities policies for both men and women.
