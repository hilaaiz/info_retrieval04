The Minister for Women and Equalities was asked— When she plans to bring forward legislative proposals to ban conversion practices.
The Government remain committed to publishing a draft Bill on banning conversion practices for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses in this parliamentary Session.
It is now over five years since the Government first made a commitment to legislate on conversion therapy, and more recently there was a promise that legislation would be tabled this spring.
Can the Minister elaborate on some of the reasons for the delay, and perhaps be more clear about when the legislation will be brought forward?
I can assure the hon.
Gentleman that we are absolutely committed to introducing the Bill in its draft stage as soon as possible.
It is a complex matter.
It is something that I have felt very passionately about over many years, but it is right that we get the legislation right.
I hope that we will be able to present it as soon as possible.
