I thank the Minister for her answer.
We have brilliant successful female entrepreneurs across Anglesey, including Laurel Knight at Medic 1, Lynne Farr at the Beaumaris Artisan Market, Helen Evans at the Amlwch Artisan Studio, and Jo Weir at Beau’s Tea Rooms.
We also have some fabulous successful male entrepreneurs such as Celfyn and Emrys Furlong.
They are supported by organisations such as Alison Cork’s Make It Your Business, the British Library’s Business and IP Centre, the Federation of Small Businesses Wales, and Small Business Saturday UK.
How are this Government supporting those organisations to broaden their reach and empower even more fabulous female entrepreneurs?
