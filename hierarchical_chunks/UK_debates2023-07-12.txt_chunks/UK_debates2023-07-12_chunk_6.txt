Given that the Minister has agreed that conversion therapy is abhorrent, and given what my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Down (Stephen Farry)  said about five years having passed since we were first told that it would be banned—we were then told that the Bill had been scrapped, then that it would be coming back, and then that it would come back with a loophole about consent—does the Minister  agree that that confusion is causing unacceptable stress, confusion and fear among the LGBT community?
Will the Government commit to ending the confusion soon?
I do not want anybody in the LGBT community to feel fear—I have had that experience myself
and I would not wish it on anyone.
That is why we are making sure that the Bill is a good Bill that delivers good law to ensure that we outlaw those abhorrent practices.
I recognise that the delay has caused some issues for the community, but I assure them that we are on their side.
Through my personal dealings with the Minister, I know how much he is committed to making sure that this legislation comes forward.
Can he reassure me that, despite what some have said, the Bill is not about stopping parents from having meaningful conversations with their children who may be questioning their sexuality?
My hon.
Friend raises an important point.
That is why we need to consider the evidence carefully; those conversations that parents have with their children are really important.
I will never forget the conversations I had with my mum and dad, who helped me when I was coming out.
