I congratulate the Prime Minister on bringing European leaders together at the weekend and on setting the record straight with  J. D. Vance on the issue of free speech.
President Zelensky is resilient and brave, just like the nation that he represents.
In the second week of the war, when I went to Ukraine with my medical team, we could see at first hand that there is absolutely nothing that the Russians will not do.
Will the Prime Minister promise that our support will not waver, and that he will continue working closely with our European allies to make sure that we bring about peace in Ukraine?
I can give my hon.
Friend that assurance.
We will not waver.
We will work with our allies.
