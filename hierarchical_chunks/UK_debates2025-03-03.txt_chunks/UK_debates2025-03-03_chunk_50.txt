I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his questions.
He talked about the scene on Friday afternoon—nobody wants to see that.
My response was to recognise the urgency of the need to repair the breach, which is why I spoke to President Trump and President Zelensky on Friday night, and again on Saturday night.
I am continuing in that work, because for me, the single most important thing is lasting peace in Europe and Ukraine.
Nothing is going to deter me from that or cause me to lose my focus on it.
