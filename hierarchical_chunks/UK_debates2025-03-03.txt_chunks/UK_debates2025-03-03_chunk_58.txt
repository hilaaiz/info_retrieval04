Our enemies should know that our Prime Minister has 100% support from us.
I noticed in Moscow that they are referring to the small size of the British Army.
Perhaps the Prime Minister could remind them of what the Kaiser said in 1914 about “the contemptible little British Army”.
Will the Prime Minister tell President Putin and other tyrants that our Army, the most professional in the world, is quite capable of giving as good as it gets?
To continue the historical allusion, as in 1939, if we do stand up to the mark with the French, it is best to have a security guarantee from the Americans.
