On the dependency on the US, I do not agree with the right hon.
Gentleman.
The US and the UK have the closest of relationships; our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.
No two countries are as close as our two countries, and at a time like this, it would be a huge mistake to suggest that any weakening of that link is the way forward for security and defence in Europe.
On the question of a rearmament bank, yes, I do think we should continue discussions with others as to what the possibilities could be.
That formed some of the discussion yesterday with our allies.
On assets, again, the right hon.
Gentleman knows that the situation is complicated, but there are ongoing discussions.
I spoke at length with the Canadian Prime Minister yesterday, because we had a bilateral meeting as well as the meeting with other colleagues.
In that meeting, I was able to assure him of our strong support for Canada, which is a close ally of ours and a strong supporter of Ukraine.
Canada has led the way on the training that has been so vital to Ukraine, so it was very welcome at the table yesterday.
In relation to the ambassador’s comments, the plan is clear.
We are working, particularly with the French— I had extensive conversations with President Macron over the past week and intensively over the weekend—and talking to Ukraine as well.
Those conversations are going on at the moment, and the intention is to then have discussions with the United States in relation to that plan.
As soon as the details are available, I will share them with the House, but they are still being worked on at the moment.
There is no guarantee of success, but I am not going to let up until we have done everything we can to ensure peace in Europe and peace for Ukraine.
