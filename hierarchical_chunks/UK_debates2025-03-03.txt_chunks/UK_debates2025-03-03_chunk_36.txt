I thank the Prime Minister for advance sight of his statement, and for our conversation earlier today.
The United Kingdom is a free, democratic and sovereign country.
We recognise that Ukraine is fighting for her survival and fighting to have the same freedom, democracy and sovereignty that all of us here enjoy.
That is why both the Opposition and the Government are fully committed to supporting Ukraine and President Zelensky.
I was also glad to see His Majesty the King welcome President Zelensky at Sandringham.
As I said at the weekend, President Zelensky is a hero.
He is a symbol of the bravery of the Ukrainian people.
