I thank my hon.
Friend for the work that he is doing to champion pubs in his constituency.
Like all of us, he recognises just how important they are to the economy, and probably even more so to local communities.
The Government can do a lot on business rates and on things like the community right to buy, which gives the community the right to step in when pubs might face closure, as part of the package.
