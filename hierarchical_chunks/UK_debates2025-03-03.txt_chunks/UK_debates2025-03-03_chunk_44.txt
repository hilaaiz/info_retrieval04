I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question.
It is a very important issue.
What I did last week was to announce the biggest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war, and the circumstances and the context require it.
That decision had to be made, and I was determined that it would be fully funded so the House could see where the money would come from.
