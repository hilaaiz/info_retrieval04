I agree on both propositions.
Ukraine needs to be at the table.
There have to be security guarantees, because we know from history that Putin does not honour agreements that do not have security guarantees.
That is precisely why we need one.
I echo the thanks to the Prime Minister for his leadership over recent days.
He has definitely spoken for Britain when he has spoken on the world stage.
May I ask him to join me in thanking the parliamentary staffers who, while he was doing that, were driving aid to Ukraine?
Quite rightly, the Prime Minister has brought together a coalition of European and NATO partners.
Is he working on those further afield?
As he knows very well,  Australia has already donated Bushmasters, and many are concerned about Iran’s support for the Russians through its Shahed drone programme.
Is he reaching out to our middle eastern allies as well?
