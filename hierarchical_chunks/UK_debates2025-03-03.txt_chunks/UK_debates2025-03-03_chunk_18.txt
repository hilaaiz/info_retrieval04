The Government are committed to delivering the biggest increase in social and affordable house building in a generation.
In our first eight months in office, we have announced £800 million in new funding for the affordable homes programme.
This top-up will support the delivery of up to 7,800 new homes, with more than half being social rent homes.
We will set out details of new investment to succeed the 2021-to-2026 programme at the spending review.
