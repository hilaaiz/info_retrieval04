I welcome the use of the proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine.
Does the Prime Minister have plans to go further and use the frozen assets themselves?
Will he provide an update on the Government’s sanctions on Russian-linked individuals and confirmation that such sanctions would not be lifted in the event of a ceasefire?
Will he update us on the steps that he and other allies are taking to ensure that Ukraine is at the negotiating table for any peace plan?
What does he think can be done to heal the rift with Washington?
