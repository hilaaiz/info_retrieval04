I thank my hon.
Friend for raising these important points.
I totally agree with him that improved connectivity is essential for places to thrive, and that is a point that Mayor Tracy Brabin makes to me frequently.
I can happily say that the case for West Yorkshire is heard loud and clear.
I would of course be happy to hold such a meeting.
