I thank the Leader of the Opposition for her message and for our discussion this morning, and I thank her for her support for the measures that we are taking.
It matters across this House that we are united on this issue, It matters to the Ukrainians and to President Zelensky.
I can tell the right hon.
Lady that he was moved by the reception that he got in our country on Saturday, and I felt very proud to be British on Saturday when our country spoke with one voice.
The right hon.
Lady reflects that through the unity that has been shown from Members from across the House, and I thank for that.
