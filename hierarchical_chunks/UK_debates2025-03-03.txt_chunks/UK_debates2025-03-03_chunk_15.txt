I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Raising standards in the private rented sector could lift up to 550,000 people out of fuel poverty.
There are a number of schemes to support landlords to improve their properties, and they can look at their eligibility through gov.uk.
In particular, there are schemes such as the boiler upgrade scheme, which offers £7,500 off the cost of heat pumps.
We look forward to working in partnership with the sector, because we recognise that it is an important sector.
