I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for the unity across the House, and he is absolutely right.
It sends a message to those who want to challenge our values when they see this House united, whether on Ukraine or defence spending.
We have to face this era with confidence and with unity across this House, wherever we can.
It has been good to have him agreeing with me—we should do this more often.
