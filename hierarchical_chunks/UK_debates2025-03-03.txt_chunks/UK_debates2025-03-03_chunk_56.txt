First, I thank the Prime Minister for the leadership he has shown in pulling together all our allies yesterday in London and for acknowledging the bravery and sacrifice of the people of Ukraine.
I was in Ukraine last week.
I met the mayor of Kharkiv, a frontline city of 2 million people undergoing daily attacks and blackouts from Russian forces.
He told me that a power project funded by the United States Agency for International Development had been cancelled at short notice.
It would have generated 11.2 MW, shoring up their energy pipeline.
Where others   have stepped back, will we step forward and support such projects, using either Russian assets or our own aid budget?
Power supply is hugely important in Ukraine.
Let us face it: power and energy have been weaponised by Putin; that is why he is attacking the power supplies to communities across Ukraine.
We will work with Ukraine to ensure that its people have the security and power supplies they need as we go forward.
