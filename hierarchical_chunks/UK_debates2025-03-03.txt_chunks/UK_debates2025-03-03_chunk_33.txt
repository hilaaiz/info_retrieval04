I welcome the opportunity for a new economic deal with the US, confirmed by the President last week, because it is an opportunity that I am determined to pursue.
I welcome the positive discussions that we had on European security, including his clear support for article 5 of NATO.
I welcome the understanding, from our dialogue, that our two nations will work together on security arrangements for a lasting peace in Ukraine.
I also welcome the President’s continued commitment to that peace, which nobody in this House should doubt for a second is sincere.
