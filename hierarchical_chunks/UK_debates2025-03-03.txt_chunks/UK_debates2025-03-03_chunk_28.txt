Help to Buy helped 350,000 young first-time buyers and the stamp duty discount helped 640,000 first-time buyers get on the housing ladder with discounts of up to £11,000.
Both are now scrapped.
Is the Secretary of State pulling up the housing ladder behind her?
It is staggering that the shadow Secretary of State says that, given that so many people now cannot get housing because his Government failed to meet their housing targets.
We will have a mortgage guarantee scheme and we will build 1.5 million homes so that young people and other people can get the houses that they deserve.
I will try again.
The Government’s manifesto promised to preserve the green belt.
Then grey belt came along, which was supposed to be a few garage forecourts.
Now it turns out that grey belt will mean 640 square miles of green belt—the size of Surrey—are to be built on.
Is this simply another broken promise?
I will also try again.
Under the Tories, the number of homes approved on greenfield land increased nearly tenfold since 2009.
Labour will be strategic in grey belt release, and we will have a brownfield-first policy.
Many families in my constituency live in new housing estates where the developers have made their profits, sailed off into the sunset, and left the roads and services in an unacceptable state and unadopted.
What steps might the Government be able to take to push local authorities like Northumberland county council into action to accept their responsibilities and adopt those estates?
I well recognise the situation that my hon.
Friend describes, but I also recognise the reluctance of local authorities to take on substandard housing estates that have been built.
We have decided to consult this year on options to reduce the prevalence of private management of estates of the kind he describes.
We will also, importantly, implement new consumer protections for homeowners on private estates in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024.
