There are of course many areas where the Prime Minister and I disagree, but now is the time for us to discuss where we do agree.
I welcome all his actions this weekend to convene European leaders, as well as the focus on economic security, using UK Export Finance to support British jobs.
As the Prime Minister knows, we welcome the uplift in defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, and we support the use of foreign aid to achieve that.
We welcome a commitment to reach 3% in the years ahead, and we will support him in taking difficult spending decisions, including on welfare.
We will return to the details of how the Government will fund this in the near future, but for now it is right that the Prime Minister is working with allies in Europe and with the United States to bring peace to Ukraine, and not a surrender to Russia.
As part of that, the Prime Minister has suggested that British troops could be deployed in Ukraine.
There are obviously a range of possible options for what such a deployment could look like, and we are keen to work with the Government, but we will need details of any such plan.
This will be a difficult but significant step.
I know many in Parliament, and across our country, will be interested in what this entails, and I ask him to work with us so there can be effective scrutiny.
I also welcome the coalition of the willing to support Ukraine and agree that Europe must do the heavy lifting.
Will the Prime Minister update us on what European and other allies are willing to offer towards this coalition?
