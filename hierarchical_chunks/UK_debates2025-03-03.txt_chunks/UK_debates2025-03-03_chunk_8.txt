I welcome the Government’s announcement today of changes to leasehold and the introduction of commonhold, but thousands of leaseholders across the country are still crippled by both high service charges and failing delivery.
I am sure that the inboxes of Members across the House are full of complaints from constituents, particularly in relation to FirstPort management company.
What can the Government do to hold individual management companies accountable for the services they deliver to our residents?
