I thank the Minister for his answer.
I am proud to have half of Morden town centre in my constituency.
Morden is an area ripe for rejuvenation.
It has fantastic transport links, but like many town centres across the country, it is struggling.
As one Labour councillor recently noted in the council chamber, despite years of promising to regenerate Morden, Labour-run Merton council has failed to deliver.
Just last week, it again put off doing anything—this time until at least 2027.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss why the council has failed to begin rejuvenation over the last 30 years, and to discuss what support the Government can  now give?
