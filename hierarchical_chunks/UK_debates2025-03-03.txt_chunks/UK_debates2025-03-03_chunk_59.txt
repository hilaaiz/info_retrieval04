I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his unity, because that is really important.
I think I speak for the whole House in saying that we are very proud of our armed forces in everything that they do.
They are at the leading edge.
They are playing a key part in Ukraine, and they will continue to play a key part in the security and defence of Europe.
