The Prime Minister deserves plaudits for the skilful way in which he handled his visit to Washington last week, as he does for the resolve that he has shown in standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of the sovereign state of Ukraine.
Surely, though, this is a moment to accept that the post-war international settlement has now been fractured and that the necessary rise in defence spending should be achieved by changing the fiscal rules, not by cuts to international aid, which will only see more people slain by famine, drought, disaster and war.
The reason why we will not change the fiscal rules is that we need economic stability.
We experienced economic instability only a few years ago, under Liz Truss.
The loss to our aid budget and all budgets would be far more profound if we go back to instability, and I am not prepared to do it.
It may be a great irony that a remainer Prime Minister used our Brexit freedoms as effectively as he did yesterday.
Indeed, as No. 10 briefed, we are now in a unique position compared with the rest of Europe, and yesterday was a triumph.
I also applaud him for saying such positive words about President Trump and our relationship with America, even if nobody behind him agrees.
But here is the key: President Zelensky has now accepted that he will sign the minerals agreement with America.
America is going to put in £100 billion or whatever it is, and thousands of Americans will be in Ukraine.
Is that, in itself, enough of a security guarantee, or does it mean that we need to send British troops?
If we do, and given the size of our Army, how many?
The mineral deal is not enough on its own.
May I just remind the hon.
Gentleman that Russia is the aggressor and Zelensky is a war leader whose country has been invaded?
We should all be supporting him and not fawning over Putin.
