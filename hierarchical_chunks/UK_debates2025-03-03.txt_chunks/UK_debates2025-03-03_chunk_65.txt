I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that point.
We must not lose sight of the fact that the Russian economy is being damaged by the measures that we are taking collectively, particularly on sanctions,  and we should have self-confidence in the ability of Europe to pull together, whether that is on military or financial issues, for the collective security of the defence of Europe.
We have said many times that Europe needs to step up.
Now is the time to step up; now is the time to lead.
That is why I was pleased that in the last few days we moved things on a little in that regard.
