I welcome the exciting Eden Portland proposals and I enjoyed meeting my hon.
Friend to hear further from him.
It  is clear that it would be great for the area’s economic regeneration, for tourism in the region and for supporting greater understanding of biodiversity loss.
Colleagues at DCMS are working closely with the proposers and with officials in my Department, but I would be happy to involve myself in whatever way is useful.
