The Prime Minister’s actions this week demonstrated again why UK leadership in defence and security and on Ukraine is crucial.
I also agree with him that it is important to strengthen our relationship with the United States.
In the coming months, will he consider whether we should be proposing to hit 3% spending before the next election?
We need to do what it takes.
I set out our position last week, which is that spending will be 2.5% by 2027 and 3% in the next Parliament, as fiscal circumstances allow.
