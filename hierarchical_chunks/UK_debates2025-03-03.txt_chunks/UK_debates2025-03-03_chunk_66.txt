I thank the Prime Minister for his statement, and for his continued strong leadership.
In contributing troops, drones and munitions, Russia’s allies remain active participants in Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine.
Will the Prime Minister please assure the House that alongside our allies we are closely monitoring Russia’s strategic partners during the ongoing peace efforts?
