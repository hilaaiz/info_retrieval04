In  Gloucestershire, after 14 years, waiting lists for both physical and mental health are finally falling.
Last week I hosted a roundtable with young people and heard how music and arts programmes, such as Gloucester’s fantastic Music Works, are transforming mental health outcomes.
I also chaired a Comedy-on-Prescription panel at South by Southwest with Lu Jackson and Jonathan Pie, utilising laughter to improve wellbeing and reduce waiting lists.
Can I ask the Prime Minister to back our campaign for creative health, and urge him to go further in reducing waiting lists for all patients?
My hon.
Friend has great expertise, having worked for many years in the NHS as a GP, and I support the work he is doing.
As he has pointed out, our plan for change has cut waiting lists in his local trust by almost 5,000, and we are going further, including through state-of-the-art radiotherapy machines rolled out across the country.
There is one going into my hon.
Friend’s constituency, and more scanners are going to  27 other hospital trusts, including two hospitals in the constituency of the Leader of the Opposition.
This is all made possible by the decisions we have made, and I know that the Leader of the Opposition will want to stand up and welcome that.
