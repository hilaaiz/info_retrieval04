I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this horrific case and the other, similar cases.
My thoughts—and, I am sure, the thoughts of the whole House—are with Michael’s family and all those affected by such vile crimes.
I think we all need to listen to what they have to say.
I know that she has been working with my hon.
Friend  the Member for York Outer (Mr Charters)  on this issue, and I pay tribute to her and to all those who are working so hard on the issue.
I am sure that the Justice Minister will be in touch at the first opportunity to take this forward.
I thank the hon.
Lady again for raising a really important issue.
