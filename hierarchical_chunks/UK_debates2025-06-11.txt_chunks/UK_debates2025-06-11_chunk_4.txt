The Minister sounds unexpectedly optimistic, given that so many question marks remain over promises and aspirations for defence spending.
Can she confirm the impact of handing over the Chagos islands and billions of pounds to Mauritius?

This spending will bring the industry more jobs, and upgrade our military homes in Wales.
