I thank the hon.
Member for raising this.
The epidemic of absence in our schools really does worry me.
Thanks to the efforts of schools and parents across the country, we have seen over 3 million more days in school this year compared with last, which is really important, but we do know that pupils with special educational needs face more complex barriers in relation to school attendance.
We will of course look at all amendments in the usual way, but in this instance I do think we have struck the right balance.
