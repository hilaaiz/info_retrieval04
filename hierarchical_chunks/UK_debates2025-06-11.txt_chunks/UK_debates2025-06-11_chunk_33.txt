May I start by congratulating Sir Billy Boston?
Billy ended his career playing at Blackpool, and I know this has been a long campaign by the Culture Secretary, the Speaker, my hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield (Josh Simons) and many in this House—congratulations to Sir Billy.
It has been exposed by Shelter that 12,000 people are waiting for council housing in Blackpool.
This is a damning indictment of the legacy of the 14 years of the previous Government.
Hundreds of families in my constituency are waiting for housing, stuck in a bed and breakfast or, like my constituent Kaci with her two children in tow, are sofa surfing.
So will the Prime Minister, alongside the Deputy Prime Minister, commit to a new generation of social housing and council housing in my constituency, and help me build a better Blackpool?
I join my hon.
Friend on his comments about Billy Boston, and I think the whole House will, Mr Speaker.
We are turning the tide on the housing crisis, with the biggest investment in social and affordable housing in a generation.
The Chancellor is investing £39 billion over the next 10 years—almost double what we saw under the last Government—and it is no wonder the National Housing Federation welcomed this as transformative, saying it offers “real hope” to the thousands who need safe, secure and affordable homes.
It is National Diabetes Week, and as someone living with type 1, as we both are, Mr Speaker, I am more than aware of the serious complications of diabetic ketoacidosis—DKA—which can prove fatal if not caught early enough.
A quarter of children are diagnosed with  type 1 diabetes when in DKA, and that could be avoided with early diagnosis.
Will the Prime Minister commit to rolling out a national universal screening programme, as seen in Italy, for type 1?
