Turbocharging the Welsh economy—and the economy at large, frankly—is vital for social mobility and prosperity.
We Conservatives delivered two Welsh investment zones, two freeports, more than £1 billion in extra funding, and we helped more than 2 million women into the jobs market across the UK.

Their jobs tax, their tourism tax and the 20 mph default speed limit are a hammer blow to business confidence, particularly in the hospitality sector.

I met the chair of Great British Energy Nuclear last week to discuss how to maximise the opportunities for Wales of new nuclear projects, and I will continue to work with the Energy Secretary and the Welsh Government to ensure that Wales’s supply chain and workforce benefit from that investment.

Almost all the UK’s nuclear power stations are currently due to come offline in the 2030s.
It is this Government who are changing that, setting out our plan to end the years of Tory failure to invest or deliver on nuclear.
We will deliver the biggest nuclear building programme in a generation.
In 14 years, the Conservatives delivered no new nuclear anywhere in the country, including in Wales.
Does the Secretary of State agree that this Labour Government are committed to delivering energy security, good jobs and lower bills for families across Wales?

Friend will know that the Sizewell C consortium, for example—a group of more than 200 nuclear supply chain companies—has a memorandum of understanding with the Welsh Government that will result in an investment of up to £900 million in the Welsh nuclear supply chain.
Great British Energy Nuclear acquired the Wylfa site last year, which previously hosted a nuclear power plant and is the best potential site in the UK for new nuclear deployment.
