The Prime Minister must be talking about a different economy.
All of us in this House heard about unemployment increasing—unemployment has increased every month since Labour took office.
Last year, the Prime Minister said that he was taking the winter fuel payment away to balance the books, but the books are not balanced; in fact, they are worse.
This year, the deficit is forecast to be £10 billion higher since the Budget—not since last year’s election, but since the Budget.
In what way are the books now balanced?
The right hon.
Lady has obviously missed the interest rate cuts, the growth figures for earlier this year, the strategic defence review, £15 billion going into local transport, free school meals, Sizewell and social housing.
She stands at the Dispatch Box to lecture us, and I see that Liz Truss is obviously back in vogue, advising Reform officially now and haunting the Tories.
I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the shadow Home Secretary, who I think was then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, gave the Liz Truss Budget 9.5 out of 10.
The Leader of the Opposition said that what was wrong with Liz Truss’s Budget was not necessarily the package—that was all right—but the way it was sold.
The Tories have learned absolutely nothing.
