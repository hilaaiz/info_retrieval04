Does the Minister prefer peanuts, cashew nuts or simply scraps for Wales?
The fabled “two Labour Governments in lockstep” is simply a myth for voters.
Changing rail classifications and short-changing Welsh communities is a true reality.
Is the Minister concerned about today’s reported peanuts?
When did she become aware of the paltry settlement of just over £400 million that is to come to Wales?
How will that be split for the Welsh Government?
How does it compare with our Government’s £740 million for rail alone?
What specific action did she take to argue for a fair share for Wales, and for its place in the Union?
The hon.
Lady’s party, which was in government for 14 years, was in power when Wales got 1% of the rail enhancement budget, although it has 11% of the whole UK network.
Her party is responsible for the historical underfunding of Welsh rail, and we will hear from the Chancellor this afternoon about what this Government are going to do about it.
