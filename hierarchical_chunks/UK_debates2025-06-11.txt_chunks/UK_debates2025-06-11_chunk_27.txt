Let me join others in wishing you a belated many happy returns for yesterday, Mr Speaker.
Let me also welcome the Government’s sanctions on two Ministers in the Netanyahu Government, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich.
The settler violence that they have incited against innocent Palestinians on the west bank is intolerable, and the Government were right to act.
As it is Carers Week, may I pay tribute to the millions of unpaid family carers across the country, recognising the challenges that they face?
The last Conservative Government left our health service on its knees.
We have heard reports that the NHS will receive extra funding in the spending review, and if it does, we will support that, but does the Prime Minister agree that no amount of money for the NHS will solve its crisis unless we also invest to fix care?
Without pre-empting the Chancellor’s statement, will he reassure me that both social care and family carers will be given the priority they deserve in the spending review?
I agree with the right hon.
Gentleman that the health crisis created by the previous Government cannot be—[Interruption.]
Opposition Members groan, but that is exactly how the country feels about the last 14 years and the mess that they made of everything.
Yes, we do need to fix social care as well as putting money into the NHS.
We are putting record amounts into the NHS, which is the right thing to do, and we are seeing the results.
We promised 2 million extra appointments in the first year of a Labour Government, and we have delivered 3 million.
So there will be that extra funding, but let me gently say to the right hon.
Gentleman that while he welcomes all the extra funding, he cannot at the same time simply say that he is against any way of raising the money for the funding.
There is an incompatibility there.
