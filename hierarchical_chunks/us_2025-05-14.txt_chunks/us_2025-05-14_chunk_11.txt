PAOA's mission is to empower and educate individuals and families while promoting pride and acceptance of all cultures and instilling the best values they embody.
The organization currently has 53 registered members and 19 Board Members.
Their vision is to ensure that the Pacific Island community in Alaska and beyond receives support in education, employment, and cultural enrichment.
I want to thank the group for their continued dedication to Polynesian cultural and community values in Alaska and for their contributions to the Pacific Islands region at large.
