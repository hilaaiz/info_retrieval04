Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors the 100th anniversary of Detroit Memorial Park, Michigan's oldest Black-owned cemetery and a beacon of dignity, justice, and community for generations.
Founded in 1925 by visionary Black leaders Charles C. Diggs, Sr. and Aaron C. Toodle, Detroit Memorial Park was born out of necessity, at a time when Black families in Detroit were denied basic dignity in burial.
These trailblazers cleared sacred ground where all people, regardless of race or faith, could be laid to rest with respect.
From offering fresh vegetables to families during the Depression to providing low-cost transportation for mourners, Detroit Memorial Park has always led with care and compassion.
Today, with cemeteries in Warren, Redford, and Flint, they continue this legacy across over 170 acres.
As we celebrate this historic milestone, I offer my deepest gratitude to Detroit Memorial Park for a century of unwavering service and dignity.
The 12th District honors the Detroit Memorial Park and celebrates this momentous occasion for our community.
