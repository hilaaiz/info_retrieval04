Mrs. RADEWAGEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Polynesian Association of Alaska (PAOA), a non-profit organization that is celebrating their 20th Anniversary.
Over the span of two decades, this organization has committed itself to educating Pacific Islanders across various domains, including health and social services, employment, culture, language, voting, education, immigration, and more.
PAOA was founded on November 16, 2004, in Anchorage, Alaska, following a Samoan Computer Language Senior Class led by Lusiana Tuga Hansen.
This non-profit entity was formally established and registered in the City of Anchorage and the State of Alaska on February 1, 2005, and achieved 501(c)(3) status on June 16, 2006.
Since its establishment, it has functioned as the leading organization for the Pacific Island community in Alaska from 2005 to 2025.
