Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding contributions that Lisa DeGennaro has made through her work with the CARES Senior Clinic.
Lisa is the clinic's competent receptionist.
She is the first to greet all who call and walk into the clinic, always with a smile.
She is eager to assist and direct patients to the right place.
The clinic would not run smoothly without her diligent efforts.
It is clear Lisa DeGennaro has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
