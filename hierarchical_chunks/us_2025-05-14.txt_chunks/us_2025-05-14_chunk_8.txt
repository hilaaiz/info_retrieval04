Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Hmong American community and commemorate May 14, 2025, as Hmong American Day, marking 50 years since the first Hmong families began their journey to the United States following the fall of Long Cheng in 1975.
On this day, we recognize the legacy of service, sacrifice, and strength that defines the Hmong American experience.
From 1961 to 1975, more than 40,000 Hmong men and boys--many under the age of 18--were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to fight in the Secret War in Laos, a critical but often overlooked chapter of the Vietnam War.
Fighting alongside American forces, Hmong soldiers risked everything to defend freedom and combat the spread of communism in Southeast Asia.
Following the end of the war, they and their families faced persecution and displacement, forcing thousands to flee Laos.
On May 14, 1975, the final airlift evacuated Hmong soldiers and their families from Laos to refugee camps in Thailand.
From there, many resettled in the United States, including in California's Central Valley, where they rebuilt their lives with determination and hope.
Today, communities like Clovis, Fresno, and Sacramento are home to some families have contributed to the fabric of American society in countless ways by serving as educators, healthcare professionals, entrepreneurs, public servants, and community leaders.
We especially honor the Hmong veterans and their families, whose courage and loyalty to the United States must never be forgotten.
Their stories remind us of the price of freedom and the enduring strength of the human spirit.
I commend the County of Fresno, the City of Clovis, and other local governments for formally recognizing Hmong American Day and paying tribute to the history, culture, and contributions of the Hmong people.
I join them in encouraging all Americans to learn more about this rich legacy and to celebrate the extraordinary impact of Hmong Americans on our communities and our country.
