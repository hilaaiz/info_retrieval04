It is simply unconscionable that guns are now the leading cause of death of children and teens in America.
Just two years ago, I joined Congress in passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the first major gun violence prevention law since the Brady Bill.
Already, this legislation is saving lives, but we need bolder action.
It is long past the time to do something about the epidemic of gun violence in our nation?
The nation that prides itself on protecting our children and the future generations.
If we want to protect Americans, we must start by learning how to effectively store guns in the homes that choose to have them.
Americans want more than thoughts and prayers.
They want action.
Gun safety is a nonpartisan issue that requires a bipartisan solution.
Over 90 percent of Americans--including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--want to expand the Brady Bill and pass universal background checks so that we can end the scourge of gun violence.
A majority of Americans want an assault weapons ban, extreme risk laws, and support for community violence intervention.
Data for Progress finds 49 percent of voters support changing Senate rules so Democrats can pass gun control legislation.
This includes 76 percent of Democrats, 43 percent of Independents, and 24 percent.
Put simply, Americans deserve sensible action to end this epidemic.
The Brady's legacy lives on today in the gun violence prevention organization named after them.
We must remain persistent in the fight for a safer America that is free of gun violence.
I will continue to work with colleagues to end this epidemic.
