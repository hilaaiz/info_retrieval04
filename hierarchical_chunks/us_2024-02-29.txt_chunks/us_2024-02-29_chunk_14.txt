Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly, Azerbaijan.
On February 26, 1992, Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people--including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly people--and left less than 2,000 survivors.
Hundreds more became disabled due to their injuries.
More than 100 children lost a parent and 25 children lost both parents.
At least 8 families were entirely killed.
This was the largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict Although a cease-fire was negotiated in 1994, it is my hope that Armenia and Azerbaijan can come together and find peace.
Long-term peace, security, and regional cooperation would greatly benefit the region and the world.
As Azerbaijanis throughout the world commemorate the massacre and continue to grieve the loss of loved ones, I hope they can find peace amidst this tragedy.
