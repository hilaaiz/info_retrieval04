Mr. TONY GONZALES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an important milestone in my district.
Today, El Paso Electric is unveiling Newman Unit 6--a cutting edge, 228 megawatt natural gas combustion turbine generating power plant.
This state-of-the-art facility will replace three older, less-efficient units with a robust energy supply equipped to meet the growing needs of the El Paso region.
Situated at the Newman Power Station in El Paso, TX, this project exemplifies El Paso Electric's dedication to enhancing energy reliability and minimizing wasteful practices.
By utilizing modern natural gas technology, this project will optimize gas usage and reduce water consumption by an impressive 600 million gallons annually.
Additionally, alongside maintaining a robust natural gas power supply, this initiative makes significant investments in renewable energy.
Such diversification is integral for fostering a resilient power grid fit for the demands of the 21st century.
Supporting a strong energy sector is a key priority of mine in this Chamber.
I fundamentally believe that energy security is national security and that safeguarding jobs, such as those generated by this project, is paramount.
Witnessing the fruition of this development fills me with pride.
I applaud El Paso Electric for their unwavering commitment to bolstering energy reliability and security in the El Paso region.
Their tireless efforts ensure that our energy grid remains strong and can keep our lights on around the clock.
