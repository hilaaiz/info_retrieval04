Mr. RYAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the Ulster County Chamber of Commerce's Leap of Kindness Day, on February 29, 2024.
Leap of Kindness Day was started in 2016 by the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce and has taken place on February 29th each Leap Year since.
The goal of the day has always been to spend the extra day we are given every four years doing acts of kindness.
This initiative has spread throughout the U.S., Canada, and Ireland to help those in need.
Leap of Kindness Day offers community members a chance to do something kind for someone else.
It motivates organizations, businesses, and communities to donate clothing, food, and money to local not-for-profit organizations.
This day keeps communities rooted in their values and spreads love to neighbors.
Growing up in Ulster County, I have seen how giving, dedicated, and kind my neighbors in the Hudson Valley are to those around them.
I hope that everyone can take part in such a great initiative, participating alongside their communities to help others, not just today but every day as we all work to spread more kindness.
I want to recognize Ward Todd and Jess Davis, President and Vice President of the Ulster County Regional Chamber of Commerce, for their work to make Leap of Kindness Day such a meaningful day for our community.
