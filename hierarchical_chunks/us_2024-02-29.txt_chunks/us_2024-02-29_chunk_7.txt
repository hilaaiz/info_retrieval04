Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the distinguished life and extraordinary military career of General Edward Greer, a remarkable individual whose legacy has left an indelible mark on our nation, as he approaches his 100th birthday.
Born in the coal-mining town of Gary, West Virginia, General Greer's journey began at West Virginia State College in 1942, where he enrolled during an era of racial segregation.
However, his education was interrupted by World War II, leading him to serve in the 777th Field Artillery Battalion, an all-Black unit.
By the war's end, he had risen to the esteemed rank.
Returning to civilian life, General Greer resumed his studies at West Virginia State College, where he met and married Jewell Means.
Their union, forged on May 31, 1948, endured for more than 72 years.
Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army in 1940, General Greer sought stability in the military, serving with distinction for 33 years.
His early assignments in Japan coincided with the outbreak of the Korean War, where he earned the Silver Star for valor.
Promoted through the ranks, General Greer's military career traversed Germany.
Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Pentagon, witnessing the Army's integration and earning promotions to Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel.
His family grew to include three children: Michael, Kenneth, and Gail.
In 1970, Colonel Greer served in Vietnam before becoming a trailblazer in military history.
Selected for promotion to Brigadier General in 1972, he joined an esteemed group of Black officers, contributing to the integration of the Army's general officer ranks.
Retiring in 1976 after 33 years of dedicated service, General Greer made El Paso his home.
With his beloved wife Jewell, he became an active member of the community, engaging in real estate sales and contributing to various civic boards.
The Greers' post-Army life was a testament to their commitment to service and community.
It is with profound gratitude and respect that we honor General Edward Greer's legacy, a legacy that exemplifies the highest ideals of duty, honor, and love for our great nation, and wish him a very happy 100th birthday.
