Mr. KHANNA.
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the selfless life of Bishop Carlton Pearson who passed away last November at the age of 70.
Bishop Carlton Pearson was an evangelist, ministry leader, author, and awardwinning singer.
He was raised in San Diego, California with five siblings.
He is survived by them, his wife, and his two children.
An expert in many crafts, his congregation often praised his diverse passions and the limitless communities impacted by his work.
He preached what he called a gospel of inclusion.
He saw all human life as an integral part of a broader community.
He was welcomed in Synagogues, Islamic groups, Atheist and Agnostic organizations, and a variety of other spiritual communities.
He felt a mandate to strive for peace through an emphasis on inclusion in spirituality and interfaith fellowship.
I commend him again today and emphasize his teaching that we don't have to go along to get along.
That we can mind many of the same things without necessarily having the same mind about everything.
We honor the life of Bishop Carlton Pearson, the legacy he left won't be soon forgotten.
I include in the Record this Rolling Stone Magazine memoriam about how he has inspired generations to come.
