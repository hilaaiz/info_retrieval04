Avid community leader 
Mr. Jasper can always be found helping others in the community, advising on business development, and providing referrals to resources.
A pillar of

As a young man and throughout most of his adult years, 
Mr. Jasper was a member of the Historic Second Baptist Church, serving as a Sanctuary choir member under Rev. Thomas Nelson Washington.
A man dedicated to the will of God, he was regularly found in Sunday school, singing in the Choir and being a guest soloist on church programs across the city, and he continues to do so today.
Currently, he worships at the First Agape Baptist Church, where he serves as a senior deacon and treasurer under the ministry of the Rev. Eddie M. Payne.
Mr. Jasper loves to minister in song.
He favors the older spirituaIs like ``I'll Tell it Wherever I Go'' and ``King Jesus Will Roll All Burdens Away'' but is most inspired by ``What a Blessing in Jesus I've Found.''
His favorite scripture is Romans 8:38-39 is his message to his children and grandchildren--``Be prayerful, have faith and trust in God, and let nothing separate you from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus.''
