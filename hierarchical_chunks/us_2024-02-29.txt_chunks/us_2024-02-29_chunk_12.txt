Mr. Jasper is a mighty man of service, and today, he continues to serve as my purpose-driven mentor and father figure.
He has encouraged me through all of my dreams throughout my career.
He is genuinely a patriarch to many who continue to cross his path and will always be a part of my journey as I lead the constituents of the 2nd Congressional District.
He is my dear friend and mentor, and I hope to be the mentor to others as he has been for me.
On this day, I wish my dear friend a Happy and Blessed Birthday, and may he see many more.
