Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, in 1993, the state of Florida commissioned Professors Maxine D. Jones, Larry E. Rivers, David R. Colburn, William R. Rogers, and Tom Dye to write and submit to the Florida Board of Regents a documented report of what occurred at the site of Rosewood in Levy County Florida during the first week of January, 1923.
The findings of that report can be found at: <a href='http:// edocs.dlis.state.fl.us/fldocs/regents/rosewood.pdf'>http:// edocs.dlis.state.fl.us/fldocs/regents/rosewood.pdf</a>.
