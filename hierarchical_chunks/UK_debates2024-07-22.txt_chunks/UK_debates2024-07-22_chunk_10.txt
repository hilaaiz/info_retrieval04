The Prime Minister has rightly talked about putting his Government back into the service of working people.
My unfaltering belief in public service was instilled in me from a young age.
I want to take a moment to pay tribute to my father, Charles Brash, a doctor in Hartlepool  for over 30 years.
One of my earliest memories is of him coming home from a night on call—GPs did that in those days—having a quick bite to eat, and then heading straight back out for his morning surgery.
Some people still call me “the doctor’s son”, and I wear it like a badge of honour.
His career, spent in the service of others, shaped my values, and my belief that only by putting people first can we achieve the change we need.
I pay tribute to my predecessor, Jill Mortimer.
Since her election in 2021, Jill has forged strong relationships in Hartlepool, particularly with veterans’ groups, which I hope to emulate.
Public service is never easy, and I thank Jill Mortimer for her service to Hartlepool.
I close by returning to the idea of opportunity.
Right now, in 2024, in one of the richest countries in the world, nearly 20% of Hartlepool’s children live in absolute poverty.
Nothing could better symbolise the spectre of opportunity denied—the opportunity for a safe and secure upbringing, to fulfil their boundless potential, to get a good job and raise their own family in security and prosperity.
So I welcome the announcement by my right hon.
Friends the Secretaries of State for Education and for Work and Pensions on developing an ambitious child poverty strategy, because as Members know, the record is clear: when Labour is in government, child poverty falls.
I am privileged to stand in this place, but I will never lose sight of the fact that it is a privilege gifted to me by Hartlepool people, far too many of whom have been denied opportunity for far too long.
Hartlepool people have a reputation for, on occasion, electing fighters as opposed to quitters, and I am pleased to tell the House that they have done so again.
My duty, my service, is to fight for them every day to secure the brighter future that our town deserves.
I am pleased to speak in a debate with so many strong female representatives, including  the hon.
Member for West Worcestershire (Dame Harriett Baldwin) , and I am really honoured to speak in a debate led by the first female Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has shown today what a force for change she is.
I have found it  incredibly moving to hear MPs across the House talk with such love and dedication about the places they represent.
It has given this Parliament a deep grounding in the stories of people from every part of the UK.
I feel deeply the trust put in me by the people of Queen’s Park and Maida Vale.
In speaking here, I stand on the shoulders of some extraordinary women who have represented the different parts of Queen’s Park and Maida Vale.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Brent East (Dawn Butler)  is someone who breaks through glass ceilings and lifts others up behind her.
Nothing ever dims her spirit and her passion for tackling injustice.
You need only walk down Harlesden High Street with her to see how she inspires people by her example—and sometimes her music.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Tulip Siddiq)  is a formidable campaigner who was in the Chamber the day she was due to give birth because she needed to give her constituents a voice.
She did not stop campaigning until her constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was safely home with her family.
Those who know her will quickly learn that she never, ever gives up.
She is always a voice for the people she cares about.
Karen Buck gave an extraordinary 27 years of service to the residents of Westminster North.
I was at a school in my constituency last week where the head said that Karen was the fourth emergency service, always at the end of a phone ready to help.
I remember going to an elderly people’s lunch where the residents said, “You can be our MP—you are very nice.
Just make sure that Karen comes to our residents’ meeting in July.”
The wonderful team at the House Library sent me Karen’s maiden speech.
It was no surprise to me that it was a passionate call to action on the housing conditions of her constituents.
That passion has not dimmed for a second; it could be heard in every line of her 37 interventions on the Renters (Reform) Bill over 25 years later.
She has shown that somebody with community running through their veins can move mountains.
I will work every day to live up to the women who came before me—that includes you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and your sister Baroness McDonagh, who have both showed such amazing, dedicated service and never give up fighting for constituents and the people of this country.
Queen’s Park and Maida Vale is a place that means a huge amount to me.
My great-grandfather came over to the UK when he was a teenager, fleeing the poverty and pogroms of Lithuania, and worked his way up to open a shop on Kilburn High Road.
My family have lived and worked in the area ever since.
Growing up in the heart of London, I attended Horfield primary school and saw how many children were cut out of the opportunities on their doorstep; that has driven me ever since.
The need that we see now is greater than ever.
My inbox and my surgeries are full of people facing the homelessness crisis and skipping meals to feed their family—all in walking distance of the Chamber.
Queen’s Park and Maida Vale is a place with huge need, but also with huge heart.
It has welcomed not just my family but families from so many different backgrounds.
We are home to the Bangladesh Caterers Association; the Lauderdale Road synagogue; the UK Albanian Muslim Community and Cultural Centre; Harlesden,  which is the unofficial capital of reggae and the starting point for so many iconic artists and producers; Kilburn, a centre of creativity with a claim to be the birthplace of cinema; and the amazing, diverse community of Church Street.
We are a community that is rich in spirit and dynamism.
In 1879, Queen’s Park was chosen to host the royal agricultural show, the Victorian equivalent of the Olympics.
It was a very British affair—it rained most of the time—but ordinary people campaigned to preserve the open space, and it is still a thriving park today.
Down the road, Walterton and Elgin Community Homes is a shining example of community leadership.
We also have the country’s only urban parish council.
Queen’s Park is the birthplace of the pride of west London, Queens Park Rangers football club.
I can tell the House that being a QPR fan is almost as good as this Chamber for getting to know the communities of the UK; it means spending rainy days in Cardiff, Preston, Southend and Tranmere, embracing again and again the triumph of hope over experience.
I have always been an optimist.
Despite 14 tough years in local government, including seven as Camden council leader, I have never lost hope, because every day I can see the power of communities.
I was elected as a councillor in 2010, and at events, when people used to say to me, “What do you do?”, I would proudly say to them, “I am a councillor.”
They would say, “That is so wonderful; you do such wonderful work as a therapist.”
I would have to say, “No, not that kind of counsellor.
I am a Labour party councillor.”
They would either swiftly go and get a drink or talk to me about dog mess.
Street cleaning and rubbish collection are essential services that councils deliver—my hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham Erdington (Mrs Hamilton)  once introduced me as the person who makes sure that Keir Starmer’s bins are collected—but we often forget how much more local government is.
I see that every day, watching the work of Brent and Westminster, two brilliant Labour councils in my constituency.
Councils are lifelines for communities.
They provide care for the children and adults who most need support.
They are leaders of place, bringing services and people together to make change.
I have seen local government staff go above and beyond time and again, fuelled by love and dedication, because there was no one else there, whether they were working with communities to deliver food during covid or supporting Afghan evacuees.
When things have been hard, they have held together our communities, finding unity in difference.
The Gracious Speech sets out bold new proposals in the English devolution Bill to unlock the energy and creativity of communities.
It sets out Bills to fulfil Karen Buck’s long-held campaign to end no-fault evictions and reform the leasehold system.
The proposals will support the people of Queen’s Park and Maida Vale who come out every day to build their community—the youth workers, the community gardeners and those running the North Paddington food bank, who wish it did not have to exist.
These are people putting hope into action because they believe that things can change.
I know that as I sit in the Chamber, I will have their voices and stories with me, but I will also have the stories that I have heard from hon.
Members from across the UK.
We all have that in common: the privilege and the responsibility of bringing the voices of our  community to this place.
We may debate and disagree, but I hope to always listen and learn, and remember that we are being entrusted to weave those stories, hopes and ambitions together for a national vision for this country—one that governs for all and leaves no one behind.
Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.
It is a pleasure to follow  the right hon.
and learned Member for Fareham and Waterlooville (Suella Braverman) .
Like other Members, I am somewhat surprised by her rewriting of recent economic history.
She had 14 years to fix the problems of child poverty, and did precious little to do that.
I listened today to the Chancellor of the Exchequer lay out this Government’s plans to restore economic stability and growth to this country—that is what will lift millions of children out of poverty in the long term.
It is a privilege to stand here today representing the place where I was born and raised, Finchley and Golders Green.
I would like to start by paying tribute to my predecessor, Mike Freer.
Although we disagreed on many things, Mike was dedicated to our area, both as a Member of Parliament and as leader of Barnet council.
I admire his commitment to public service and, in particular, his role in securing equal marriage legislation for same sex couples—a legacy that he can take enormous pride in.
But the circumstances under which Mike decided not to stand for re-election are appalling.
We should have been able to face each other on the basis of our ideas, but Mike’s life and office were threatened by those who believe in the bullet, not the ballot box.
It is a stark reminder of the fragility of our democracy both at home and abroad.
I want to use my time in this place to stand up for the democratic values and processes that I believe in.
Witnessing the dignified and smooth transition of power last week in all parts of this House is something we can take pride in.
We must ensure that we work together to defend the safety of public servants.
I wish Mike and his husband Angelo all the best in their future.
I also pay tribute to the much missed Dr Rudi Vis, who holds a special place in the heart of my local community, not least as the first Labour Member to represent this special patch of north London.
In over a century, I am only the second person from my party to be sent to this place by the people of Finchley and Golders Green.
I am also only the second woman.
Some Members may remember the first.
When Mrs Thatcher entered this place, she was made to wait two whole years to make her maiden speech, but in our era of breakneck news cycles, and with so much work that I want to do, having to wait just two weeks has felt like a very long time.
Having delayed long enough, Mrs Thatcher did not waste a second when she rose to her feet, breaking convention by making her maiden speech on a private Member’s Bill that she introduced.
“This is a maiden speech”, she said, her sonorous tones echoing through this hallowed place— “but I know that the constituency of Finchley…would not wish me to do other than come straight to the point”.—[Official Report,  5 February 1960 ; Vol. 616, c. 1350.]
The people of Finchley and Golders Green rightly remain as demanding of their elected officials today, so I, too, will come straight to the point.
Like Mrs Thatcher, I am a patriot and I want our communities and our country to prosper and be an influence on the global stage.
But unlike her, I fundamentally believe that there is such a thing as society.
Society is not an abstract idea to be buried in sociological essays.
We can see it in the rich tapestry of communities that come together across Finchley and Golders Green.
I may be the first female, Jewish, Gibraltarian MP from this constituency, but I would not be here without the support of my neighbours and my community: the Cypriot community, the Somali Bravanese, the Kosovan, the Japanese, the Irish and Hindu communities, the lawyers and the Uber drivers, the charity workers and the campaigners, the Spurs fans and the fans of some other north London team.
Whereas in recent times some politicians have chosen to use “north Londoner” as an insult, my constituents
and I wear it as a badge of pride.
It symbolises a place that celebrates diversity, hard work and looking out for your neighbour.
Our diversity comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the history of our area.
Where else can boast the parish where Archbishop Desmond Tutu honed his  ministry in the terrible years of exile during apartheid in South Africa, and the childhood home of the late and great Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, a man who taught us that a good society is one that offers all its members equal access to hope?
It was in East Finchley that George Michael first tinkled on the ivories and Amy Winehouse first took the stage.
Finchley and Golders Green has a quiet radicalism baked into its history.
Take Hampstead Garden Suburb, where I grew up, a project driven by the extraordinary Henrietta Barnett in the early 20th century.
One of the first garden cities, it was a groundbreaking development.
She also set up Toynbee Hall in London’s east end, where I began my legal career as a volunteer at the Free Legal Advice Centre.
I saw there just how important the law could be for tenants facing eviction and women suffering unequal pay.
Now I want to take those values of access to justice and a commitment to the rule of law into my new role as Solicitor General.
When, in 1907, we witnessed the opening of Golders Green underground station, adverts at the time dubbed our area a “place of delightful prospects”.
I can vouch that never a truer word has been spoken, but this place of delightful prospects has suffered in recent years.
My community has witnessed rising levels of antisemitism and Islamophobia.
These are a scourge on our society and as long as I am in office I will tirelessly call them out and work to eradicate them.
Our community today is increasingly becoming a place of busy food banks and empty mansions.
Inequality is writ large, stunting people’s health and potential.
Many across Finchley and Golders Green are struggling with the spiralling cost of living.
This has to change not just in my constituency, but across the whole country.
Our NHS is broken, the prisons are full, the police cannot respond when they are called out and our teachers are not supported to deliver.
We need to get Britain back on track, and the Bills set out in the King’s Speech are exactly what we need to take the brakes off the economy and restore and rebuild our public services.
My constituents are raring to go.
Whether it is the Brent Cross Town development, one of the largest regeneration developments in Europe, or our brilliant high street businesses and local entrepreneurs, all we need to get growing is a Government who are on our side.
Well, we have that Government now.
So, to quote my famous predecessor, let’s get straight to the point and let’s get on with the change that Britain truly needs.
Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make my maiden speech in this debate.
It is a privilege to follow the first female Chancellor in history, and to follow two inspiring maiden speeches from the Labour Benches by my hon.
Friends the Members for Queen’s Park and Maida Vale (Georgia Gould) and for Finchley and Golders Green (Sarah Sackman).
It is an honour to sit alongside them on the Government Benches, and their communities are both very lucky to have them.
As hon.
Members can imagine, I have given careful thought to my remarks today, but it is safe to say that this is not the most anticipated maiden speech ever  associated with Welwyn Hatfield.
The reason for that is that, on  20 November 1558 , Elizabeth I gave her inaugural address as Queen from Hatfield House in my constituency.
Irrespective of how the next few minutes go, I think her place in history is safe.
I am especially grateful to be called in this debate on the economy.
My constituency is anchored by two new towns that flourished under a previous Labour Government.
Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City were incorporated as new towns together under a single development corporation on  20 May 1948 .
The growth of Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City played an important role in the rebuilding and reimagining of life in our part of the country after the horrors of the second world war.
I believe that if we are to succeed in growing our economy, we have to rediscover the ambition and the vision that was embodied by those who designed and carefully planned our two great towns.
My predecessor as the MP for Welwyn Hatfield was the right hon.
Grant Shapps, who served our community for 19 years and will be well known to all Members of this House.
In fact, he will probably be familiar to anyone who was watching a morning television news programme at any point over the last five years.
Before I talk about Grant’s legacy, however, I want to start with a message of reassurance to the Labour Whips and my colleagues: I have no desire to hold quite so many Cabinet positions as he did, and certainly not in such a short period of time.
I want to reflect solemnly on the personal and professional commitment that Grant Shapps made to the people of Ukraine.
After the Russian invasion in 2022, he opened his family home to provide sanctuary to three generations of a Ukrainian family, innocent people whose lives were turned upside down by Putin’s unprovoked act of aggression.
In the last Parliament, more than 200,000 Ukrainians were welcomed to our country under the Ukraine family scheme and the Ukraine sponsorship scheme, an initiative that I believe showed our country at its best, open and welcoming in an hour of grave need.
We serve in this House of Commons at a time when our wider political discourse can often be angry and divisive.
Of course we will disagree in the House, and passionately so—our constituents rightly expect us always to stand up for our community and our values, and I will certainly try to do just that—but I think we can too easily forget what unites us.
Where we agree, let us have the confidence to say so.
My predecessor was right to champion the people of Ukraine, and the cause of freedom and democracy.
I commend him for it, and wish him well in whatever comes next.
Welwyn Hatfield is a constituency rich in history.
Welwyn Village and Woolmer Green were both Roman settlements, and Welwyn is one of the few places in the country believed to have been occupied continuously for 2,000 years.
Nearly 400 years after Hatfield was home to Queen Elizabeth I, local people made an important contribution to the defeat of Nazi tyranny.
The Royal Air Force’s Mosquito fighter-bomber was developed at the de Havilland airfield and aircraft factory in Hatfield.
Welwyn Garden City also has a unique place in history as the creation of Ebenezer Howard, the father of the garden city movement.
His immaculately planned and tree-lined streets, such as Parkway in Welwyn Garden City, are still true to his vision from nearly 100 years ago.
Despite our wonderful history, what has struck me when I have walked around our towns and villages is the impression of too many projects on hold, and potential going unfulfilled.
Take the iconic Shredded Wheat silos, designed by Louis de Soissons in 1926 and a defining feature of Welwyn Garden City for decades.
The site has lain virtually dormant since the factory closed in 2008.
In central Hatfield, it is a similar story.
Queensway House consists of 66 units that were once all social housing.
In November 2019, after a ballot of residents, a majority decided that it was time to demolish and rebuild, but nearly five years later Queensway House is still standing, and it looms over the centre of Hatfield as a symbol of the inertia that has captured our politics for too long.
I am determined that that must change.
The centre of Hatfield is one part of our community that most urgently needs investment in good-quality housing and social infrastructure, and I will be a champion for it in this House.
Welwyn Hatfield is a growing and increasingly diverse community.
In just the last few months I have attended the world street food festival in Welwyn Garden City, the first ever Diwali celebration in White Lion Square in Hatfield, and the ever popular Welwyn festival on Singlers Marsh.
We are home to prominent national businesses, including Tesco and Ocado in Hatfield, and to the thriving University of Hertfordshire.
The university will soon be opening its state-of-the-art Spectra building for the study of physics, engineering and computer science—and yes, Mr Vice-Chancellor, as this will appear in Hansard, please consider that to be my formal bid for an invitation to its opening!
I believe that a new Parliament is a time for ambition and optimism.
Welwyn Hatfield blossomed when Attlee’s Labour Government put housing and carefully planned communities at the centre of its agenda for change.
Nearly 80 years later, we have another majority Labour Government with a mandate for national renewal.
This is a moment of opportunity, and each of us on these Benches has a responsibility to play our part in realising it.
For as long as I serve in this House of Commons, I will always do my utmost to champion Welwyn Hatfield, to respect our history, and to be an agent for change.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for West Suffolk (Nick Timothy)  on his maiden speech, and all those who have spoken for the first time in the House today.
It is an honour for me to make my maiden speech as the first Member of Parliament for the Newton Aycliffe and Spennymoor constituency.
I pay tribute to those who came before me.
The former Sedgefield constituency makes up the majority of the new seat.
In addition, we have taken Spennymoor and Tudhoe wards from Bishop Aukland, and Coxhoe ward from City of Durham.
I wish to put on record my thanks and pay tribute to Paul Howell and Dehenna Davison for their public service, and to my hon.
Friend  the Member for City of Durham (Mary Kelly Foy)  for her continuing dedication to her constituents.
Unlike some former Members of this House, I am not fluent in Latin, but I am assured that the motto of my hometown translates as “Not the Least, but the Greatest we seek.”
This has not only served as a powerful statement of intent for the new town of Aycliffe since 1947, but captures the shared spirit of the towns and villages across this new constituency—varied in history, but united in a desire to get on, to do well, to strive for a better future.
My own family’s story is testament to this spirit of aspiration that has long defined the working people of our country.
Several generations ago, both sides of my family were drawn from mining villages across England to the Durham coalfields because of their reputation for good wages and reliable work.
In turn, my grandparents moved from pit villages to Aycliffe new town, home for two years to the late Lord Beveridge, in search of modern housing and better jobs for their children.
My parents’ generation then worked hard to give us the opportunities that they never had, including higher education, the chance to work across the country and across the world and personal freedoms to flourish.
This ethos—that each generation raises the next, that background be no barrier, and that opportunity be distributed as widely as talent—is the driving force in families in my constituency and a lodestar for this Government.
But making that a reality requires strong economic growth across our country.
We must back the industries of the future, such as Hitachi Rail in my constituency, which manufactures world-class, green trains, and employs 700 highly skilled workers and another 1,500 in the supply chain.
I thank a former Member of this House,  Phil Wilson, for his tireless campaign, alongside The Northern Echo, which led to the plant being located in the area some years ago.
I am also grateful for the public commitments made by my right hon.
Friends the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and the Transport Secretary to support Hitachi’s future.
I look forward to working with them to secure those jobs and expand high-tech manufacturing more widely.
That includes the innovative work at Sedgefield’s NETPark.
This Durham University spin-off hub develops innovative products in satellite technology, drug development and biological weapon detection, which are then exported around the globe.
The creation of jobs in the industries of the future is particularly important in a constituency with former mining communities, where ongoing economic development is badly needed.
I do not want the House to think that my constituency is all work and no play.
We are famous for the Sedgefield ball game—a historic Shrove Tuesday tradition not for the faint-hearted.
We are home to excellent football clubs, including Newton Aycliffe, where my parents served on the committee, and Spennymoor Town.
Spennymoor itself typifies our rich cultural history, with a heritage trail dedicated to Norman Cornish, one of the pitmen painters, who learned his craft alongside his mining in the Spennymoor settlement.
Some of the best brass bands in the country can also been found in the constituency.
They not only keep alive the cultural traditions of our past, but provide excellent, high-quality music education for new generations of young people today.
We are also home to incredible local produce, including artisan chocolate made in Coxhoe, and award-winning real ale brewed at the Surtees Arms in Ferryhill—I have personally quality-assured the latter on several occasions.
On the topic of ale, my predecessor Tony Blair was noted for hosting world leaders in pubs across the constituency.
I have yet to find a pub without a photo of the former Prime Minister and his closest NATO allies, but my diligent search continues.
Finally, I am proud of our thriving community organisations.
The Ladder Centre does invaluable work to support residents, and the Cornforth Partnership is a lifeline for those looking to get back into work.
Just as Durham coal powered our economy in the past, so constituencies such as mine can power our modern economy, with high-tech, green manufacturing and research.
Let me return to where I began—“Not the Least, but the Greatest we seek.”
Mr Deputy Speaker, in this House, let us commit ourselves to seek the greatest—the very best—for our constituents, for our communities and for our great nation.
I look forward to seeing the economic measures in the King’s Speech start to spread wealth, growth and opportunity to every corner of this United Kingdom, including the people of Newton Aycliffe and Spennymoor.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Newton Aycliffe and Spennymoor (Alan Strickland)  on his maiden speech.
I do not think that we crossed over at university, but mutual  friends tell me that he was an excellent president of the Oxford Student Union.
We can tell that his debating skills were honed there, and we saw that in evidence this evening.
I want to express my gratitude to the people of the new Farnham and Bordon constituency for placing their trust in me and for allowing me the honour to represent them here in Parliament.
I feel that giving a maiden speech is a bit like giving a best man’s speech at a wedding, as you are surrounded by disapproving elderly relatives who are going to hang on every word, but I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that none of the jokes that I have made before in any best man’s speeches will be given in this House, especially as I know that my mother-in-law is watching on the Parliament channel.
I also wish to thank my family—especially my wife, Caroline, and my daughters, Susannah and Lucy, who have put up with me a lot over the past year—for their patience and support, as well as my parents, James and Theresa.
Other hon.
Members have noted that they are not the first people in their family to be Members of Parliament.
I am not even the first sibling to be a Member of Parliament.
I pay tribute to my brother, Alexander, who served the people of the Rother Valley constituency so diligently in the previous Parliament.
Apparently, it is also customary to express gratitude to our predecessors in the seat—a small political obituary, as it were.
Fortunately, both my immediate predecessors, my right hon.
Friends the Members for Godalming and Ash (Jeremy Hunt) and for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds), are still, as Members can see, very much in their political prime.
None the less, I want to thank them for their generous support and advice since I was selected.
They have both achieved amazing things for the constituents whom I have inherited.
Campaigning was a sobering affair.
On the doorsteps I was told: “Oh, we do like Jeremy”, or “Damian did such wonderful stuff for us”, or “You have very big shoes to fill”.
To rub salt into the wound, the week before the election, the local paper ran a story on how much the people of Haslemere would miss the shadow Chancellor—believe me, I know my place.
Speaking of predecessors, the predecessor of my right hon.
Friend the Member for East Hampshire, Lord Arbuthnot, should be praised for his sterling work on the Horizonscandal and for bringing justice to the sub-postmasters so cruelly affected.
I still hope that those who were responsible—by act or omission—are brought to justice.
The newly created Farnham and Bordon is a county constituency crossing Surrey and Hampshire, making the life of a new Member of Parliament even more complex than it already is.
More than that, the name, while referencing the two largest towns in each county, ignores the other towns of Haslemere and Liphook and the many villages that range between the larger population centres.
Many argued for, and I supported, a less specific but more all-encompassing name for the constituency, such as the Wey Valley, taking its name from the beautiful River Wey that runs through it.
Clearly they are not romantics in the Boundary Commission, so Farnham and Bordon stuck.
The only saving grace is that its initials spell FAB, which sums up the area that I represent.
This “FAB” constituency ranges from Farnham in the north to Haslemere and Liphook in the south, Whitehill and Bordon in the west, and the western villages of Surrey, such as Tilford, in the east.
Bookended by the north and south downs, it is an area of outstanding beauty, with thriving market towns, pleasant villages, and a thriving sports and arts scene, including the prestigious University for the Creative Arts.
It also has a significant military connection, most obviously in Bordon, which was home to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers until 2015 and is home to the Longmoor ranges, where Ukrainian troops are being trained.
Military history is everywhere, from Amesbury school in Haslemere and Hindhead, where Montgomery lived during the war, to the Canadian war graves and memorial in Liphook, and the site of the first-ever two-minute silence in this country on Castle Street in Farnham.
The residents of this new constituency are ever thankful for the role that our armed forces have played in keeping us safe.
From Arthur Conan Doyle to Jonny Wilkinson, King John to Flora Thompson, and Graham Thorpe to  the hon.
Member for Boston and Skegness (Richard Tice) , heroes and villains have been born, lived, worked and played in this fabulous constituency, but it is not the beautiful scenery, the historic gems, or the famous people who make this constituency the best in the country.
It is not even the fact that my grandparents ran Stafford’s sweet shop in Haslemere for many years—what little boy would not want grandparents who ran a sweet shop?
It is the current residents, businesses and community spirit that make FAB special, and a joy to represent.
Every day there are local events, charitable occasions and community festivities to get involved with.
Indeed, I doubt that anywhere else in this country can rival the number of duck races in the area.
Following that Cook’s tour of the constituency, one might be forgiven for thinking that there are no issues to solve—a home counties garden of Eden.
It of course cannot be denied that there are many areas of significant affluence, but it should not be concealed that there are areas of high deprivation, and I will champion their improvement.
The constituency’s location is both a benefit and a curse.
Within easy commuting distance of London, it provides a rural haven for those who wish to live outside but work in the city.
That also makes it rich pickings for housing developers who look for any open space, green or otherwise, to build on.
I am not against housing development—we need homes for our children and grandchildren—but we need the right homes in the right places, with the right tenure mix and with the supporting infrastructure.
Conservative-run East Hampshire district council has done everything that it can to persuade the new Government to modify their housing targets to make them more appropriate for our area, including writing to the Deputy Prime Minister.
I hope that she will respond positively.
Indeed, if there is one issue that unites the whole of the new Farnham and Bordon constituency, it is that infrastructure has not kept pace with development.
That is particularly acute in Bordon, where thousands of houses are going up without the supporting infrastructure.
The GP surgeries, the NHS dentists, the schools, the roads and the leisure centres all need upgrading and expanding rapidly to meet that housing growth.
We must not build more houses until infrastructure catches up.
Otherwise we will be left with housing estates devoid of services, security and society.
I am deeply concerned about the new Government’s plans on house building.
Labour’s changes to planning, imposing top-down targets and removing the rights of local people to have their say on developments, is a retrograde step that has been met with anger from my constituents and resolute opposition from me.
I mentioned the need for health services in our area.
Having spent most of my career in healthcare, latterly working for seven years in the NHS, improving clinical services and patient outcomes, I know that both locally and nationally things need to change in the NHS.
We need to have a grown-up and honest discussion with the public about how we are going to deliver, provide and fund the NHS and social care going forwards.
For an ageing population with increasing healthcare needs and diminishing birth rates—that is, the people who are going to pay for the NHS—we need a cross-party discussion that brings all parties together to make long-term decisions on how we proceed with health and social care in this country.
If I achieve nothing else in my time here, starting that conversation, and hopefully progressing it fruitfully, will be something to hope for.
As a traditional, common-sense Conservative, I believe that we cannot pay for health and social care unless we have a strong economy.
Despite a global pandemic, a war in the east of Europe and instability in the middle east, and regardless of the picture that the Government are trying to paint in their press releases, the most recent statistics show that the economy is turning around and is on an upward trajectory.
I will oppose any measures by this Government, including the misguided nationalisation of industry and the socialist labour rules, that I believe will hamper or reverse that trend.
Equally important is to safeguard ourselves from external threats.
The rise of a resurgent Russia, China and North Korea is something that we should all be concerned about.
I do not believe that it is hyperbole to say that we are in a pre-war era, and we need to ensure that our borders, skies and infrastructure, both physical and digital, are safe from threats.
That is why I absolutely believe that we should move to 2.5% of GDP spent on defence immediately, and increase that to 3% when practical.
In short, we must protect our economy, healthcare and national security to ensure the prosperity and safety of our country, but mindful that maiden speeches are not meant to be controversial, I shall leave it there and return briefly to the subject of my FAB constituency.
In 1668, Samuel Pepys recorded that the people of Liphook were “good, honest people”.
Given his own morals and motivations, I am not sure whether he meant that as a compliment, but I assure the House that it is as true now as it was then for the residents of Farnham, Bordon, Haslemere, Liphook and our surrounding villages, and I pledge to be a good, honest servant of them in this place.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank  the hon.
Member for Farnham and Bordon  (Gregory Stafford)  for describing his constituency so passionately.
While we may strongly disagree on the need for growth and new development in this country, we may agree more on the future of our NHS, and I look forward to working together on that ambition.
I am a proud Londoner, and like many Londoners I was not actually born here; I am delighted to share with you that I was born in Manchester and my family comes from Lancashire.
In fact, for most of my childhood I was aware of only one football team—the Bolton Wanderers—but for the last 42 years London has been my home, and the chance to represent my home city is truly a special honour.
I put on record my thanks to the residents of the Cities of London and Westminster for placing their trust in me as their representative.
I start by thanking Nickie Aiken for her service.
She is a pioneer, as the first woman to represent the Cities of London and Westminster, and is remembered fondly by many residents.
She has shown me kindness and offered her advice, for which I am grateful.
I know that here and across the constituency she will be remembered for her tireless work campaigning to regulate pedicabs, and her work to end the Vagrancy Act 1824 and deliver the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024.
I also pay tribute to my good friend Karen Buck, who represented the St John’s Wood neighbourhood wards of Abbey Road and Regent’s Park, which joined the two Cities constituency in the recent boundary review.
When walking through Westminster with Karen, it is hard to find anyone in her constituency who does not know her and has not been helped by her.
Through her tireless casework for tens of thousands of constituents, and her Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018, Karen has made an outstanding contribution to lives in Westminster and beyond.
She is a fearless representative and campaigner and a kind and wise friend.
I am so grateful for her advice, and will do my very best to live up to her high standards.
From 1977 to 2001, the two Cities were represented by Peter Brooke, who is remembered for his work as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and later as the Secretary of State for National Heritage.
Finally, I also remember J. S. Mill, who represented the City of Westminster from 1865 to 1868, and who in 1866 became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote.
I hope that he would be happy to see Nickie, Karen and I delivering on his pioneering work for equality here in the two Cities.
Truly, when a woman is tired of London she is tired of life.
The Cities of London and Westminster are home to great cultural institutions: the national gallery, the royal opera house, the commercial centres of Oxford Street and Edgware Road, innovative start-ups alongside major international corporations, the Government here in Westminster and Whitehall, the international financial centre of the City of London, the beautiful Hyde Park, Regent’s Park and St James’s Park alongside the residential squares of Belgravia and Marylebone, and yes, Buckingham Palace.
Many Members will know the neighbourhoods of Soho, Fitzrovia and Covent Garden as places to spend a night out.
In fact, tens of thousands of people live here.
We have St Bartholomew’s, one of London’s oldest churches, Bevis Marks, the oldest practising synagogue in the UK, and London Central Mosque.
Just minutes away from Parliament we have the Peabody estates of  Westminster, the pioneering and beautifully designed Churchill Gardens and Lillington and Longmore estates, the architectural delights of the Barbican, Golden Lane and the historic communities of Petticoat Square and the Guinness estate in Portsoken ward.
All those places are home to diverse communities living side by side, but also to inequality and injustice, and the struggle to find a stable, affordable and decent home is holding people in my constituency back from meeting their potential.
That struggle is holding our city and our country back from meeting our potential.
Tackling the housing crisis has brought me into politics, and this debate on the King’s Speech proposals for economic growth is an important time to highlight the situation that many of my constituents face.
Nearly 20 years ago, I worked at the Treasury on the Barker review of planning.
It is with sadness that I note that we are still not delivering the homes we need.
I am determined that this Government will deliver on our promise to build more affordable homes.
Ending no-fault evictions will bring certainty and security for the approximately 40% of households in the Cities of London and Westminster who are renting privately.
Our cross-Government strategy will put Britain back on track to ending homelessness, rough sleeping and temporary accommodation, which have been rising here for years and are harming so many.
I am grateful to organisations such as The Passage and The Connection here in the two Cities for doing so much to support vulnerable people.
The Cities of London and Westminster has one of the highest proportions of leasehold homes in the country.
Residential leasehold is trapping tenants with unaccountable landlords, and I am pleased the Government have pledged a leasehold and commonhold reform Bill.
It is characteristic of such an international place that global patterns affect our local communities.
The rise of short-term letting and the risk of dirty money in property are contributing to a loss of homes for Londoners, and as their representative here I am determined to tackle that.
I will be standing up for our local hospital and St Mary’s in Paddington, and continuing our campaign to secure funding for the redevelopment of London’s major trauma centre.
The story of the two Cities is one that is optimistic, outward-looking, hard-working and driven.
I hope to continue to represent this place in that fashion.
I am the first Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament to ever represent this historic constituency, and I join colleagues in closing with a pledge to approach this new Parliament with a renewed commitment to respectful debate and disagreement.
Elections are a time to make a choice.
Now that a decision has been made, it is time to move forward with a relentless focus on public service and delivery.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I am grateful to you for calling me to make my maiden speech during this King’s Speech debate on the economy, welfare and public services.
I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Halifax (Kate Dearden)  on her maiden speech.
As a former officer in the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, her constituency has deep links with my former regiment, and indeed its antecedent regiments, the 33rd and 76th of Foot.
It is fantastic to hear new Members on both sides of the House speak so passionately and eloquently about their constituencies.
I speak as the first new Member of Parliament for Huntingdon since 2001, but I am only the third Member in my lifetime, and the fourth Member since the second world war.
It is therefore an enormous privilege to have been elected to represent the constituency, and I am honoured to have been voted for by my constituents to follow such a long-serving Member of  Parliament.
My predecessor Jonathan Djanogly served the House and his constituents for some 23 years.
In Parliament he served on the Trade and Industry Committee, as Solicitor General and as a shadow Business Minister.
In government, he was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Justice.
My predecessor’s proudest achievements came from the work that he delivered locally.
His work on tackling flooding from the River Great Ouse saw significant flood alleviation projects delivered in St Ives and the Hemingfords, and further upstream in Godmanchester.
That work has saved thousands from the crippling impact of flood damage on homes and businesses.
I intend to build on that, delivering further flooding solutions across the constituency for villages such as Alconbury, Abbots Ripton, Wistow, Kimbolton, Broughton and Earith.
My predecessor is also rightly proud of his work in facilitating the delivery of both the A14 and the A428—road infrastructure projects that have transformed travel across Cambridgeshire, and stand to greatly enhance the region in its position at the tip of the UK innovation corridor.
The development has set the conditions for Huntingdon’s future growth, offering the opportunity for better jobs and taking advantage of the Cambridge cluster and expansion across the region, meaning that Huntingdon can be a business hub in its own right, not just a dormitory town for London and Cambridge.
Despite the growth that Huntingdon has seen over the past 60 years, first via the post-war London overspill and now via expansive development, the constituency is still characterised by its thriving towns and vibrant villages.
From the market towns of Huntingdon and St Ives to our rural villages, from Sawtry to Somersham, Houghton to Hamerton, Covington to Colne and Pidley to Perry—and three dozen others that will not stretch to my tortured alliteration—each has their own character and identity.
Huntingdonshire is a region with a rich history, and one that it will be a privilege to steward.
That history extends to some of my other predecessors.
Many Members will be aware that Huntingdon is the seat of a former Prime Minister, Sir John Major, who is still held in the highest regard across the constituency.
It was an honour to receive his endorsement during the recent election campaign.
Famously, it is also the former seat of the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell.
Cromwell was the Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1628 for just over a year until Charles I dissolved Parliament.
Records show that he made just one speech in that time—so far, so equal.
It is clear that Huntingdon expects a certain level of stature from its Members of Parliament.
Notable as Sir John Major and Oliver Cromwell surely are, arguably they are not Huntingdon’s most famous product.
It is not even the celebrated diarist Samuel Pepys, who attended Huntingdon Grammar School.
In fact, that accolade should be awarded to a lunch-time staple that everyone is familiar with; one that everyone has a favourite version of; and one that some Members may well have had for lunch this very day.
John Montagu, three times First Lord of the Admiralty, Postmaster General and Secretary of State, is not notable for his political career or his colourful social life.
John Montagu, whose family home was Hinchingbrooke House in Huntingdon, is best known today—somewhat arcanely—by his title and the moniker bestowed upon  his favourite snack to consume during long sessions at the card table.
Such was the popularity of said snack that other card players also wished to order it.
They would cry, “I’ll have the same as Sandwich.”
It obvious where this is going.
John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, was not prepared to break from the card table to eat, so would ask his servants to bring him slices of salted beef between two pieces of toasted bread.
Yes, among its formidable political alumni, Huntingdon can also lay claim to a genuine global culinary revolution, described by The Wall Street Journal no less as Britain’s “biggest contribution to gastronomy”.
Huntingdon is the birthplace of the modern sandwich—every day is a school day.
I digress.
Huntingdon’s rich history is also characterised by an inextricable link to service via its long relationship with military aviation, initially through the Royal Flying Corps and subsequently during the second world war through RAF Bomber Command’s Pathfinder force and the United States army air force’s 303rd bombardment group.
On  4 July 1942 , the US eighth air force flew the first American mission over Nazi-occupied Europe from RAF Molesworth.
Latterly, during the cold war, RAF Alconbury saw the US air force provide covert high-altitude reconnaissance along the East German border in a new variant of its famed U-2 spy plane, in addition to providing battlefield damage assessment in the event of a nuclear strike.
Most of that base is now Huntingdon’s newest housing estate, Alconbury Weald—surely the only housing development in the country with fully functional nuclear decontamination and washdown facilities.
RAF Warboys, RAF Upwood and RAF Brampton have all since disappeared, but the constituency still retains those links.
RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth are still operated by the United States air force, and RAF Wyton is on the cutting edge of our defence intelligence capability.
Those links carry through into the constituency itself and it is striking just how many veterans have made their home within its boundaries.
One in nine households within Huntingdon are home to a veteran, a staggering number when compared with other constituencies and a community that, as a British Army veteran myself, I am proud to represent as their Member of Parliament—even if to many of those RAF veterans I am just a Pongo.
I know well how important it is to support our veterans’ community and to commit to improving veterans’ welfare.
Having undergone the process myself, the transition from service to civilian life has its challenges, and there are many stories of both success and failure.
I served on a veterans advisory and pensions committee and know well how important it is to ensure that veterans are able to access the services they need.
Veterans’ identity cards have helped to open those pathways for many who would otherwise struggle to evidence their service, but I hope the Government will look closely at how support itself is provided.
Restructuring Veterans UK and creating a more comprehensive holistic offering, easing access via an overhauled veterans gateway, could streamline access to the welfare services that our veterans need.
