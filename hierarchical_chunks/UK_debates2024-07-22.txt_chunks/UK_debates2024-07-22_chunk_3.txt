I thank the electors of North Durham for voting for me to represent them in this House.
I promise that I will always fight for their interests, and I could not want to represent a finer constituency.
I follow into the House the right hon.
Kevan Jones.
He is an extremely tough act to follow, and I wish him well both in overcoming his health troubles and in his new role, having been elevated to the other place.
Kevan was elected MP for North Durham in 2001, and served the constituency and this House with distinction for 23 years.
He was utterly committed to the defence and security of our country, serving as a Defence Minister, with multiple stints on the Defence Committee.
He was the longest-serving member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, a vice-president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and a commissioner of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
That is highly appropriate, given the number of veterans in the North Durham constituency—particularly people associated with the Durham Light Infantry.
