Mr. Speaker, in this world there are those who dream of a better world and those who actively work to make it so, and Pam was the rare blend of both.
In Pam's world, neighbors looked after each other no matter what, and strangers were merely friends she had yet to meet.
Her unexpected passing leaves a deep void in the hearts and lives of so many, and I send my deepest condolences to her family, friends, and all who knew and loved her.
May her memory live on in every step we actively take toward a kinder, more inclusive community.
Everyone was welcome in Pam's heart and in her home, so it is fitting that her legacy will forever be remembered.
