Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, the Coppell Fire Department.
Due to a power failure at the Village Parkway Pump Station earlier this year, the City of Coppell announced a Boil Water Notice and requested that residents and businesses only use water in emergency situations.
The Coppell Fire Department's Emergency Management and Public Works team leapt into action and helped restore power to the water pump, all during a brutal Texas heatwave.
The department offered multi-faceted assistance, from staffing the Emergency Operations Center, providing heat rehab support at the distribution point, transporting water from local vendors to the public library, on top of the normal daily operational items.
I'd like to thank the Coppell Fire Department for their quick response and service to the residents of Texas-24 by helping make Coppell's water safe to drink again.
