Ms. WILLIAMS.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Dr. William H. Boone on his retirement from the illustrious Atlanta-based HBCU Clark Atlanta University, his appointment as Professor Emeritus, and thank him for his impact on the people of Georgia's Fighting Fifth District.
Called the ``Dean of Atlanta City Politics,'' Dr. Boone has spent the last 40 years researching, advising, and commentating on Atlanta political life and Black political power across the South.
He earned the respect of his peers and colleagues, serving as Assistant Provost, Dean of Graduate Studies, and the Chair of the Political Science Department at Clark Atlanta University as well as a president of the National Conference.
Dr. Boone's talent as an educator is evident by the students he has produced.
The people of Atlanta, of Georgia, and of the South have greatly benefited from the thoughtful, critical, and thorough analysis and scholarship Dr. Boone and his students have produced and will continue to produce for decades.
As we all know, Atlanta Influences Everything, especially Black political power.
Dr. Boone's focus on Black politics has improved our understanding of our own community and America's understanding of the cultural and political factors that inform and shape our present.
Dr. Boone takes his role as a leader in Black intellectual thought seriously.
He always aims to be unapologetic when looking at the Black experience in this country, and to critically examine how the American experience affects Black people.
And he always makes sure to connect training and education to activism; to fighting for our community.
Congratulations to the Dean of Atlanta City Politics, Dr. William Boone.
The people of Georgia's 5th Congressional District have learned so much from him for the last 40 years, and we will continue to learn from him and those lucky enough to learn from him, for decades more to come.
I hope he enjoys his retirement.
