Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Jeff Williams.
In 2012, Jeff founded Taste Project, an organization that provides meals in Fort Worth to those in need.
Jeff knew what food scarcity felt like growing up in a family of 4 where both of his parents worked hard to keep food on the table even though money was tight.
When he was younger, his parents would sometimes skip meals to make sure him and his sister had dinner.
Jeff's upbringing gave him the idea to create a place where members of the community could go to always get an affordable meal.
In 2017, the Taste Project opened a pay-what-you-can community restaurant in Fort Worth, the Taste Community Restaurant, where diners can pay as little as a penny for a meal.
Beyond the restaurant, the Taste Project empowers and provides hope to North Texans through culinary classes, job training programs, and even a community garden that helps teach people gardening skills.
In the last 6 years, Jeff and Taste Community Restaurant have helped more than 150,000 people and are currently serving more than 1,000 people a week.
Jeff and his team work hard every day to make sure they help as many people as possible.
I'd like to thank Jeff for his dedication to serving the people and families.
