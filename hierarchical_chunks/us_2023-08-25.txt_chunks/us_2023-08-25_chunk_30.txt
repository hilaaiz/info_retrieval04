Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Teresita Batayola for receiving lifetime achievement awards from the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO) and the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).
Over the years, I have had the immense privilege of witnessing Teresita's tireless work to improve health outcomes for refugee, immigrant, and underserved communities in Washington's Ninth District and across the Puget Sound region.
Teresita's career as the President and CEO of the International Community Health Services (ICHS) was remarkable.
She helped transform ICHS from just 2 clinics into a growing regional health care network that continues to provide comprehensive care to over 27,000 patients.
Teresita's work went beyond just leading ICHS for 18 years.
During her tenure at ICHS, she also took on leadership roles at the local and national level to help expand access to health care and other services for those that need it most.
Her dedication to expanding health care access in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities led her to serve on the AAPCHO's Board of Directors for well over a decade.
Her years of steadfast leadership has been instrumental in advancing the resources and capacity of community health centers across the country, building a legacy that communities will continue to benefit from for decades to come.
These lifetime achievement awards from AAPCHO and NACHC are a well-deserved testament to that legacy and to Teresita's exemplary service.
