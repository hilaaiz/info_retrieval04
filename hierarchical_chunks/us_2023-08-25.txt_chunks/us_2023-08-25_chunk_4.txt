Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Sergeant Paul R. Daw, a Vietnam War veteran and upstanding constituent of New York's 21st District.
Paul was raised in Long Island, New York.
After graduating high school, he joined the United States Army, serving for 2 years in the Vietnam War from July 1969 to May 1971.
Sergeant Daw was stationed in Vietnam as an Eleven-Bravo infantryman alongside his fellow men with the 1st Cavalry Division, Ranger Company A.
For his service, Sergeant Daw was highly decorated.
Upon his honorable discharge in 1971, Sergeant Daw earned a Bronze Star with 2 oak leaf clusters, a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Army Accommodation Medal for Valor, and the Good Conduct Medal.
After returning home to Long Island from Vietnam, Sergeant Daw joined the New York Police Department, where he served for 21 and a half years as an officer of the law.
Off the force, Sergeant Daw also supported his community as a volunteer firefighter until his retirement from the NYPD in 2003, at which time he moved upstate to the North Country.
In his retirement, Sergeant Daw has taken time to focus on his family life.
He and his wife
