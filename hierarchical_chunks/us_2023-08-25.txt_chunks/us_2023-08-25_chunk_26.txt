His passion for sports, particularly hockey, became the heartbeat of his life.
DJ generously shared his love for the game by dedicating his time to the Youth Hockey League, where he not only nurtured young talents but also found immense joy.
To both the youths he mentored and the family he deeply cherished, DJ brought a lighthearted sense of humor and an essence of selflessness, dependability, and respect for others.
DJ will be remembered for his legacy of service, care, and joy.
He is survived by his loving father Dennis; his devoted mother, Kimberly; and his 2 adoring sisters, Cassandra and Hanna.
DJ was, and is, well-loved and highly respected amongst his family and community, and his memory will not soon be forgotten.
I pray that his loved ones may be comforted as they mourn his loss.
