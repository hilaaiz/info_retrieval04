Mr. Speaker, Willis Rockwood is a man who has spent his long and fruitful life deeply devoted to his family, his friends, his country, and his faith.
Those who know and love him fondly refer to him as their ``National Treasure,'' and I assert that he is just that.
On the occasion of his 100th birthday, I salute his life of service, and want to reflect our community, our state, and our Nation's gratitude for all he has contributed and constructed.
