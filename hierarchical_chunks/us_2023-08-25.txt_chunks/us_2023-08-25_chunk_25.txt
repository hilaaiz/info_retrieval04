Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the life of Staff Sgt.
Darren James ``DJ'' Breton, who has recently passed away at age 32, and to honor his service to the Nation.
Born in Wiesbaden, Germany, DJ embarked on a remarkable journey that took him across the globe and led him to proudly serve his country through his role as a crew chief in the United States Air Force.
