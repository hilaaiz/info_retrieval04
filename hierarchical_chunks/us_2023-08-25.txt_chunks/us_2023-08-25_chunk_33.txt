Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the incredible victory of the West Suburban Little League Softball Team on winning their second straight state championship this season.
Under the leadership of team manager Dave Lynch this incredible team comprised of members from schools such as Westmont, Biship McCort, and Richland have worked together achieve an incredible level of success.
As our students continue to participate in organized sports they learn valuable skills including teamwork, dedication, and good sportsmanship.
Even in the face of adversity, the Red Rage players came together and found a way to win time after time.
Congratulations to the entire West Suburban Softball Team including Addy Dunbar, Kylie Durst, Bella Kist, Sienna Kubic, Alea Ladika, Elleigh Ladika, Cali Lynch, Kelsie Muto, Audra Rudolph, LaMya Stephens, Kristin Stiles and Elizabeth Veranese on their hard work and dedication.
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I congratulate the West Suburban Little League Softball Team on their victory, and wish them every continued success.
