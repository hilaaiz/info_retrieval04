Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my friend, Craig Allen Keith, who passed away at Parkview Regional Medical Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on August 14, 2023.
Craig was born in Van Wert, Ohio on May 31, 1976.
He was a 1994 graduate of Crestview High School in Convoy, Ohio, and earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from Indiana Wesleyan University in 2003.
A consummate professional in domestic and international travel for 20 years, Craig served as Senior Commercial Account Project Manager at SIRVA BGRS Worldwide, Inc. Craig attended Abundant Life Church for 30 years and held several leadership positions.
He loved his church unconditionally and served the Lord with gladness all his days.
Craig loved entertaining and spending time with his friends and family.
While grilling and smoking meats or baking his (in)famous chocolate chip cookies, he would tell jokes and fill the air with his full, boisterous laughter.
Craig was an avid traveler who loved learning the history of the many destinations he visited.
He sang loudly, off key, and with all his heart, in church and to the gospel music he loved so much.
Craig will be immensely missed and forever loved by all.

He is survived by his children, Gentry and Pierson Keith; mother, Sheila (Vince) Stone of Columbia City, IN; father, Leroy (Karen) Keith.
