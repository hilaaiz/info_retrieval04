Ms. STRICKLAND.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Trenton Brazie, an Army veteran who continues to answer the call of service everyday as a firefighter, Emergency Medical Technician, and CPR public education instructor here in our South Sound community.
During his decade-long career in the Army, Trenton was deployed 3 times, completing a combat tour in Afghanistan and peace tours in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
He also served with the 17th Field Artillery Brigade at Joint Base Lewis McChord, and served in roles that, in 10 years' time, increased in leadership responsibility, including team leader, squad leader, and platoon sergeant.
After the Army, Trenton reentered the civilian workforce with an eye towards community-centered service--he soon found himself with the Tumwater Fire Department, where he continues to work as a firefighter.
And his service doesn't stop with fighting fires--he works to prepare and protect the community by teaching CPR and serving as an Emergency Medical Technician.
Trenton is also pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Fire Service Administration at Eastern Oregon University, demonstrating his dedication to his own self-development as a public servant and emergency service professional.
As Washington continues to face a fierce fire season, I thank Trenton for his selfless service to our community and our country.
