I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend’s work on the Select Committee.
NHS England is assessing the situation and preparing contingency plans in case Jhoots becomes insolvent.
Such plans involve working with other local pharmacies and dispensing GP practices to ensure that patients continue to have access to medicines.
Continuity of care, as she rightly points out, must be at the heart of our response, and we are working at pace to ensure that is protected.
