I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I know just how important that school is to parents and children in his constituency, and share his determination to fix the broken SEND system.
That is why we have boosted investment in SEND to £12 billion, to put new facilities and tailored support in place for children who have long been failed.
We want decisions to be taken swiftly, and I will ask the schools Minister to update my hon.
Friend about that particular school.
