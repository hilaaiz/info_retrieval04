I thank the hon.
Member for those questions.
I would certainly be happy to meet Members who have Jhoots in their constituency and are affected.
I will update the House.
We are looking at strengthening the regulation, but there are some constraints on what I can say, because so much of this is now going through legal process.
There is pushback, and we do not want to do anything to jeopardise the legal action we are taking through the appeal process, so I will have to be relatively circumspect in what I say.
I am happy to have those discussions and to update the House.
