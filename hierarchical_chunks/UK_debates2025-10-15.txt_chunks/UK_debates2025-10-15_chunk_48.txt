I thank the hon.
Lady and pay tribute to her work as Chair of the Select Committee.
I am very proud of the fact that we delivered a £500 million uplift to pharmacy—19% across the two-year period.
It was the highest uplift of any sector, not just of my portfolio but the entire NHS.
I am also very proud of the fact that we are taking forward hub-and-spoke legislation to enable pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to operate at the top of their licence.
The day before yesterday we signed off on a statutory instrument to improve the ability of technicians to do more in the area of dispensing.
We are looking to empower the workforce and enable them to operate at the top of their licence.
That is a fundamental part of the shift from hospital to community that is at the heart of our 10-year plan.
