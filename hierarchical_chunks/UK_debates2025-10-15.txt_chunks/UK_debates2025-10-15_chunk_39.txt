May I first thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for West Dorset (Edward Morello)  for raising this appalling issue?
Pharmacies are at the heart of our communities and are relied upon by millions.
They are under increasing pressure across the country, where we are seeing irregular opening hours and unannounced closures.
Families living in communities that rely on Jhoots pharmacies, such as  those in the constituency of my hon.
Friend and many other parts of the country, will be deeply concerned that they and their loved ones could be about to be left without medicines that they desperately need.
Staff have been placed in an intolerable situation.
The National Pharmacy Association’s chief executive has said, as we have heard, that Jhoots risks damaging the reputation of community pharmacies.
The Government urgently need to grip this issue and ensure that patients and the staff of these pharmacies are not being let down.
Will the Minister and the Secretary of State agree to meet all the Members in this place whose communities are affected by potential closures?
Will he update the House at the earliest opportunity as to what steps he is taking to stabilise the crisis in community pharmacy across the country?
Is he confident that integrated care boards, which are distracted by 50% cuts to their budgets and top-down reorganisation, have the capacity to deal with this urgent situation as they head into planning for the next winter crisis?
