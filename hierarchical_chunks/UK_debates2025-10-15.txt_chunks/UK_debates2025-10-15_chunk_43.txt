This is a clear breach of contract, but I am told by our ICB that it does not fall within contract law.
The regulations are moot on this point, because the circumstances that Jhoots finds itself in were never envisaged when the regulations were written.
That is the problem that the Minister has identified.
There seems to be some timidity among officials and others on the overhanging threat of a judicial review, were the Government to act in extremis to introduce some urgency.
I urge the Minister to take that risk on behalf of all our constituents.
I certainly welcome his offer, following the suggestion of  the hon.
Member for North Shropshire (Helen Morgan) , that all Members of Parliament with constituents affected by this dire problem should be involved in meetings.
I look forward to that, so that we can provide timely advice, updates and support to our constituents, who are rightly worried.
I pay tribute to the Boots employees in the hon.
Member’s constituency where Jhoots is not providing the service that is required.
We appreciate that.
I can assure him that nothing is off the table.
He has rightly identified the problem with the regulatory framework, which is strong on pharmacists, pharmacists’ premises and pharmacy staff, but there is something of a gap when it comes to regulating pharmacy business owners.
That gap has been identified, and I have commissioned my officials to work on that at pace.
I will happily keep him updated on that work.
