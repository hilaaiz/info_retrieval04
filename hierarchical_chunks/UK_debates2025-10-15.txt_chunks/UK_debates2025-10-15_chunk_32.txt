Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.
As a pharmacist for nearly 20 years and the MP of North Somerset, I have the dubious pleasure of having two Jhoots pharmacies in the town of Portishead in my constituency.
I cannot say two operating pharmacies, because they have shuttered their doors, with reports of them not having paid their bills, their rent or their staff.
As a pharmacist, I know that this affects the perception and view of community pharmacy up and down the country.
What plans do the Minister and the Department have to ensure that bad actors in the pharmacy space—as Jhoots, in my opinion, appears to be—are dealt with more quickly and effectively under new legislation?
Order.
Questions should not be statements.
I pay tribute to my hon.
Friend’s direct professional expertise and experience as a pharmacist.
He is right to point to the fact that the regulatory framework is not as strong as it needs to be.
I have spoken with officials in my Department who have worked in the pharmacy sector for many years, and they have never seen behaviour like this before.
It is quite unprecedented.
Nevertheless, it is shining a light on the fact that we do not have a strong enough regulatory framework.
We need to look at the way that business owners are regulated.
There is strong regulation of pharmacists and pharmacy staff such as technicians, but business owners are not regulated as strongly as they could and should be.
My hon.
Friend is right that speed is also important, which is why we need to look at ways of fast-tracking particular cases where there is clear breach, because sometimes the appeal process can be very slow indeed.
We are looking at all of this in the round, and I have commissioned urgent advice from my officials to see how we can beef up the regulatory framework.
