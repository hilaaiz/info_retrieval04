I am confident that ICBs can take this forward.
In most cases across the country, our assessment is that there is a pharmacy within striking distance of a Jhoots, but certainly in those areas where there is not, that may require particular follow-up action.
My officials and I will be following up with those ICBs to ensure that the appropriate action is being taken.
Five members of staff from Jhoots pharmacy in Laceby Road have been to see me.
They have been going into work, but they have not been paid since July.
It is absolutely appalling.
Can the Minister set out what pressure he and the Department can bring to bear on this chain, which has now unfortunately closed its doors for good?
I agree with absolutely every word that my hon.
Friend has just said.
It is completely unacceptable that people are coming into work, doing an honest day’s work and then not receiving an honest day’s pay.
Unfortunately, there is a limit to what we can do, because pharmacies are private businesses and each employer is required to fulfil their legal obligations to pay their staff.
I recommend that the members of staff she mentions contact ACAS and their trade union the PDA, if they are not already in touch.
For those who are not members of that union, I strongly recommend joining a trade union and seeking legal advice from it.
That is a vital part of what trade unions do.
They need to take action to force Jhoots to do the right thing.
