My hon.
Friend has put her finger on an issue within all this, which is that if we are looking to bring in other pharmacies to replace Jhoots or, indeed, to take over a Jhoots store, we cannot do that in the latter case until such time as there is an insolvency and that business is no longer a going concern.
There is a process, set out in legislation, for opening new pharmacies.
Potential new pharmacy contractors can apply to open in an area and evidence how a new pharmacy can provide benefits for patients, but it is a challenge for them to make such a case if a Jhoots  pharmacy is still listed as open and providing services.
It is something of a Catch-22 situation.
We first have to resolve the issue with Jhoots and take the necessary action, and then we can see where we are with potential gaps in the market.
