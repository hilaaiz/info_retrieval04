I thank the Minister for his response.
Community pharmacies, such as Lodge pharmacy in Perry Common in my area, play a vital role and offer an excellent service, and that is why I am concerned when places such as Jhoots pharmacy close or, maybe, fold.
The winter months are coming, and I am passionate about winter measures.
How will we ensure that our pharmacies can offer the winter vaccines needed this year if we lose large chains, such as Jhoots?
