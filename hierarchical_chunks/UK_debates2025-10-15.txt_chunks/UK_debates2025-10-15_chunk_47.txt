The case of Jhoots is clearly hugely unfortunate given the incredible work that community pharmacies do up and down the country for our constituents.
I am pleased to hear the Minister say that this case will not negatively affect the funding settlement, but it is set against the backdrop of a very precarious sector where actors who want to do good by our communities and do a high-quality job often find that they simply cannot make ends meet, and bad actors find a way to move in.
When the Committee looked last at this issue, the workforce was a key plank to why the sector is not sustainable.
What update can the Minister give us on the inclusion of pharmacists in the workforce plan?
