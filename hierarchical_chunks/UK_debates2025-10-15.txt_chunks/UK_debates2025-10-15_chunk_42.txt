I thank my friend and neighbour,  the hon.
Member for West Dorset (Edward Morello) , for securing this urgent question.
I have exactly the same problem as he and  the hon.
Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) , but in Shaftesbury in my constituency.
I thank the staff of Boots, who are picking up such a huge amount of slack because Jhoots is not there.
There is a danger to the member of staff who is on duty, because there are prescribed drugs on the premises, and she is the only person there, and I worry for her safety.
What additional support can the Department give to existing providers, such as Boots, that are picking up the slack, particularly during the winter peak, in terms of advice to patients and administering vaccines?
