Only this weekend, the National Pharmacy Association chief executive, Henry Gregg, said that he is concerned that “reports of Jhoots Pharmacy branches across England failing patients risks damaging community pharmacy’s reputation and could imperil its ability to secure a good 2026-27 funding settlement.”
Communities across the country have been left without functioning pharmacies.
Doors have been locked without notice, patients have arrived to find no pharmacist, no prescriptions and no stock, and staff have gone unpaid and been threatened with the sack.
Jhoots Pharmacy faces allegations of not paying wages, having premises repossessed and serious regulatory breaches.
The General Pharmaceutical Council has already intervened several times, yet for many patients it is too late—they simply cannot get their medicines.
This is not an isolated business failure; it exposes a deeper fragility in the community pharmacy network on which local people depend for basics and often lifesaving care.
I have four questions for the Minister.
First, when was NHS England first made aware of these closures, and has the Minister met the Jhoots leadership?
If not, why not?
If he did, what was the outcome?
Secondly, has the Department assessed how many people have been left without local pharmacy access as a result of Jhoots’s actions, and what is the Minister doing to remedy this, considering it is happening across the country?
He mentioned ICBs, but there are several involved.
Thirdly, what mechanisms exist to ensure continuity of care when a contractor collapses or walks away?
Again, he mentioned ICBs, but is there a national contingency plan?
Finally, will the Government now review whether the current model, under which chains are expanding rapidly through acquisition and debt, is fit to safeguard community pharmacies in the long term?
Linked to that, can the Minister definitively confirm that the funding settlement has not been compromised?
The 10-year NHS plan states that it wants to move more care into the community, yet it is completely missing a delivery chapter on how to achieve that.
At the same time, we have issues such as Jhoots.
I hope the Minister will be taking steps to investigate this issue in its entirety and to safeguard against this type of incident happening again, and will spell out the delivery aspect of the 10-year plan.
