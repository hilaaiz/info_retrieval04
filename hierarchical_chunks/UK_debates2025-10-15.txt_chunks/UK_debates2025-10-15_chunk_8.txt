The Secretary of State said yesterday that his new legacy commission will not relitigate previous investigations involving veterans unless there are “compelling reasons” to do so.
That is reinforced in clause 30 of the Bill that has now been published.
To remove scope from opportunistic lawyers, would he consider defining far more closely than he has done up to this point precisely what he means by “compelling reasons”?
That is no doubt an issue that the House will discuss as the Bill is considered in detail.
I think that “compelling” and “essential” is a pretty high bar.
It will be for the commission to interpret that, but no doubt we will continue to discuss it.
