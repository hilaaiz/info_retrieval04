I thank the Prime Minister for his strong words at our party conference in calling for unity at a time when many feel that our country is divided, and in rightly calling out racism.
I am a second-generation immigrant, born in this country, and people like me and so many of our constituents have every right to be here.
No one should face hatred because of the colour of their skin.
Does the Prime Minister agree that some of those on the Opposition Benches who seek to stoke division and keep close company with those who accept Russian bribes cannot and should not be trusted to govern this country?
