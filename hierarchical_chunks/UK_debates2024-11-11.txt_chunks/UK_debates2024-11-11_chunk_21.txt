I welcome the Government’s decision to provide more than £1 billion in new funding for the household support fund, extending it all the way through next year, and to give much more notice to the local authorities that deliver it.
The funding is so important not just to countless vulnerable residents, but to great local organisations, such as the Need Project food banks in my constituency.
How will the Department work with local authorities to make the most of the notice and to ensure the funding goes as far as possible?
