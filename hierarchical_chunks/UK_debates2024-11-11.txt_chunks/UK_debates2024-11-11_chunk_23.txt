I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing this matter to the House, and I pay tribute to all those he has worked with to understand the challenge that we face.
He is right that we will take this forward through the “Get Britain Working” White Paper.
Citizens Advice is playing an important role in supporting that work, and the work of the child poverty taskforce.
