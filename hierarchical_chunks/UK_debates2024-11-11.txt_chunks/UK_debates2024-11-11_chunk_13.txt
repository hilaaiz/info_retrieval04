The Minister mentions the equality assessment.
That was a high-level equality assessment that was only dragged out of the Government in response to a freedom of information request.
The fact is that they are avoiding accountability for this policy and avoiding scrutiny by the House.
The Government are saying that the impact of the cut on the poorest pensioners will be mitigated by pension credit, and we have heard from the Minister about the very small numbers who are taking up pension credit in response to this announcement.
Their own figures predict that fully a third of eligible pensioners—that is 750,000 of the poorest people in the country—will not get pension credit and will not get the winter fuel payment.
That is what the Government are banking on.
That is how they are making the savings that they predict from this policy: by cutting benefits to some of the poorest people in our country—[Interruption.]
The Minister shakes her head, so she might want to put me right.
Does she want all eligible pensioners to claim pension credit?
[Interruption.]
The Secretary of State says yes.
If she does want that, does she then accept that the Government’s savings from this policy will be completely wiped out?
Yes, and no.
