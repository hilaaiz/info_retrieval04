On Armistice Day, it is important that we as a Chamber reflect on the Royal British Legion and its “Credit their Service” campaign.
This is a campaign to ensure that when benefits are calculated, military compensation is disregarded.
In the light of this, will the Secretary of State give serious consideration to disregarding military compensation when calculating pension credit?
I associate myself with the hon.
Gentleman’s comments and those of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State.
I will look carefully at what the hon.
Gentleman has suggested and get back to him.
What steps she is taking to help reduce levels of poverty.
After 14 years of Conservative Government, 8 million adults and 4.3 million children were left in poverty.
Among other things, £240 million was recently announced in the Budget to support better work so that people can get the dignity of a good job and the security of a proper wage.
Details will soon be available, as the Secretary of State mentioned, in our “Get Britain Working” White Paper.
