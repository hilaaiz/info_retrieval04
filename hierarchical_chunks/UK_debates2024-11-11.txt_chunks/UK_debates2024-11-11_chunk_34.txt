I welcome the fact that 23 NATO nations will hit the 2% spend this year.
I regard that as a floor, not a ceiling.
The UK, under Governments of both parties, has always spent well above and set the pace for other European countries.
We will continue to do that, because European countries in NATO must take on more of the NATO leadership.
We are determined that the UK will do that, which is why we have said that our approach to defence will be a NATO-first policy.
We will, wherever we can, look to be first in NATO, so that we set the pace on the sort of transformation to the better equipped, better able and more lethal forces that our nations need to deter adversaries and to defend ourselves if required.
