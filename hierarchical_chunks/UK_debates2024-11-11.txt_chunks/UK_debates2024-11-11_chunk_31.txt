We live in an increasingly dangerous and volatile world, with hundreds of thousands of people dying or being injured on our own continent in Ukraine, and wars and conflicts raging in the middle east, Africa and beyond, not to mention the increased nefarious activity in the grey zone.
Without a shadow of a doubt, we are dealing with exceptional circumstances and we need to grasp the gravity of the situation.
I have a great deal of time and respect for the Secretary of State because I know that he gets it, but do others in government understand the gravity of the situation, because we need clarity?
We need a timetable so that not only our allies, but those in our defence community, know where we are heading.
Yes, they do.
Everyone agrees that defence spending must increase, and it is increasing under this Government.
It increased in the first Budget of this new Government by nearly £3 billion for next year.
Alongside that is the cast-iron commitment that we are a Government who will set a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence.
