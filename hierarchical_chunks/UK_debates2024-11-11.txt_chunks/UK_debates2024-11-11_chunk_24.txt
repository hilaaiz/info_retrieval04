What progress her Department has made on the pensions review.
I am leading the Government’s landmark pensions investment review, which aims to increase pensions investment in the UK economy and improve retirement outcomes for future pensioners.
An interim report will be published soon.
Phase 2 of the review, which will focus on pension adequacy, will be launched later this year.
David Carson and Patricia Kennedy, constituents of mine in Central Ayrshire, face massively reduced pensions payments from their pre-1997 contributions to their Hewlett Packard pension, because current legislation index-links contributions from 1997 only.
What assessment has the pensions review made so far of the challenges facing pension schemes, and will the Minister meet me to discuss David and Patricia’s case?
The issue affects some hundreds of thousands of people.
