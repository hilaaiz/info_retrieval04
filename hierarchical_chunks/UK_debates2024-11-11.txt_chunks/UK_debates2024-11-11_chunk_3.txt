The Minister from Northern Ireland is a member of our child poverty taskforce.
I hope to visit soon and the co-chair of the taskforce, the Secretary of State for Education, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) , also plans to visit.
We have introduced the new fair repayment rate to slash the level of universal credit deductions because, as food banks in my constituency have told me, that really pushes people into poverty.
That is not what the Government should be doing, and that is why we have taken action.
I look forward to coming to Northern Ireland to talk to the hon.
Gentleman, his constituents and the organisations fighting poverty to see what more we can do.
What assessment she has made of the adequacy of the personal independence payment application process.
The application process for personal independence payment is being kept under review.
An online process is being trialled and we are looking at further potential improvements.
One of my constituents in receipt of PIP is sight-impaired, deaf-blind registered and cannot use a phone or fill out forms.
Can the Minister tell me why PIP reassessments are being scheduled for people with incurable disabilities and terminal illnesses?
The hon.
Gentleman raises a very fair point.
It is, of course, important that we keep the awards under review, because sometimes they go up as well as down and we want to ensure that the support being provided is appropriate for the claimant.
We also need to ensure that the process is accessible—I agree with him about that.
Help can be provided to manage the assessment process.
If he would like to send me more details about his constituent, I would be glad to see what we can do to help.
