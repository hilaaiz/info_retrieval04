I thank the Minister for that answer and the assurance from the Dispatch Box that the maximum level of debt repayment from a household’s universal credit is to be reduced from 25% to 15% each month.
That is great news for Scottish families, who could benefit by an average of £420 a year.
Much of that debt management is carried out at the DWP centre in Stornoway in my constituency, and some 65 of the 80 staff there are involved in responding to calls nationally.
That is a good example of job dispersal, and their service is high quality and is now involved in reducing poverty.
I encourage the Minister to come and meet the staff there, to meet clients and to see the operation for herself.
