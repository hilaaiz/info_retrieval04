We come to the shadow Minister.
The withdrawal of the winter fuel payment from 10 million households, including 70% of disabled pensioners, is a huge change, as is using pension credit to distribute the benefit to the minority of people who will still get it, yet the Government have rushed this change through without giving their own statutory advisory committee the chance to properly scrutinise it.
Ministers have not even responded to the chair of the committee, who wrote to them several weeks ago with suggestions on how to mitigate the effect of the policy.
On top of that, they have failed to provide a full impact assessment to show what the effect on poverty would be.
Will they finally produce a full impact assessment of this policy, and when will the Minister respond to the chair of the advisory committee?
