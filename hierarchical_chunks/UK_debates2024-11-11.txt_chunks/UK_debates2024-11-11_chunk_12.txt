I welcome the hon.
Gentleman to his place.
In answer to his questions, we have published an equality analysis, which he can find on the Government’s website.
Owing to the legislation, we do not have to produce an impact assessment, but there is an equality analysis.
I urge him to have a look at that.
All I would say to him is that the new Leader of the Opposition argued in 2022 that winter fuel payments should be means-tested.
I wonder how the hon.
Gentleman might means-test the winter fuel payment, if he had the chance.
