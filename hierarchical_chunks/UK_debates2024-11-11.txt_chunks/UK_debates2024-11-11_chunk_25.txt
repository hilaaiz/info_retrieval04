I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that case.
I would be very happy meet him, or any other hon.
Member who has such cases in their constituency; however, the pensions review will look more at how current pension schemes can improve outcomes for future pensioners.
We are looking at driving scale in consolidation of defined contribution pension schemes and local government pension schemes, and at a shift away from cost to value.
I know that there is interest in that from across the House, and I hope that we can work on it across the parties.
