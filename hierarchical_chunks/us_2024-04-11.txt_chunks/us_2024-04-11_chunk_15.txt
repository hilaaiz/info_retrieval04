Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Sparta UNICO on its 25th anniversary.
As the name UNICO attests, this organization is truly unique.
It combines a celebration of Italian-American culture with a passion for charitable initiatives and local community service.
From awarding students in our school districts with academic scholarships, to fundraising for local food pantries and other charities, Sparta UNICO has impacted the lives of many residents in New Jersey's Seventh District.
Our communities have certainly benefitted from the noble efforts of Sparta UNICO, and I am grateful to have such an exemplary organization operating in our district.
I wish UNICO a wonderful 25th anniversary.
I thank them again for promoting such incredible cultural diversity in our communities, and for admirable dedication to making our district a healthier, safer, and more vibrant place to live.
