Mr. CASAR.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize the David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church's celebration of its 100th anniversary this year.
In 1924, 28 African American members founded the Church out of a former blacksmith's shop in Austin, Texas.
David Chapel would move twice, landing in its current site at MLK and Chestnut in 1958.
Its membership continued to expand, and the need for larger accommodations became clear.
At the height of racial segregation in the American South, White-owned banks refused to provide the loans necessary for the building of a new space of worship.
Undeterred, David Chapel pursued the funds, development, and construction they needed for the structure, becoming a truly communitydriven project.
Additionally, the building was designed by John Chase, the first Black graduate of the University of Texas at Austin's School.
Through the commitment and dedication of many, the construction of the current David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church building was finished only a year after it started.
Since 1992, David Chapel has been led by its Senior Pastor, Rev. Joseph C. Parker, Jr., Esq., D. Min.
Under Rev. Parker's leadership, David Chapel has increased its community involvement by developing and implementing the Chestnut Neighborhood Plan, and co-founding the Texas Congregations United for Empowerment (TCUE), an organization of Black churches in Central Texas working to increase their economic and community empowerment.
As the Congressman representing the 35th District of Texas, I am honored to congratulate Rev. Packer and David Chapel Missionary Baptist Church on its 100th anniversary of providing spiritual guidance and serving the needs of our community in East Austin and beyond.
