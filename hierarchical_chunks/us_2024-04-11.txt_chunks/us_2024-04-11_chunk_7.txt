Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Frisco Garden Club's Wildflower Luncheon in Frisco, Texas.
In 2002, the City of Frisco established a memorial composed of wildflowers in honor of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on our Nation.
In the following year, Frisco Garden Club member Edna Willits proposed the addition of a native plant garden and monument at the memorial.
Through her passionate advocacy and dedication, the Freedom Meadow memorial was constructed.
In benefit of Freedom Meadow, the Club held its first ``Wildflower Tea and Silent Auction'' on April 29, 2004.
This successful luncheon yielded the Club over $4,500 and allowed Freedom Meadow to expand into the beautiful and moving monument it is today.
Since then, the Club has hosted the Wildflower Luncheon every year to raise funds in support of gardens throughout Frisco and conservation initiatives for Texas bluebirds.
Additionally, the Club has annually awarded two high school seniors with scholarships thanks to funds raised from this event.
I am proud to recognize the Frisco Garden Club's incredible efforts to support and uplift our community.
Their important work represents American strength, hope, and resolve against those who would harm us.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of this historic occasion.
I wish the Frisco Garden Club and the Wildflower Luncheon continued success for many more years to come.
