Mrs. LUNA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the horrific crimes A fundamental principle of justice: the punishment of those who commit the most egregious crimes against the innocence of our children.
It is a matter that strikes at the very core of our values and demands our unwavering attention and action.
There will be those who argue that the death penalty is unconstitutional.
But let me be unequivocal: when it comes to protecting our children from the horrors of child rape, the death penalty is not only constitutional, it is a moral imperative.
Our Constitution stands as a beacon of freedom and justice, crafted to safeguard the rights and liberties of every American.
Yet, what greater violation of those rights could there be than the brutal and unforgivable abuse of our most vulnerable--our children?
The federal minimum for child rape must be upgraded to the death penalty, and a minimum of life behind bars.
For it is not merely a matter of punishment, but of deterrence and justice.
We must send a resounding message to those who would prey upon our children: such heinous crimes will not be tolerated in our society, and those who commit them will face the most severe consequences, a life for a life.
Protecting our children is not just a duty, it is our sacred obligation as a Nation.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of innocent victims or allow such predators to roam freely among us.
We must hold these monsters accountable.
It is our responsibility to ensure that our children are safe from harm, and that those who would seek to harm them are swiftly and decisively punished.
Upgrading the federal minimum for child rape to the death penalty is not about vengeance--it is about justice.
It is about standing up for the most vulnerable members of our society and sending a clear message that their safety and well-being are paramount.
The time has come to reaffirm our commitment to protecting our children from harm.
Let us stand together, united in our resolve, and demand that those who commit such heinous acts face the full force of the law.
