Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Professor Marielaine Mammon as she is honored as a recipient of the 2024 Dale P. Parnell Distinguished Faculty Award.
This national award recognizes exemplary faculty members from America's community colleges.
Through her decades of service to the County College of Morris (CCM) in New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District, Professor Mammon continues to inspire classes of students.
Professor Mammon dedicated her education and career to the performing arts.
Of her 51 years of teaching experience, she dedicated 47 years to CCM and has made a lasting impact on our community.
Professor Mammon is a tremendous mentor and she inspires her students to see their full potential while honing the skills needed to reach their goals.
Through her extraordinary career in the performing arts, including performances at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall, Professor Mammon leads her students by example.
Outside of the classroom, Professor Mammon is deeply involved on campus, whether she is chairing Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations, leading choir performances at local senior living facilities, or creating interdisciplinary opportunities for students.
She has served on numerous committees, including the Pandemic Response Team, Academic Standards Committee, and Curriculum Committee.
Through these extracurricular efforts, Professor Mammon hears directly from both students and faculty on their needs on campus and she brings this understanding to her work.
I am honored to recognize Professor Mammon for her exemplary career and congratulate her on this well-deserved recognition.
