Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Michael Wysocki of Dallas, Texas, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Michael is an experienced jurist and courtroom litigator who has dedicated himself to faithfully serving our community.
Michael is a distinguished graduate of the University of Texas at Tyler and Texas Tech University School.
In 2006, he was admitted to the State Bar of Texas and became board-certified in Family Law in 2011.
Michael is licensed to practice law in Texas, New Mexico, and before the U.S. Supreme Court.
He became the Managing Shareholder of O'Neil Wysocki, P.C., with offices in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston.
Over the years, Michael has successfully represented many clients who are experiencing family and domestic legal issues.
For his extensive work and efforts, Michael was named a Texas Rising Star lawyer three times and recognized as a Texas Super Lawyer since 2014, a prestigious title awarded to less than five percent of all lawyers statewide.
Additionally, he has been honored by the Annette Stewart Family Law Inns of Court for his professionalism.
In his free time, Michael volunteers on political campaigns to elect Republican candidates and helps appoint qualified Judges throughout Texas.
Whether he is in the courtroom or on the campaign trail, Michael is a fierce fighter and advocate for American values.
It is an honor to bestow Michael with the Patriot Award for his exceptional service to our Nation and the people.
I wish him continued success for many years to come.
