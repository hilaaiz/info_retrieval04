Mr. GUTHRIE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kim Huston on her retirement from nearly 30 years of working in local economic development in Nelson County.
As President of the Nelson County Economic Development Agency and Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation, Kim has been a tireless advocate for Nelson County and ensuring their economic success.
During her time in economic development she has overseen more than $1,500,000,000 in investments in her area and made sure Nelson County had a seat at the table in a global economy by building relationships with business leaders worldwide.
Kim has been a champion for making Nelson County a global tourist destination.
Alongside keeping Bardstown the Bourbon Capital of the World, she oversaw the city being named the most Beautiful Small Town in America by USA Today and Rand McNally in 2012.
Her passion for Nelson County is felt by everyone who has met her and she captured that passion by proudly authoring three books about her hometown.
I want to thank Kim for her work in Nelson County and wish her a happy retirement as she spends more time with her family.
