Ms. MATSUI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to Join the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce in recognition of the 2023 Al Geiger Memorial Award Honoree, West Sacramento City Council Member Quirina Orozco, for her ongoing exemplary public service to the Sacramento region.
Council Member Orozco is an excellent leader in our community who demonstrates that the Sacramento region's approach to everything from economic development, innovation, community outreach, and advocacy can and should be a model for the rest of the country.
Council Member Orozco's commitment to public service illustrates the very reason why I love my congressional district.
Our leaders have always sought to innovate, to push the envelope, and--most importantly--to deliver for out constituents.
