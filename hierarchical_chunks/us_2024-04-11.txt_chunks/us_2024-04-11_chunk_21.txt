Mr. GUTHRIE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Elaina Murphy for her service to Kentucky's Second District.
A Nicholasville, Kentucky native, Elaina obtained her Bachelors Degree from Centre College in 2015 and her Masters Degree from George Washington University in 2017.
Nearly a decade ago, I welcomed Elaina to my team as a summer intern in July 2015 before she transitioned to become my Staff Assistant until December 2015.
In August 2016, I welcomed her back to my office as my Legislative Correspondent.
She has since advanced to roles as Legislative Assistant, Senior Legislative Assistant, and most recently Senior Policy Advisor.
Elaina has worked tirelessly in nearly every legislative area in my office with particular interests in foreign affairs, energy, and telecommunications.
She has been essential to many projects in my office, including spearheading the Spectrum Caucus, and has been a passionate advocate for America's gold standard military installation, Fort Knox.
I want to thank Elaina for her work serving her home state and Kentucky's Second District as a constant, reliable member of my team.
I wish her the best as she excels in this next chapter of her career on Capitol Hill expanding her work in foreign affairs as she goes to work for the House Intelligence Committee.
