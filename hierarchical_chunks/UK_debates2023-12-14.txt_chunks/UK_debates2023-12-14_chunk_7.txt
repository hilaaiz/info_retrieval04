I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question.
I more normally get asked concerns about whether we are going to undershoot the target, rather than overshoot it, but it is a valid question.
It is important for us that we are introducing the SAF mandate, and we must give certainty to the industry so that investment comes in.
We have funded 13 different companies to set up SAF plants or do development, but we are looking at all the different options and nothing is off the table.
We will consider all the different proposals and publish our response to the second consultation as soon as possible.
