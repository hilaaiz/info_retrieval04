I welcome the Minister to his place and wish him well in his endeavours.
It is always a pleasure to see some of the 2019 intake elevated to the Front Bench, so very well done.
I thank him for his answer, as the issue of sustainable aviation fuel is important for my constituents.
To ensure that we do not overshoot climate targets on the road to jet zero or net zero, will the Government consider introducing the SAF mandate under a greenhouse gas intensity scheme?
That is quite a technical question, but I know it is one that the Minister is well up to answering.
