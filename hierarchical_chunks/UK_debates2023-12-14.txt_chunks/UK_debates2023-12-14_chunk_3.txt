The Secretary of State will know that we all want good roads, but we also want safe roads.
Can I draw his attention to the dreadful road accidents killing young people recently?
Is he aware that over the last 13 years, from being one of the safest places in the world in terms  of road safety and deaths on the roads, we are steadily becoming very bad indeed?
Will he do something about that, if he can?
I of course share the hon.
Gentleman’s concern about the deaths of anyone on the roads, but particularly of young people.
I do not recognise the characterisation he has set out.
Our road safety record remains one of the best in the world.
[Interruption.]
Well, it does.
The Department spends a great deal of resource on campaigns to get people to drive more safely, and we do that when we are engineering and delivering new roads.
Safety is one of the very important things that we think about as we design and roll out new road infrastructure.
What assessment he has made of the potential merits of electrifying the Furness line.
Northern is developing a final business case for a new fleet that will bring new trains to my hon.
Friend’s route, and include options for greener technology such as batteries.
We are also working with the Great British Railways transition team to assess options to decarbonise the whole network.
