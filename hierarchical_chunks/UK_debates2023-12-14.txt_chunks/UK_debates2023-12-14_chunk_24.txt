I thank my hon.
Friend for joining me and others in the industry to discuss open-access rail on  27 October .
I have today written to the Office of Rail and Road and the chief executive of Network Rail, asking them to review the unused access rights and agree a timeline, so that we can get decisions made more promptly.
I hope to then give him more information.
