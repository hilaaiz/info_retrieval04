I am pleased that the International Court of Justice has warned Maduro not to take any action that could alter the status quo, but can the Minister tell me what discussions the UK Government have had with representatives of the ICJ?
Have discussions been had directly with the Venezuelans on behalf of the UK Government?
To what extent does he share my concern that our previously weak response to states using dubious referendums, followed by the use of military force, to annex parts of a neighbouring country, as Russia did  to Crimea in 2014, has emboldened people like Maduro to believe that should he take military action, the consequence for him would be extremely limited?
Again, it is good to see support for Guyana across the House.
Whether this is because of Venezuela’s aspirations about oil or some other matter, whatever that might be, its actions are completely unjustified.
As the hon.
Member indicated, we need to call it out.
The 1899 border issue is settled.
We support Guyana in its efforts to resolve this matter in whichever way it wants to through the ICJ, but it needs to be done peacefully.
The hon.
Gentleman also makes an important point about Russia.
These actions are opportunistic.
There are huge issues geopolitically, and dictators or other Heads of Government should not seek to exploit these moments when there are far bigger issues at stake elsewhere in the world, so we need to call it out.
As I said earlier, we are keeping this under very close scrutiny and will take whatever actions we think are appropriate, along with our regional partners.
