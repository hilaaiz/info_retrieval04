My right hon.
Friend has announced that there will be an Opposition day debate on  Tuesday 9 January .
Have the Opposition told her that they want to make it on the Leader of the Opposition’s claim that he will bulldoze through local objections to development?
May I draw her attention to the website of a man called Chris Dixon, who says he is in favour of building on the Goring gap in my constituency?
He says that people who want to stop that development should vote for me, and those who want to have it built on should invite Angela Rayner to come down and see it.
Will the Leader of the House say whether the Labour party is willing to expose its desire to build on green gaps to public debate in this Parliament?
Order.
I am not sure that the Leader of the House is responsible for the Labour party.
I know that the Father of the House must have told the Member who he has brought into question that he would name her today.
Mr Speaker is always right, and I am not responsible for the scheduling of topics for Opposition day debates.
I know that my right hon.
Friend will have sent a message today that if that is what Labour is minded to do, he will be there and spoiling for a fight.
