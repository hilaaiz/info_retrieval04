That is an excellent question.
I can confirm to the House that I have had conversations with Baroness Scotland.
As secretary-general, she has taken a very strong lead: she has issued two statements and called the emergency session of the council of Ministers, which as I said, my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Development and Africa attended.
We will continue to work with the Commonwealth, which is a vitally important organisation in this context.
Does the Minister agree that whenever a country’s borders are threatened, they must be secured, or it risks undermining that country’s sovereignty, social cohesion and national identity?
I could not agree more—that is absolutely vital, particularly in this case.
Latin America has been a region of peace for many, many years, and it needs to stay that way.
It is great to see the House speak with one voice in support of our Commonwealth friend and partner, Guyana.
The Minister is right: these borders were settled in 1899.
They are the borders that were transferred to the independent Guyana in 1966, and they are the borders that are internationally recognised.
As the Minister also knows, President Maduro has said that he will immediately issue licences for gas, oil and mineral exploitation, in direct contravention—as we heard from  the hon.
Member for Argyll and Bute (Brendan O’Hara) —of the ICJ ruling.
What more is the United Kingdom doing to take this case up on the international stage with Guyana to make sure that ICJ rulings are adhered to?
We have already highlighted the work we are doing with the Commonwealth.
We have talked about the international engagement, and obviously, the situation was also discussed by the UN Security Council last Friday.
We are taking it at every single level, and it helps if, in this place, we condemn with one voice the actions that have been taken by Venezuela.
That will be noted in each of those forums, so I commend the hon.
Member for his very important words.
