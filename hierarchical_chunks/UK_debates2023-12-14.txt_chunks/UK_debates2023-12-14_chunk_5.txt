As my hon.
Friend knows, my officials are active members of Team Barrow, alongside the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and local partners, recognising the national significance of the submarine programme.
Work is ongoing, looking at improvements to the A590, and at options for the rail industry to improve the local rail network.
I would be delighted to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss that work.
When he plans to publish further information on the UK sustainable aviation fuel mandate.
After four years in Parliament, this is my maiden voyage at the Dispatch Box.
[Interruption.]
Indeed, it is Christmas come early, and it is a gift that the first question I am asked comes from  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) .
The UK sustainable aviation fuel mandate is on track to start on  1 January 2025 , with preparatory work  on secondary legislation progressing well.
We recognise   that final decisions on the parameters of the mandate must be taken in a timely way to provide certainty for investment decisions, and we will publish those as soon as possible.
