I welcome that there will be talks between the leaders of Guyana and Venezuela in St Vincent.
I put on record my thanks to Brazil for its leadership on this matter, including the deployment of troops along its border.
Those talks should be a mechanism to reduce the tensions  brought about by Venezuela’s actions, not a discussion about settled borders or a reward for threats.
The Essequibo border was settled more than 100 years ago in 1899.
Has the Minister spoken directly to Brazilian or American counterparts, or to key regional bodies such as CARICOM—the Caribbean Community—and the Organisation of American States, about responding to Maduro’s actions?
