That is a very good question from my hon.
Friend.
He knows more about Brazil than most people in the House, and I respect him for that knowledge and for the points he has made.
Of course, we are working closely with Brazil.
It has expressed its concern and warned against unilateral action.
It has said that  there is no way that Venezuela’s military forces would be able to access Guyana through Brazil, and we will continue to work with it very closely.
As he says, we have a strong relationship not just defence-wise, but as we look to its G20 presidency and its hosting of COP30.
What we are seeing is a shameful and cynical move by Venezuela’s President Maduro to threaten and bully a smaller neighbour.
We in the UK must make it clear that we cannot allow such threatening behaviour to continue, so what steps is the Minister taking, along with international allies, to affirm the UK’s unwavering support for Guyana’s sovereignty?
As I said in my statement, we have worked with the Commonwealth ministerial group to call out this action in joint harmony with our other relevant Commonwealth partners.
We continue to work with other international bodies to call it out, and obviously, we will be in a position to form a view—along with others in this House—later today, after the meeting that is taking place in St Vincent and the Grenadines.
