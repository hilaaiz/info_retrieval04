I thank the hon.
Gentleman for this work on the Backbench Business Committee and for his question.
He will know that it was the topic that the Youth Parliament chose to debate when they visited the Chamber.
There has been huge focus on provision in schools, particularly during holidays.
If he has particular concerns, I will be happy to raise them with the Secretary of State for Education, as the next questions are not until  29 January .
