I thank the Minister for his response to the urgent question, and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset (Mr Liddell-Grainger)  for securing it.
I also thank the shadow Foreign Secretary,  the right hon.
Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) , for his response.
I do not often find myself in agreement with him, but, on this, I could not fault him on a single word.
Both have raised the key strategic role that Brazil plays in the region.
We are about to sign a defence partnership agreement with Brazil—in the not too distant future—so it plays a key strategic role.
What further can the Minister do, particularly when he visits Guyana, to have enhanced conversations with Brazil to see what role it can play in making sure that we keep peace in the region?
