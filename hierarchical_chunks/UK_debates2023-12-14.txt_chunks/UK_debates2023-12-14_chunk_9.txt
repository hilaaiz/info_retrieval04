I welcome my constituency neighbour,  the hon.
Member for South Cambridgeshire (Anthony Browne)  to his place on the Front Bench.
For the past two years, part of the guided  busway in Cambridge has been closed due to a complex legal wrangle with the Health and Safety Executive.
It has meant that buses are snarled up and motorists and bus users have had thousands and thousands of hours of wasted time.
Will the Minister meet me to try to find a way to resolve this issue speedily and get Cambridge moving?
