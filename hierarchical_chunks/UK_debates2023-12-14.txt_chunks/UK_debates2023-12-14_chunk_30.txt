I am glad to follow the Opposition foreign and Commonwealth affairs spokesman in reminding the House and the Minister that when the United States persuaded the United Kingdom to go to international arbitration, the determination in 1899 was to leave that region as part of what is now Guyana, which became independent in 1966.
The dispute with Suriname was settled some time ago by agreement.
This should be as well, and Venezuela should go back to solving its own problems and exploiting its own hydrocarbons, if it chooses to do so, as it moves towards a more eco-friendly economy and preferably a better kind of politics as well.
The Father of the House makes a very important point.
This is a settled matter, and Venezuela needs to sort out its own issues.
There have been steps taken by partners in the region to try to help open the door to Maduro, and he has responded in this way.
It is unacceptable.
We now come to the SNP spokesperson.
