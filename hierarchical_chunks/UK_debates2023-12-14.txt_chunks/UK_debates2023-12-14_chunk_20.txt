I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
We are actually spending more money on active travel than any other Government in history.
As she says, active travel is an important part of decarbonisation and the route to net zero.
Her figures do not take into account the regional spending within  England, which should be added to the total.
I would be happy to write to her with the actual figures for spending in the UK.
