The Secretary of State has visited many airports to discuss the upgrading of airport security, and has seen the new security equipment in operation.
I know that my predecessor engaged regularly with airport representatives to seek reassurances on timescales for the next generation security checkpoint.
Most recently, I met Heathrow’s chief executive for discussions.
I can reassure the House that I will continue this good work, and will shortly meet representatives of the aviation sector to discuss the matter further.
There are many visits already in the diary; indeed, I will be meeting the Airport Operators Association straight after this session.
My Department— Order.
I think we have got the gist.
I am grateful to the Minister for his answer, and I welcome him to his new role.
This new technology will greatly improve passenger experience at airport security.
For example, it will obviate the need for those little plastic bags we all love putting   our liquids into.
Airports are worried about potential delays if the passenger scanners are introduced in one go for every passenger, as people will need to get used to the new technology.
May I urge the Minister to discuss with the airport operators the phased introduction of the new scanners, to remove the possibility of delays?
