I thank the Minister for his answer.
He will be delighted to know that, for once, I am going to ask not about the quality of service on the Furness line, but rather about capacity.
The Government recently announced, through the Network North deal, the electrification of the energy coast line.
That will take 150 million tonnes of freight off that line every year and is hugely welcome.
Through the SSN-AUKUS programme and the Dreadnought programme, and the doubling of the size of the shipyard in Barrow, a similar amount of freight will be needed going the other way.
Will the Minister meet me and the wider Team Barrow board to discuss the merits of electrifying the Furness line?
