Guyana is a diverse, beautiful and proud country with close ties of history, friendship and family with the UK.
As the child of parents who came from Guyana as part of the Windrush generation, I am living proof of our shared history.
For my relatives, and for all the people of Guyana, this is a deeply troubling time.
I am grateful that the Minister has indicated that he will go to Guyana shortly, and that the UK’s support for Guyana’s sovereignty is unwavering.
What specific actions are the Government taking to ensure that, if the threat is followed through, Guyana’s sovereignty is protected?
It is good to see strong cross-party support on this vital issue.
I certainly recognise the right hon.
Gentleman’s interest in this matter from his personal perspective and from a geopolitical perspective.
He is absolutely right: this is from the playbook of Putin and other dictators around the world, and it needs to be called out and stopped.
We are grateful for the work that Ralph Gonsalves, the Prime Minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, is doing to facilitate those conversations.
They need to be about de-escalation; the border is a settled issue as far as we are concerned.
The right hon.
Gentleman asks what action we are taking.
I can assure him that there have been multiple conversations.
The Foreign Secretary is absolutely concerned about this.
I have held conversations with interlocutors in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and many other places.
I was in Argentina for the inauguration at the weekend, and I met many interlocutors there who all share the concern.
We will work with CARICOM, the OAS, the UN, and, of course, the Commonwealth, which is vital, to call this out and take whatever steps are required.
