We live in an increasingly volatile world, so I thank the Minister for his clarification on defence spending.
Surely the cost of fighting a war, notwithstanding the human cost, is significantly higher than that of having a credible deterrent force.
The Prime Minister recently told me at the Liaison Committee that the strategic defence review has to be completed before the path to 2.5% can be plotted, so why have there been discussions about the timeline for that path before the SDR has been published?
We have said that we will publish the strategic defence review in the spring, and we will also set out a path to spending 2.5% of GDP on defence in the spring.
I do not recognise the publication timeline suggested by my hon.
Friend, but he is right that  deterring a war is cheaper than fighting one.
That is why we are continuing to support our allies in Ukraine, and making sure that we have a NATO-first defence policy—to deter aggression facing the United Kingdom and our allies, and, if necessary, to defeat it with formidable capabilities.
