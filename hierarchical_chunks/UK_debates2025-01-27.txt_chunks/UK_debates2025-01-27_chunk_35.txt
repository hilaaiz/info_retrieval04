I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I support the work of the private sector businesses that do so much to support our armed forces.
The needs of our armed forces will change and are changing; that means changed capability, but it also means a change in how we buy our kit.
Certainly, if we look at some of the absolute procurement disasters under the last Government—only two of 49 defence procurement projects are on time and on budget—we see that we need not only to buy the right kit, but to buy it better.
That is something that the last Government clearly failed to do; the shadow defence procurement Minister himself, the right hon.
Member for Rayleigh and Wickford, described the defence procurement system as “broken”.
We need to take steps forward, and the SDR and the defence industrial strategy will set out how we will improve defence procurement.
