Before we start today’s business, I want to note that today is Holocaust Memorial Day.
I know that the whole House will agree with me about the importance of remembering, especially on the 80th anniversary, the 6 million Jewish people murdered during the Holocaust, alongside the millions of other people killed as a result of Nazi persecution, as well as those killed in more recent genocides—Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.
I know that colleagues will want to join me in thanking the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust for the important work it does.
