I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his thoughtful question.
We absolutely recognise the role of early years education in identifying needs and  providing timely support.
We have launched the new SEND assessment resources and child development training, and are identifying and supporting communication needs through the early language support for every child programme, along with NHS England.
We will continue to work across Government to ensure that children with SEND get the right support at the right time.
I am very sorry to hear the tragic circumstances of the case the hon.
Gentleman outlined.
