I thank my hon.
Friend and constituency neighbour for his question.
He is right that last week we declassified information about the activities of the Russian spy ship Yantar, including revealing details of the surfacing of a Royal Navy submarine to deter the Yantar’s activities loitering above our critical national infrastructure.
It is absolutely right that this Government make the case that warfare has changed, especially when it comes to the protection of our critical underwater infrastructure.
Making the case that we have formidable abilities, but also being clear in the SDR about how we will invest in those capabilities alongside our allies, is essential.
The SDR will be published in the spring, when I am sure he will be able to see more about that.
