I thank pupils, teachers and school leaders for their resilience since the original buildings were closed in August 2023.
We have delivered high-quality temporary modular accommodation that the school will use until its new permanent buildings are ready.
We will continue to work closely with the trust and the local community to find a permanent solution.
