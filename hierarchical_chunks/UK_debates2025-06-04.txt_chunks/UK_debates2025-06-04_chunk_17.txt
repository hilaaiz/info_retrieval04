I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this case and I am deeply sorry to hear about Molly’s situation.
We are improving the lives of those that need it.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has just said to me that she will look into the case, so if the hon.
Lady will provide the details, I will ensure that it gets proper attention so that we can deal with the particular problems she has raised.
I am grateful to her, as I am sure Molly is, for raising this and I hope that we can now take the action that is necessary.
