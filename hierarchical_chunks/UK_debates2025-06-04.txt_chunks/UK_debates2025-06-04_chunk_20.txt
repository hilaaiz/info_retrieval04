I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
At a time of global conflict, it is staggering that the SNP policy is to block an £11 million investment for a new national welding centre on the Clyde.
I was there earlier this week and saw the huge potential for apprenticeships, for job opportunities, and for young people.

I support it—the SNP blocks it.
In England, we are backing 120,000 more apprenticeships with £3 billion of funding as part of our plan for change, but despite the highest funding settlement in the history of devolution, the SNP is cutting college budgets and blocking opportunities.
It has no plan for Scotland’s future.
