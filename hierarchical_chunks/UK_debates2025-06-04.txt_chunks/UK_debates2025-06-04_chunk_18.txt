Diolch, Mr Speaker.
In Wales, we will never forget how our steel industry was neglected by the Conservative Government.
They made unfunded promises, refused to make critical decisions and left Port Talbot on a cliff edge.
I welcome the news overnight that this Labour Government have secured an exemption for our steel industry from the latest US tariffs—a deal secured by this Labour Prime Minister.
Will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to update the House on what further work he is doing in order to support our steel workers across Wales and across our United Kingdom?
My hon.
Friend is doing great work with Welsh Labour colleagues to champion working people in Wales.
The United Kingdom is the only country in the world that will not be subject to the  additional tariffs announced today, and we are working with the US at this moment to swiftly implement the agreement we have reached, which will see the 25% tariffs removed.
We want that—the Conservatives do not want it—and it is crucial for British jobs.
We have fought tooth and nail for our steel industry, saving jobs at British Steel and improving the deal at Port Talbot, and we will continue to do so.
