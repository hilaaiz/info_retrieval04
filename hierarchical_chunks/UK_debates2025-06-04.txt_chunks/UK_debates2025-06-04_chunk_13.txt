I welcome the Prime Minister’s remarks about Gaza, because I am sure that all of us are appalled by the latest scenes: starving people desperate for food, water and medicine, met with chaos and violence.
The US-Israeli programme is clearly failing and nothing short of lifting the full blockade on aid will do.
Given that the Netanyahu Government refuse to do that, will the Prime Minister take more decisive action today?
Will he push at the United Nations Security Council for humanitarian corridors to get the desperately needed aid urgently into Gaza?
