I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting this issue, because the Conservatives left our flood defences in the worst state on record.
It is prisons, it is the NHS, it is the economy, it is flooding—every single thing they touched, they broke.
We are investing £2.65 billion to build and maintain flood defences, and that means 52,000 more properties will be protected by March of next year.
