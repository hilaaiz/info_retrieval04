The Minister for Veterans and People is doing sterling work.
His advocacy has helped to ensure that Labour will improve 3,000 forces family homes.
We are making a £1.5 billion investment across the whole UK.
I am sure that when the strategic defence review was launched, in Scotland and then in this  Chamber, the hon.
Member was full of admiration for what the Minister is doing for veterans and those who currently serve us with such distinction.
Scotland-born veteran Betty Gallagher joined the Army when she was 17, but eight months later she was dishonourably discharged for what were referred to as “lesbian tendencies”.
Today, Betty runs the thriving BourneOut LGBT hub in Eastbourne and founded Eastbourne Pride.
Will the Minister thank Betty for her service to our country, and advise on how she and other veterans can seek justice for the discrimination that they were subjected to?
I am delighted to join the hon.
Gentleman in thanking Betty for all her efforts.
He will know that, in the review, work has been undertaken on justice for LGBT people in our armed forces, and we are pleased to commend that to the House.
