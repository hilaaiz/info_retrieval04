My constituent, Molly, is a single mother caring for a child with cancer.
She cannot work because of her caring responsibilities.
Since January, she has tried to claim disability living allowance and universal credit, but faced constant Department for Work and Pensions bureaucracy.
That bureaucracy continued right up until yesterday, when she received yet another frustrating letter from the DWP about her DLA.
Will the Prime Minister assure Molly and others like her that his Government are doing all that they can to help?
Will he visit Tiverton and Minehead to see these challenges at first hand and to work with me to find a solution?
