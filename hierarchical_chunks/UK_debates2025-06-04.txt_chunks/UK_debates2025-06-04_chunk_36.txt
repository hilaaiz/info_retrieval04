I thank my right hon.
Friend for listening to Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region’s metro mayor, and Liverpool city region MPs, who jointly asked for pretty much what he has announced for the region in today’s statement.
I also congratulate him on recognising the value that transport investment has for communities and for growth.
In 2027 a new fleet of electric buses will arrive in my constituency as part of the expansion into the borough of Sefton.
Can he confirm that today’s announcement covers the improvement in grid connections and infrastructure for charging that will be necessary to take advantage of the very welcome transition to electric buses?
