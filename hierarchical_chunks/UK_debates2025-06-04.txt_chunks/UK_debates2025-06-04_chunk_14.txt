I give the right hon.
Gentleman my assurance, because this is a very important issue, that we are working at pace with our allies on that very issue, to take whatever measures we can to get that humanitarian aid in.
We have been doing that intensively over recent weeks and I give him my assurance that we  will continue to do that, because that aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, and he is absolutely right about that.
It has been over two decades since a Labour Government banned the cruel practice of fur farming, but the job is not done.
Real fur and fur products are still being imported into the UK.
This week, I delivered a petition to No. 10 with over 1 million signatures calling for a fur-free Britain.
My private Member’s Bill would deliver exactly that.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that it is time to close the loopholes, ban the import and sale of real fur, and finally put the fur trade out of fashion?
