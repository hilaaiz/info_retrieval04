I thank my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey)  for tabling her amendments and for discussing them with me over the last few days.
We have worked to try to ensure that the best outcome is found.
She makes the point that when there is a general election coming, albeit that that is an unusual circumstance—one hopes that it will arise only every five years—it throws things into doubt.
The last thing we would want is for the Bill to get Royal Assent and then, for some reason—probably the election—not come into force.
I understand where she is coming from on that.
