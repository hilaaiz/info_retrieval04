I thank my right hon.
Friend for highlighting the importance of interfaith dialogue.
I must not miss the opportunity to promote one of the projects being undertaken by the international alliance of 43 countries.
We have a working group on interfaith dialogue, which was launched this year, and we are calling for contributions of good examples of such dialogue from around the world.
I encourage anyone in this place, and anyone listening to the debate or reading about it afterwards, to contact our alliance—they can do so through me —in order to contribute.
