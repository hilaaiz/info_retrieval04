I thank  the hon.
Member for Wallasey (Dame Angela Eagle)  for her support for the Bill.
She asked why these regulations were not included in the 2022 Act.
Unfortunately, they were out of scope as that Bill was altering entitlement conditions for benefits.
I assure her my officials have said no other areas are in need of amending—I see that gets the thumbs up from the Opposition Dispatch Box.
On consistent definition, the Bill will build on previous legislation that changed special rules for social security benefit.
This final change brings the payments made by the Pension Protection Fund and financial assistance scheme into alignment with those changes.
