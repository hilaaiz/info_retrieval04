I thank all Members who have taken part in the debates that have led the Bill to progress to this stage, including the Committee stage, and for the cross-party support it has rightly received.
As has been outlined, the Bill builds on the 2022 changes the Government introduced to social security benefits.
That legislation was welcomed by excellent key charities, such as Marie Curie, the Motor Neurone Disease Association and Macmillan Cancer Support.
It changed the special rules for a number of benefits, ensuring claims were rightly fast tracked.
Those who were thought to be in the final year of their life were able to receive vital financial support six months earlier.
