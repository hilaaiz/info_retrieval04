I am led to believe that 12% of the world’s nuns are in India.
India is an amazing country, but many of us will have been horrified by the regular and active persecution of Christians in parts of that country.
Of course the UK Government need their important relationships with our Commonwealth friend, which recently hosted a very successful G20 summit and is a very important part of the global economy, but they also need to challenge aspects of the way in which it deals with freedom of religion and belief.
I believe that our Ministers do that successfully, but it is of additional benefit to have a special envoy of the Prime Minister’s who works with many countries, through the international alliance, on raising these issues.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)  mentioned a case that she had tackled in Nigeria.
My right hon.
Friend is making an excellent speech.
May I augment what she has just said about the international alliance?
Just this week, three members of its council of experts produced a report on the continuing atrocities in Manipur, which have been going on for a year.
I am pleased that the Foreign Secretary has spoken in such positive terms about our experts’ first report, which was produced a year ago, and I hope that Members, and those who are listening to the debate, will look at the further report led by the well-known and prestigious former BBC reporter David Campanale.
Those atrocities in Manipur require much more attention.
My hon.
Friend is right to make that point, and a permanent role will continue to bring that focus.
As the Bill makes clear, staff and accommodation will be provided when they are considered to be necessary, which I think is important.
