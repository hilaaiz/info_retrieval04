I thank the right hon.
Member for that intervention, and I hope that her family welcome the Bill as well.
Like much of our hospitality industry through covid, pubs were absolutely battered.
While this Bill is small and will not apply all the time, when it does apply, the revenue that our local hospitality venues and pubs will gain from it will make a huge difference to them.
