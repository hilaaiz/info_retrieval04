I thank the hon.
Member for her fulsome support for my Bill.
I stress to her and to the House that there will be continued consultation with the police and local authorities, even when the regulations in the Bill are in play.
We are simply changing the parliamentary process, not the process that happens outside this place.
I want to give her that assurance.
