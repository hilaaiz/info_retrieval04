Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Community Options on their 35th anniversary.
Community Options is a non-profit organization based in New Jersey, and it is dedicated to promoting self-determination and community involvement for people with intellectual and development disabilities.
By providing these individuals with accessible housing and equipping them with skills to pursue careers of their choice, Community Options has changed more than 5,000 lives.
This exceptional organization has tackled barriers that historically impeded people with disabilities, and in doing so they have brought extraordinary vibrancy, creativity, and diversity to our communities.
New Jersey is both proud and grateful to house the headquarters of this exceptional organization.
I wish Community Options the best of luck as they continue with their outstanding work.
It has been a true pleasure to watch their organization grow and prosper over the past 35 years, and I have no doubt that they will touch many more lives in the future.
