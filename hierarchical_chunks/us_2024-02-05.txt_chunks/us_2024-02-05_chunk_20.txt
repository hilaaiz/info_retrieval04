Ms. MATSUI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the Women's Cardiovascular Medicine Program at the University of California, Davis, and to acknowledge National Red Dress Day, which seeks to raise awareness about heart disease being a leading cause of death for women in America.
Established in 1994, the UC Davis Women's Cardiovascular Medicine program and clinic was the nation's first program dedicated to women's cardiovascular health.
Since then, the program has continued to lead the industry in cardiovascular care in the Sacramento region, providing personalized, equitable, and women-centered care to tackle cardiac conditions unique to women.
The remarkable clinical team offers a comprehensive and preventative range of care options that include, but are not limited to, dietary counseling, cardiac rehabilitation, and risk factor analysis, diagnosis, and treatment.
In addition to the program's clinic providing care to women with cardiovascular conditions, it also trains the next generation of healthcare workers.
Students are given the opportunity to directly engage with women with heart disease through resident rotations and the opportunity to shadow leading experts in women's heart care.
The UC Davis Women's Cardiovascular program is a great representation critical issues of our time.
Some of this program's many feats include collaborating with the California Department of Public Health to draft California's Master Plan for Stroke Prevention, now designated as a model women's heart program by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.
