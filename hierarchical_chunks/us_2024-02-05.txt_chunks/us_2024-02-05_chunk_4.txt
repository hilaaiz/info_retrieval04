Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Greenville Mississippi Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. for their 70 years of service.
The Greenville Mississippi Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. was chartered on February 14, 1954, by the late G.P. Maddox, he late B.L. Bell, the late Dr. Charles Holmes, the late Ray Brooks, the late A.C. Isaac, the late Robert Hall, the late Dr. Henry St. Hille, the late Sunny Kyles, and the late Arthur B. Peyton, Sr.
Today, the brothers who make up the alumni chapter are from Mississippi, Tennessee, and Arkansas.
The Greenville Mississippi Alumni Chapter has sought ways to acknowledge brothers within their chapter who have made individual achievements in their path of life.
Seventy years of the Greenville Mississippi Alumni Chapter has come with scholarship awards for men and women to highlight citizens who have contributed to serving the community, exceptional educational achievement, professional achievement, service to the fraternity, outstanding leadership, and brotherhood.
Their continual leadership and service around Greenville, MS, and the greater Mississippi Delta have contributed positively to the region.
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. has sponsored events such as football bowl games, high school Greek shows, all-star basketball games, Miss Kappa Alpha Psi pageants, and the Arthur B. Peyton golf tournament.
The chapter has also participated in the United Way housing initiative and pioneered events such as the inaugural All-White and Jean social events and New Year's with the Nupes.
Celebrating 70 years of service is only possible with the hard work and dedication of brothers who have committed their time and effort to their fraternity.
