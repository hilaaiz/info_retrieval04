Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, host of the popular radio show, Hawkeye in the Morning, Mark ``Hawkeye'' Louis is an avid baseball card collector.
Since his childhood, Hawkeye spent years collecting Major League Baseball cards, with the collection eventually totaling an impressive 17,000 cards.
Instead of letting the collection continue to collect dust, he decided to give back to our community by selling the cards and donating the proceeds.
Hawkeye decided the enormous impact of donating the more than $10,000 in proceeds would make him more proud than hanging onto the cards ever could.
His background in volunteer work and fundraising at DFW children's hospitals made Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth the perfect choice.
Hawkeye's story is inspiring and his selfless donation will help hundreds of children in our district.
I want to thank Mark ``Hawkeye'' Louis for his ongoing support of North Texas children and children's hospitals throughout our community.
