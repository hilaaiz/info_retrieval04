Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the promotion of Brigadier General Lisa J. Hou to the rank.
Major General Lisa J. Hou has served as the Adjutant General of the New Jersey National Guard and Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs since June 2021.
As a daughter of immigrants raised in New Jersey, General Hou's journey is a prime example of the American Dream and of our nation's spirit.
It is my privilege to honor a true patriot that has served and supported New Jersey and our country.
Major General Hou has commanded the more than 8,400 Soldiers and Airmen of the New Jersey National Guard with steadfast determination.
The wide range of missions the New Jersey National Guard responds to presents a challenge Major General Hou has risen to accomplish.
Whether through state-to-state partnership with the Republic of Albania, supporting the Global War on Terror, or providing assistance during natural disasters, the Soldiers and Airmen of the New Jersey National Guard have executed their missions with the utmost professionalism and success under Major General Hou's command.
In addition to her role as Adjutant General of the National Guard, Major General Hou also serves in the New Jersey Governor's cabinet as Commissioner of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs (DMAVA), Major General Hou leads, directs, and manages all state veterans' programs, commissions, and facilities in the Garden State, providing services and benefits to over 300,000 veterans statewide.
I extend my most heartfelt thanks to Major General Hou for her service and sacrifice.
