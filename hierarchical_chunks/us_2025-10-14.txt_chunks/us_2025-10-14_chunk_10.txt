Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Bill Zortman on the remarkable milestone of hosting his 5000th radio show.
As a longtime voice behind ``It's Your Business,'' Bill has amplified leading voices to guide South Dakota listeners with practical wisdom and sound judgement.
Bill's distinguished career in radio and television broadcasting spans more than forty years, including over fifteen years here in South Dakota.
Beyond the microphone, he has demonstrated a deep commitment to public service and community leadership.
After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Bill took a break from journalism and served as the Executive Director for the Red Cross close to home, serving as President of Realtors for Kids, organizing the Professional Real Estate Associates Military Thank You Picnic, and earning recognition from his peers as Real Estate Spirit of the Year in 2008 and the Professional Real Estate Associates Spirit Award in 2012.
Bill has become more than just a broadcaster; he's a trusted voice for business, agriculture, and civic life in our state.
Through ``It's Your Business'' and ``lt's Your Business to Know'', Bill has built a trusted forum for businesses, public leaders, and neighbors.
