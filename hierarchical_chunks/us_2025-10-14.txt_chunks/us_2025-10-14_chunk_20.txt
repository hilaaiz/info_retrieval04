Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the remarkable achievements of Peacock's Signs & Designs, a venerable black-owned business located in Grenada, Mississippi, that has been a pillar of the community for nearly five decades.
Founded in 1976 by Walter Peacock, this family-owned enterprise began humbly as a side endeavor creating personalized license plates.
Mr. Peacock, a talented artist and dedicated entrepreneur, transformed his passion and skill into one of Grenada County's oldest and most successful businesses.
Through decades of unwavering hard work and commitment, Peacock's Signs & Designs has grown from a small local operation into a respected company serving hometown restaurants, boutiques, shopping plazas, and even national restaurant and retail chains.
Mr. Peacock's dedication to quality and service has earned the business a reputation for excellence, not only in Grenada but also in surrounding communities and smaller towns that lack local sign companies.
Today, the legacy of Peacock's Signs continues with the involvement of Walter Peacock's two sons, Walter ``Winston'' Peacock, Jr. and Fred ``Wesley'' Peacock.
Together, they carry forward their father's vision, expanding the company's reach while maintaining the high standards set by their father nearly 50 years ago.
This multigenerational commitment is a testament to the strength of family, the power of entrepreneurship, and the impact of black-owned businesses on local economies and communities.
It is through such steadfast dedication that small businesses like Peacock's Signs & Designs contribute profoundly to the cultural and economic fabric of our great Nation.
