Mr. CRAWFORD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the oldest living residents of Arkansas, my constituent, 
Mrs. Ida Newbill, on her 111th birthday.
Born on October 14, 1914, 
Mrs. Newbill has lived through more than a century of extraordinary progress, bearing witness to generations of history with grace, wisdom, and faith.
She was raised attending Sunday school, and continues to build her life upon strong values, which have served as guiding principles for her family and community.
Together with her late husband, 
Mr. Joseph Newbill, 
Mrs. Newbill raised six children, four of whom are still living: daughter Alberta Glass (age of 94), daughter Willie Mae Terry (age of 91), daughter Augustine Terry (age of 90), and daughter Ida Henderson (age of 88).
