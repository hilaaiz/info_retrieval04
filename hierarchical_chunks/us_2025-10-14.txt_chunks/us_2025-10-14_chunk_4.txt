Ms. Nyad was inducted into the United States National Women's Sports Hall of Fame in 1986.
She is also an International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame Honoree and an ISHOF Al Schoenfield Media Award recipient.
In addition to her illustrious career as an athlete, 
Ms. Nyad founded the national walking initiative EverWalk and wrote and starred in the off-Broadway play, The Swimmer.
In 2014, the City of Key West honored 
Ms. Nyad with an historic bronze plaque installed at Smathers Beach where she walked ashore at the end of her Cuba crossing.
On November 6, 2025, a State of Florida Historic Marker tribute to Diana's inspirational life will be unveiled and eventually be on permanent display at Las Olas Beach in Ft. Lauderdale.
It is with great enthusiasm that I congratulate 
Ms. Nyad on her accomplishments and ask Floridians to join me in thanking her for contributing to our state's rich cultural history.
