Ms. Nyad gained fame by setting a new speed record for both men and women when she circled Manhattan Island in 1975 in 7 hours and 57 minutes.
She was the first person to swim North to South across Lake Ontario in 1974, and was the world champion on the marathon circuit that year.
Her first attempt to swim from Havana, Cuba to Key West, Florida was in 1978 and 35 years later, at the age of 64, Diana became the first to ever swim from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage--110.86 miles, 52 hours and 54 minutes.
