Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War veterans who will travel to Washington, D.C. on October 15, 2025, with Honor Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWII, Vietnam, and Korean War veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on The National Mall in Washington, D.C.
These memorials were built to honor their courage and service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures.
The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who will travel here on October 15, 2025, answered our Nation's call to service during one of its greatest times of need.
From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service, and sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero.
We owe them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and join me in expressing gratitude.
