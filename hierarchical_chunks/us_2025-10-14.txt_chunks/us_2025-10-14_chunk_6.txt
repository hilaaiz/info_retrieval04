Mrs. Newbill is a proud matriarch of a United States Army family, with her son, grandson, and great-grandson having honorably served our Nation.
She also has a profound love for locomotives.
Each year, a special locomotive visit by the North Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad to Arch Street in Eudora, Arkansas, near her home, has become a cherished tradition to celebrate her birthday.
Today is no different, Danny Robbins will drive the train to her hometown and host a birthday celebration for ``Momma Ida,'' as she is often referred to throughout the community.
May her life continue to remind us all that faith, family, and perseverance are the foundations of a happy life.
It is with great admiration that I wish 
Mrs. Newbill a very happy birthday and honor her contributions to the 1st Congressional District of Arkansas, and I extend my sincerest wishes for continued joy, peace, and health in the years ahead.
