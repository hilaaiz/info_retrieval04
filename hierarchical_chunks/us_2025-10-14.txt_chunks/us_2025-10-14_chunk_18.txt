Ms. DEXTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary young leader from Oregon's 3rd Congressional District, Samruddha Preuitt, a graduate of David Douglas High School in Portland.
Samruddha was recently named a 2025 U.S. Presidential Scholar--one of just 161 students nationwide to earn this prestigious honor.
Since 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has celebrated the academic excellence, leadership, and dedication of our Nation's most distinguished high school seniors.
This honor is reserved for students who not only achieve top scores on college entrance exams but also demonstrate outstanding scholarship, character, and service.
Samruddha embodies all of these qualities.
He now studies data science and engineering at the University of Connecticut, drawn by its strong commitment to undergraduate research.
As someone who engaged in undergraduate research myself, I know how transformative those experiences can be--and how they help prepare the next generation of leaders in science, technology, and public service.
This achievement reflects not only Samruddha's individual brilliance and perseverance, but also the strength of our public schools, our educators, and a community that values opportunity and hard work.
I congratulate him on this remarkable achievement, and I wish him continued success as he pursues his academic and professional journey.
