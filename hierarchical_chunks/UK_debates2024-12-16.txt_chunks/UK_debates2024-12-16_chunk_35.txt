I thank my hon.
Friend for representing the concerns of his constituent.
The Department is working closely with the Pensions Regulator.
We are looking to gather information on the number of schemes that provide discretionary increases on pre-1997 benefits and those that do not.
At the moment, the trustees of those schemes have discretion over the decision to index those benefits.
