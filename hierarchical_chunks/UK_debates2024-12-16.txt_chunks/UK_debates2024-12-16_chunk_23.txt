I thank the Minister for his answer, but I would like to focus on the age differential in the rates.
He will be aware that people under 25 receive a different rate of universal credit.
The Government announced that they will try to abolish the age differential for the national living wage.
If it could also be abolished for universal credit, that would be really good for young care leavers.
Will the Minister look at potentially phasing out the age differential in universal credit?
