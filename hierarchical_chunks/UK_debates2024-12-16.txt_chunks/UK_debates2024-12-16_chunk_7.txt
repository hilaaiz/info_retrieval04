I thank my right hon.
Friend for her response, not least given the dire inheritance from the previous Government: the worst performance of an employment rate in the G7 since the pandemic.
I see that inheritance in my community, in Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, where individuals carry not the indulgence, and not the offence, but the misfortune of ill health.
What is the Secretary of State doing to tackle economic inactivity, so that we give hope again, not just to those individuals, but to my community?
