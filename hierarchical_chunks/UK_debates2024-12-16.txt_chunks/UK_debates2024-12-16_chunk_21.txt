I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
A number of ideas have been put forward by think-tanks and research institutes.
One such idea is a sidecar savings account, which could be used for a pension, but could also have some money set aside for a rainy day should somebody fall into debt.
We are considering that.
He raises a very important question, because some of those on low incomes sometimes cannot afford to put in those contributions, but there may be a way between opting out and remaining in the scheme, and we are looking at that.
