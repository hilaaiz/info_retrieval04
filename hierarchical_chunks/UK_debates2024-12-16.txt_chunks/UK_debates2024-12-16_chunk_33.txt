I welcome the NAO report, which I asked for last May, when I was Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee.
We are determined to address the problem of carer’s allowance overpayments.
The cliff edge could be dealt with through the introduction of a taper instead of the current arrangements, as the Chancellor mentioned in her Budget speech in the autumn.
If we do that, it will not happen quickly, because it will be quite a major project, but it is something that we are looking at closely.
