The Secretary of State was asked— What assessment she has made of the potential impact of the Autumn Budget 2024 on levels of unemployment.
The Budget made the choices needed to fix the foundations of our economy.
Taking those into account, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that unemployment will fall to 4.1% next year and remain low until 2029.
We are taking action to support jobs and growth, and to transform employment support to get Britain working.
Will the Minister answer a simple question: since the Budget, have unemployment rates gone up or down?
I have just given the OBR’s assessment.
It is worth noting that there are still a significant number of vacancies in the economy.
We are determined that the Department for Work and Pensions will be reformed to serve employers better, so that they can fill those vacancies.
Many disabled people in Ealing Southall are unnecessarily unemployed purely and simply because their employer refuses to respond to their request for the reasonable adjustments that they need to do their job.
Will the Minister consider strengthening the right to reasonable adjustments, so that workers receive a response within a specified number of weeks, in line with the recommendations in the groundbreaking disability employment charter?
