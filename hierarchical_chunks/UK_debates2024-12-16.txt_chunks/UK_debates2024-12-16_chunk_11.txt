I hope the Secretary of State will join me in congratulating Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell on their victory on “Strictly” this weekend.
In the light of that victory, how does she plan to make the Access to Work scheme more fit for purpose, so that it can help more people with disabilities reach their full potential?
I absolutely join in the hon.
Gentleman’s comments.
It was a great joy to see that victory at the weekend.
We want to see Access to Work working better.
We want to get the backlogs down, and for that support to be available to more people.
Labour Members believe that disabled people have the same rights as anyone else to work, socialise and take part in life.
That is what we are determined to achieve, not just through the Department for Work and Pensions, but through every part of Government.
The hon.
Gentleman will know that we recently announced lead Ministers for disability in every Department.
That shows how important we take this issue to be.
What assessment she has made of the potential impact of trends in inflation on pensioners’ living standards.
Due to the Government’s steadfast commitment to the triple lock, pensioners will see an above-inflation increase of 4.1% in their state pension next year, which means that they will be up to £470 better off—and, over the course of this Parliament, over £1,900 better off.
