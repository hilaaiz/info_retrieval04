I recognise what was behind the increase in the national minimum wage for 18 to 21-year-olds, but I have been surprised by the reaction of businesses in my constituency.
Those businesses have told me, in terms, that they will reduce the number of 18 to 21-year-olds they employ, because there is a higher failure rate associated with their employment, as they are new to the workforce, yet employing them will cost the same as employing those who are older.
Does the Minister recognise that issue, and what will she do about it?
Anybody who sees that, in the British economy, there are nearly 1 million young people out of work or training—not doing anything—would say that is a dreadful legacy left by the previous Administration.
That is why the youth guarantee is at the heart of our “Get Britain Working” plan.
Order.
Before I call Dr Jeevun Sandher, may I offer him my congratulations on his engagement?
That is incredibly kind of you, Mr Speaker.
Young non-graduates are finding it far harder to get good, well-paid jobs.
The number of young people not in education, employment or training has nearly doubled since 2013, and youth unemployment is at its highest rate in almost a decade because young people are not getting the skills they need.
On top of that, they are becoming far sicker; one in three young people currently has a mental health problem, and that figure is rising.
What are the Government and the Department doing to give young people the skills and the health support that they need to get good, well-paying jobs?
That question demonstrates the quality analysis I would expect from recently engaged economists on the Labour Benches.
The Minister for Skills and I have been working closely on the youth guarantee, because we know that it is only by colleges and jobcentres working in hand in hand that we will get young people the skills that they need to succeed.
