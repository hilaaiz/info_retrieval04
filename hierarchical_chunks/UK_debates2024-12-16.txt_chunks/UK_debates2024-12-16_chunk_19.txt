Friend for that question, which is indeed an interesting idea.
It is one that was put forward recently by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and I will consider it.
In the pension schemes Bill, which we will introduce next year, low earners with multiple small pots will have those pots consolidated, so that the money works better for them and gives them a better retirement in the future.
