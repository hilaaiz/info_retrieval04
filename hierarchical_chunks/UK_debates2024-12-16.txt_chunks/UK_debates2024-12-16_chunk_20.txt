I thank the Minister very much for her answers.
Both parties—the one now in opposition, and the one in government—have always encouraged people to buy pension contributions in every way they can.
However, the fact is that for many people who are low earners, it is not possible to have a pension scheme and at the same time to live, given the age we are in and the cost of living.
What can the Minister do to encourage people to do so in a way that does not impact on the money they have coming in?
