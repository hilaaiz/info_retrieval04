Senator Diana Bajoie, as a true mentor, supporter, and dear friend.
She is a true fighter--as a ``lioness at heart,'' but Don Hubbard calls her ``killer''.
The Greater New Orleans Community is blessed to have this incredible gem still making a difference in our great state.
I am proud to say I can connect with her throughout my political career, and as Congressman, respecting the guidance and support she gives.
I am forever grateful for her commitment to the residents of Louisiana, and guidance to our program.
I will forever carry her direction as I serve the Constituents of LA02.
May God continue to bless her.
