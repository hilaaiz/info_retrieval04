and administrative staff, who were able to gain invaluable experience in the organization prior to moving on to other important positions or launching private practices in social work.
Additionally, many of the clients Dixon Family Services provides resources to have gone on to make their own contributions to the community, paying forward the same assistance that they received.
Although, historically, many of its programs were funded by government contracts or grants, in recent years Dixon Family Services has been supported primarily by private foundations, corporations, churches, service organizations, and businesses, as well as many caring and generous community members whose donations and kind words of support sustained the organization.
