Mr. Speaker, next month Commander Kimbrell will assume duties as the Deputy Legislative Director to the Commander of European Command in Stuttgart, Germany.
It has been a great pleasure to work with Commander Kimbrell during his time representing the Department of Defense in my office on Capitol Hill.
On behalf of our grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of Commander Kimbrell and his four children.
I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in our U.S. Navy.
They have dedicated their lives to the service of our great Nation.
