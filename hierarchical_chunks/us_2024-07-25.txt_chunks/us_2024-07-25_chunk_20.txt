Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the astounding life of Dorothy Lawrence, who celebrates her 95th birthday this week.
Dorothy was born on July 29, 1929, along with her twin brother Dick, on the Borden Farm in Wallkill, NY.
She is the youngest of five children and spent her childhood on Borden Farms in Wallkill and Earlville NY, which her father managed.
In 1947, she graduated from Earlville High School.
The following year, Dorothy earned a business certification from the Central City Business Institute in Syracuse, New York.
She worked as a secretary until she married her beloved husband, John, in 1955.
Dorothy is a lifelong member.
Malachy's Catholic Church in Sherburne, New York.
Coming from a musical family, Dorothy has had a passion for singing all her life.
When she was only four years old she and her twin brother sang ``Little Old Lady Passing By'' for a radio contest.
In the 1960s, she helped found the Sherburne Community Chorus and was an active member until just recently.
At the age of 95, Dorothy still enjoys music, attending local concerts whenever possible.
Currently, Dorothy still resides in the same house that she and her husband built in 1955.
She is a loving mother to four children with whom she spends time with nearly every day.
She has ten grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren who she loves dearly, and she keeps informed about her many nieces and nephews as well.
Dorothy is one of four surviving members of her high school class, and she has remained in contact with each of her former classmates since they graduated together in 1947.
Dorothy is known by her family, friends, and other members of her community for her delicious apple pie.
Dorothy Lawrence is an exceptional member of her community whose dedication and love for her family and community is truly inspiring.
I am thrilled to recognize her for her many accomplishments and wish her a very happy 95th birthday.
