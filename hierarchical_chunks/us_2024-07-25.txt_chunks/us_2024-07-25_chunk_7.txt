Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an incredible New Orleans Matriarch, former State 
Senator Diana Bajoie.
She is one for the history books.
As a young woman in her twenties, she began her public service in the Louisiana House of Representatives, where she served as the only woman in that body during her first term.
In 1991, she became the first African American woman ever elected to the Louisiana State Senate.
In 2004, she took the oath as Senate President pro-tempore, and became the first woman ever elected to a leadership post in the Louisiana State Senate.
In 2012, 
Senator Bajoie was appointed by Mayor Landrieu to fill a vacancy on the New Orleans City Council in District B. Former 
Senator Diana E. Bajoie is not just a public servant in title--she is a public servant in spirit, heart, and deeds.
Her colleagues describe her as one who fights for communities, families, and Louisiana with tireless compassion.

She also attended the Southern University School.
An Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree was conferred upon former
