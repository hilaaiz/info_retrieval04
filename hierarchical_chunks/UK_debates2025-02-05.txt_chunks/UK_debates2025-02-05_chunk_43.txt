The Minister confirmed to me in a written answer last week that we will not have a unilateral ability to extend the agreement.
In December, the Minister for the Armed Forces,  the hon.
Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport (Luke Pollard) , said that he was confident that Members  would back it when we saw the detail.
This is seemingly a renegotiated deal, and we have not seen the detail of the original deal or this deal.
What are the differences between the previous deal and the renegotiated deal, and when will the details be presented to Members of this House?
