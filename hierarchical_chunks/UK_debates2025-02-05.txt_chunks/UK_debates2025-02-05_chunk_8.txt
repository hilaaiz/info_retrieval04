I am very grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his kind words and for his passion about apprenticeships, which we on this side of the House absolutely share.
I am delighted that next week is National Apprenticeship Week.
We are absolutely committed to ensuring that more girls see a future for themselves in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
Again, that will be great for them and great for our economy.
