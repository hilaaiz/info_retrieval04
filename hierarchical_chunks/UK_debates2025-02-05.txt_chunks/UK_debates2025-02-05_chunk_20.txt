Eighty-six per cent.
of trains at Kearsley station in my constituency were delayed or cancelled in the past 12 weeks.
That is widespread through Bolton South and Walkden.
My constituent Sophie, who commutes from Walkden to Manchester, told me that “almost every day one peak time train is cancelled.
And when the train finally turns up it’s overcrowded”.
Recently, she was stranded for hours after constant cancellations because train crew were unavailable.
Can the Prime Minister reassure my constituents that this Government are committed to building reliable railways after 14 years of Tory chaos?
My hon.
Friend is right to highlight that the Conservative party left our railways in a terrible state.
Two years of strikes cost our economy £850 million in lost revenue.
You cannot grow the economy if you cannot run the railways.
We will launch Great British Railways to focus relentlessly on passengers and to clamp down on delays and cancellations.
I am pleased that Northern has announced the largest ever investment in its fleet to deliver 450 new trains, meaning more comfortable and reliable journeys for my hon.
Friend’s constituents.
