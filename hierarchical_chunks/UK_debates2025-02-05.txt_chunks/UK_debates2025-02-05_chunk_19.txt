I thank the hon.
Gentleman for steadfastly raising this really important issue, particularly during Children’s Mental Health Week.
I have met the 3 Dads Walking.
They are inspirational and their courage is extraordinary.
As the father of young children, I do not know how they are able to campaign in the way that they do.
I am not sure I would be able to do so.
Of course, I can assure the hon.
Gentleman that I will meet them again and push this really important agenda forward.
