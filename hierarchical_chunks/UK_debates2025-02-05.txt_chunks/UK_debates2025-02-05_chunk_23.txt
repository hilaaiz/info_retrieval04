The Prime Minister can waffle for as long as he likes, but we know that Labour promised to bring energy bills down by £300.
Instead, bills are going up.
He is freezing pensioners while shovelling money to Mauritius.
The Prime Minister is not just managing decline; he is creating decline.
He has the power to grant these licences, open these oil and gas fields, save British jobs and bring down bills.
Why does he find it so hard to do the right thing?
She really needs to look into how these licences are granted.
I appreciate that the Conservatives’ reset seems to be having no policies apart from cutting pensions, and having no briefings on relevant issues.
Let us just remind ourselves that they presided over the biggest drop in living standards on record.
Mortgages went through the roof, and they left a £22 billion black hole.
We learned last weekend that, under the last Government, £35 billion was lost on benefit fraud and error.
Who was in the Treasury at the time?
The shadow Business Secretary,  the hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) , and the Leader of the Opposition.
They want to give lectures.
No thanks!
The hon.
Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage) says that his party is “open to anything” when it comes to changing our NHS and open to an “insurance-based system”.
Will my right hon.
and learned Friend confirm that under a Labour Government the NHS will be there for everyone when they need it, not having to worry about the bill?
The NHS is the lifeblood of our country, and that is why we invested £25 billion at the Budget—a record amount—and are making it fit for the future through our plan for change.
What a contrast with Reform, whose leader has said that those who can afford to pay should pay for healthcare.
Under Labour, the NHS will always be free at the point at use for anyone who needs it.
