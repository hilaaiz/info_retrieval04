Eighty-six per cent.
of trains at Kearsley station in my constituency were delayed or cancelled in the past 12 weeks.
That is widespread through Bolton South and Walkden.
My constituent Sophie, who commutes from Walden to Manchester, told me that “almost every day one peak time train is cancelled.
And when the train finally turns up it’s overcrowded”.
Recently, she was stranded for hours after constant cancellations because train crew were unavailable.
Can the Prime Minister reassure my constituents that this Government are committed to building reliable railways after 14 years of Tory chaos?
Before we begin, I wish to make a short statement about the House’s sub judice resolution.
There is a question on the Order Paper concerning special educational needs and disabilities provision.
There are legal proceedings relating to the policy of applying VAT to private schools, and relating in particular to SEND provision.
These cases concern a matter that is currently before the House and of national importance.
I am therefore exercising my discretion to allow reference to these cases now and in future proceedings.
