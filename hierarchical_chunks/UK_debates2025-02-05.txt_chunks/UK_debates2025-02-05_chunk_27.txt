Eighty-three proud pottery workers woke up on Monday morning with no job, following the collapse of the 200-year-old Royal Stafford pottery firm.
It is a crisis in our ceramics industry, with escalating prices for energy, and fake and foreign imports causing a real problem.
Will the Prime Minister, through his offices, arrange for the energy companies to meet Ceramics UK and the GMB, as the voice of the workforce, so that we can hammer out a new deal?
Will he promote, through public procurement, buying British so that proud manufacturing jobs in Stoke can be protected?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for raising this really important issue.
It is obviously a question of jobs, but it is also a question of identity and a sense of place.
Of course we will work with the energy companies and have the relevant meetings, as he suggests.
Agnes lives in my Bicester and Woodstock constituency.
In 2019, when she was nine, she was referred by her GP to child and adolescent mental  health services.
Agnes has had to wait more than five years for an assessment for the neurodiversity that has caused her crushing mental health problems.
Last year, when Agnes’s dad, Jim, sought to accelerate her appointment, he was told that CAMHS could not see her or prioritise her appointment “unless Agnes is actively trying to kill herself.”
Jim asked me to raise this case because he wants to ensure that no other child goes through the same experience as his daughter.
Will the Prime Minister meet Agnes, Jim and me to hear their story?
