The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 5 February.
I know the whole House will be appalled by the death of a young boy in Sheffield on Monday.
Our hearts go out to his family and his loved ones.
Knife crime blights our communities and we redouble every step to ensure that young people are kept safe.
On Monday, I met other European leaders in Brussels to discuss the vitally important focus on security and defence in a volatile world.
I am determined to reduce barriers to trade, making it easier for businesses to do business and ensuring that a better relationship with our European partners delivers for the British people.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in the House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
Sadly, suicide is the biggest killer of young people under 35.
Andy Airey, Tim Owen and Mike Palmer are the 3 Dads Walking.
They each tragically lost their precious daughters, Sophie, Emily and Beth, to suicide.
They have campaigned tirelessly for suicide prevention to be included in the school curriculum in an age-appropriate way.
We met the previous Prime Minister in Downing Street and suicide prevention was added to the relationships, sex and health education curriculum guidance for consultation last year.
I know that the Prime Minister has met the three dads and supports their campaign, but sadly progress has stalled.
Will the Prime Minister please meet me and the three dads so that we can finally get this over the line and ultimately save young lives?
