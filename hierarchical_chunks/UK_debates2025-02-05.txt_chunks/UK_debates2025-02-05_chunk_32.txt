I thank my hon.
Friend for his important question.
It was a delight to appear before his Committee to discuss other matters just a few weeks ago.
This treaty reflects both parties’ shared commitment to uphold international environmental law, including high conservation standards across the archipelago.
Mauritius has expressed dedication to marine conservation and has aligned its global initiatives to protect 30% of  marine areas by 2030 and its commitments under the sustainable development goals, and establishing a fit-for-purpose marine protected area is a crucial part of that.
We will work with Mauritius very closely on this matter.
It was a very important part of the discussions, and I am very glad we have been able to make the agreements that we have.
