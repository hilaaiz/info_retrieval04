I thank the hon.
Member for raising this important issue.
Women and babies deserve the highest standards of care through pregnancy, birth and the months that follow.
We are committed to recruiting thousands of new midwives for the NHS while providing support to trusts that are failing on maternity care.
We are working with the NHS as it delivers a three-year maternity plan, which is making good progress in improving services, including for his constituents.
