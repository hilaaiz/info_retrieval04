I put on record the deep concern of the Liberal Democrats at the way this deal has progressed.
We accept the ICJ ruling.
I thought there was a consensus across the House on the importance of the UK upholding the rule of law, so I am bemused by the confected consternation of those on the Conservative Benches.
It was the then Foreign Secretary,  the right hon.
Member for Braintree (Mr Cleverly) , who in 2022 stated: “it is our intention to secure an agreement on the basis of international law to resolve all outstanding issues”—[Official Report,  3 November 2022 ; Vol. 721, c. 27WS.]
But under this Labour Government, Chagossians have been ignored, Parliament is without a say, and the lack of foresight on how the US presidential election might affect the deal is troubling.
After failing to force through an agreement, Ministers have now given Donald Trump a say about the future of sovereign British territory.
Can the Minister confirm that before signature, this House will be given a vote on the terms of the final deal, in particular to see how UK security interests have been protected?
I have set out on a number of occasions why the deal is right for our national security interests and those of our allies.
I have also set out very clearly the normal process.
It will go through Parliament.
