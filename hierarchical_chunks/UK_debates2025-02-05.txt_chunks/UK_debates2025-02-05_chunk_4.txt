We welcome the Government’s mission to halve violence against women and girls, but a recent report from the National Audit Office makes grim reading, stating that one in 12 women are victims of violence every year and that there were more than 2 million victims in the year up to June 2024.
It also suggests while there is a welcome focus on victims, we are not doing enough in terms of prevention.
How will the Minister ensure that this mission will focus on education and prevention in schools as well as seeking to support every survivor, and is she speaking to the Scottish Government about co-ordination?
The hon.
Lady is right to draw attention to the legacy picture painted by the National Audit Office.
We are investing in a new national policing centre for VAWG public protection, and ensuring that we have a real focus on tackling high-risk offenders by intervening much earlier and taking further measures involving domestic abuse specialists.
However, as the hon.
Lady says, this is also about prevention.
It is a responsibility for all of us across society, men and women alike, and there is an important role for education.
Work is under way in the Department for Education to ensure that young people, from an early point, understand healthy relationships and what consent looks like.
Of course, I am always happy to discuss that with colleagues across the UK.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help reduce the gender pay gap.
Women’s equality and economic growth go hand in hand.
Because the progress on closing the gender pay gap stalled under the last Government, as part of the Employment Rights Bill we are requiring  large employers to publish gender pay gap action plans alongside their figures to show what they are doing to tackle pay disparity.
