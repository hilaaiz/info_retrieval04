I thank  the hon.
Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran)  for securing this urgent question; it is indeed urgent.
At the UN, the UK called for Israel to abide by UNSC resolution 2286 on the protection of civilians and healthcare.
It is clear that Israel is not abiding by that resolution, so with the words having been uttered and ignored, what will the Government now do to ensure that Israel is held to account for its actions?
