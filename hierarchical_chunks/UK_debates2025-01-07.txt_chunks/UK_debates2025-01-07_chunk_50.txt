I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and her kind words.
The House will be bored of hearing me say it, but we do not comment on sanctions measures in advance of taking them, as doing so would reduce their impact, but I welcome the opportunity to make a brief comment on the proceedings of the Knesset.
There is much said in other Parliaments with which we do not agree.
We are clear that obligations under international humanitarian law, and diplomatic obligations, fall on the Israeli Government.
We are clear with the Israeli Government on their obligations under international humanitarian law, and we are clear about our policy position.
I will refrain from providing detailed commentary on the proceedings of another Parliament.
