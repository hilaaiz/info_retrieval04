I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for writing to me before Christmas.
I recognise the pressures that have been placed on NHS commissioners in recent years and the pressure that that has put on service configurations.
I tend to support the devolution of decision making, with decisions about service reconfigurations taken closer to the communities they serve.
I recognise also that commissioners do not always get it right, which is why engagement with Members of Parliament and other democratically elected representatives is important.
Ministerial oversight is important, too.
We will look seriously at the issues he raises and talk to NHS leaders, and I know he will be doing the same.
This Government are determined to give NHS leaders the tools to do the job, so that we can get the right care in the right place at the right time, with a better experience for patients and better value for taxpayers.
