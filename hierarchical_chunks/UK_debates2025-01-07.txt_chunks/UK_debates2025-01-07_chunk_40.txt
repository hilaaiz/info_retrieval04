Thank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this question.
I also thank  the hon.
Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran)  for all the work that she has done trying to highlight the horrors that are going on in the region.
What assessment have the Government made of Israel’s action in the Netzarim corridor, which Israel has cleared of Palestinian civilians in order to construct military roads and positions.
One senior Israeli official told Haaretz that the area had been designated as a “kill zone”, with anyone who enters being shot.
The same officer told Haaretz that civilians were knowingly killed and later designated as terrorists.
With competitions between military units regarding who can cause the most casualties, what assessment has the Minister made of these alleged war crimes, and can he tell me what we are doing to document and to stop them?
Mr Speaker, as you would expect, my Department takes careful stock of all reports, including those that my hon.
Friend mentions, and we include them as part of our regular assessments.
We have concluded one of those assessments recently, and I have already updated the House on that.
