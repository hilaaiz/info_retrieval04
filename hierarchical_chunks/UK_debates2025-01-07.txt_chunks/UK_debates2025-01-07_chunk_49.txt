I thank you, Mr Speaker, for granting this urgent question, and I thank my hon.
Friend for all his hard work in these difficult situations.
Eight members of the Knesset have penned a letter to the Israeli Defence Minister demanding that Israel destroy all sources of water, food and energy for Palestinians in Gaza.
They argue that Israel should do to the rest of Gaza what it has been doing to the north.
Will the Government ban entry of those eight Knesset members, who are openly calling for the extermination of Palestinians in Gaza?
