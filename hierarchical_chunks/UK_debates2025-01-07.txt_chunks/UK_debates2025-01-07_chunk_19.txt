Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
[Interruption.]
I am sorry—that is the last time I will get called.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Yesterday, in relation to the elective backlog, the Secretary of State said: “Where we can treat working people faster, we will, and we make no apology for doing so.”—[Official
Report,  6 January 2025 ; Vol. 759, c. 597.]
Labour politicians have struggled to define what they mean by working people, but his words have caused anxiety.
Will he reassure those with disabilities that prevent them from working and retired elderly people who have worked all their lives that they will not be pushed to the back of the queue and that treatment will continue to be provided in the NHS on the basis of clinical need?
Of course, clinical need is paramount and must always drive decision making about who to treat when and the order in which people are treated.
That is why I find the question posed so deeply disingenuous.
[Interruption.]
We inherited NHS waiting lists at record levels and waiting times that are frankly shameful.
The shadow Minister should be apologising for her party’s record, and she should also apologise for the two-tier healthcare system that sees those who can afford it paying to go private and those who cannot afford it—working-class people—being left behind.
That is the two-tier system that the Government are determined to end.
Order.
Can we be a bit careful with the language we are using?
