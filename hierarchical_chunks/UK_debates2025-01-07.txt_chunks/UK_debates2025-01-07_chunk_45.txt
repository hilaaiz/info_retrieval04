We could not be clearer, either publicly or privately, about what expectations fall on Israel in relation to health provision.
I have raised these issues, the Foreign Secretary has raised these issues, and my ministerial colleagues have raised these issues.
It is a source of enormous frustration to the ministerial team that, this far into the conflict, we are still having to raise these issues, and we will continue to do so until there is some resolution.
And that resolution must enable greater healthcare for the Palestinians of Gaza and the wider region.
Mr Speaker, you and I have been through this rigmarole many times over the past 14 months.
I was going to ask today about the fate of Dr Abu Safiya, but I think we all know what will happen to him.
I was going to ask about the babies who are freezing to death while blankets are being denied entry into Gaza, but I do not think we will be able to do much about that.
The same applies to the denial of access for cancer medication, anaesthetic, or crutches or, indeed, the bombing of every single hospital.
