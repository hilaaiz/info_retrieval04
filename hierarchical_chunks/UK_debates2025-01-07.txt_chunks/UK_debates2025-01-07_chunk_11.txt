I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for his campaigning on this important issue—and indeed for speaking so honestly about his own experiences during his time in this House.
An additional £267 million has been invested this year to improve the quality and capacity of drug and alcohol treatment and recovery.
We are committed to correcting the years of disinvestment in treatment and recovery services and ensuring that people can access the support they need.
