I am sure my right hon.
Friend will share my delight at the fact that in our growing community of Thanet, the NHS is looking to open the Thanet integrated hub in one of the most deprived parts of Kent.
However, Tory-run Kent county council has put in spurious objections to the development.
Does he share my concern that such unnecessary objections block access to healthcare and make it harder for the Government and the NHS to cut waiting lists?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for the work she is doing to improve health and care services for her constituents.
The Government are giving health and care providers the tools to do the job.
Of course, change will take time, and it is therefore crucial that we all pull together locally and nationally.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Government are on the side of the builders, not the blockers.
The NHS Confederation has said that for the Government to be able to drive down waiting lists, “the pause to the delivery of the new hospitals programme must be as short as possible and NHS leaders need clarity about timelines.”
With that in mind, will the Secretary of State tell leaders at Eastbourne district general hospital, as well as our community in Eastbourne, precisely when the new hospital programme review will be completed so that we can get cracking with our upgrades?
