The last Government treated mental health as a Cinderella service, with my constituents waiting days in A&E to be admitted to hospital mental health wards.
The Solace Centre in Ealing Southall provides help and support in the community for those with mental health problems, at a fraction of the cost of a hospital stay.
How does the Minister intend to move more mental health services from hospital to the community, and to create more great services like the Solace Centre?
