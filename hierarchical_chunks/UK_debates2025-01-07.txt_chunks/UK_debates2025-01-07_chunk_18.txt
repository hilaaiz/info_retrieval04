I thank the hon.
Member for that question.
I agree with him about the need for clarity as well as consistency.
We undertook the review into the new hospital programme because the previous Government’s timetable was a work of fiction and the money was not there.
I hope to report to him and to the House shortly on that, with the undertaking that the timetable we publish and the funding provided by the Chancellor in the Budget and at the spending review will mean that we will provide not just clarity but consistency, which is important for NHS leaders, important for patients and important for the construction industry partners we need to work with.
