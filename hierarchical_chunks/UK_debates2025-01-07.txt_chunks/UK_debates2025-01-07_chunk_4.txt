I thank the Secretary of State for his answer on the critical issue of access to GPs in primary healthcare.
My constituency of Barking is woefully under-served by primary healthcare, and especially by GPs.
On average, each GP looks after 2,000 patients; the national average is 1,600.
In particular, the area of Barking Riverside has no GP services.
Will the Secretary of State meet me to discuss this matter, so that the thousands of homes that are being built will also have a primary healthcare facility on site?
