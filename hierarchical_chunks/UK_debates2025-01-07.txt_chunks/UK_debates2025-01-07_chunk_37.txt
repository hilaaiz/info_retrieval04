I thank  the hon.
Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran)  for securing this urgent question.
Innocent civilians in Gaza are suffering and the situation is desperate; everyone in the House recognises that and we all want aid and support to reach them.
Does the Minister also recognise that innocent civilians are being used continuously as human shields by Hamas, which has no regard for their safety or welfare?
There are no excuses for the current situation.

Perhaps  the hon.
Member for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East (Andy McDonald)  can listen to my comments and then he can comment afterwards.
