Dentistry is a key part of primary care, yet an estimated 5 million people in England have been left without an NHS dentist.
That is why today a petition is being handed in at Downing Street signed by more than a quarter of a million people.
We have moved on from the election, but we do not yet have a timetable for when the negotiations for a new NHS dental contract will begin and when another 700,000 extra urgent appointments will be rolled out.
Can the Secretary of State confirm the timetable for those improvements?
What specifically are the Government’s plans for the new patient premium, and will he offer assurances to dentists that any changes to the current model will be outlined in detail to them as soon as possible?

We are determined to give dentists the tools to do the job so that patients can see a dentist when they need one.
