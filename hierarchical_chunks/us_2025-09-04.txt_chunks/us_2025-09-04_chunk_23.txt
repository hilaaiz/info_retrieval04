Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable landmark of our history from my hometown.
For 150 years, the South Dayton Depot has been a center of connection, culture, and community spirit.
Since its founding in 1875, the South Dayton Depot has welcomed generations of travelers and neighbors, serving first as a vital hub for freight and passenger service, and now as a museum where history is preserved for generations to come.
The South Dayton Depot has not only preserved our community's railroad heritage, but has also become a gathering place where neighbors connect and visitors experience the rich story of our region.
From its role in major motion pictures like The Natural and Planes, Trains and Automobiles, to its continued service through the Movie and Rail Museum, the South Dayton Depot stands as a living link between our past and present.
On September 6, 2025, the Village of South Dayton will celebrate the South Dayton Depot's 150th anniversary with a community celebration that honors both its historic legacy and its enduring role as the heart of the village.
Thanks to the dedication of local leaders,
