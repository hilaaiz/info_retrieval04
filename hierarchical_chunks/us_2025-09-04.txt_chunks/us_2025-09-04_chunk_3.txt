Mr. GOODEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of The Rock Church of Terrell's 20th anniversary and to congratulate Pastor Gary Weems on his retirement and transition to a senior bishop role.
Since its founding in 2005, The Rock Church of Terrell has been a symbol of love, hope, and faith to people from all walks of life in my hometown of Terrell, Texas.
Pastor Gary began his ministry in Terrell in 1996, immediately offering himself and his family to the enrichment of our community.
Alongside his wife, Jodi, Pastor Gary has dedicated his life to the service of the body of Christ and full-time ministry for 48 years.
His faithfulness and love have made a profound and enduring impact on the Terrell community.
In his absence, The Rock Church of Terrell will welcome a new generation of pastoral leadership.
Pastor Gary's son, Ben, will assume the role of Senior Pastor, continuing his father's legacy of dedicated service.
I wish the best for Pastor Ben and his wife, Chelsea, and Associate Pastor Bodie Jones and his wife, Stephanie, as they embark on this new journey.
