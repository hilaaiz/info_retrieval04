Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Phillip Douglas Morgan of Flora, Mississippi.
Phillip Morgan was a Mississippian through and through who gave back to his community and loved his family.
Meeting people was a passion of Phillip's, and he never met a stranger.
Phillip grew up in rural Mississippi and was a graduate of Mississippi schools.
He studied accounting at the University of Southern Mississippi and had a 10-year career as an accountant.
Hired by Southern Ag Credit to work as their Chief Financial and Operating Officer, Phillip worked his way to CEO in 2020.
He took his skills and passion of people and saw the Southern Ag Credit team as his extended family.
Phillip was a family man who spent time with his wife Christy and his two daughters at their hunting club, cheered his daughters on in horse shows and cheer camps, and also enjoyed vacationing with extended family.
With a passion for fostering rescue horses, Phillip worked closely with the MS Horse Rescue.
His support for the Dixie National Rodeo, Ducks Unlimited, and Heart of the Horse were passion projects of his.
Phillip will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and the Southern Ag Credit family.
I was honored to have had the opportunity to work alongside him through the years.
His dedication to the Ag industry will continue through his legacy.
