Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Christina O'Rear on her retirement after 30 years of distinguished service in law enforcement.
Officer O'Rear earned both an associate's degree in Law Enforcement and a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Lamar University.
She holds the designation of Master Peace Officer and has completed more than 2,500 hours of training.
Throughout her career, she has been recognized with multiple certifications, awards, and commendations for her professionalism and dedication.
Since joining the Grapevine Police Department, Officer O'Rear has served her community with distinction in numerous roles, including Patrol Officer, Detective, Victim Liaison, and member of the Honor Guard.
She has also contributed as a Task Force Officer with the Tarrant County Narcotics Task Force and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Beyond her investigative and enforcement duties, she has provided critical support as a Peer Support, CISM, and Mental Health Coordinator, roles that reflect her compassion for both her colleagues and the community she served.
She currently serves as Co-Regional Director of the Texas Crisis Intervention Association and as Regional Director of the Texas Law Enforcement Peer Network.
As Officer O'Rear retires at the end of August, we celebrate a career defined by integrity, service, and leadership.
I thank Officer Christina O'Rear for her three decades of outstanding service to the Grapevine community and to the State.
