D.C. Summer Internship Program now offers fully funded experiential learning for young people pursuing careers in public service.
From groundbreaking scholarships to hands-on education, the Dirksen Congressional Center continues to advance understanding of Congress while forging strong partnerships nationwide.
Its pioneering efforts have made it a cornerstone institution for those who study, teach, and practice American democracy.
As we commemorate this remarkable milestone, I want to recognize the staff, leadership, and patrons of the Dirksen Congressional Center for their dedication, vision, and enduring service to our Nation.
I congratulate the Dirksen Congressional Center on 50 years of advancing civics, scholarship, and public service.
May the next 50 years strengthen its vital mission of connecting Americans to their Congress and history.
