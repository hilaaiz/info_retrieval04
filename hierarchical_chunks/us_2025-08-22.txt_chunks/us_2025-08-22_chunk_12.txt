Mr. MENENDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of one of the most iconic albums in American music history, Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen.
Released on August 25, 1975, this landmark album did more than launch a young songwriter from Long Branch, New Jersey into stardom; it became the soundtrack for countless Americans and an anthem for all those blessed to call New Jersey home.
Songs like ``Thunder Road'', ``Jungleland'', and the titular ``Born to Run'' demonstrate Springsteen's unmatched ability to blend vivid storytelling set in the incredible mosaic that is New Jersey with the generational musical talent of the E Street Band.
Born to Run has stood the test of time and is remembered today as a timeless masterpiece about our daily struggles and chasing our dreams no matter the odds.
Over the past five decades, Bruce Springsteen has become more than just an iconic artist.
He is a staple of American culture.
Known as ``The Boss'', he has sold more than 150 million records, won 20 Grammy Awards, and been awarded the Presidential Medal.
His philanthropic efforts supporting food banks, veteran organizations, and anti-poverty initiatives reflect the values of compassion, solidarity and looking after each other that have always been the foundation of his music.
And even with all of his success, you can still find him near the streets, venues, boardwalks and people that shaped him and his music.
