Mr. Speaker, I honor the dedicated work of FIA to serve and uplift the Indian-American community, sustain the legacy of Indian heritage across generations, and foster cross-cultural cooperation and understanding.
FIA's activities benefit all the communities in which its members reside, and for that, we are all grateful.
