Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, today I wish to recognize the Federation of Indian Associations (FIA) as it commemorates India's 78 years of independence.
Since FIA's establishment in 1970, its mission has been to serve the Indian-American community, promote Indian cultural heritage, and advance bilateral ties between the United States and India.
Over the course of five decades, FIA has organized numerous outreach events to provide community support and to celebrate Indian culture and heritage.
FIA's efforts have included consular document service assistance for over 11,000 community members, cultural dance competitions that have engaged over 19,000 children in celebration of their heritage, and an annual Diwali Soup Kitchen, which has successfully distributed thousands of meals throughout the Northeastern United States.
Furthermore, FIA helped to distribute personal protective equipment and hot meals to first responders and community members during the COVID-19 pandemic.
