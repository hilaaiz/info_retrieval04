Mr. Speaker, the 50th anniversary of Born to Run is not just a celebration of an album, it is a recognition of Bruce Springsteen's enduring impact on our country.
For more than half a century he has given voice to the struggles and aspirations of the people we encounter in all our lives--the dreamers and the believers, the down-but-not-out, and the men and women whose stars may have faded but still burn inside them.
But perhaps what separates Springsteen from his peers is that he continues to create music that captures the moment and times we are in.
On behalf of the people of New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District, and the millions of Springsteen fans worldwide, it is a privilege to honor this important anniversary and to thank him for all his contributions to our country, and most notably, to the great Garden State.
