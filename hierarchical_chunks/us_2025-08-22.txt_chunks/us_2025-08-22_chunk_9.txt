Hultgren continues his mission by ensuring that our veterans receive the support they fought for.
Sgt.
Hultgren has been with Veteran Services for seven years, and he has been manager for three of those years.
Everyone he's served knows that he's gone above and beyond for our nation and community.
His wife of 22 years and their three children all reside in my community, and we are proud of their family's faith and resilience.
