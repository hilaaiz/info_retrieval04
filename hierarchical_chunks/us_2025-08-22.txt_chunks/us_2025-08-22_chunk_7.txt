Mr. MAST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American hero, Sergeant Rohn Hultgren of Palm Beach County, Florida.
Sgt.
Hultgren is a father, husband, soldier, and public servant whose courage on the battlefield and commitment to my community deserves our recognition.
During his service in Afghanistan, Sgt.
Hultgren's convoy was struck by an improvised explosive device.
The blast left him with a broken femur and a traumatic brain injury.
As a result, Sgt.
Hultgren underwent extensive speech therapy, but he never wavered in his devotion to our Nation or his fellow soldiers.
For his sacrifice and bravery, he was awarded the Purple Heart.
