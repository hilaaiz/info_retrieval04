to, constituents.
The research and analysis that CMF performed for the Gold Mouse Awards identified the most innovative and effective web page practices and then shared that critical information with all Congressional offices so they could benefit everyone.
In 2018, Brad's vision for establishing an ``Academy Awards'' for Congress provided the spark for the creation of CMF's Democracy Awards program.
The Democracy Awards, in a similar approach to the Gold Mouse Awards before them, are presented to both staff and members to acknowledge their exemplary use of best management practices, constituent services and transparency.
By shining a spotlight on these leaders, the awards showcase their skills and practices for others to utilize and improve on.
Through his tenure at CMF, Brad has carefully stewarded its strong reputation for nonpartisan work strengthening the management skills and workplace practices in Congress while building public understanding and trust in the legislative branch.
Brad has been a lifelong advocate for the institution of Congress, members, and staff and we thank him for his dedication and work on our behalf.
