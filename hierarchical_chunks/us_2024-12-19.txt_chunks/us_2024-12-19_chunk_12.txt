Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Matthews-Vu Medical Group in Colorado Springs, led by Doctor Richard Vu and his wife Doctor Shabnum MatthewsVu.
The Matthews-Vu Medical Group has served the Pikes Peak region with a focus on the underserved in our community, offering many low-cost medical solutions for those most vulnerable.
Dr. Vu was born in Vietnam and moved to the United States as a young boy with his mother and siblings, living in Chicago near his father.
The circumstances of his upbringing instilled in him a hard wark ethic and desire to serve those around him who are underserved, especially those on welfare and receiving govemmental aide.
Dr. Vu and Dr. Matthews-Vu, who grew up in East Meadows, New York, met at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, where they both received their medical degrees.
Dr. Vu completed his residency in Internal Medicine at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago, while Dr. Matthews-Vu completed her residency in Pediatrics at the University.
After residency, the couple first lived in Arizona and then moved to Colorado Springs in 2004 with their family, they began their medical practice shortly after the move.
Originally founded with only two and a half physicians and a small and modest office in 2004, the Matthews-Vu Medical Group has grown to over sixty providers in five locations with a broad range of specialties and medical skills.
Specializing in serving our community and patients who are on government plans such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, the Matthews-Vu Medical Group has become a beacon of help for those in our community who need affordable medical care that is provided with an intentionally caring and loving heart.
