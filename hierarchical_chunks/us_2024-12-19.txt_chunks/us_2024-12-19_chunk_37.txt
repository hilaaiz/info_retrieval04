Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, Americans are grateful for the service of American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC)
Secretary Charles K. Djou who provided welcome remarks of the Commemoration of the 80th Anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge at the Luxembourg American Cemetery on December 14, 2024.
With his AMBC leadership, American cemeteries worldwide are a permanent recognition of affection for servicemembers recognizing Freedom Is Not Free.
When Americans liberate nations from oppression, it is not for occupation as we request only to have sufficient acreage to bury valiant American patriots.
