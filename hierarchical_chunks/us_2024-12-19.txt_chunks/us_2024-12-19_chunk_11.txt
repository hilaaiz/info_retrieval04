Omaha Beach, and stormed Pointe du Hoc, scaling 100-foot cliffs, neutralizing the German guns above.
He continued his mission across Europe, fighting in this very battle, the Battle of the Bulge.
And the relevance of this Battle is just as important today as it was 80 years ago.
History can repeat itself once again.
We are witnessing the largest land invasion in Europe since 1939 with Russian aggression in Ukraine and Eastern Europe.
We are also witnessing the rise rearing his ugly head.
We are witnessing a world on fire and a battle again between good and evil.
The significance of this battle must serve as a reminder that Freedom is Never Free.
In that the democracies around the world must rally to the cause of freedom when it is under attack.
We do not choose our enemies.
They choose us.
And just as we fought the Nazis during World War Two, we will continue to fight for freedom and democracy.
It is our duty to take the lessons learned from our fathers, grandfathers in history, to preserve what these men fought for.
In a time of great peril, these men fought against tyranny and oppression, to preserve freedom.
History will always remember them as the greatest generation, may God bless our veterans, the fallen heroes of the Battle of the Bulge, the great people of Bastogne, and the United States of America, and may He hold them in the palm of his hand.
Thank you.
