Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to participate in CODEL McCaul for the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.
An inspiring speech was delivered by Brigadier General Andrew Saslav at the Bastogne War Museum, Belgium, on December 13, 2024, confirming the professionalism and dedication of the American military freedom and democracy.
