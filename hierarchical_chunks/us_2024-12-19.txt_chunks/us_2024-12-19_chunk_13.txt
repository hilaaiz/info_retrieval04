This commitment to the individual and family of every patient is evident in the way both Dr. Vu and Dr. Matthews-Vu live their lives and have raised their family.
The love they share for each other and their family is obvious in the way they interact with each other and every patient.
They are most attentive to their patients and prioritize their needs above everything else.
Their passion for medical excellence and patient service is driven by their mission statement: ``Providing the highest quality of compassionate care for patients from all walks of life.''
Dr. Vu and his team ensure that everyone who walks through their door, regardless of their background or financial means, will get the medical care they need and deserve.
In 2020 the Matthews-Vu Medical Group opened their own processing center to process COVID-19 tests, prioritizing speed, accuracy, and service to our community in the midst of the pandemic.
Their processing center allowed many other businesses in the community, including medical and dental, to remain open during the pandemic.
Dr. Vu and Dr. Matthews-Vu have three children.
Their family continues to exemplify the love of Jesus Christ to everyone around them.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in Congress join me in honoring and celebrating the Matthews-Vu Medical Group and Dr. Richard Vu and Dr. Shabnum Matthews-Vu for their dedicated and Christ honoring service to the Pikes Peak region.
