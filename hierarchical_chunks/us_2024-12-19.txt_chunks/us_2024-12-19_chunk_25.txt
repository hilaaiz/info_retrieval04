Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity today to highlight the deep, widespread and heartfelt appreciation shared by many across Ocean County, New Jersey for their extraordinary County Clerk, Scott Colabella, who will retire at the end of this month after a lifetime of outstanding public service to our New Jersey communities.
Scott is a great American patriot.
His story of commitment, dedication and outstanding work on behalf of New Jersey citizens--and his leadership in securing foolproof, reliable elections--belongs in our Nation's congressional record, the official written history of this country since the Continental Congress.
I first met Scott in the early days of my campaigns and congressional service.
In fact, Scott was among one of my first congressional interns in my freshman term in the 97th Congress in 1981.
Serving in my Washington, D.C. office, Scott proved to be an outstanding worker, assisting me in the delivery of top-notch constituent service and legislative analysis.
After working on Capitol Hill and graduating from Rider University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science, Scott began a career of public service rewarded with promotions, achievements and advancement over the course of the next several decades.
