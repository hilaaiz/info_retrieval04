Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, along with Representative Mike Thompson to recognize and honor Erin Hannigan on the occasion of her retirement after an illustrious career of public service, leadership, and commitment to the Vallejo, Solano County communities and beyond.
Erin is a lifelong resident of Solano County and a proud member of the Vallejo community.
Her dedication and service have left a profound and lasting impact on those around her.
Throughout her career, Erin held numerous significant roles that enriched her community.
Her journey in public service began as a member of the Vallejo Community Development Commission, where she played a key role in distributing Community Development Block Grant funds to benefit neighborhoods and organizations in Vallejo.
In 2004, she facilitated the relocation of a national insurance company's call center to the Vallejo Waterfront, creating 220 local jobs.
In 2007, Erin was elected to the Vallejo City Council, where she guided the city through challenging economic times with resilience and a balanced approach to addressing budget deficits.
She championed critical initiatives to improve quality of life, including revising commercial truck routes, introducing the Chronic Nuisance Ordinance, and supporting smoke-free city parks.
Erin's commitment to public service continued when she was elected to the Solano County Board of Supervisors, representing District 1 in November 2012.
Sworn into office in January 2013, Supervisor Hannigan worked tirelessly to bridge the services and operations of the County with the community.
Her leadership focused on public safety, homelessness, human trafficking, health care, and environmental sustainability.
One of Erin's hallmark achievements is her partnership with the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation, which has contributed an extraordinary $7.75 million over eight years to assist those in need in Solano County.
This partnership has supported a robust collection of programs, including First 5 Solano, which provides critical basic needs support to families in crisis and funds initiatives in early learning, school readiness, social engagement, and community resource information at the First 5 Center in Vallejo.
Erin Hannigan's legacy is one of integrity, leadership, and dedicated service to her community.
Her tireless efforts and unwavering commitment have left an indelible mark on Solano County and serve as an enduring inspiration to all who had the privilege of working with her or benefiting from her advocacy.
Erin's leadership and contributions will be deeply missed, but she will undoubtedly continue to inspire those who follow in her footsteps.
On behalf of the constituents of California's 4th and 8th Congressional Districts, we wish Erin best wishes in her well-earned retirement and extend our sincere gratitude for her many years of service to the community.
