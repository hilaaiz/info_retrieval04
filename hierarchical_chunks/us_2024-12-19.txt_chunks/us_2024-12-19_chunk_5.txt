war is a human endeavor, and while the Nazis had lots of armor, the troopers of the 101st had a rendezvous with destiny.
Now most of history will tell you that that siege was eventually broken on the 26th of December, at 1650 hours as Cobra King, the lead tank of Patton's Third Army reached Bastogne.
I think the troopers of the 101st would tell you that the only thing those tanks allowed him to do was continue the attack.
War is a human endeavor.
It was then, and it is now.
What the world witnessed 80 years ago is what happens when the cause of freedom is led by valiant action, a coalition and Alliance built on freedom and liberty, not conquest.
In the words of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Battle of the Bulge was a great and glorious victory.
But it is also a reminder that freedom is not free, that the price defend it.
Today, we are joined here today by veterans of that fight from 80 years ago.
And gentlemen, it is my great honor to be in your presence.
Thank you.
Your legacy is what makes our Army great today.
Thank you.
