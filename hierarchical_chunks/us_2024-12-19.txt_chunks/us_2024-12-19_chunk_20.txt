Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the members of the Maury High School Football Team from Norfolk, Virginia, on claiming their second straight Class 5 State Championship, and their first back-to-back state crown in program history.
On Saturday, December 14, 2024, the Maury Commodores won the championship game against the Briar Woods High School Falcons of Loudoun County by a score of 46-0.
Led by Coach Dyrri McCain, the Commodores closed their season undefeated, recording 15 wins, including six shutouts, and maintained a 30-game winning streak extending back to last season.
Going into the championship, Maury faced a significant disadvantage after losing one of their star players in their previous game.
Ari Watford, a defensive end committed to Clemson University, suffered a season ending injury in the semifinal game against Green Run High School on December 7.
Without Watford, the team realized they would need to step up to win the state championship and did.
Throughout the championship game, the Commodores led on offense.
Quarterback Au'Tori Newkirk scored on the first drive of the game with a 49-yard touchdown pass to receiver Lebron Bond.
In the second quarter, Newkirk passed to receiver Jahvon Wiggins, who ran the ball into the end zone for another touchdown and widened the Commodores' lead to 14-0 at halftime.
In the third quarter, they scored 32 points in less than seven minutes.
Newkirk threw four touchdown passes to Elijah Moss, Tayshawn Branche, Damon McDaniel, and another to Bond.
These young athletes made everyone in the community proud and demonstrated their ability to overcome adversity.
