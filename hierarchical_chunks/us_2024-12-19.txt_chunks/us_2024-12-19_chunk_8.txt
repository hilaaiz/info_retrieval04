Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent and friend Dr. Rachel Hardeman for her extraordinary antiracist scholarship.
Dr. Hardeman is the founding director of the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity (CARHE), and the Blue Cross Endowed Professor of Health and Racial Equity in the Division of Health Policy & Management at the University of Minnesota School.
Her tremendous work at the Center led to her being named one of TIME's 100 most influential people in the world this year.
Led by Dr. Hardeman, the team of researchers at CARHE has garnered national and international attention for their research on structural racism in healthcare.
TIME specifically recognized Dr. Hardeman's work to address America's maternal health crisis, which has focused on disparate birthing outcomes across race and how police brutality can impact pregnancy and childbirth.
Dr. Hardeman is committed to lending her expertise to shape policy that will positively impact our communities for generations to come, including Minnesota's groundbreaking Dignity in Pregnancy and Childbirth Act and the federal Momnibus Bill.
Dr. Hardeman has always placed community at the forefront of her work, and consistently partners with stakeholders to better inform her research.
A prime example is her long-standing partnership with the Black-owned Roots Community Birthing Center in North Minneapolis which has been instrumental in her research to demonstrate a culturallycentered approach to birth equity that can help address the maternal health crisis we are facing.
This honor from TIME is indicative.
Hardeman's dedication to working closely with community to produce results that are relevant not just locally, but around the country and the world.
We are very fortunate to have such a brilliant, diligent, and thoughtful leader in Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District whose work has, and undoubtedly will continue to, lead to better health outcomes in Minnesota and beyond.
