Can I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s remarks about the terrible fire in Bicester last Thursday?
I know from my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bicester and Woodstock (Calum Miller)  how deeply the close-knit community  there has been affected by this tragedy.
The firefighters Martyn Sadler and Jennie Logan were true heroes, as was Dave Chester.
I hope that the prayers and thoughts of the House are with their loved ones and the two firefighters still in hospital.
