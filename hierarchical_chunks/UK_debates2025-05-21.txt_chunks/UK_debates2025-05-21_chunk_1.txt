The Secretary of State was asked— If he will take steps to ensure that compensation is not paid to people detained using interim custody orders during the troubles in Northern Ireland.
This issue arose following the Supreme Court judgment in 2020, which found certain custody orders to be unlawful.
The amendment to the legacy Act to try to deal with that has also been found unlawful by the Northern Ireland courts, so the Government are carefully exploring how to lawfully address this complex issue, alongside our commitment to implement legacy mechanisms that are fully compliant with human rights.
I will, of course, keep the House updated.
Will the Secretary of State withhold the remedial order until he is certain that he can deliver the Prime Minister’s pledge to prevent Gerry Adams from receiving compensation?
The Government are currently considering the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the representations made to it.
I am a veteran, as many Members know, and lots of my colleagues served in Northern Ireland.
I was based in a barracks in Germany that was attacked by terrorists, so I get it, but the last Government’s legacy Act offered a path to immunity for those who committed the most appalling terrorist crimes.
Does the Secretary of State agree that it is no surprise that the legislation was so widely opposed and has been found to be unlawful?
