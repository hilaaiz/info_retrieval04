I thank my hon.
Friend for reading that victim impact statement.
I know from talking to Cheryl how hard it was for her to make that victim impact statement in the first place; it took a huge amount of courage, and grief.
She wanted to read that statement to the perpetrator, as she should have been able to do.
I know from the meetings that I have had with her how visceral the pain is to her of not having been able to do so.
I therefore thank my hon.
Friend for reading that impact statement out in the Chamber, allowing it to be heard by the whole world.
