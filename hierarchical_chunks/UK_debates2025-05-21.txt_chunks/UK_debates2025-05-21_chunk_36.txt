I thank the hon.
Gentleman for making that very perceptive observation.
I hate to say this, but I was not making a casual point; it was a considered point.
When we think about how this House continues to legislate and tax in a way that reduces economic growth, that does not celebrate a culture of entrepreneurialism and founders, and that is leading to higher employment, with 100,000 fewer people on payroll than there were a year ago, we should all look deep into our souls.
What is the endemic failure in Parliament, and of this Government in particular, that is leading so quickly to precisely those outcomes?
