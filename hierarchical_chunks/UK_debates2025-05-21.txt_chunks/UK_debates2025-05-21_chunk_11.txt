I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue, and he is absolutely right that what we do needs to be rooted in what happens on the ground.
I met the executive unit working with the police to tackle perpetrators, and they are seeing evidence of that.
The legislation for our jurisdictions can be joined up—that is absolutely right—but what has come across to me on many visits is the need to tackle what happens online.
The Online Safety Act 2023 is now being enacted through Ofcom, which undertook a consultation in Belfast recently on its draft guidance.
It proposes practical steps for online safety, and steps to tackle misogyny, pile-ons, domestic abuse and other harms.
He is absolutely right about what we can do, through our efforts on the ground, if we all work together.
