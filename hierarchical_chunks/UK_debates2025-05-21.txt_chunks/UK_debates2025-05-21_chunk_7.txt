I strongly support the petition brought forward by my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Goole and Pocklington (David Davis) .
As of this morning, it has more than 90,000 signatures, showing the strength of public feeling on this issue.
Almost a year ago, the Labour party published its manifesto, saying that it  would scrap the legacy Act, yet it has still presented no alternative.
Victims are in limbo, and veterans are in limbo.
The last Labour Government handed out letters of comfort for terrorists, but nothing for elderly veterans.
When will the Secretary of State finally show the House his plans, and how can veterans have confidence that they will get the protection they deserve?
We have begun the process of repealing and replacing the legacy Act in the proposed draft remedial order.
It will deal with the conditional immunity that was struck down by the courts, and which we came into office committed to remove because it did not command support across Northern Ireland, as it would have given immunity to terrorists, including those who killed the soldiers to whom  the right hon.
Member for Goole and Pocklington (David Davis)  referred earlier.
I intend to bring forward legislation to complete that process when parliamentary time allows, because this Government inherited a completely hopeless piece of legislation, which has been found time and again to be incompatible with our international obligations.
