I thank the Minister of State for all she does on her visits to encourage people across Northern Ireland, especially women, ladies and young girls.
What we really need in Northern Ireland is legislative change, longer sentences and more people convicted.
What discussions has she had with the Minister responsible for police and justice in Northern Ireland to ensure that, legislatively, we are moving fast to try to stop violence against women and ladies in Northern Ireland?
