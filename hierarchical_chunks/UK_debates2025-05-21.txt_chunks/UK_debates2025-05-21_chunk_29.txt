My hon.
Friend rightly and powerfully raises the broken promises of the Scottish National party on mental health services.
This is important, and we will have positive discussions with the devolved Governments to work on addressing mental health waiting times.
The SNP promised to invest in frontline mental health services, then cut them by £54 million in real terms this year.
With a record settlement in the Budget and two decades in power, the SNP is out of excuses and out of ideas.
Scotland deserves better than that.
If the Prime Minister agrees that the Israeli Government starving children to death is monstrous, why does he think it is okay for the UK to continue to sell Israel the equipment for the fighter jets to drop bombs on those starving children?
What we contribute into a pot is parts for fighter jets, and if we were to stop that, they could not be used by other countries in other conflicts, including those in which we are involved—[Interruption.]
The hon.
Member does not know the detail at all.
They are not sold directly.
They go into a pot.
If we were to stop that, they would not then be available to others around the world who desperately need them in the conflicts they are engaged in, and that is why we will not do it.
The  dementia gateway in my constituency was recently at risk of closure following £42 million-worth of budget cuts by the Conservative-run Dudley council.
The gateway is a vital service for dementia patients and their carers, providing daytime activities and advice and support from trained advisers.
Following a well-fought campaign with cross-party support, the dementia gateway has been saved.
In this Dementia Action Week, will the Prime Minister join me in congratulating Lisa and the campaigners?
Does he agree that such services are essential and that they support the Government’s mission to provide quality care in our communities close to home?
