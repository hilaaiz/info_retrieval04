I thank the right hon.
Member for raising this case not just today, but on the many occasions that he has.
It is incredibly important that we do everything we can in this case.
I have met Laila and given her my commitment to do everything I possibly can.
I have had a number of contacts myself, but I will not stop doing everything within my power to secure that release.
