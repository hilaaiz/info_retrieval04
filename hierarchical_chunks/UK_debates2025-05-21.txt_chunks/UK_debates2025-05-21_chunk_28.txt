I welcome the Government’s investment of £680 million into mental health support.
Meanwhile, in Scotland, many children in my constituency are stuck on an NHS Lothian neurodevelopmental waiting list, which only recently has seen patients referred in March 2022.
This delay can lead to poor mental health, with children ending up on a child and adolescent mental health services waiting list too.
How will the Prime Minister work with the devolved Governments to ensure faster diagnosis and greater support, so that no child across these isles grows up on a waiting list?
