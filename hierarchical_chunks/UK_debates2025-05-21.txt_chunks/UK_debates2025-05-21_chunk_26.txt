Cowards who commit these heinous crimes should face the consequences of their actions, which have a huge impact on victims’ lives.
That is why we will force offenders to attend their sentencing hearings, with longer sentences, unlimited fines and prison sanctions for those who seek to avoid facing justice.
I pay tribute again to Cheryl, who I will meet later this afternoon, for having the incredible courage to push for that change, notwithstanding the incredibly painful impact it has had on her and her family.
The Government assure us that Northern Ireland is still in the United Kingdom’s customs union.
If so, how is it that British steel can be sold to the United States tariff-free, but that same British steel if sold into Northern Ireland is subject to EU tariffs?
Why on Monday did the Prime Minister not even try to take back control over the trade laws that govern Northern Ireland?
It is important that we reduce tariffs on steel into the US market and other markets—including the EU markets—for obvious reasons.
It is also vital that we seek to ensure that we reduce any barriers in trade within the United Kingdom as a whole.
Yesterday was a step towards that.
There is further work to do, but we do want to get to that place where we can trade without those barriers in the United Kingdom.
We will continue to work on that.
