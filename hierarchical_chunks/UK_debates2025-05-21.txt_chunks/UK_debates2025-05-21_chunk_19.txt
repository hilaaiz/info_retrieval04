I thank my hon.
Friend; we are united by a shared focus on creating better life chances for our children, and I am delighted to hear that her constituents are already benefiting from our changes.
Thanks to our plan for change, we will deliver free breakfast clubs in every primary school in England.
I am determined to support parents to give every child the best start in life.
That is why we are rolling out free childcare, expanding the first 300 school-based nurseries, and delivering more family hubs.
