Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Mrs. Dolores L. Clemons on her 100th birthday.
As she celebrates her 100th birthday, her life story is a beautiful tapestry woven with love and resilience.
Born on October 8, 1924, in Coudersport, Pennsylvania, 
Mrs. Clemons is a devoted mother of nine and embodies the spirit of caring within her family and to everyone she meets.
After 21 years of service, 
Mrs. Clemons retired from Buffalo General Hospital, where she dedicated her career as a nursery technician caring for newborn and infant children and later as a nurse in the emergency room, touching the lives of countless patients with her compassionate care.
Over the years, she has witnessed many changes in her life and community, yet her love for those around her has remained a constant source of strength.
Known as the best baker in the family, she has created countless sweet memories, sharing her delicious treats with loved ones.
