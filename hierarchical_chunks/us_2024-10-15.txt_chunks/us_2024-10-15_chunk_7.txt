Mrs. Collins-Jones' culinary journey is deeply rooted in her upbringing in Buffalo, where growing up in a large family of nine instilled in her the understanding that cooking is about more than sustenance; it is about love, tradition, and togetherness.
Inspired by her mother's ability to create feasts that brought joy to their home, her passion for cooking continues to shine through every dish she serves.
Today, we celebrate 
Mrs. Kimberly Collins-Jones for her remarkable achievements, her generous spirit, and the countless lives she has touched.
Here's to 62 wonderful years and many more to come.
