Mr. Yin immigrated to the United States in the 1960s with only $100 in his pocket.
He earned a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and later purchased a struggling McDonald's in Oakland, California.
Together with his wife, he grew that single location into 30 successful franchises across Northern California.
Their business achievements enabled them to focus on philanthropy and community leadership, particularly within the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.
In 2001, 
Mr. Yin founded the Asian Pacific American Public Affairs (APAPA) organization, which promotes civic engagement, leadership, and education within the AAPI community.
APAPA's mission has expanded nationwide, with multiple chapters across the United States.
The organization provides scholarships and leadership training to empower the next generation of AAPI leaders.
