Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Battle Creek VA Medical Center for 100 years of service to our Nation's veterans.
Completed in 1924, the Battle Creek VA Medical Center was the 100th VA hospital in the United States.
When it first opened, staff and patients from the hospital farmed about 200 acres of the 675-acre property.
This activity served as therapy for the patients and allowed the hospital to be more self-sufficient.
Today, the Battle Creek VA Medical Center has a wonderful campus that includes 30 buildings that are used for patient care and administrative offices.
At its peak, the Medical Center had over 1,400 beds while today the focus is primarily on outpatient care.
As the son of a disabled WWII veteran, who received care in Battle Creek, I have experienced firsthand the critical need for ensuring that the men and women who have served our Nation receive the respect and care they have earned.
