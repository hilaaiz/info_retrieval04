Mr. Pease was recently honored as one of 25 instructors nationwide to win the Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize for Teaching Excellence.
This very prestigious and well-deserved award includes a $50,000 prize, to be shared with his school's skilled trades program.
The award was created to recognize excellence among high school skilled trades teachers.
More than 900 applications from all fifty states were submitted for the 2024 prize.
In addition to all his professional honors.
Mr. Pease serves as a mentor to his students and encourages them as he prepares them for good careers and a bright future.
He is well-respected both at school and in the Flemingsburg community.
I am honored to recognize him before the House.
