Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Citrus South Tule School on their 150-year anniversary and thank them for their significant contributions to the Porterville community.
Citrus South Tule School, an elementary school located by Lake Success, opened its doors in 1874 as a one-room schoolhouse.
For the first 140 years of its history, Citrus South Tule served the students in the immediate area of Lake Success.
In 2015, the school became part of the Porterville Unified School District.
Since its founding, Citrus South Tule has been committed to the academic success of all students.
Today, the Citrus South Tule School offers a range of programs at the forefront of educational innovation.
In 2017, the school opened its Future Ready and Qualcomm Thinkabit Labs, providing students with the opportunity to explore their interests in engineering, technology, and robotics.
Through their range of STEM opportunities, the Citrus South Tule School helps students become innovative, collaborative, and hardworking members of the Porterville community.
The Citrus South Tule School is a leader of educational innovation and attracts more than 2,500 visitors annually who come to explore their unique educational programs and scenic campus.
Over the past century, Citrus South Tule has remained committed to their mission of ensuring all students have the education they need to thrive.
It is because of the faculty and staff at Citrus South Tule School that students in the Central Valley community flourish, and I want to thank them all for creating a learning environment that helps our youth become the best they can be.
