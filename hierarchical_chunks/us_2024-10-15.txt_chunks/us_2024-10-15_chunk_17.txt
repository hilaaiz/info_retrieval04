Mr. MOORE.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to honor the exceptional accomplishments of 
Mr. Peter Jenks, who has recently been selected for the Top of Utah Military Affairs Committee's Western Big Hat Award.
This award--first given to Admiral Chester Nimitz--recognizes individuals who have demonstrated outstanding service to their community.
Anyone who knows Peter knows that there is no one more deserving of this award than he.
I know Peter best for his dedicated service to my constituents in Northern Utah, but his influence extends far beyond this narrow snapshot of his career.
Peter has served Utah's First Congressional District for three decades, working as district director for three consecutive Members.
In this role, he has been critical to the success of this office and Congressional District, especially in serving the needs of our servicemen and women at Hill Air Force Base.
Beyond work, Peter is consistently generous with his time.
He is a current board member and former president of the Utah Defense Alliance where he leads efforts to engage state and local government and military and business leaders on defense and aerospace issues.
He also serves Wolf Creek Foundation board, serving and supporting the families Peter has twice served as Honorary Commander at Hill Air Force Base, first with the 388th Fighter Wing and later with the 419th Fighter Wing and is universally loved by all who have worked with him.
Those lucky enough to know him know there is no more loyal a friend nor selfless a mentor than Peter Jenks.
It is my honor to recognize Peter's accomplishment and service for Utah's First Congressional District and our Nation's service members.
Utah and the United States are better because of his work and example.
I thank Peter for his service and sacrifice throughout the years.
He is a model of courage, selfless service, and altruism from whom we can all learn.
