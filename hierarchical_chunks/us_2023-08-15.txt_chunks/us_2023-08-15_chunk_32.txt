Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ronald ``Ronnie'' Jett, who has recently passed away, and to honor his service to Virginia's First District and the Nation.
Ronnie served as a life member on the Northumberland Rescue Squad and is a recipient of the Michael B. Player Award for excellence in EMS.
His service to his community continued with the Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department, where he served as an active member for nearly four decades.
He has also been recognized as a life member for this service.
In January 1996, Ronnie was sworn into office for the Northumberland County Board of Supervisors for District 5.
While on the Board he acted as Vice Chair for six years, Chairman for eighteen years, Emergency Services Director for eighteen years, and liaison for the Board to the Northern Neck Regional Jail since July 2000.
His work on the Board includes enhancements to the County 911 System, obtaining funding for the Fire Department, construction of school complexes, athletic fields, and first responder facilities.
His loyalty and care for the citizens and staff was clearly visible through his work to better his County.
Ronnie was a family man who survived by his wife, Linda S. Jett, daughters, Carrie Jo Jett and Kelly Morgan Jett, stepdaughters Kristi and Carlina; eight grandchildren, Kyndal, Karter, Haleigh, Michael, Keith, Macey, Dallas, and Michael Jr.; sister, Patsy Basye, and numerous caring nieces, nephews, and cousins.
He was preceded in death by his mother and father, Doris and Wilson Jett, and his brothers, Mitchell and Michael Jett.
He could often be found spending time with his dog, Mia, or on his boat with family when he was away from his businesses, Smith Point Seafood and Cockrells Creek Deli.
