the course of his career, General Higer has piloted 40 different types of aircraft and accrued over 3,000 military flight hours.
General Higer is concluding his admirable career at Edwards Air Force Base as commander of the 412th Test Wing, but this was not his first time in what is first time in California's ``Aerospace Valley''.
He first came here as a student-pilot in 2003, attending the world-famous U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School and setting himself apart from the rest of his class with his skill and tenacity.
While he went on to fulfill different roles around the country, General Higer couldn't stay away from Edwards AFB for long.
He returned in 2017 and served as Commandant for the same test pilot school he graduated from as a young soldier, and later ascended to the position of Commander for the 412th Test Wing.
Under his leadership, Edwards Air Force Base has remained the center of the flight testing universe, overseeing the testing of such programs as the F-16, T-38, T-7 A, F-22, F-35, C-12, C-17, KC-135, KC-46. B-1, B-2, B-52, B-21.
Because of the work of General Higer and the brave men and women under his command, our nation is better prepared and equipped for the future and positioned to exceed our enemies in next-generation air dominance.
Once again, I want to recognize and sincerely thank Brigadier General Higer for his lifetime of service to our great Nation.
I know myself, our community, and all those at the 412th Test Wing will be wishing him nothing but happiness and prosperity in his retirement.
