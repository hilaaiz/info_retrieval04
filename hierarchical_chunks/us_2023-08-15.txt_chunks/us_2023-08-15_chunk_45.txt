Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence and idealism that these wonderful young people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of my colleague's help keep our democracy vibrant.
The insights, skills, and knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they go about making their mark in this world.
Because of people like them the future of our country is bright, and its best days lie ahead.
I wish them all well.
