Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves.
That is why I ran for public office.
I was inspired to serve by so many great public figures that came before me.
I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve....
You only need a heart full of grace.
A soul generated by love.''
By this measure there are several other great young men and women who served as legislative fellows this Spring and Summer in my office.
Each day, they exemplified the highest standards of excellence, bringing forth fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and an unrelenting drive to effect positive change within our cherished community.
Their tireless efforts to address the diverse needs and pressing concerns of our constituents resonate deeply with the values we hold dear.
In the pursuit of serving the constituents of the 18th Congressional District of Texas, their contributions have been nothing short of remarkable.
That is why today I rise to pay tribute to 14 extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents of the 18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people.
They are: Panashe Siachitema, Texas Tech University; Ramanpreet Kaur, Indiana University; Amy Arceo, Texas A&M University; Ainsley Gill, Vanderbilt University; Joel Crawford, Harvard University; Kevin Darmadi, George Washington University; Lindsey O'Neal, Payne International Development Fellowship, Niyonsaba Magnifique, Payne International Development Fellowship; Vanessa Rogers-Wright, Charles B. Rangel Internatinal Affairs Program; Wilson Pemboh, Texas Tech University; Alexandra Wilhelm, Pepperdine University; Parker Milligan, Oglethorpe University; J Hardy, Howard University; Carrington Blair, Jackson State University.
