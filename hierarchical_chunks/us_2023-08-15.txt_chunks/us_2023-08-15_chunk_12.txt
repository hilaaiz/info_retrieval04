Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a truly remarkable individual, 
Ms. Flo Bellamy, whose dedication, passion, and selfless service to the citizens of Johnson County, Tennesse, have left an indelible mark on our community.
I have personally witnessed Flo's unwavering commitment to the youth genuine love she extends to each child, and it is on display every day at the Community Center.
This is a woman who, for three years, worked without a salary, driven by a vision to establish an afterschool and summer program for our youth.
Her sacrifices, from collecting essentials for the disadvantaged to ensuring that many children receive their only meal outside of the school system, showcase her unprecedented dedication.
In addition to her work with the youth, Flo has been a beacon of hope for cancer patients, assisting them in navigating their journey, from finding care to arranging transportation to medical appointments.
Her connection to this cause is personal and sincere.
Having witnessed the devastating effects of cancer in her own family, Flo took the reins of the American Cancer Society's county-wide walk for cancer.
Even as the names and structures of these efforts evolved, Flo's leadership remained constant, her shift from fundraising for research to directly benefiting local cancer patients made a significant difference in the lives of many.
Furthermore, Flo's teachings have sowed the seeds of understanding, tolerance, and unity.
She taught respect for all, regardless of race, religion, or disability.
Due to her influence, I firmly believe that the younger generation in our community now embraces differences more openly and warmly than ever before.
However, the testament to Flo's legacy isn't just in the programs she led or the funds she raised.
It's in the heartfelt stories of grown adults, once children under her wing, who approach her in public to express their gratitude and love.
It's in the newfound perspectives and attitudes she fostered in a community that has historically faced its own set of challenges.
As I stand here, my heart swells with gratitude for Flo Bellamy.
Her decades-long service, from leading the Johnson County--Mountain City Community Center to being an unwavering advocate for the most vulnerable, has left a mark that will echo across generations.
We all owe her an immense debt of gratitude.
I invite my colleagues and the citizens of Johnson County to join me in saluting our precious Flo.
Her work and her spirit embody the very best of our community.
We love and cherish her, and I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize her monumental contributions.
