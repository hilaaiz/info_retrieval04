Mr. MIKE GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a lifelong patriot and soldier who has proudly served our great Nation in uniform for more than 30 years.
After a storied career marked by professional exceptionalism and taking on new challenges without hesitation, Brigadier General Matthew Higer will be enjoying his wellearned retirement.
While the team at Edwards Air Force Base will surely miss his leadership, General Higer will undoubtedly be enjoying the opportunity to spend more time with loved ones.
Prior to his command of the 412th Test Wing.
General Higer began his career attending some of our nation's finest military learning institutions, earning his commission from the Air Force Officer Reserve Training Corps at the University of Southern California and going on to attend the United States Army War College and the United States Naval Postgraduate School.
Between his stints at these schools, General Higer served as a test pilot, evaluator pilot, and instructor pilot.
No matter which role he was serving in at the time, Higer consistently distinguished himself from his fellow airmen through his hard work ethic and commitment to the pursuit of excellence.
