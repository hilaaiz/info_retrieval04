Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Commander Judith Robertson's tireless dedication and unwavering commitment to service, in both the United States Navy and Easley Baptist Hospital, have left a lasting impact on my constituency.
It is a privilege to celebrate the service of Lieutenant Commander Robertson and the barriers she has broken through her service in the United States Navy.
This has made her an inspiration and role model for countless young women and service members.
I am honored to represent the third district of South Carolina and to celebrate the exceptional individuals who make a difference in our community and country.
