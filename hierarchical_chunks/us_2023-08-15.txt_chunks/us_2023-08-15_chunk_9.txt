Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable career Robertson, a resident of Easley for nearly three decades, was the first female Physician Assistant in the United States Navy and a trailblazer in her field.
In 1974, Lieutenant Commander Judith Robertson entered the United States Navy and later graduated from the Sheppard Air Force Base's Physician Assistant Program with a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Physician Assistant Studies from the University.
Ultimately, earned the title of the first female Physician Assistant, paving the way for countless women to follow in her footsteps.
During her time in the U.S. Navy, she used her knowledge and training to provide OB/GYN services to Vietnam refugees at Talega Camp Pendleton, California.
Her dedication and commitment to serving her country is evident in her 30-plus years of active service, during which she exemplified the highest standards of professionalism and excellence.
For her service, she was awarded three Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, two National Defense Service medals, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Good Conduct Medal, and the Humanitarian Service Medal.
Since she retired from active duty in 1998, Lieutenant Commander Robertson's passion for helping others has not waned.
Since settling down in Easley, South Carolina, she has continued to contribute to her community as a volunteer at Easley Baptist Hospital, selflessly giving her time and expertise to assist those in need.
Her humility and willingness to serve are attributes that make her an invaluable member
