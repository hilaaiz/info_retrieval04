Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Stafford County NAACP in honor of 67 years of service to the community.
Founded in 1956, the Stafford County NAACP has worked tirelessly ``to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination,'' working to build a better future for everyone in Stafford County.
As the first and longest-serving president of the Stafford County NAACP, Frank White, Sr. laid the groundwork for this branch's long-term commitment to service.
His legacy continues through his son, Frank White, Jr.--an active member.
Under the current leadership of President Yolanda Roussell, the Stafford County NAACP continues to be a beacon in the community through its activism, partnerships with local churches, support for Black-owned businesses, voter registration drives, and community forums on African American history, public education, and mental health.
The Stafford County NAACP brings the entire community together for large celebrations--including the Stafford County NAACP Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration and the Stafford County NAACP Juneteenth Commemoration and Celebration.
These events would not have been possible without the hard work of its members.
The Stafford County NAACP has demonstrated a fervent commitment to our communities and an extraordinary devotion to the strength and prosperity of our Commonwealth.
As the U.S. 
Representative for Virginia's Seventh District, I am honored to recognize this organization for its tremendous record of service to Stafford County-- and I thank the Stafford County NAACP for building a stronger Virginia.
