Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and heroism of U.S. Army Specialist Charlie Simpson, Jr. 
Mr. Simpson was drafted into the United States Army in 1968 and went to Basic Training in Fort Ord, California.
After Basic Training, he successfully completed Advanced Infantry Training and later, Jump Training School.
He then received orders to join our brave soldiers in Vietnam.
