Mr. Tomtishen served in the United States Army for three years, of which two were spent in Vietnam.
He assisted in the training of troops at Fort Benning in Georgia and was severely injured in combat as a result of a landmine.
An active member of the Lempke-Blackwell VFW Post 7573 and AMVETS Post 52, Michael Tomtishen has assisted and participated in many local events and parades, once saving an onlooker's life by performing CPR.
For 30 years, 
Mr. Tomtishen has also honored fallen heroes by assisting in the placement of American flags--a task he was never asked to do.
Michael Tomtishen is a hero to many--his selfless commitment to those around him is an example for us all to follow.
With National Purple Heart Day still fresh in our hearts and minds, I am beyond proud to honor Michael for his many years of unselfish leadership, generosity, and respect for his community.
We are all indebted to him for the example he sets.
