Mr. Speaker, we often mention the sacrifices our men and women in uniform and their families make for our country, and rightly so.
But today, along with our thanks, let us also celebrate the good work and contributions these soldiers, airmen, and marines have made in their communities.
I would like to thank Specialist Simpson for his tremendous sacrifice for our nation and wish him well as he continues working for the people of Malvern, Arkansas.
All Arkansans are eternally grateful for his service.
