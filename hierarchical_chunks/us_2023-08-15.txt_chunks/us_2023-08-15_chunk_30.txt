Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary constituent whose dedication, service, and unwavering commitment to our community exemplify core American values.
Michael Tomtishen, who many throughout the City of New Baltimore regard as a `hometown hero,' is a veteran of the Vietnam War, a twotime Purple Heart recipient, and a lifelong resident in his community.
