Family Violence, for which she was honored with the Governor's Courage Award and the Woman of Valor award from the New York Board.
Perhaps most widely known is Anita's creation of the Reel Abilities Film Festival, the nation's largest showcase of films by and about people with disabilities.
Through ReelAbilities, Anita helped elevate underrepresented voices, challenge public perceptions, and promote the full inclusion of people with disabilities in American life.
As she celebrates 80 extraordinary years, I recognize Anita Altman for her vision, her integrity, and her unwavering belief that all people deserve to live with dignity, visibility, and respect.
