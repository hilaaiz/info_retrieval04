Mr. Ramsaran was the first member of his family to attend school, an opportunity he valued greatly.
He attended Auchlyne Church of Scotland Primary School and Corentyne High School through a Booker Sugar Estates Scholarship.
He graduated high school with diplomas from the University primary school teacher at Yakusari Primary School, then at the Ministry of Health in Georgetown, and as a clerk at magistrate's courts in New Amsterdam and Whim Village in Guyana.
Before leaving for the U.S.A. to pursue higher education and a better life for his family, 
Mr. Ramsaran married Camille (formerly Camille Ramgadoo).
He embodied the American dream with courage, determination, and a commitment to succeed.
While attending college and supporting his family, which included his wife and two small children, he held several jobs.
He earned advanced engineering degrees from Polytechnic-New York University and persevered through many hardships, including violent racial attacks against his family and their home.
With remarkable resilience, he exceeded expectations, purchased a home, quickly advanced to prominent positions in major companies, funded his children's college education, and established a successful engineering firm in Queens, New York.
He has become a role model for his immediate and extended family, as well as for others in his community.
Together with Camille, 
Mr. Ramsaran is the parent of Arnold and the late Gerald, and they are the grandparents of Jaden and Gavin, all of whom reside in Queens.
