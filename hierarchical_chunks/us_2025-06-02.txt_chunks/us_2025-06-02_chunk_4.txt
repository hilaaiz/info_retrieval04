Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent constituents as devoted and compassionate as Elissa.
Elissa has impacted hundreds of students during her career.
Elissa will leave behind an expert skill set and enthusiasm that will be hard to replace, but her 33 years of unwavering dedication to the Waterford community will leave a legacy for years to come through each and every one of her students.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing Elissa DeVito's immeasurable contributions and congratulating her on her well-earned retirement.
