during which Ephrata junior Sophia Rivera excelled in shot put and discus.
On the first day, Rivera captured the state title in girls' shot put with a distance of 43 feet, 3 inches.
Her domination continued into girls' discus the following day, where a throw of 143 feet, 3 inches nabbed the gold medal.
Sophia Rivera's two state titles crown a spectacular season and a complete sweep in the postseason, as Rivera won gold medals in both events during the Lancaster-Lebanon League championship and the District Three championship weeks prior.
With two state titles and a total of 6 gold medals during the track and field postseason, Sophia Rivera has firmly established herself as one of Pennsylvania's best in shot put and discus.
I offer my sincere congratulations to Sophia on her success this year and look forward to seeing what she accomplishes next.
