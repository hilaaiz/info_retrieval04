Mr. SCOTT FRANKLIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Hollis Hamilton Hooks, a lifelong Lakelander whose quiet leadership and steady service left a lasting impact on the community he loved.
Hollis never sought the spotlight, but his influence was deeply felt throughout Polk County.
From his early work in Washington to a successful career in financial services, he remained guided by a strong sense of duty to give back.
In 1992, Hollis was elected to the Polk County School Board, where he helped lead the district's first strategic planning effort.
He championed policies to expand school choice and raise academic standards through the development of magnet programs.
He also served on the board of the Polk Education Foundation, where he helped channel private-sector support into classroom resources, scholarships, teacher recognition programs and professional development.
Hollis made a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of our region.
As chairman of the board for the Lakeland Regional Medical Center, he played a key role in guiding improvements to local care.
Through his work with the hospital's foundation, he helped drive critical investments in enhanced services and modernized facilities to meet the needs of a rapidly growing community.
His commitment to civic life extended to the arts and public discourse.
He served on the board of the Polk Museum of Art, working to increase access to arts education and cultural programming.
He also sat on the board of LkldNow's parent nonprofit, underscoring his belief in the value of informed and engaged local communities.
Hollis Hooks was more than a civic leader.
He was my friend, a fellow elder at First Presbyterian Church of Lakeland, and a man of profound integrity.
My prayers are with his wife Debbie, their children and all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Hollis made Lakeland stronger, and his example of humble leadership will continue to guide and inspire.
May we honor his memory by living lives of purpose and service.
