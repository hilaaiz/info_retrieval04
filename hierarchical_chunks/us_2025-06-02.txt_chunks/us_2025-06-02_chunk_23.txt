Mr. Ramsaran has been a resident of Queens, New York, since emigrating from Guyana (formerly British Guiana) in 1968.
He is the third generation of Indian indentured laborers who worked on British sugar cane plantations after the emancipation of enslaved people in British colonies in 1834.
His great-grandfather, Pooriye, arrived in Guyana in 1853 aboard the ship Adelaide, and his great-grandmother, Radhah, arrived in 1860 aboard the ship Colgrain.
His family faced significant struggles and persevered under extremely harsh conditions on the plantations.
Throughout the generations, they worked tirelessly to build a better life in Guyana rather than return to poverty in India.
