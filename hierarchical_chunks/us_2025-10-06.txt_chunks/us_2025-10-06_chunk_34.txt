Mr. Speaker, this milestone represents more than the completion of a project, it signifies a lasting investment in the prosperity and potential of rural communities.
Thousands of citizens will now reap the benefits of this achievement, including expanded educational opportunities, strengthened economic development, improved access to health care, and an enhanced quality of life for countless families and businesses.
Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has demonstrated that when vision, leadership, and commitment to community are combined, meaningful progress can be made.
This accomplishment serves as a reminder that rural America must never be left behind.
I commend Tombigbee Electric Cooperative for its steadfast dedication and leadership, and I look forward to seeing the continued benefits this investment will bring to the people of Northwest Alabama.
