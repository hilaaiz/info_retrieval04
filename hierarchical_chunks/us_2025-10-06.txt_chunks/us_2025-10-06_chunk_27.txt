Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 150th anniversary.
Mary's Episcopal Church in Lampasas, Texas.
Founded in 1873 during the turbulent years of Reconstruction, St. Mary's has stood as a steadfast place of worship and community for a century and a half.
From its beginnings under the leadership.
Thomas S. Denny and a small group of faithful families, the church persevered through frontier hardships, local feuds, floods, and economic trials.
Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant congregation rooted in service, tradition, and faith.
The sanctuary itself, built of native limestone in the Victorian Gothic style, is a testament to the perseverance of its early leaders, including Capt. A.H. Barnes, Dr. James Bierbower, W.T. Campbell, T.H. Haynie, W.C. Price, and others whose dedication made possible the construction of a permanent church home.
Generations of families, like the Campbells, the Haynies, the Richeys, the Olivers, and many more have sustained and enriched the life.
Mary's across decades, ensuring its continued presence as a spiritual cornerstone of the Lampasas community.
Today, St. Mary's remains a thriving parish, carrying forward its mission with more than a dozen families whose membership stretches back multiple generations, while also welcoming new parishioners who bring fresh perspectives and energy.
Together, this congregation embodies the resilience, stability, and continuity that have defined St. Mary's since its founding.
