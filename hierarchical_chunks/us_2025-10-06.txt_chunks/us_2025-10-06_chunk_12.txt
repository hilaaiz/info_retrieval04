do more to address the housing crisis.
In 2012, I worked with La Shelle and SHRA to secure a $300,000 planning grant to begin the process of redeveloping the Twin Rivers public housing project, now called Marisol Village, an affordable housing project.
Thirteen years of partnership later, and after securing over $32 million in federal funding, Marisol Village is now double its original size at 427 units.
Most importantly the community now provides my constituents with vital resources, like a full suite of resident services, green space, childcare facilities, a light rail station and cultural amenities, right at their doorstep.
I am proud to have worked with La Shelle to create real positive impact with Sacramento's federal tax dollars right here in our community.
La Shelle Dozier's tenure at SHRA is a shining example of what makes Sacramento special.
La Shelle knows firsthand that often it takes a village to build a village.
Time and time again I have joined La Shelle in support of SHRA's projects and witnessed her build a wide coalition of local, state and federal partners to bring a safe and healthy home to those who need it most.
The work that La Shelle and her team have done is truly indicative of why I love our region.
Here in Sacramento, we lift up our community and seek to create positive and lasting impacts for all Sacramentans.
