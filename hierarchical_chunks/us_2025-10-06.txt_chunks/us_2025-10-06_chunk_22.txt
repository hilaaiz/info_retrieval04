Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Lt. Colonel Jabar Shabazz on his retirement.
On behalf of myself and the citizens of Fairfax County, I thank him and his family for his honorable 31 years of selfless service to our Nation.
Fairfax County is the safest jurisdiction of its size, and that is in no small part due to the dedication of individuals like Lt. Col. Shabazz.
Best wishes for a safe and happy retirement.
