Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, earlier this summer in Altamonte Springs, while off-duty and spending time with his family, Firefighter and Paramedic Christopher Fearon witnessed a five-year-old boy slip under the water and begin to drown.
Within seconds, he pulled the child out, cleared his airway, and helped him take a lifesaving breath.
The boy was purple in the face and struggling to breathe, but thanks to Chris's training, instinct, and calm under pressure, he survived and recovered.
Chris embodies: Skill and decisiveness under pressure--drawing on years of fire-rescue and paramedic training; Service beyond duty--never hesitating to act, even off the clock; Humility and compassion--later reflecting, ``All I wanted to do since I was little was help people...
and I love it.''
This act of quick thinking heroism, covered by local news, not only saved a life but also drew attention to the importance scholarship to learn to swim, creating a ripple effect of safety and prevention beyond the incident itself.
