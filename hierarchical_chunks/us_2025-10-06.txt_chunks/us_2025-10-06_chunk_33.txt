Mr. ADERHOLT.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight the completion of Tombigbee Electric Cooperative's commitment to bring reliable, highspeed fiber internet access to more than 100,000 residents in Northwest Alabama.
Tombigbee Electric Cooperative was established to meet the need for electricity among citizens in the rural areas.
Since its founding in 1941, Tombigbee has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to serving its community and strengthening the area it surrounds.
Over the decades, the cooperative has provided safe and provide safe and reliable electric power and fiber-to-the-home internet.
In 2017, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative set forth an ambitious goal to provide high-quality, high-speed internet service to 100,000 people across Northwest Alabama.
Today, that goal has been achieved.
Through the installation of more than 4,200 miles of fiber and a total investment of $145 million, made possible by $37 million in state and federal grants, as well as a $100 million investment by the cooperative itself, Tombigbee Electric Cooperative has delivered on its promise to bridge the digital divide for rural Alabamians.
