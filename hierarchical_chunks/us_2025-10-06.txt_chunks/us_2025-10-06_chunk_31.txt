Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending First Baptist Church of Merrifield for its efforts to better the Northern Virginia region.
Achieving 155 years of ministry is a milestone worth celebrating.
It is a privilege to work alongside this great congregation in the community, and I wish them continued success through faith, family, and service.
