On the assisted dying Bill, which is a private Member’s Bill, the Government are quite rightly staying neutral, but the real issue with the Bill is that the time constraints of private legislation make it difficult to get it right first time.
If we get this wrong first time, the consequences are too terrible to contemplate.
In 1967, the Government of the day gave time to allow David Steel’s Abortion Bill to go through.
Will the Prime Minister commit to giving extra time—Government time—to the Bill to ensure that we get this right first time?
