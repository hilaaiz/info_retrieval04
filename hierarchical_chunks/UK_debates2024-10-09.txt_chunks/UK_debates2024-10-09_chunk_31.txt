I remember that visit.
Here is the new political vibe: invest with Labour or decline with the Tories.
That is why I am so pleased to read out the investments we have had in the last few weeks.
We have a big summit coming up on Monday, with hundreds of CEOs coming, and I am confident we will be making further such investment announcements in weeks to come.
That is what will fix and stabilise our economy.
Because we are taking the tough decisions, the investment is now coming flowing into this country, to fulfil our obligation to raise living standards across the country.
The A483 runs through my constituency from Llanymynech to Oswestry.
It is one of the busiest and most dangerous roads in the constituency, and National Highways says the crossroads at Llynclys is the worst accident blackspot in the midlands.
It has a proposal to improve the situation, but Treasury rules place a higher value on road speed than on the lives of North Shropshire’s residents.
Will the Prime Minister look at flexing those rules to back National Highways and my residents, to give them the safe road they deserve?
