I thank the hon.
Member for raising this.
It is obviously a big and important issue in her constituency.
It is vital that as we invest we improve safety and deliver better journeys for drivers.
National Highways continues to study the case for safety improvements to the A483 and will continue to do so.
As she probably knows, decisions will be set out under the third road investment strategy.
I know that the Roads Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) , will have heard her representations and will agree to a meeting, if that is what she would like.
