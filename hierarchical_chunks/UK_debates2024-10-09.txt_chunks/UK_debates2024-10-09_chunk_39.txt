With shared prosperity funding drawing to a close, and Cornwall having some of the greatest potential in Europe in critical minerals and renewable energy, it is time for  our aspiring Celtic tiger to identify much more strategic sources of investment funding, which take us away from the short-termist begging-bowl politics of the previous decade.
Will the Prime Minister meet Cornish MPs to discuss the future of industrial and social funding in Cornwall?
My hon.
Friend is a proud Cornish MP.
He is absolutely right that economic growth must be spread across the country; it cannot simply be focused in the south-east and London.
He will no doubt have seen today the floating offshore wind taskforce report, which sets out that the UK’s industry can support tens of thousands of jobs, including huge job opportunities in the south-west.
I will ensure that a meeting is arranged for him with the appropriate Minister.
Today is PANS PANDAS Awareness Day, which is about a paediatric condition affecting potentially thousands of children across the UK.
I first raised the condition in the Chamber 18 months ago, when I heard about its devastating impact from a constituent.
Does the Prime Minister agree that it should not be for a charity to fund the pathway analysis and research needed to ensure that people and children get the support they need?
Will he help facilitate a meeting for me with the charity and the Department of Health and Social Care?
