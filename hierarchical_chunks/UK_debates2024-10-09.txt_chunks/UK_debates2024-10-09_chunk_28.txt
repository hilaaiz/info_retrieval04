I thank my hon.
Friend for her important question.
It is appalling that child poverty has gone up by 700,000 since 2010, after the last Labour Government did so much to bring it down.
Tackling this is at the heart of our mission to break down the barriers to opportunity.
The taskforce is developing a strategy to reduce child poverty, and it will be published in the spring of next year.
