Cities and towns in Northern Ireland have already missed out on levelling-up funding under the previous Government, as I saw at  first hand as shadow Minister, so the uncertainty regarding the city deals has been quite a hard hit on the people in Northern Ireland.
I seek further reassurances from the Secretary of State that the people of Northern Ireland will not be overlooked in the Budget.
I absolutely recognise the uncertainty that this has created and, as I have indicated, I will be meeting the chief executives of the two deals very shortly.
Given the uncertainty while we await the outcome of the first phase of the spending review, the particular problem that they face is that a lot of effort goes into progressing these deals with the private partners, because the money comes from the Government and from the Northern Ireland Executive in the form of match funding, and then other partners, including the local councils, and they do find themselves in a difficult position— I will not hide from that.
The only other thing I would say is that those two deals are much further back in the process than those for Belfast and Derry; for the Causeway Coast and Glens deal the heads of terms had been signed in April of this year, and for the Mid South West deal the terms had yet to be signed—I think they were due last month.
Then there is a further process under which the programme of the deal itself is developed to then get to the stage that Derry reached on  18 September , when the financial agreement is signed and then the business case and the projects are unlocked.
So I recognise that it is difficult and, as I have already indicated to the councils, I will continue to argue for the cause of these deals.
