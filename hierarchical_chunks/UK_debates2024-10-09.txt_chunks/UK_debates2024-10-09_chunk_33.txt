Bolton Hospice provides vital services to individuals with life-limiting conditions yet, like hospices across the country, it faces a difficult financial future and is reliant on fundraising, including the kind donations I was able to raise when I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro last year and from the campaign run by .
What steps is the Prime Minister taking to ensure hospices, like the one in Bolton, are put on a sustainable financial footing?
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on his efforts in relation to his local hospice.
We want everyone to have access to high-quality care, including end of life care.
That is why we require all local NHS bodies to commission services from hospices to meet the needs of their local populations.
Most hospices are charitable, independent organisations that also receive funding for providing NHS services.
We have inherited a huge problem with the £22 billion black hole, but we are determined to move forward on this none the less.
Since the signing of the Belfast agreement in 1998, more people in Northern Ireland have now sadly lost their lives to suicide than those who were killed during the 30 years of the troubles.
Does the Prime Minister agree that the challenges with poor mental health in Northern Ireland, some of which are directly related to the violence   of our past, are a unique and pressing legacy of the troubles?
Will he therefore commit to tasking his Government to work collaboratively with the Department of Health in Northern Ireland to explore how these issues can be properly recognised and resolved?
