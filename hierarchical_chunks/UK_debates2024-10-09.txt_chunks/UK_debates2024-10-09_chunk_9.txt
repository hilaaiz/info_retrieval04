I thank my hon.
Friend for her important question.
I pay tribute to her, the Home Secretary and the Minister for Policing, Fire and Crime Prevention along with others across the House who have campaigned on this issue for years.
The new Government have been able finally to take urgent steps to address this issue.
Protection zones around abortion clinics will be in force from  31 October —the end of this month.
The Government are determined that anyone exercising their legal right to access abortion services should be free from harassment and intimidation.
The police will now have the power to deal with anyone they reasonably suspect to be obstructing, causing harassment or distress, or influencing within a buffer zone.
