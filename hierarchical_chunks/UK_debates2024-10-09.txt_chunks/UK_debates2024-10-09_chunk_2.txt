With permission, I would like to make a statement about the Government’s support for film making in the UK.
Film is one of the great British success stories of the last 30 years.
Ever since Gordon Brown created the film tax credit back in 2007, this amazing industry has created jobs and growth across the UK and flown the flag for British creativity across the world.
Our Government have huge ambition for the film sector, and today we are introducing secondary legislation that will put rocket boosters under this growing industry and unlock the potential of our incredible independent film sector.
