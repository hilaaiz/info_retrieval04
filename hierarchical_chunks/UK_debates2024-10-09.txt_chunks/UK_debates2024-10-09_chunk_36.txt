I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
This reinforces the point that the SEND provisions were a failure of the previous Government, particularly in rural communities.
The issue is felt by Members on both sides of the House.
It is really important and we have a duty now to pick it up and ensure that all children with SEND receive the right support to succeed in their education, and we will continue to do so.
