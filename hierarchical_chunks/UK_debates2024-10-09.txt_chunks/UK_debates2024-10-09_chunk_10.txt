I welcome the ministerial team to their places.
The Conservative Government launched the £100 million violence against women and girls strategy in our determination to make our streets safer for women and girls.
It involved creating a new 24/7 sexual assault helpline, transport safety champions and a £5 million safety of women at night fund.
Why does this Labour Government feel that setting a target of merely halving violence against women and girls is a suitable ambition?
Surely nothing but targeting the total eradication of this horrific criminality, whether in the home or on the streets, is enough.
