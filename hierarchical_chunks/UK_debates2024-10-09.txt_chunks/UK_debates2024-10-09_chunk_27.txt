One in two children in my constituency lives in poverty after housing costs are taken into account, so I welcome the Government’s commitment to tackling child poverty, but we all know that every year of poverty has a long-term impact.
When does the Prime Minister expect the welcome child poverty taskforce to report so that we can see action?
