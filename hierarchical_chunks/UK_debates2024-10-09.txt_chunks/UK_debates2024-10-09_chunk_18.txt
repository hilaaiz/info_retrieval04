The Conservative Government introduced the hugely successful opt-out HIV and hepatitis testing programme for A&Es in London, Brighton, Blackpool and Manchester, with a £20 million commitment to expand the programme to 33 more, diagnosing more than 1,300 people with HIV in the first two years and tackling health inequalities.
This has meant, crucially, that more LGBT+ people, women, people of black African ethnicity and older people have been diagnosed and supported.
Will the Minister assure the House that the funding and commitment will remain?
