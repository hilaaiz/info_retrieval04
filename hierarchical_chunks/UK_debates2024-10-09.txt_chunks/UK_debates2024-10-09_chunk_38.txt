I thank the right hon.
Member for raising this question on a really important issue.
I do understand that there are strongly held views across the House—on both sides and within both sides, if I can put it in that way.
I do agree with him that it is important that we ensure that any change to the law—if there is to be one—is effective.
If this House gives the Bill a Second Reading, it will of course then go to Committee as usual, which will allow that more detailed scrutiny, but we do need the discussion more broadly on this important issue.
