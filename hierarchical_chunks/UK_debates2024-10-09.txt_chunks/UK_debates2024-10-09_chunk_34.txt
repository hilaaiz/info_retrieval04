I thank the hon.
Member for raising that important matter.
I do know at first hand the deep impact that the troubles have had on so many in Northern Ireland.
We must ensure that those with mental health issues receive the support and the care that they need.
Public services are obviously devolved in Northern Ireland, but we will work with the Executive and leaders to support them in delivering better outcomes.
That is why my Secretary of State for Health and Social Care spoke to the Health Minister in Northern Ireland in the first week that he was in the Department.
I am sure that he will be prepared to follow up on the matter should the hon.
Member wish him to do so.
