The Secretary of State will remember that when he and I were at the signing of the Londonderry deal in September, I lobbied him strongly to get the other two deals over the line.
He has outlined the meetings he has held, but given what he has just said about not meeting and talking with the Chancellor about this, will he be meeting the Prime Minister?
He has met other people, and we need to get these deals up and running—over the line—to get much-needed investment into areas such as mine and the Mid South West.
I very much enjoyed seeing the hon.
Gentleman at the signing of the Derry/Londonderry and Strabane city deal—it was a great event.
It is the   responsibility of all of us in the House who have the interests of these two deals at heart to make representations to everyone who can influence the final decision.
