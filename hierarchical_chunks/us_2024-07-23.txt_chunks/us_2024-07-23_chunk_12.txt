Mr. BERA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, Gamma Epsilon Boule on the occasion of its 40th anniversary, acknowledging its significant contributions to the Sacramento community and its dedication to the principles of leadership, service, and scholarship.
Whereas, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, also known as the Boule, was founded on May 15, 1904, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by a group of professionals as the first African American Greek-lettered organization, dedicated to fostering a spirit of brotherhood, professional excellence, and community service; and Whereas, the Gamma Epsilon Boule of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity was established 40 years ago in the Sacramento region, when its first Sire Archon John Wesley Hudson MD wrote a letter on July 27, 1984 stating that Gamma Epsilon Boule had completed its chartering ceremony with a list of members including fourteen distinguished professionals in the Sacramento metropolitan area of which two are still living today including Archon Dr. Eugene Spencer and Archon Judge Gary E. Ransom; and Whereas, the members of the Gamma Epsilon Boule continues to include an impressive list of local and national leaders representing a variety of professions, including the following: medicine, dentistry, health care, law, politics, architecture, engineering, real estate development, education, the entertainment industry and business; and Whereas, the members of the Gamma Epsilon Boule have contributed to the Sacramento community through its dedication to leadership, academic excellence, and civic engagement, and demonstrated exceptional commitment to mentoring youth, supporting educational initiatives, and fostering economic development, thereby enhancing the quality of life in Sacramento; and Whereas, this 40th anniversary provides an opportunity to honor the Boule's remarkable achievements and the positive impact it has had on the Sacramento community fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.
Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the United States Congress extends its congratulations to the Gamma Epsilon Boule, celebrating its legacy of excellence and wishing its members continued success in their future endeavors.
I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Gamma Epsilon Boule's 40th anniversary and wish them the best on their continued work and dedication towards improving the Sacramento region.
