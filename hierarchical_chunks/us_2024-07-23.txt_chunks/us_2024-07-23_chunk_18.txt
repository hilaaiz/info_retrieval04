Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Zookeeper Week, which is celebrated from July 21st to July 27th, as we honor the dedicated men and women who care for our Nation's diverse and magnificent wildlife while educating the public.
As a proud representative of Northwest Ohio, home to the renowned Toledo Zoo, I have seen firsthand the passion and commitment zookeepers bring to their vital work.
These unsung heroes play a crucial role in wildlife conservation, education, and the preservation of endangered species.
Zookeepers work tirelessly behind the scenes, ensuring that animals receive the highest standard of care, from nutrition and enrichment to veterinary support.
Their efforts not only enhance the well-being of the animals but also foster a greater understanding and appreciation of wildlife among the public.
No one exemplifies this more than Laurie Dixon, Lead Zookeeper in the Aquarium at the Toledo Zoo who has dedicated her life to this work for the past 41 years.
She shared with me that ``Zookeepers are passionate about their animals.
So, we provide the best care that our animals need to thrive.''
I have loved my Toledo Zoo since I was a little kid.
The Toledo Zoo is a great place to make memories with family and friends.''
Their work is essential to preserving biodiversity and educating future generations about the importance of protecting our planet's natural treasures.
Let us take this week to acknowledge and celebrate the extraordinary contributions of zookeepers across our country.
They truly are the guardians of our wildlife and stewards of our natural heritage.
