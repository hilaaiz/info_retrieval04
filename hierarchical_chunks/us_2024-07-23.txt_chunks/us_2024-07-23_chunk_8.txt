Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of John Hemmings, III, who is retiring as Executive Director of the Ohio Valley Regional Development Commission, what we in Southern Ohio know as the OVRDC, after committing 33 years of life and work to the Commission.
Starting as a Regional Planner in 1991, John has held almost every position within the Commission, serving as Executive Director since 2008.
During his time at the OVRDC, John lent his skills and talents to countless programs that helped revolutionize the Ohio River Valley, including a regional commission that coordinates a cross-governmental approach to improve the local community through infrastructure and economic development.
As a Scioto County native, John's commitment to the region has led to critical improvements in the lives of so many Ohioans.
Working with him to advance the dreams and lives of so many has truly been an honor.
