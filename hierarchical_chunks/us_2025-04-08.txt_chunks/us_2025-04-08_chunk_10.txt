Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mr. Jeffrey L. DeWitt on his retirement from the Fort Worth Fire Department after 37 years of dedication and service to the City.
Founded 152 years ago, the Fort Worth Fire Department is a nationally recognized agency with a rich history of serving and protecting the 13th-largest city in the nation.
Born and raised in Upstate New York, 
Mr. DeWitt moved to Texas as quickly as he could.
He became one of the first paid firefighters with the Keller Fire Department in the early 1980s.
He joined the Fort Worth Fire Department on May 6, 1988, as a full-time commissioned firefighter in Class 41.
Over his career, he served in four stations, including the historic Downtown Station 1, where he was assigned on December 12, 1997.
The following year, he was promoted to Engineer at Station 1.
During this time, he had the honor of driving ``The Big One,'' the largest engine at the Fort Worth Fire Department for 13 years--a fact his young daughters proudly shared, saying, ``Dad drives the big truck downtown.''
In addition to his many years with the Fort Worth Fire Department, he has spent nearly two decades instructing classes at the Fire Academy at Tarrant County College.
As an instructor for both new recruits and continuing certification courses for commissioned firefighters, his positive impact extends to other fire departments across the State of Texas.
Now, as he retires from Station 35 in the critical Fort Worth Alliance Airport Corridor, 
Mr. DeWitt holds the distinction of being the department's senior-most engineer and a certified Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) firefighter.
