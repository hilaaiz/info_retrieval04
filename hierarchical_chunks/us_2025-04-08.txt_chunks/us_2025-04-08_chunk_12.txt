his many years of service, he has worked tirelessly to protect others before himself.
He will undoubtedly continue to embrace the spirit of a dedicated first responder and an engaged member of our Fort Worth community.
I know he is looking forward to well-earned time with his family and first grandchild.
On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, it is an honor to recognize 
Mr. Jeffrey L. DeWitt's service to the Fort Worth Fire Department and his impact on keeping our community safe for the past 37 years.
I wish him and his family the very best as they celebrate his retirement.
