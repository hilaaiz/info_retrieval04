Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Eagle Mountain Saginaw Independent School District for its outstanding achievement in winning the Caudill Award.
This prestigious architectural honor is presented by the Texas Association of School Boards to recognize the best educational facility in Texas.
The Dr. Jim F. Chadwell Administration Building and the Discovery Lab Learning Center received this award for their exceptional planning and innovative design in fostering an excellent learning environment.
Designed by VLK Architects, an innovative firm based in Fort Worth, these buildings have been recognized for their nature-infused, forwardthinking architecture.
Situated near Marine Creek Lake, the facilities seamlessly incorporate the surrounding natural landscape, featuring trails through scenic woods, prairies, and waterways.
At the Discovery Lab, students can explore the environment firsthand, collect scientific samples, and bring them back to the labs for further study.
Additionally, the administrative building represents a significant upgrade, consolidating multiple smaller structures into one state-ofthe-art facility.
Housing 17 administrative departments and 150 employees, this campus sets a new standard for Texas public school infrastructure.
These remarkable centers for education are named in honor of esteemed local educators who have dedicated decades of their lives to the district's students.
The administration building bears the name.
Jim F. Chadwell, who served as superintendent for 14 years.
Under his leadership, the district passed two bond measures totaling over $1 billion and expanded from 23 schools serving 16,600 students to 31 schools with a student body of 23,800.
The Discovery Lab buildings honor Jane Weaver and David Prince, two of the district's distinguished educators, who have devoted decades of their careers to teaching outdoor education.
On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to recognize Eagle Mountain-Saginaw ISD for earning the prestigious Caudill Award.
This recognition is a testament to the district's dedication to excellence in education.
The community is fortunate to have such an innovative facility that supports students, educators, and administrators alike.
The Caudill Award is a well-deserved honor and a valuable addition to an already thriving school system.
