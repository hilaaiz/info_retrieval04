Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mr. Brad Barnes in his retirement from serving as President of the Stock Show and Rodeo in Fort Worth, Texas.
The Stock Show and Rodeo is the city's oldest and largest annual event, gathering millions of visitors every year.
Showcasing both professional rodeo athletes and thousands of kids from across Texas, this event continues to reflect Fort Worth's rich cultural heritage.
In his many years with the Stock Show and Rodeo, 
Mr. Barnes volunteered before becoming a full-time employee in 2004.
During this time, the rodeo moved from the historic Will Rogers Coliseum to Dickies Arena.
Payout winnings for contestants grew to 1.5 million dollars and expanded the attendance rate exponentially.
Always looking ahead, he has prepared the initiative to renovate the Will Rogers Coliseum in pursuit of preserving its historical significance to Fort Worth.
Since 1985, premiums, scholarships, and grants for Texas youth have accumulated over 100 million dollars.
Under the leadership.
Barnes, the 2025 Junior Sale of Champions alone raised more than 10 million dollars.
The Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo represents the cultural heart of Fort Worth, starting from the early days on the Chisholm Trail driving cattle to now being a symbol of where ``The West Begins.''
Mr. Barnes has worked tirelessly to preserve Fort Worth's connection to its origin, believing that without it, it will just be another city on the list of many in Texas.
On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, it is an honor to recognize 
Mr. Brad Barnes's humble commitment to the Fort Worth community.
I wish the best to him and his family as they celebrate his retirement and continue to be committed members of the community.
