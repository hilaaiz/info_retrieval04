Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 
Mr. Keith H. Johnson.
As Chief Keith Johnson prepares to retire this month, I rise to honor his distinguished career and service to the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue System.
Chief Johnson is a fourth-generation firefighter who began his fire service in 1982.
His career led him to the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department, where he ascended to the rank of Deputy Chief in 2009.
After more than 30 years of service in Fairfax County, Chief Johnson was appointed as the Assistant Chief of Operations with Loudoun County Fire and Rescue and, later, the Chief of the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue System in 2018.
He possesses both Fire Inspector and Fire Investigator certifications with the Virginia Department of Fire Programs.
During his tenure, he led a department of nearly 500 career and more than 1,500 volunteer personnel, oversaw the implementation of a collective bargaining ordinance, created a 24 hour Operational Shift Commander program, and formed a behavioral health section.
He also advocated for benefits and protections to include increased behavioral health benefits and cancer protections for first responders, as well as for the inclusion of fire sprinkler systems in residential homes.
Chief Johnson was recently named the Career Fire Chief of the Year in 2024.
He continues to serve as Chair of the Governor's appointed Virginia Fire Services and on Virginia's Board of Housing and Community Development.
Congratulations to Chief Johnson on an exceptional career.
I thank him for decades of service to our community, and I wish him well in his retirement.
