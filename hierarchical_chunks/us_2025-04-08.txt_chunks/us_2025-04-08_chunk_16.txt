Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Reverend Father Ted Poteres for his extraordinary leadership at Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Merrillville, Indiana, and to wish him well upon his retirement.
For his lifetime of service to others and dedication to providing spiritual guidance and support to those most in need, Father Ted serves as an inspiration to us all.
