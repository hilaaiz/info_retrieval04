I call this a Bill to assist people who are dying.
The measures are not for people who are not dying.
People who are terminally ill may live for a long time.
They are not yet dying, and the measures are for them until they are.
All of us must make the very best of every day, whether our lives be long or short.
Of course, that is especially true for those with a terminal diagnosis.
