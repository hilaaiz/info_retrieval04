Will my hon.
Friend give way?
I am just going to make some progress.
Patients must have “an inevitably progressive illness or disease which cannot be reversed by treatment” and a person is not considered to be terminally ill only because they have a disability or a mental disorder.
These clear, strict criteria, plus the multiple capacity assessments, exclude possible serious mental health disorders such as anorexia.
I was also very pleased to support the change advocated for by Marie Curie and Hospice UK, which would ensure an assessment of palliative and end-of-life care as part of the first report on the Act.
We know from other countries, in no small part due to the 14-month inquiry by the Health and Social Care Committee, that palliative care and assisted dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patients the care and choice they deserve in their final days.
It should not be an either/or for dying people, and we need to channel our energies into supporting all options for terminally ill people.
I am very grateful to the hon.
Lady for giving way.
As she knows, the leading experts in palliative care have come out to oppose the Bill, and they point to the fact that hospices are underfunded and do not have the same ability to serve patients.
I therefore gently question whether we are in a position today to make a judgment that patients truly would have a choice at the end of life.
