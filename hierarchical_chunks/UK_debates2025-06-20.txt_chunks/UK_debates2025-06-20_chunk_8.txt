I thank my hon.
Friend for giving way; she is being very kind.
I came into this House supporting the principle of assisted dying, and I thought very carefully before voting against the Bill on Second Reading.
There are differing views, but I want to ask my hon.
Friend, before MPs put their name not to the principle of assisted dying but to this Bill specifically, why the vast majority of primary care doctors, geriatricians and groups representing people with disabilities, eating disorders and domestic violence are all opposed not to the principle but to this Bill specifically.
Some people who are supportive of the principle of assisted dying do not support this specific Bill; can my hon.
Friend explain their opposition?
