Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Reverend Freddie Banks, the Pastor of New Testament Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on the occasion of his retirement.
For the last 40 years, the leadership he has displayed for his congregation and his greater community is worthy of commendation.
Reverend Banks was born in 1937 in Merigold, Mississippi.
His family would later move to Ypsilanti, Michigan where he graduated from Ypsilanti High School in 1957.
Shortly thereafter in 1959, Reverand Banks married his wonderful wife, Evelyn.
Their legacy now includes 4 children, 6 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.
Reverend Banks began his journey with the St. John Missionary Church of Ypsilanti in 1965.
There he served as Sunday School superintendent, President of the Usher Board, and Chairman of the Deacon Board.
He would preach his first sermon in September 1977 and was ordained as Assistant Pastor in 1978.
Reverend Banks attended classes at the Detroit Bible College, later the William Tyndale Bible College, where he graduated in 1984.
Reverend Banks went on to serve at St. Mary Baptist Church in 1983 as their Assistant Pastor.
Later, he was called to preach at Fellowship of Believers, which was later named New Testament Missionary Baptist Church.
His service to the community includes execution of marriage ceremonies, providing marriage counseling, and providing funeral services.
