Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor rising 7th grade student Amelia Lisowe, a resident of Benton and congratulate her for being crowned the winner of the Royal International Miss Preteen.
In addition to her crown, she also won several well-deserved awards.
prizes, and cash scholarships.
Since 2018, Amelia has overseen her own nonprofit organization, Lisowe's Lights, and has raised enough money to donate 20,000 nightlights to foster children in the United States and around the world.
She is a talented school athlete.
participating in both the school dance and volleyball teams.
Amelia also dances with Dance Dynamics Company and serves as an iCan Dance buddy for special needs dancers.
She should serve as a role model for our Nation's youth.
I congratulate her on her crown, her tireless volunteer work.
and her many accomplishments.
