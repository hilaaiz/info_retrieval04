Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this past August, it was my honor to attend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony for Daniel Cohen.
The trail to Eagle Scout is marked by milestones and achievements, each one a testament to Daniel's unwavering determination.
From those early days as a Cub Scout to rising through the ranks, to earning merit badges and honing skills, he has demonstrated a thirst for knowledge and a willingness to embrace challenges.
Daniel makes giving back to his community a priority and that is evident through his Eagle Scout Project.
In an effort to help retire flags in a respectful way, Daniel built a flag retirement box for his local VFW.
I know Daniel has a bright future ahead of him and I wish him all the best.
God Bless Daniel Cohen and God Bless the United States.
