Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Barbara L. McQuade, currently a professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School.
Her service to her nation and the state of Michigan is worthy of commendation.
Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Barbara earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1987 and her J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1991.
She began her career at the law firm of Butzel Long in Detroit before serving as a clerk for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District.
From 1998 to 2010, Barbara was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Law from 2003 to 2009.
In 2010, Barbara was appointed by President Obama to be the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, the first woman to serve in that position and a post she held until 2017.
During her tenure, she oversaw cases involving public corruption, terrorism, corporate fraud, and healthcare fraud, among others.
A brilliant legal mind, Barbara has been quoted in the New York Times, Politico, Newsweek, and Time Magazine as well as serving as a legal analyst for NBC News and MSNBC.
Back here in Michigan, Barbara has been a recipient of the Neal Shine Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership as well as The Detroit News Michiganian of the Year Award.
Since 2017, she has served as the Law Professor from Practice at the University.
