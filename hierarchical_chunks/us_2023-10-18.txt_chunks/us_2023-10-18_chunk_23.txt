Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing and celebrating the lifetime of work that Reverend Freddie Banks has been kind enough to share with us.
He has spent his entire life in the service of others, and though he may be stepping down from the pulpit, we will be sure to feel his influence for years to come.
