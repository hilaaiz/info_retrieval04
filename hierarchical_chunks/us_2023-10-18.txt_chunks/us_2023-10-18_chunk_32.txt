Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor Sydney Massey, a recent graduate of eStem High Public Charter School, and a 2023 Presidential Scholar.
The U.S. Presidential Scholars program recognizes our nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors.
Sydney is one of only 161 students receiving the award this year, making it one of the highest honors for recent graduates.
This award serves as a well-deserved recognition of Sydney's many years of academic excellence.
Her dedication and commitment should serve as an example for our nation's youth.
In addition to receiving this award, she has also been recognized for scoring a perfect 36 on the ACT.
I congratulate Sydney on being named a Presidential Scholar and her many academic achievements, and I wish her the best in what is sure to be a bright future.
