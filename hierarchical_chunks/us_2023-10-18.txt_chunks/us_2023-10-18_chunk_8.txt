Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Barbara L. McQuade's service to our nation and to our great state.
No matter what position she has held, she has always been a bulwark against those who would prey on the weak from positions everywhere, and the future of our country is brighter with her teaching our children.
I thank Barbara for her service.
