Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to congratulate 21 rising and graduated seniors from Riverview High School in Searcy.
Each of these gifted students have taken and passed a dual-credit history course from their high school in partnership with Arkansas State University-Beebe.
With this complete, they will already be ahead in their college education and be set for success wherever they may go.
I was delighted to welcome these talented students to our Nation's Capital just a few weeks ago and show them the history of the United States firsthand.
To make the trip, these young men and women tirelessly raised the funds themselves by working concession stands and hosting car washes.
Their hard work inside and outside of the classroom will ensure that they achieve excellence in their future endeavors.
It's wonderful to see the hard work of our students and I wish them continued success in their future education.
