Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor Julia Bullock, a longtime Searcy resident and the National Guard's 2023 Armed Forces Military Spouse of the Year.
Julia serves as the Soldier and Family Readiness Group coordinator for Headquarters Company, 2-153 IN, and as one of the coordinators for the overall Battalion.
In her role, Julia tirelessly works to help soldiers and their families access resources within the community that can help them through major issues, especially home and food insecurity.
She also serves as an advocate for the Guard, frequently speaking to Arkansas elected officials to advocate for long-lasting solutions to these challenges for our military families.
Julia and her husband, Michael, an Arkansas Army National Guardsman, reside in Searcy with their children.
I extend my sincere gratitude to her and her family for their tremendous service.
