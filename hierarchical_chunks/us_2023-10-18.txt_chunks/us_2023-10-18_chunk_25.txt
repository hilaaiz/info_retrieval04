Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the life and legacy.
October 22, 2023, marks Lt. Col. Carruthers 100th birthday and the awarding of the prestigious French Legion of Honor medal--the highest level of recognition awarded by the French Government for his service to the country during WWII.
Lt. Col. Carruthers began his military career by joining the Army Air Corps at nineteen years old, where he proceeded to be a 2nd Lieutenant Bombardier during WWII.
During the war, his B-17 was shot down, and he spent 22 months in the German POW camp Stalag Luft 3, home of the Great Escape, the largest escape by allied Air Force personnel of the war.
After the war, he went on to have a thirty-plus year career in the United States Air Force, being awarded numerous medals, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, several Air Medals, and the Purple Heart in recognition of his outstanding and selfless service.
We are able to live free today because of the courage of men like Lt. Col. Carruthers, who put their lives on hold and answered their country's call when it needed them most.
Love of family, country, and a life dedicated to service sum up the character.
Col. Carruthers, a member of the Greatest Generation.
These stories will inspire future generations of Americans to pursue a life dedicated to causes greater than themselves.
I hope this testament to Lt. Col. Carruthers' life serves as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed to him by the American people.
On behalf of Texas' 21st Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary life.
Col. Carruthers and his dedicated service to our country.
Today, a grateful Nation thanks him.
