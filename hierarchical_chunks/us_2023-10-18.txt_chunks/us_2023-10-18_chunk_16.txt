Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Jason Smedley, a native of Little Rock and decorated Marine Corps veteran, who will serve as the commandant of the brand-new Arkansas Military and First Responders Academy.
His distinguished military service includes multiple deployments, working within the Pentagon, and a Purple Heart when serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Back home in Little Rock, Colonel Smedley has continued his service in the Marine Corps Reserves.
He has also strived to serve within his community, including time as a volunteer firefighter.
Colonel Smedley has proven his dedication time and time again to the United States Marine Corps, his home state of Arkansas, and the youth I thank him for his distinguished service, and I am confident that he will be an inspiring leader for the lucky students of the Arkansas Military and First Responders Academy.
Semper Fi Colonel.
