Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union for International Credit Union Day.
SchoolsFirst is a long-time community staple in my district, and I am delighted to celebrate their growth.
In 1934, a group of 126 Orange County school employees pooled together $1,200 to found SchoolsFirst, formerly known as the Orange County Teachers Credit Union.
The first branch was opened in Santa Ana.
SchoolsFirst has since expanded to become the state's largest Credit Union and the 5th largest in the Nation.
SchoolsFirst serves over 350,000 school employees who live or work in Orange County and their family members.
They have 22 branches in Orange County alone and 70 across California.
As a member-owned credit union, SchoolsFirst has been steadfastly committed to returning excess earnings to its members.
Nationwide, they have over $25 billion in assets and over 1 million members.
I am grateful for SchoolsFirst's charitable contributions to the community.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join me in celebrating SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union and their contributions to our Orange County community.
