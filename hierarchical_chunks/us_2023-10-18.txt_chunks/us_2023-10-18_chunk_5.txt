Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Assad Kelada for his almost five decades of incredible work.
As a young man, he quickly dazzled us with his humor and has been making families laugh together for decades, all while never forgetting his family and where he came from.
He is exemplary of everything we highlight when we speak about the American Dream, and I am sure he will continue to make us laugh for years to come.
I thank Asaad for his contributions.
