I welcome the Secretary of State’s warm words about improving affordable housing availability.
Does she agree that the affordability of housing is closely related to the bills that people have to pay—energy bills in particular?
Will she ensure that all new social housing from this stage forward is built to the highest possible standards of energy efficiency, to save people’s bills?
