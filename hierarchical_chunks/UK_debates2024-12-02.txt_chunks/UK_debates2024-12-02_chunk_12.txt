I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
The Government are acutely aware that far too many leaseholders across the country are routinely subject to unjustified permissions and administration fees, unreasonable or extortionate charges, and onerous conditions that are imposed with little or no consultation.
That is not what home ownership should entail, and it is why we must bring the system to an end in this Parliament.
As I set out in the written ministerial statement to which I referred earlier, the Government will act to protect leaseholders from abuse and poor service at the hands of unscrupulous managing agents, such as the ones my hon.
Friend mentioned, by strengthening regulation in this area.
