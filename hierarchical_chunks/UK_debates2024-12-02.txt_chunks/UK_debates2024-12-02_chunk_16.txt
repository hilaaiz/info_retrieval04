I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I am more than happy to sit down with her, or to join a call or meeting with leaseholders in her constituency, in order to discuss the Government’s plans to end the system in this Parliament.
We fully appreciate the wish of leaseholders across the country for us to act with speed.
As the ministerial statement sets out, we also have got to balance that with the need to get these reforms right.
The serious and specific flaws that were left to us by the previous Government in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 are a warning about what happens when reform in this area is not done properly.
