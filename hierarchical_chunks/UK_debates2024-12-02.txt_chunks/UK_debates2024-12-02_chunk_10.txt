I welcome the shadow Minister to his position.
May I remind him of the record of his party in government?
In those 14 years, 123,000 households, including 150,000 children, were living in temporary accommodation—not to mention the scandal of rough sleeping and the deaths caused by that Government’s neglect.
We are investing to tackle those issues and the mess that the hon.
Gentleman’s party left behind.
We have already announced £233 million in the Budget; Conservative Members need to decide whether to back us on the investment we are making to clean up the mess that he and they have left behind.
