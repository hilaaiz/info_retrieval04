I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his questions and his strong focus on this matter.
I think he has a bit of amnesia from when the Government he was a part of started these negotiations.
They held 11 rounds of negotiations, and it took a Labour Government to conclude them.
We have done so in the best interests of our national security, and the national security concerns of our closest allies.
It would not have been possible to secure a deal and the support of the United States if all parts of the US security apparatus were not in support of it, and as a former Defence Minister, the hon.
Gentleman will know that to be true, regardless of the politics he must play today.
