I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for that question.
It will probably not surprise her to hear that the first question I asked when I became Minister with responsibility for building safety was, “How many buildings need remediating?”
I do not think that it will surprise her or colleagues to hear how astonished I was to find out that between 4,000 and 7,000 buildings were  unidentified after seven years—which shows the previous Government’s intent.
We are going to identify them, work out what their risks are and get them remediated.
