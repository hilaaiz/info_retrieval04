Again, we have been looking at how we build safe, secure, energy-efficient homes that bring down people’s energy bills.
The previous Government saw energy bills go up really high.
We are introducing Great British Energy so that we can bring bills down, and are building the homes that people desperately need.
I am sure that the House agrees that affordable housing is important.
However, my experience in Leicester South is that all too often it is provided in new developments, as homes for shared ownership or as similar housing products, which are out of reach for the poorest in my community.
What my community really needs is more social rented houses.
What is the Secretary of State doing to promote the construction of social rented homes, as opposed to other affordable housing products?
I agree with the hon.
Member that we need more social homes.
That is why we have been putting more into the affordable homes programme.
We have made it absolutely clear that under section 106 notices, which he mentioned, homes need to be affordable; that is why we have put affordability tests in the NPPF.
We want to ensure that people have those homes, and we want to build the next generation of council and social housing—and we will.
