Sadly, homelessness is projected to rise by 27% this year.
The Government’s broken promise on national insurance rises has wreaked havoc across the charitable sector, with 110 national  homelessness charities warning the Chancellor that £50 million to £60 million will be lost in the sector and Homeless Link calling the increase “the final nail in the coffin” for the sector.
Will the Minister listen to that warning, and what will she be doing to convey these concerns to the Chancellor and change this disastrous policy?
