I used to have ginger hair as well!
May I give the right hon.
Lady the answer to my question?
It was the Foreign Secretary.
In opposition, the now Home Secretary warned that the Chinese Government are “attempting to influence Parliament”, and trying “to interfere in our democracy and undermine our security.”—[Official
Report,  11 September 2023 ; Vol. 737, c. 667.]
Those risks are all heightened by this development.
Are this Government so desperate to counteract the disastrous Budget and their own growth-wrecking trade union Bill that they are now willing to override national security, national interests and the sensible concerns of their Home Secretary by kowtowing to the Chinese Government?
We have got record investment into the UK through our international business summit.
I am proud of our Employment Rights Bill, which is pro-worker and pro-employer.
It will reward good employers and put money back into the high street.
This Government take national security very seriously and will continue to do so.
Given that the mayoral council and leaders’ councils are being contemplated as part of the English devolution Bill, what steps is the Deputy Prime Minister taking to ensure that Cornwall’s voice is heard in Westminster, after being subsumed for far too long?
It was a pleasure to meet my hon.
Friend and colleagues to talk about devolution in Cornwall.
He will know that we have agreed to a non-mayoral devolution deal for Cornwall as a first step.
We recognise the distinct culture, history and identity of the Cornish people.
This important step will allow us to unlock deeper devolution in Cornwall and, in time, we hope it will allow Cornwall to take its seat at the Council of the Nations and Regions.
