I thank my hon.
Friend for taking the time to meet me to talk about devolution and growth in that region.
We are absolutely committed to ensuring that growth is felt in every part of the country, and that requires partnership from central Government, local government and the business community.
I would be more than happy to meet him to talk about how we can do that going forward.
