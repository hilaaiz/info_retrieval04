I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He will recognise—I know he does—that those types of developments are the result of the expansion of permitted development rights that was taken forward after 2013.
There are issues with the quality of some of the works that have come through that stream.
On the specific issue he raises, perhaps it might be a good idea if we sat down together.
I will happily discuss with him how we can protect leaseholders from those types of variable service charge increases.
