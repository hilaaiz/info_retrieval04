I welcome the Government’s commitment to continue our work to address issues with the current leasehold system.
However, where we are building new towns, such as Sherford in my constituency, residents, like others in new builds, face council tax and service charges, with no likelihood of that changing.
What plans does the Minister have to address the impact of service charges in new towns as part of leasehold reform?
