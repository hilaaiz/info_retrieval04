The hon.
Gentleman asked two quick questions.
We intend to continue our dialogue with the new Mauritian Government and our friends in the United States.
He will be aware, of course, that it is illegal under US law for us to engage directly with the new Administration until they come into place, but we will continue to have dialogue with our US and Mauritian friends.
I am surprised that as a former Defence Minister, the hon.
Gentleman is asking about costs.
He will know that it is usual for us to declare the operating and running costs of overseas bases, but it would compromise our operational security and long-term relationships if  we were to declare the Government-to-Government payment for overseas bases.
We have declared the operational running costs of our overseas bases, and we will continue to do so in response to parliamentary questions.
Detailing the security payments for Government-to-Government interactions is not something that this Government do, and was not something that his Government did either.
