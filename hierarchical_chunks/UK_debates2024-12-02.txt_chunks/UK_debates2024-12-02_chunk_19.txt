I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that supplementary question and assure him that I share his deep concern about the pressure on the household budgets of shared owners in his constituency, and others across the country, as a result of rising variable service charges.
In addition to the routes to redress I have just set out, I draw his and the House’s attention to the  measures in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 that are designed to drive up the transparency of service charges to make them more easily challengeable if leaseholders consider them unreasonable.
Further detail about our plan to bring those and other provisions in the Act into force can be found in the written ministerial statement made on  21 November .
