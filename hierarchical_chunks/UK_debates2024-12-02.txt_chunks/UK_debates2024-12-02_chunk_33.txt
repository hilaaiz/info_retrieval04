I welcome the Secretary of State’s announcement of the deadlines.
However, the National Audit Office report published last month shows that the majority of buildings affected by cladding have not been identified.
Will the Secretary of State go further by delivering a more joined-up approach, so that we can identify and remediate those properties as soon as possible?
