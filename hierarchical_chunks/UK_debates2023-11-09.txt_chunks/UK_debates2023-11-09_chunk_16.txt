I thank my right hon.
Friend for the update, but he will probably be aware that there are backdoor routes that are leading to technology ending up in Russia.
The most prevalent of those is British universities supplying technology to Iran that ends up on drones, which are then used by Russia to attack the brave Ukrainians.
Will he undertake to investigate this practice and put a stop to it, and to apply appropriate sanctions accordingly?
