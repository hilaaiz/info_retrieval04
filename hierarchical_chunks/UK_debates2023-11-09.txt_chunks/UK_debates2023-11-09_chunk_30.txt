I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
It is important to respect local decision making.
We know from the neighbourhood planning forums we helped to establish that quite often they are more ambitious about building homes in their area than their own local authorities.
We are on track to meet our manifesto commitment of 1 million new homes in this Parliament.
Since 2010, we have delivered over 2.2 million homes, with millions moving into home ownership.
Through the Levelling Up and Regeneration Act 2023, we are also improving the planning process.
At the heart of it, I am very happy to say, we still have local people and local decision making.
