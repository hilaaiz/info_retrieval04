I thank the hon.
Gentleman very much for his comments—I know the revelations in the British media to which he referred at the beginning of his remarks.
I will write to him today on some of the technical points he has raised, giving him a very specific answer.
On the general point he has made, I can tell him that Britain has prohibited the export to Russia of thousands of products, including semiconductors, and our trade with Russia is down over 96% from pre-invasion levels.
We are also providing advice to UK businesses on how to identify methods of circumvention and have shared a list of products of particular concern that could end up on the battlefield.
