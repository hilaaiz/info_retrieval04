My hon.
Friend accurately identifies dangers to the sanctions regimes that can cause them to be circumvented.
We are, I think, good at identifying and closing down such dangers, but I should make it clear to him that UK sanctions prohibit a range of activities related to the movement of prohibited items to and from Russia, both directly and indirectly.
In that context, I will consider carefully the point that my hon.
Friend has made.
