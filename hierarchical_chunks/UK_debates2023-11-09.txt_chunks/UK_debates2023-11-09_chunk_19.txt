The Foreign Affairs Committee recently described the UK Government’s efforts to sanction individuals and organisations linked to Russia’s Wagner terrorist group as “underwhelming in the extreme”.
What action do the Government intend to take in response to that report, so that organisations such as Wagner and those who run them are effectively sanctioned?
We know that Ukraine has imposed sanctions on the former KGB intelligence officer Alexander Lebedev.
Do the UK Government have any plans to follow suit?
