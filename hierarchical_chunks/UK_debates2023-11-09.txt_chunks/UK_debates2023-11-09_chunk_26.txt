I thank my hon.
Friend for the work he is doing.
He raises an important point, and if he were to apply for a debate, I am sure it would be well attended.
The Department of Health and Social Care invests about £1 billion a year in research through the National Institute for Health and Care Research, and that institution welcomes funding applications on any  aspect of health research.
Its expenditure on cancer research in the last financial year was over £100 million.
I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important matter, and I shall draw the attention of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to what he has said.
