I thank the right hon.
Lady for the work of her Committee.
I look forward to reading her report greatly.
I will give it close attention, as I always do.
Scrutiny of action by the police, or indeed any other public body, is not the same as interference.
Scrutiny is healthy and appropriate; interference is a different thing entirely.
There is a distinction between scrutiny and interference.
The operational independence principle is not one that we plan to revisit, but we look forward to discussing these questions, both with the right hon.
Lady’s Committee and in this House.
