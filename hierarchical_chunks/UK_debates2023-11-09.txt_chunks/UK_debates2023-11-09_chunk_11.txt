I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his words.
He is right to point out those examples where Members of this House, particularly on the Opposition Benches, have in the past criticised the police.
No one on those occasions claimed that those criticisms impinged on the operational independence of the police; they were simply holding the police to account, as politicians on both sides are entitled to do.
I am grateful to him for reminding the House of those previous occasions when Opposition Members have exercised their prerogative to hold the police to account.
