I thank the hon.
Gentleman very much for his comments.
We do not give routine updates or a running commentary on sanctions, but he may rest assured that we are looking at Hamas in every respect.
He drew attention to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee’s report; as he will know, we recently announced sanctions—both direct and indirect—against Wagner.
While we are careful not to discuss specific cases, we take all potential breaches very seriously, and all businesses that are registered in the UK are bound by law to comply with the Russia sanctions regime.
