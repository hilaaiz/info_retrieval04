I thank the shadow Home Secretary for her questions, as always.
She asked about where the Home Secretary is.
It may have been wise to ask that privately rather than publicly, but she is with a close family member who is having a hospital operation this morning.
I have the Home Secretary’s permission to say that to the House in the event that somebody raised it, as the shadow Home Secretary has done, so I am passing that message on to the House.
