As my right hon.
and learned Friend said, the police have a wide range of powers that they have been exercising under anti-terrorism legislation.
That legislation makes it an offence to glorify, promote and incite association with proscribed organisations, which of course includes Hamas.
Section 18—I think—of the Public Order Act makes it an offence to use threats to incite racial hatred.
There is a wide range of offences and they are being used.
So far during these protests, 188 people have been arrested for hate crimes in relation to glorifying Hamas, inciting violence, and apparently praising the appalling terrorist atrocities that were committed, and we expect that wide-range of powers to continue to be used.
