I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that very important point.
It is right that we mark the contribution of all ex-servicemen and women.
He mentions the—I think 120,000—Jewish servicemen who fought in world wars with our British armed forces.
These are incredibly important events, and  19 November  coincides with Mitsvah Day, a day when the Jewish community around the country will be supporting local charities and communities—another example of the service they give to their communities and this nation.
I am very happy to ensure that there is ministerial attendance at that event.
That tradition should continue.
I cannot tell him which Minister, but I shall make sure that all relevant Departments remember the request.
