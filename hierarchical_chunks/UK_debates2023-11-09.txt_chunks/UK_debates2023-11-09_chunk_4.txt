I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for his question.
His knowledge of the law in this area, as in all areas, is immaculate.
The commissioner does have powers under—I think—section I3 of the Public Order Act 1986 to ban marches in certain circumstances.
As my right hon.
and learned Friend says, it was last used about 11 years ago, so it is quite a rarely used power.
It applies when the police think that they are unable to deal with disorder that may break out.
That is  quite a high threshold.
The Metropolitan police have so far not made a request to the Home Secretary under that section, but, if they do so, it will be considered very carefully indeed.
