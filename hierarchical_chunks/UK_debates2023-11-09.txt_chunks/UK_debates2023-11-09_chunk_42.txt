I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that important point.
As someone who has been subject to such threats myself, I think these matters are very important.
We did work on this in the previous Session.
There is ongoing work in the Ministry of Justice and other Departments to ensure that people are able to whistleblow.
In other parts of Government, we have moved to protect individuals who find themselves in different but similar sets of circumstances, particularly relating to issues of employment and sexual harassment.
