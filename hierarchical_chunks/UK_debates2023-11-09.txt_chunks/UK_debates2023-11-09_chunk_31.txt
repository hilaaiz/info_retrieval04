Last Saturday I had the privilege of attending the launch of the north-east Field of Remembrance, run by the Royal British Legion, in Saltwell Park in my constituency.
Will the Leader of the House join me in thanking and congratulating the Royal British Legion on an excellent ceremony?
Saltwell Park is a massively brilliant venue for our north-east Field of Remembrance.
I was also wondering how soon we might get an announcement that will lead to the recommencement of the Backbench Business Committee in this Session of Parliament.
First of all, I am very happy to join the hon.
Gentleman in congratulating the Royal British Legion in his constituency on all the work they do all year round, but particularly at this time of year.
I have been prodding my colleagues with regard to his request, and I hope to have some news for him this afternoon.
This weekend, the nation will fall silent to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the great war, the second world war and other conflicts.
Next weekend at the Cenotaph, the Association of Jewish Ex-servicemen and Women will conduct its annual march.
That will be a really important security operation for the Metropolitan police.
Last year, my right hon.
and learned Friend  the Member for Cheltenham (Alex Chalk)  became the first ever Minister to lay a wreath at that service.
Will my right hon.
Friend allow a debate in Government time on the contribution made by Jewish ex-servicemen and women, and will she prevail on the Defence Secretary or a Defence Minister to attend the service and lay a wreath?
