I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this question, which will be of concern to everyone who has this condition, their carers and their families.
He will know that there is a very clear process to ensure the drugs that are available and approved by NICE are both cost-effective and clinically effective.
There are appeal processes, and I am sure he will assist his constituents to make representations.
Of course, even if a drug is not approved by NICE, patients can, in certain circumstances, still have access to it if it can be shown that the drug would disproportionately benefit that individual.
