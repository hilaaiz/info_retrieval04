I thank the Minister for his response.
He will know that there is unity across the House in standing with Ukraine, but there are serious concerns about the effectiveness of our sanctions regime.
Almost two years have passed since Putin began this phase of his illegal and barbaric invasion of Ukraine, but on Monday, it was revealed by The Times that a British company has allegedly continued to ship semiconductors to Russia since Putin’s war began and that these have been identified within at least one Russian tank deployed in the conflict against Ukraine.
It also reported that the company only stopped shipping to its Russian distributor after the bank refused to process payments for these exports.
There are clearly serious deficiencies in the implementation of our regime that must be addressed.
I had these raised with me on my recent visit to Kyiv, and I draw attention to my declaration of interests.
