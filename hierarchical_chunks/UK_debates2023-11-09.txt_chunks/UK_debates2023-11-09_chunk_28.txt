I thank the hon.
Lady for her questions.
The powerful words this week of Susie Flintham of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice should give us all pause for thought.
That is why the Government have placed professionalism and care of each other at the heart of what we do.
We are the first Government to have set up a ministerial human resources function in Whitehall—it is shameful that previously that did not exist.
That is also why we are focused on more training and support for MPs, Ministers and officials, and it is why, in my evidence to the Standards Committee, I said that the only way we will make the nation proud of our conduct here is to recognise the responsibility and duty  of care we have to each other across the hundreds of organisations that make up the political landscape—Parliament, political parties and Whitehall.
The Government and I as Leader of the House take these matters incredibly seriously.
