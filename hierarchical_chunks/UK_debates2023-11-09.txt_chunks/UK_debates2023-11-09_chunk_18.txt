I thank the Minister for his answer.
The SNP welcomes the extension of sanctions against the Russian regime, but we still think more needs to be done.
For example, are there any plans to extend the sanctions that are currently in place against Hamas and other terrorist organisations operating in the middle east, which we know are forging closer and closer links with Putin and his criminal terrorist networks?
In particular, the United States has already sanctioned a number of Hamas representatives and people close to Hamas operating in different countries  in the middle east.
Do the Minister and the Government have any plans to follow suit and sanction those same individuals?
