I thank the right hon.
Lady for her diligent campaigning on this matter.
She rightly notes that the compensation study was set up to run concurrently in order to save time.
I know that the Paymaster General is planning some engagement in the coming weeks with the groups that are campaigning.
Having raised this at a previous business questions, the right hon.
Lady will know that I have also raised it with the Paymaster General.
I will make sure that he hears what she has said again today.
I can tell her that he is committed to acting as swiftly as possible to ensure that all people, including those who should receive interim payments, do so.
