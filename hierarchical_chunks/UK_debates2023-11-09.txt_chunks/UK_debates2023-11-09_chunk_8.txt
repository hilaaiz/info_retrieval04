The Home Affairs Committee has spent many months scrutinising policing for a report that is due to be published tomorrow.
That scrutiny has included the principles of policing by consent and the operational independence of the police, free from political interference, in upholding the rule of law, as set down by Parliament on protests and other matters.
Alongside that, the Committee has been briefed on the policing of protests and will be looking to do more shortly.
However, given the comments from the Home Secretary, the principles of operational independence of policing dating back to 1285, and the policing protocol, which the Home Secretary agreed in June this year, can the Minister confirm that if there is to be any discussion of these long-standing policy principles of policing, Parliament is the place to do it, possibly including the use of a royal commission?
We should certainly not have these matters debated on the front page of newspapers at a time that is very challenging for communities in this nation.
