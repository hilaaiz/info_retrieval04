Notwithstanding the case the hon.
Lady raises, I am sure that she will recognise that the vast majority of level 7 apprenticeships were being used by people later in their careers, who already had degrees and who wanted management training, so we have had to look at whether that is sustainable and right.
However, she raises an important point about a scheme in the university in her constituency.
We need to get more young people into medicine, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and I will ensure that that particular offering is looked at and that she gets a full reply.
May I, too, offer my condolences to the shadow Leader of the House?
I concur with what he said: as a Parliament, we are better when we collaborate.
I want to raise a constituency issue.
Trade union reps do a fantastic job representing their colleagues, communities and professions.
However, a rep at a school in York has been suspended for carrying out trade union activities and raising employment rights.
Will the Leader of the House raise this grievous matter with Cabinet colleagues?
Our reps working in public services should not be suspended for raising concerns about issues such as funding across our education system.
Can pressure be put on the multi- academy trust, which is completely unaccountable, to reinstate this representative?
I am sorry to hear about the case my hon.
Friend raises.
She is right that our trade union representatives do an important job in our workplaces, providing a link between employer and employees, and ensuring that people have the standards and rights that they are entitled to at work, and that they are working in healthy and safe environments.
I will ensure that the case she raises is looked into.
We are taking steps to ensure that academy chains are held to account in the same way as local councils.
