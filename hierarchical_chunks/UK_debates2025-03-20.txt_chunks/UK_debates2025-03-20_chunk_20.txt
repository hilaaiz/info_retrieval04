I am grateful for the question from my hon.

We are absolutely determined to make the best of this opportunity, not least because the previous Government did not know how much we were actually buying.
The Secretary of State has announced that we will monitor the food bought in the public sector, and that will inform our policy of making sure that British farmers make the most of the opportunity for public procurement.
