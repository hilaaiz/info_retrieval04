The Conservative Government protected over 600,000 properties from flooding, introduced the £100 million frequently flooded allowance and committed to a £5.2 billion investment in flood protection.
However, we know that the mental health impacts of flooding remain long after the waters subside.
Rural communities face unique challenges, including outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza and foot and mouth—a clear and worrying threat, given the recent cases in Germany and Hungary.
Unfortunately, this Labour Government are exacerbating such stresses with their family farm tax and by scrapping the farming resilience fund, which supports mental health.
Can the Minister confirm, for the sake of mental health, what support will be offered to rural communities in place of the scrapped fund?

Gentleman.
He is quite right about this issue, which he has mentioned before.
I am in complete agreement with him about the impact of flooding on mental health, and I know that we all take it seriously.
We are investing £500,000 in mental health charities to support rural communities, but I completely recognise the devastation that flooding causes, and I am always happy to work with Members from across the House on how we can support people’s mental health.
If he will take steps to implement the provisions of the Environment Act 2021 on deforestation due diligence.
The biggest driver of deforestation worldwide is agricultural expansion,  particularly the production of a small number of commodities such as soy and palm oil.
This Government are considering the approach to the deforestation regulations, and nothing has yet been ruled in or out.
