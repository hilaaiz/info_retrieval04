I thank the hon.
Member for raising his concerns about coastal erosion, and he is right.
It is a huge problem, and with climate change it is only set to get worse.
I completely recognise how it is impacting coastal communities.
His suggestion to bring together the different devolved Governments to discuss this issue is really interesting, so let me take that away.
