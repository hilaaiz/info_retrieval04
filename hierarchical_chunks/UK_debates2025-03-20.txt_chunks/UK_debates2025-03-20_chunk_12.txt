I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this issue.
As I said, we are delivering a record £2.65 billon investment in building, maintaining and upgrading flood defences, and that money will be spent over the next two years.
We will shortly announce some of the projects that are going ahead in the next financial year, and next year we will announce even more.
There will be an announcement this year for the next financial year, and an announcement next year for the second half of the two-year record investment.
That shows out commitment to building, maintaining and improving flood defences up and down our country.
