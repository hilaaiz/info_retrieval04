Like people in Hartlepool, we in Bath recognise that the Conservative Government left our flood defences in a poor state, and we welcome the extra funding that the Bath flood defence scheme has received.
However, we worry that it has come too late in a lot of cases.
Is there a timeline for when my Bath constituents will actually see improvements?
