I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
I completely agree that the previous flooding formula did not work for rural communities, which is exactly why we are consulting to change it.
The consultation will be announced shortly, and I encourage him and every Member across the House to get involved in shaping the formula, so we can make sure it delivers the right outcomes for everybody up and down our country.
