I thank the Solicitor General for her answer.
Yesterday, I spoke to one of my constituents.
When she was 14, she was raped by an adult whom she should have been able to trust.
She woke up to him raping her.
She has been carrying that with her for decades.
Two years ago, she reported what happened to her and she has been fighting for her day in court all of that time.
Can the Solicitor General please set out what the Government are doing to fix the broken system that is failing to deliver justice, and will she meet me to discuss how we can better support victim survivors such as my constituent?
