I thank the hon.
Member for that question, and for passing on her condolences to the shadow Leader of the House.
She is right that getting young people into work is a priority for the Government, and it is important for the country that we do so.
We need to reform the apprenticeship system so that more apprenticeships are available for young people, but that is not the system we inherited.
In the system we inherited, the apprenticeship levy was underused and underspent, and apprenticeship starts were falling.
That is why we are creating Skills England and reforming the apprenticeship levy, so that the young people she talks about can get the help they need.
