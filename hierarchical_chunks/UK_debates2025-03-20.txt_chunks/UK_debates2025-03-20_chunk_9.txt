rose— The questions have to relate to Hartlepool’s flood defences.
I call the Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee.
The people of Chesterfield have great empathy with the people of Hartlepool, as we face exactly the same issues.
A new report by Public First shows that each year of flood events causes decade-long downward pressure on the economy worth up to £6 billion.
I am grateful that the Minister will shortly visit us in Chesterfield to see flood projects and vulnerabilities, but does she agree that there is acute need for projects like the one we require on the River Hipper, and the one required in Hartlepool?
It endangers the Government’s growth mission if we are not able to get these projects going.
I think we all have empathy with Hartlepool, so I encourage more people to ask questions on this issue.
I look forward to visiting my hon.
Friend’s constituency to find out more about the projects he mentions.
He is quite right to say—this is an argument that I hope we will all pursue ahead of the spring statement—that tackling flooding is a good, value-for-money investment, because it helps to protect our economy and ensure that we can have growth.
