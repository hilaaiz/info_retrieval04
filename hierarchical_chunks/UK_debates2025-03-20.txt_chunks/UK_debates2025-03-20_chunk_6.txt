I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue and for his recent letter.
He is right to be angry about the poor state of his flood defences, and I am sure his constituents value him as a local champion, raising that in the Chamber.
To rebuild after Conservative failure, we have had to urgently move £36 million into maintenance funding this year.
As I have mentioned, the projects to receive funding in the next financial year are being agreed and will be announced shortly.
