I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising the issue of the eradication of polio and for all his great leadership and work on this issue over many years.
It is an issue close to my heart: my mum had polio as a youngster, and she suffers from the consequences of that even today.
The Government strongly support global efforts to eradicate polio.
As he will know, decisions on the future of the overseas development aid budget are subject to the spending review, but I will absolutely ensure that his powerful and strong representation has been heard as part of those conversations.
