I thank the shadow Leader of the House for that tribute to his father, Torquil Norman.
I did not know him, but he sounds like a wonderful father—someone who invented children’s toys but also who had great wisdom and gave him great advice.
We in this House should all live by those values of positivity, creativity and resilience that the right hon.
Gentleman so fondly shared with us.
I send him and his family my very best wishes, as I am sure the whole House does, as he comes to terms with that in the coming days.
