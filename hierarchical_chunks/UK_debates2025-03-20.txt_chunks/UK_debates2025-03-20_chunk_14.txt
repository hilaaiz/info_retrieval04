I thank the Minister for her answer.
Communities in Cumbria have seen many devastating floods over the last two decades, but flood action groups in Keswick have worked hard with United Utilities to develop a scheme that uses Thirlmere reservoir as a storm water store, helping to prevent flooding in the town.
All agree that more could be done.
Although I applaud their work, I note that there is no statutory requirement for water companies to use their assets as flood defences.
Will the Minister look at how water companies’ assets can be used to prevent flooding across the country?
