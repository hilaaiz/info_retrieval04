I am grateful not only for the work that my hon.
Friend’s action flood group does, but for the work that flood action groups do right across the whole of his constituency.
He raises an incredibly important and interesting issue.
In the Sir John Cunliffe review, we are fundamentally looking at the management of water right across entire catchment areas.
When we think about water management, we need to consider not only whether communities have enough water to meet their needs, but whether they have protection from flooding and drought.
A holistic way of dealing with some of the challenges we face is certainly one of the answers going forward.
My hon.
Friend has given a great example, and I would be happy to explore it further with him.
