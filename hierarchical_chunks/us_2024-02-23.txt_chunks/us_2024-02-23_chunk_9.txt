Mr. Speaker, outreach was made to the sponsor of H. Res.
966 on several occasions to support the inclusion of Palestinians who had been victims of sexual violence into the Resolution.
However, the sponsor denied adding in any language that supports the well-documented fact that Palestinians have faced many atrocities similar to those described in the Resolution.
Sexual violence is abhorrent and must be fully investigated and prosecuted.
The intentional omission of Palestinian lived experiences in this resolution is dehumanizing and a disservice to survivors everywhere.
