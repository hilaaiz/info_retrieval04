Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate Black History Month, a time dedicated to recognizing the contributions of African Americans to the rich tapestry of American history.
This month serves as an opportunity to reflect on the achievements, struggles, and enduring resilience of the Black community.
One noteworthy aspect of Black history that deserves recognition is the profound impact of African Americans on the world of music, particularly in the realm of jazz.
Jazz, born from the African American experience, has become a universal language, transcending borders and connecting people from diverse backgrounds.
It is a powerful expression of creativity, resilience, and cultural richness.
In this context, I'd like to emphasize the significant partnership of the Turkish Embassy and the Ertegun brothers.
Sons of Turkey's first ambassador to the United States, Ahmet and Nesuhi believed in the power of music to bring people together.
Beginning in 1940, musicians such as Duke Ellington, Johnny Hodges, ``Lead Belly,'' Teddy Wilson, Lester Young, and members of the Benny Goodman, Ellington and Count Basie orchestras performed at the Turkish Embassy.
Their father insisted that in the embassy, all, regardless of color, be treated with dignity and respect.
As co-founders of Atlantic Records, the Ertegun brothers were instrumental in bringing together artists from different backgrounds, breaking down racial and cultural barriers in the world of music.
Ahmet traveled to New Orleans and Harlem to sign the greatest black musicians of the time, including Stick McGhee, The Harlemaires, and The Drifters.
In the 1960s, Atlantic Records, often in partnerships with local labels like Stax Records in Memphis, helped to develop the growth of soul music, with artists such as Ben E. King, Solomon Burke, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Percy Sledge, Aretha Franklin, and Wilson Pickett.
The Turkish Embassy's commitment to hosting these jam sessions exemplifies the importance of cultural diplomacy and the unifying power of music.
Through these events, artists of diverse backgrounds, including African American musicians, have had the opportunity to showcase their talents, bridging cultural gaps and promoting understanding.
As we commemorate Black History Month, let us go beyond celebrating the achievements of the past but also recognize the importance of continued collaboration and dialogue to build a more harmonious future.
The blending of Black history and jazz, coupled with the dedicated endeavors of entities such as the Turkish Embassy and the Ertegun brothers, stands as a powerful tribute to the transformative potential I encourage my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the significance of Black History Month, celebrating the contributions of African Americans to the arts and culture, and recognizing the positive impact of initiatives like the Turkish Embassy-hosted jam sessions in fostering unity and understanding.
