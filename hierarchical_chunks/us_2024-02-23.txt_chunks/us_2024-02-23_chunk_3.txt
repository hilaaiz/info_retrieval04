Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Kosovo's Independence Day on February 17th.
This date marks 16 years since Kosovo declared independence in 2008 after enduring years of conflict.
Kosovo has since emerged as an independent democratic nation and today is one of the most valuable allies of the American people.
In celebrating this occasion, I also celebrate the many AlbanianAmericans who have made Michigan their home.
Our community continues to grow and foster immense cultural, economic, and creative growth throughout the State.
These families embody the values of freedom and democracy that represent the American Dream.
Historically, Michigan itself has played a substantial--and proud-- role in Kosovo's road to stability and democracy through the deployment I am delighted to honor the independence of Kosovo alongside the vibrant and ever-growing Albanian-American community that calls Michigan its home.
Kosovo's remarkable transition into sovereignty, alongside our state's everlasting bonds with the Albanian-American people, represents the power of democracy both at home and abroad.
The shared principles between our two nations truly represent the ideals that have turned our connection into economic prowess, shared defense, and international cooperation.
