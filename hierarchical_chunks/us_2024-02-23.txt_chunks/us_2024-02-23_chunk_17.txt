Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Chief Timm Schabbel, who recently retired as Fire Chief of the Clay Fire Territory in South Bend, Indiana, after 35 impressive years with the department.
During his nearly four decades in public safety, Timm has served in different roles within the fire department, including as a firefighter, Engineer, Lieutenant, Chief of Operations, and Fire Chief.
Timm was promoted to Fire Chief in 1997, making him the longest tenured chief officer in the agency's 75-year history.
Under Chief Schabbel's leadership, Clay Fire became the first internationally accredited fire department in Indiana.
In addition, Clay Fire also expanded under Chief Schabbel's tenure, essentially tripling the area the department covers.
These achievements were only possible thanks to Timm's vision and determination.
