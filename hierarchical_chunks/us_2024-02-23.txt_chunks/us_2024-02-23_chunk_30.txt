Mr. NUNN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the tremendous life of Gunner Anthony Vignaroli who passed away on February 6, 2024.
Tony made service to his country and the state of Iowa his life's calling.
Following his graduation from Saydel High School, Tony embarked on a life of dedicated service.
He served our country valiantly in the Vietnam War and then worked at Valley View Village as a Maintenance Supervisor.
Many knew him for his work as a volunteer for the Department of Public Safety at the Iowa State Fair, where he helped with security efforts.
I was honored to work directly with Tony to enhance Iowa State Fair safety for more than a million visitors by acquiring a security tower for the midway.
