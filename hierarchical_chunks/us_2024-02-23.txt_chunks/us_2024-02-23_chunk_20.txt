The many awards and accolades he has received over the years-- including Firefighter of the Year from Clay Township, Fire Chief of the Year from the state of Indiana, the President's Award from the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Sagamore of the Wabash award--are all a testament to Timm's commitment to excellence and an accomplished career spent in the service to others.
The broader South Bend community and St. Joseph County are unquestionably better off and safer thanks to this good man who exemplifies what it means to be a leader and a true public servant.
Timm's example and leadership are also reminders that first responders are on the frontlines of some of the most difficult situations our communities face.
When there is a problem, first responders like Timm answer the call and willingly put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe, and for that all of us are extremely grateful.
I am proud to join so many Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second District in expressing our appreciation to Chief Schabbel for his service and in wishing him and his family all the best going forward during Timm's very well-deserved retirement.
I thank Timm.
