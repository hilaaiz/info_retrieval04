Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of 20year-old Alexa Bartell from Arvada, Colorado.
Alexa's friends and family knew her as an outgoing, compassionate, and energetic young woman, saying she could light up the room with her infectious personality.
She loved basketball, music, and connecting with others.
Tragically, Alexa's life was cut short in April of 2023 by an act of reckless endangerment when she was driving near her hometown.
Everyone who was fortunate to meet Alexa could see how intelligent, funny, and kind she was, and this tragedy took away her bright future.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, we honor the life of Alexa Bartell and continue to send support and love to her family and friends.
In remembering Alexa, we not only mourn her passing, but also celebrate the joy and warmth she brought into the lives of those around her.
