Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, on February 14, during Roll Call No. 44, I recorded my vote as Present.
The reason for my vote is as follows: All acts of sexual violence are horrific.
We should all be fighting to end it here at home and all over the world.
So, while this resolution rightly denounces any sexual committed by Hamas, I am disturbed that it completely ignores and erases any sexual abuse and violence committed by Israeli forces against Palestinians, especially children.
War crimes cannot justify more war crimes.
We must stand up for everyone's safety and human rights, no matter their faith or ethnicity.
There are numerous, well-documented reports of sexual violence, including rape, committed by Israeli forces against Palestinians in their custody.
Children detained and stripped to their underwear in public, for the world to see.
The UN and human rights groups have raised alarms for years--but Congress has never cared.
We all have a responsibility to denounce sexual violence in all forms, regardless of who is responsible.
This resolution falls well short of that responsibility.
