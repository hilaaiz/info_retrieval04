The Secretary of State says he cannot put himself in the shoes of the victims, but he could listen to them.
Can he tell us how many or what percentage of the victims he has met have shown support for this piece of legislation?
Very few have shown support for this legislation, but I have met many, as has my Lords Minister, Lord Caine.
In fact, part of the process of changing the Bill has come from those conversations.
I understand that lots of families do not want this Bill, but the question then is: if not this Bill, then what?

The hon.
Member for Foyle (Colum Eastwood)  says “Stormont House”, but he knows that Stormont House did not have cross-party agreement at the time and that the Ulster Unionist party did not agree to it— rose— I happily give way.
Please correct me.
Would the Minister acknowledge that it did have cross-party support—the Ulster Unionists deferred on one small matter—and that it was recommitted to by his Government and the Irish Government as recently as January 2020?
And it did not move forward because of the different political issues that came about.
