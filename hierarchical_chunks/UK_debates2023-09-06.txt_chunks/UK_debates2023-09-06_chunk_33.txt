I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point, for the way he has raised it, and indeed for the numerous conversations we have had on these matters outside this place and within it.
He knows the answer that I am going to give him.
I will never, and can never, put myself in the shoes of the people who have lost someone.
I just cannot.
However, I can see a process that has worked for only a very few people, considering the quantum of people who were affected by the troubles and who lost people.
Indeed, the chances of getting justice for them are dwindling all the time.
