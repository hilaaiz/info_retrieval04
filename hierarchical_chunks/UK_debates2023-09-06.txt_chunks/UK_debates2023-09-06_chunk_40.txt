I thank the Chairman of the Select Committee for his point.
He will know that other amendments I have tabled have tried to make this body as independent as it can possibly be.
I am sure he will have taken great heart from the appointment of the chief commissioner designate, Sir Declan Morgan, and from the comments he has been making about how he  intends to go about his business.
He is engaging widely, even at this point, and will do so even further when the Bill gets Royal Assent and becomes an Act.
Just in the practice of Sir Declan in putting the flesh on the framework that we are building here for the commission, I think my hon.
Friend will see that there are lots of opportunities for it to do exactly what he wishes it to do.
