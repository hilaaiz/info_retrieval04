This was never going to be an easy issue, or an easy Bill.
If it was easy, it would have been done many years ago.
What the Government are proposing may be right, or it may be part right and part wrong.
I certainly think that giving those survivors and their families a right to veto would be the wrong step to take, so the Government are right on that.
However, I think the House will find comfort in the fact that the Secretary of State will keep the progress of the enactment under review, and if there is abuse or things that are wrong, we can revisit it, tidy it up and make it work better.
This cannot be seen as a closed chapter, job done.
Rather, it is the start of a new process—quite experimental in some ways—of learning from other people’s experiences.
If we have that comfort that this is amendable and reviewable, it might help to assuage some, if not all, the concerns.
