I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that question, the way he poses it and the point behind it.
The senior management team is a strong and effective unit, and the Policing Board has a lot on its plate at this point in time.
I believe it has even launched a review into how the Policing Board itself operates.
I am quite sure that questions are being asked about what can be done in this space but, as of now, I can update the House only on what I have done.
