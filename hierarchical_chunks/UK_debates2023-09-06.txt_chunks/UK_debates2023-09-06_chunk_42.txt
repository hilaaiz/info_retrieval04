I thank my hon.
Friend for his point and for his committed work in my Department.
I was not there at the time, but I know of it.
I understand the point that he makes.
Over the past year, we have endeavoured through amendments to make the Bill very much focused on all victims of the troubles, so that all victims can, if they choose to do so, contact the commission and start a process that will hopefully get them some information in relatively quick time.
