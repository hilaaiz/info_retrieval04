I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his point.
The many amendments to this Bill throughout the last year have included measures on how families should be engaged with and how their views should be heard throughout the process.
To ensure that the commission can obtain as much information for families as possible, we need to ensure that the right incentives are in place for individuals to come forward and provide that information.
The possibility that eligible individuals who co-operate fully with the commission could then be prevented from obtaining immunity from prosecution is highly likely to act as a significant disincentive for individuals to disclose that information.
