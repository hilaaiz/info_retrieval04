The Minister made this very point at an event that I was at at the weekend, but it was Chatham House rules so I am not allowed to talk about it.
He puts forward the argument that the parties just could not agree, but I was involved in many of those discussions and I can tell him that the British Government dragged their feet month after month around the issue of onward disclosure.
That is what happened, and it is important to put that on the record.
The vast majority  of political parties and victims’ groups in Northern Ireland supported Stormont House but the British Government just did not want to do it.
That is why it did not get delivered.
I am afraid I do not quite believe that that is the case.
However, the British Government have committed to full disclosure to the ICRIR, which allows for a huge amount of information to be put forward in those circumstances and the possibility of ensuring that the commissioner can obtain as much information as possible from families.
