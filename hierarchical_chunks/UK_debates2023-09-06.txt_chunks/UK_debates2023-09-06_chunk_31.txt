I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
I extend my sympathies to her constituent’s family, as she raised.
She is right to continue campaigning in this important area.
I hope she will understand that I cannot pre-empt the specific contents of the strategy, but I can tell her that it will draw on previous work, including submissions from childhood cancer charities and stakeholders to our recent calls for evidence.
Of course, we want to hear from them to highlight and get a sense of the issues that she specifically raised, but I will ensure that we write to her to give her a sense of the timing.
