I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his supplementary question.
Northern Ireland benefits from being part of the United Kingdom with access to electricity from Great Britain through the interconnector, and it also benefits from being part of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland.
I and the Minister of State worked hard to ensure that that was preserved during the UK’s exit from the European Union.
We are working very closely with all officials across Government here and in the Northern Ireland civil service to ensure that the right preparations are in place for the winter.
