One of our priorities now is the successful implementation of the Windsor framework and that green channel.
We will continue to have conversations with colleagues in the Cabinet Office who lead the  Windsor framework taskforce.
I assure my hon.
Friend that we are determined to ensure that that system works as seamlessly for everyone.
Will the Minister confirm that at next week’s investment conference the Government will proactively market Northern Ireland’s dual market access under the Windsor framework?
Yes, I can confirm that.
I am absolutely determined that we shall do so.
Indeed, next week I shall chair a session on that issue.
This is not just about access as of right to the UK market and as a privilege to the EU market; it is also about being under our services regulation, which is an advantage, in combination with access to our free trade agreements, such as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership.
This is a unique opportunity in all of the world, including right across the EU, and I am convinced that he and I, and we all, should make the most of it.
