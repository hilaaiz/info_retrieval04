Oldham is a wonderful place but it is not without challenges.
The local community is concerned about the number of young people who have been drawn into gang activity and who are at risk of child criminal exploitation.
Figures over the last two years show that 312 young people have been identified as being at risk of exploitation.
We have had five section 60 stop and searches in place over the last year because of the number of knife incidents.
Can we have a debate in Government time on what is being done in urban areas where criminal exploitation is not being checked?
