I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on his ingenuity in managing to squeeze that in.
That was an excellent bit of Order Paper operation.
I am happy to meet him to talk about what we are doing in his area to smooth the experience of victims of crime who have  to go through the criminal justice system.
They have suffered trauma already; the system should not add to that.
What steps the Crown Prosecution Service is taking to prosecute people for the trafficking of vulnerable adults and children into the UK.
The CPS has specially trained prosecutors who work closely with law enforcement agencies to bring to justice those who commit the heinous crimes to which the hon.
Lady refers.
The CPS has, for example, recently obtained convictions in the first prosecution for trafficking people for organ  harvesting.
That presented many complex and difficult challenges, and I commend the teams in the CPS for their work on that.
Last year, the number of potential UK victims of modern slavery reached a record level, with referrals for women and children both at all-time highs.
In 2022, the average wait for a first decision in modern slavery cases was six days.
In 2023, it was 23 days.
Modern slavery is getting worse, not better, and now the UK Government are actively making progress on seeking to strip people of modern slavery protections.
When will the Government accept that this is a crisis, and take the urgent action needed?
The hon.
Lady is quite right to draw attention to the seriousness of this crime, but the Government accept the urgency, which is why, for example, we have the CPS available to provide early advice to law enforcement in exactly the cases that she refers to.
We have specialist prosecutors providing that advice, so that we have the right advice and the right charges against the right people at the right time.
