The Minister told me in January this year that the chemicals strategy will be produced next year, before correcting it to this year.
Whether it is this year, next year or sometime never, does she agree that the strategy will be worth the paper it is written on only if the UK regulations catch up with other countries and stop hazardous substances being dumped here, damaging our environment and public health?
As the hon.
Member will know, there is a global framework on chemicals.
I attended a conference on the UN global framework on chemicals back in September in Bonn.
We signed up to the framework, which is binding, sets targets and international commitments, and relates to finance capacity-building, so that we can soundly manage and handle our chemicals and waste, and that is exactly what we are doing with our bespoke UK strategy.
