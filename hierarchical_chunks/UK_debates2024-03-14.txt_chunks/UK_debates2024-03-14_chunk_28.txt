I welcome the Attorney General’s comments.
I think every one of us shares the desire for the fighting to stop, and respect for the International Court of Justice.
However, does she agree that it is important to be careful when we use legal terms in broader political debate?
For example, the test of plausibility in the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice is essentially about the admissibility of a claim, rather than its ultimate merits.
The Court itself has described that, in a judgment involving Myanmar, as a “low threshold”.
It is important not to make more of a preliminary finding than we should before final litigation is completed.
