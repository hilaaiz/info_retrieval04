When I visited the region with  the hon.
Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell)  many years ago, we saw some of the actions of settlers in the occupied territories.
So far as I was able to, I reprised that visit when I went to the region most recently, and I was surprised at the difference in the level of violence used.
I was able to visit a Bedouin village and talk to those who feel that at a very difficult time for the farming community, during lambing, they were being pushed off their land.
I listened very carefully to what the hon.
Gentleman said, and I reassure him that the Government continue to keep this issue under review.
