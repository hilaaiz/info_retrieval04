Education is the bedrock to levelling up in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke.
I am delighted by the improvement since 2010, with some 92% of schools now rated “good”  or “outstanding”.
Mill Hill Primary Academy and New Ford Academy in Smallthorne have both recently received “outstanding” status.
Sadly, Labour’s abysmal and dismal record looms large and haunts Stoke-on-Trent.
Thanks to Labour, 88 schools are languishing in disastrous private finance initiative deals.
Recent hikes to the charges facing those schools could put staff livelihoods at risk, as well as undermining the very fabric of what we are trying to do, which is to turn education around in our great city after Labour’s abysmal failure.
Will the Leader of the House assist me in securing an Adjournment debate or a Westminster Hall debate so that I can raise these matters directly with the relevant Department, in order to ensure that those 88 schools can and will be protected?
