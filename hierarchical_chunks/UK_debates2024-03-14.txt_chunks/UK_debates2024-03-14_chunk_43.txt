I welcome the hon.
Lady’s welcome of the Post Office (Horizon System)
Offences Bill, which I hope her party will support.
She knows that we will shortly bring forward measures to rectify the situation on infected blood.
These scandals did not arise under this Administration, but we have gripped the issues.
The infected blood issue had been left for decades, but we have investigated and set up inquiries and are compensating the victims.
I hope the House will support us in doing so on both matters.
