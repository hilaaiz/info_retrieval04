I am absolutely certain that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General will have been as shocked as I was to read this week’s report by researchers at Warwick University on the recent handling of rape cases by the CPS.
In far too many areas, the picture it paints is simply appalling: poor communication, poor quality control, poor decision-making, outdated attitudes, stereotypes and victim blaming, added to the constant problem of staff being overworked and under-resourced.
The one positive is that it was the CPS that commissioned the report in the first place.
It has not shied away from the findings, and researchers are clear that the roll-out of Operation Soteria will take things in the right direction.
Do the Law Officers agree that we simply cannot leave things there?
Will they undertake to come back to the House with an action plan based on the findings of this report, and a clear timetable for its implementation?
I am grateful to the right hon.
Lady for raising that.
I am horrified by a great number of the findings.
There is clearly a lot of work here.
Things are clearly moving in the right direction, and much of the work being undertaken by the CPS is on liaising with victims and ensuring that their experience  is as easy as possible, in the hugely traumatic circumstances.
There is a lot more to do on joint working, but I am happy to continue liaising with her, in order to update her as this goes forward.
What steps the Crown Prosecution Service is taking to improve the experience of victims of crime in Kettering constituency.
My hon.
Friend will be pleased to hear that CPS East Midlands is now making charging decisions for rape cases more quickly.
In 2022 and 2023, the area was performing better than the national average on reducing victim attrition.
