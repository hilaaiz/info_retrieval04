It is good to hear inclusive politics.
May I ask the Leader of the House whether, following consultations, there might be a statement before or after Easter on inclusivity in Parliament?
We rightly want to embrace and value difference and diversity, whether of a person’s race, gender, other characteristics, background or experience.
The word that is missing is “sex”.
Over the last five years, those who are gender critical have raised all sorts of issues, including the constant use of puberty blockers for children and the attack on the  LGB Alliance for not swallowing what Stonewall and Mermaids persuaded many Government Departments and agencies to do, which was to disregard sex completely.
While wanting to support trans people and make sure that they can have a life free from bigotry and fear, would it be possible for the House to examine its own policies on inclusiveness and try to ensure that the word “sex” is included along with the other characteristics for which people should not be discriminated against?
My hon.
Friend raises a very important point, and I know that many members of the House of Commons Commission will have heard what he has said.
This is a very important matter.
When the Government have put forward measures—for example, to protect single-sex spaces, which are important and valued by many people in this country—we have also been reassuring about what that means for trans people and those living in a different gender.
It is perfectly possible to do both, and I think that the House having a further focus on the issue is a very good suggestion.
