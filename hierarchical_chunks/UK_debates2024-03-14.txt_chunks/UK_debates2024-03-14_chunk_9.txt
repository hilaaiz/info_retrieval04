I welcome the action that this Government are taking to improve water quality, but in Wales, which has some of the worst levels of sewage pollution, there are no legally binding targets for the water companies to reduce sewage or to upgrade their waste water treatment plants, and there is no overall reduction plan for sewage.
There are not even any prosecutions, because the policy in Wales is not to prosecute these companies.
Does the Minister know which party is running the Administration in Wales?
