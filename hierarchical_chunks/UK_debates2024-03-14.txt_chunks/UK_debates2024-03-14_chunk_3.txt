I thank the Secretary of State for his answer.
In recent months, parts of North Warwickshire and Bedworth, including Austrey, Polesworth and the Woodlands, have seen significant and unprecedented flooding, which has caused real damage to houses and businesses and upheaval for local residents.
Will the Secretary of State set out what other steps can be taken to prevent this from happening and to stop these situations becoming the norm?
