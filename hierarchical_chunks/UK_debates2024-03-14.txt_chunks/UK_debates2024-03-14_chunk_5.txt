I thank the Secretary of State for his response.
As he will know, the Northern Ireland Assembly is back up and running.
We have a Minister in place to deal with flooding, but money must be spent wisely and effectively.
What discussions has the Secretary of State had with the Northern Ireland Assembly Minister at this early stage to ensure that lessons learned here on the mainland can be used back home, where over the past year flooding has become an exceptional problem that worries many people?
