I thank my hon.
Friend for being a champion for his constituents, in particular by trying to get levelling-up funding.
He will know that the processes that assess where funding is directed are independent of Ministers, and that the criteria and grading are transparent.
He will also know that where people have not been successful, the Department has quite often worked with local authorities and Members of the House to improve the bids put forward.
I encourage my hon.
Friend to go and talk to the Secretary of State, and I will ensure he knows that my hon.
Friend has raised the issue today.
