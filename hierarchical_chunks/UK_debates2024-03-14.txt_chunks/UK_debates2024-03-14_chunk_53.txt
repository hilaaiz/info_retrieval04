I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this important matter.
I encourage him to raise it with his local police and crime commissioner, as I am sure he has.
I will ensure that the Home Secretary has heard what he has said today, but I would encourage him to address the issue with his local constabulary and the police and crime commissioner.
