I thank the Minister responsible for water for coming to Vale Road in Colwick recently to meet residents affected by flooding.
I know that that meeting was very much appreciated.
Will the Minister reassure me that he and his Department will carry on working with me to continue to improve flood defences in Colwick and across Nottinghamshire, so that the residents can sleep a little better at night?
