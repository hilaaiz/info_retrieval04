I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important point.
She will appreciate that these situations are often incredibly complicated and involve many factors.
However, it is important to ensure that we know where children are and what education they are getting.
It is particularly important after the pandemic that we ensure that all children are getting access to a good education.
