Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Memorial Day, a time to commemorate the valor and sacrifices of the brave men and women who laid down their lives in service to our nation.
To recall those who enlisted in our armed forces and fought to preserve our American liberties, values, and way of life.
We remember the men who ran ashore the beaches of Normandy to end WWII; those who fought in the snows of Korea; the bravery of those who fought in the impenetrable jungles and unbearable heat of Vietnam; as well as the men and women who were called to serve in the aftermath of 9/11.
America is the world's superpower, but our freedom comes at a cost that has included the lives of the brightest and boldest of our Nation.
It is only fitting that on Memorial Day, we find ourselves reflecting on those individuals who so bravely and instinctively risked their all in the face of severe danger.
I am reminded of the poignant words of Navy veteran Jack Crawford, who, while serving aboard the USS Yorktown when it was sunk during the Battle of Midway in 1942, once stated: ``There aren't many things you can take out of this planet... but you can take with you, wherever you go, consciousness of duty faithfully performed.''
That which we simply call `duty,' a word we use freely and do not give the reverence it deserves--is the motto, way of life and heartfelt song of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guard members, who constantly and without hesitation put their lives on the line for our freedoms.
