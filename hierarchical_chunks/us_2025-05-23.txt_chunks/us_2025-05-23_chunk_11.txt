Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Joshua Kyong won Jung is the president of the Orlando Korea Culture Center (OKCC) and the founding pastor of Sunlight Grace Church in Orlando, Florida.
He currently serves as the chairman of the Asian American Heritage Council of Central Florida (AAHC-CF), a regional organization dedicated to celebrating and promoting Asian cultural heritage.
Originally from South Korea, Joshua immigrated to the United States at the age of 29 to pursue a Master.
In 2014, he planted Sunlight Grace Church and, just two years later, led the founding of the OKCC as a community outreach initiative aimed at sharing Korean culture.
Despite initial challenges, the growing popularity of K-pop and Korean media helped OKCC gain traction, offering programs such as Korean language classes, cultural events, and food experiences.
Joshua's vision has always been to build bridges between cultures, fostering greater understanding and appreciation among the diverse communities.
His leadership, both in ministry and in cultural outreach, continues to make a significant impact on the region, empowering the next generation and bringing communities together through faith, education, and celebration of heritage.
