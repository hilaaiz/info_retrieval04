Mr. DeJoy helped navigate the United States Postal Service through the uncertainty brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Under his direction, the U.S. Postal Service maintained its essential mission of delivering mail and packages to the American people, keeping family and friends connected in this challenging time.
In addition to navigating the pandemic, 
Mr. DeJoy was responsible for implementing important reforms and cost-saving measures with the goal goals, 
Mr. DeJoy secured $50 billion dollars from Congress for USPS restructuring, as well as sought assistance from the Department of Government Efficiency to streamline the USPS and successfully improve the inner workings of the agency.
