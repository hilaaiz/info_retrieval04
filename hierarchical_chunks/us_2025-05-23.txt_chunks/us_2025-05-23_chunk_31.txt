Mr. Speaker, the men and women who have given their lives in service to this nation are--irrevocably--heroes.
When their country called, they answered.
No matter how they found their way to service, each took it upon him or herself to serve faithfully and to their fullest, while giving their last measure of devotion to our country.
We owe them more than just remembrance; we owe them gratitude, respect, and a promise to forever uphold the values for which they fought and died.
