Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, standing at Arlington National Cemetery, the weight of history surrounds you--rows of white headstones stretching endlessly, each marking a life dedicated to service.
But among them, one site stands apart: the eternal flame at President John F. Kennedy's final resting place.
As the flame flickers, unwavering, the words from his inaugural address echo in your mind.
``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.''
President Kennedy spoke those words in 1961, but he could have said them today, or yesterday.
More than a declaration, those words are a promise woven into the fabric of American history, upheld by the generations of men and women laid to rest around him.
To put it simply, President Kennedy's immortal words encapsulate Memorial Day perfectly.
