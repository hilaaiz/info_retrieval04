Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the extraordinary bravery and selfless service demonstrated by Deputy Christopher Parish
This past April, Deputy Parish responded to a vehicle fire near a residence in Winamac, Indiana.
Upon arrival, he discovered that the fire had spread to the house, which was rapidly becoming engulfed in flames.
Although initial reports indicated that all occupants had evacuated.
Deputy Parish heard a voice from inside the burning home.
Without hesitation, he broke a window using his flashlight, but dense smoke prevented the trapped individual from escaping.
At this critical moment, volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson arrived on the scene.
Together, Deputy Parish and Firefighter Anderson entered the smokefilled room through the broken window and successfully rescued the individual, pulling him to safety just before the fire overtook the room.
The rescued individual received immediate medical attention and is currently in stable condition.
Deputy Parish was treated for smoke inhalation and sustained minor cuts during the rescue.
Deputy Parish's actions exemplify the highest standards of public service and courage.
His quick thinking and fearless response undoubtedly saved a life that day.
His heroism serves as an inspiration to us all and underscores the vital role of first responders in our committees.
I thank Deputy Christopher Parish for his valor and dedication to public safety.
