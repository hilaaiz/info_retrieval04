Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional service.
Victor Trevino--physician, public health advocate, and the 85th Mayor of the City.
A native son of Laredo and descendant of its founder, Captain Tomas Sanchez, Dr. Trevino is a proud graduate of Nixon High School and the Laredo public school system.
He pursued higher education at Laredo Junior College and Texas A&M-Kingsville before earning his medical degree in Coahuila, Mexico.
After completing his residency in New Orleans, he returned home to serve the people.
For nearly four decades, Dr. Trevino has cared for the most vulnerable in our community.
As Medical Director of the Laredo Health Department, he expanded access to maternity care, public health clinics, and preventive services.
He also held leadership roles at multiple hospitals, nursing facilities, and continues to serve as a trusted physician in the community.
His leadership during the COVID-l9 pandemic was especially critical.
As Health Authority, Dr. Trevino launched a binational vaccination program with Nuevo Laredo and Colombia, Nuevo Leon--administering nearly 300,000 vaccines and significantly reducing hospitalizations and deaths on both sides of the border.
Elected Mayor in 2022, Dr. Trevino continues to serve with compassion and a deep belief in the betterment of our city.
