Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courageous actions of volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson of Buffalo, Indiana, whose selfless service exemplifies the highest ideals of public safety and community commitment.
On April 11, 2025, a vehicle fire near a residence in Winamac, Indiana, escalated into a house fire.
Deputy Christopher Parish of the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office arrived on the scene and discovered that the fire had spread to the house, which was rapidly becoming engulfed in flames.
Although initial reports indicated that all occupants had evacuated, Deputy Parish heard a voice from inside the burning home.
Without hesitation, he broke a window using his flashlight, but dense smoke prevented the trapped individual from escaping.
At this critical moment, volunteer firefighter Mike Anderson arrived on the scene.
Together, Deputy Parish and Firefighter Anderson entered the smokefilled room through the broken window and successfully rescued the individual, pulling him to safety just before the fire overtook the room.
Firefighter Anderson's actions exemplify the highest standards of public service and courage.
His quick thinking and fearless response undoubtedly saved a life that day.
His heroism serves as an inspiration to us all and underscores the vital role of first responders in our communities.
I thank Mike for his valor and dedication to public safety.
