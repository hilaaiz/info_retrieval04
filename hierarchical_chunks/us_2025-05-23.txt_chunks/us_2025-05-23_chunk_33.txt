Ms. DeLAURO.
Mr. Speaker, I was participating in a Congressional Delegation to the Holy See to attend the inaugural mass of Pope Leo XIV and our military plane experienced mechanical problems.
I was delayed in returning to the District.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 132, and YEA on Roll Call No. 133.
