Mr. Speaker, on this 55th anniversary, we do more than remember--we reaffirm our responsibility to tell their story with truth and dignity.
Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green were sons of Mississippi whose lives mattered.
Their futures were stolen, but their memory fuels our pursuit of justice and accountability.
Let us ensure that future generations know their names--not just as victims, but as young men who deserved to grow old, to dream fully, and to live freely.
In honoring them today, we commit ourselves to building a nation where no young person's life is met with such disregard--and where history is neither buried nor forgotten.
May we speak their names, tell their story, and carry their legacy forward.
