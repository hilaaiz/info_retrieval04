Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Takemasa lshikura is the president of the Japan Association of Orlando (JAO) and has played a vital role in preserving and promoting Japanese heritage in Central Florida for over two decades.
He first came to the United States in 1983 as a performer at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center.
What began as a three-month engagement led to the founding of Matsuriza, a professional taiko group that continues to perform weekly at the Japan Pavilion in Epcot, delighting millions of guests from around the world.
Matsuriza has also traveled extensively across the United States to entertain audiences at cultural events and festivals.
In addition to his performance work, Takemasa has dedicated himself to community cultural exchange through the Orlando Taiko Dojo, a nonprofit organization he founded to teach traditional Japanese drumming.
His students, ranging in age from 10 to over 80, regularly perform at marathons, festivals, and local events throughout the region.
Beyond drumming, Takemasa has contributed to cultural education as principal of a local Japanese language school and through his leadership of JAO.
Since 2000, he has helped grow the Orlando Japan Festival from a small gathering at a restaurant into a major annual celebration in Kissimmee, now drawing over 10,000 attendees.
Festival proceeds support Japanese language education and have contributed over $20,000 to disaster relief efforts nationwide, including California and Hawaii, as well as in Asian countries, including Japan and the Philippines.
