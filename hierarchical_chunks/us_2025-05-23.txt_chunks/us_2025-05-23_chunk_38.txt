Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of two young Black men--Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green--whose lives were violently taken 55 years ago on May 15, 1970, on the campus of Jackson State College in Jackson, Mississippi.
Phillip Gibbs was a 21-year-old junior at Jackson State College.
He was majoring in political science and planned to attend law school.
He was a husband and a father to a young son, Phillip Jr. At the time of his death, his wife Dale was home with their child and pregnant with their second son, Demetrius who would never get the chance to meet his father.
In the late-night hours, nearly 500 rounds of ammunition were fired at students gathered near Alexander Hall.
Phillip Gibbs was killed outside the dormitory, while James Green was struck and killed across the street near B.F. Roberts Hall.
Twelve others were wounded.
The walls and windows of Alexander Hall still bear the scars of that night.
Despite multiple investigations, no one was ever held accountable for the shootings.
Local and federal probes concluded that the use of force was excessive and unjustified.
Yet, legal doctrines shielded those responsible, and justice we never served.
To this day, the names Gibbs and Green are spoken with reverence in Jackson and beyond.
Their memory lives on in the Gibbs-Green Plaza, which stands where blood was once spilled--now transformed into a space of reflection, remembrance, and resolve.
In 2021, Jackson State University conferred honorary degrees posthumously on both young men-- an acknowledgment of the futures they were denied.
