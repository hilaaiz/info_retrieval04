Mrs. CAMMACK.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's Third Congressional District, we wish 
Ms. Elsa Lewis a very happy 100th birthday.
Elizabeth Marie Kretzschmar better known as ``Elsa,'' is the youngest of three children born to German immigrant, Fritz Kretzschmar and Austrian immigrant, Josie Wittescheck Kretzschmar on June 6, 1925 in San Gabriel, California.
During World War II, she met and married a Navy sailor by the name of Wesley Inman Lewis and moved to Gainesville, Florida while he attended the University.
Upon graduation, they moved to Thomasville, GA and resided on Miilpond Plantation where Inman was the forestry supervisor for the many acres of the plantation.
During their residency in Thomasville, Elsa was a homemaker and gave birth to three children, a girl and two boys.
In the 1960s the family moved back to Inman's hometown, Alachua, Florida, to open a fertilizer plant and farm one of the largest tobacco farms in the area.
Elsa had been a bookkeeper before her children arrived and became the bookkeeper for the fertilizer plant they owned and operated in Alachua.
She has spent her remaining years here in Alachua after retiring from bookkeeping when the fertilizer plant was sold.
All three of her children and their families live close by as well as seven grandchildren and great grandchildren.
She is fondly known to her great grandchildren and great, great grandchildren as ``GiGi.''
Even though she is approaching 100 years loved, she is still dependent and lives on her own with children and grandchildren keeping her busy.
Congratulations to 
Ms. Elsa on 100 amazing years.
