I thank my hon.
Friend for giving way.
My other hon.
Friend,  the Member for Hyndburn (Sara Britcliffe) , is right to point out the need for us to explain the benefit of the CPA, because much of our day-to-day work as Members is connected to the grassroots of what we do in our constituencies, but the role of a parliamentarian is so much greater than that.
I will give an example.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken)  was talking about her meetings with the Malaysian Parliament earlier this week.
I had the great pleasure of meeting the hon.
Rodiyah binti Sapiee, who is a Member of the Malaysian Parliament and is a new regional representative for the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians network.
We  have not touched upon that organisation much in this debate so far, but it is there to support elected Members, very much in the way that my hon.
Friend the Member for Hyndburn spoke about—supporting new Members to do their jobs as well as they can, and hopefully retaining them work in Parliament for longer.
The Malaysian Parliament has 28 female Members, just 13.5% of their parliamentarians, and we discussed ways to increase the number of women parliamentarians.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that we can learn from each other about these questions in our Parliaments throughout the Commonwealth because we have such similar set-ups?
