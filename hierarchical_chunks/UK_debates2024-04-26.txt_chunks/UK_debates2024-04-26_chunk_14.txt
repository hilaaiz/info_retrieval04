Order.
I am being very generous in allowing the scope to be broadened somewhat.
I now look forward to hearing more from Nickie Aiken.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
I agree with my right hon.
Friend about women supporting women.
We do a great job of supporting women in this Parliament and I am delighted to be part of her cross-party women in parliament group.
We have to have strength in numbers and we have to encourage more women to stand, whether in CPA countries or our own, because we have to hear women’s voices in politics.
Does my hon.
Friend agree this is not just about encouraging women but—I consider myself to be a relatively young person—it is also about including more young people into parliamentary democracies across the Commonwealth?
