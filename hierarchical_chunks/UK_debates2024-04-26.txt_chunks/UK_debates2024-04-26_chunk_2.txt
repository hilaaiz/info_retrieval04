I thank the formidable team at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and my noble Friend Lord Ahmad, the Minister responsible for the  Commonwealth, and the Deputy Foreign Secretary, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) , who is not on the Front Bench today—he is detained elsewhere—but has been ably replaced by the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Charnwood (Edward Argar) .
Throughout, those Ministers have understood why the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association status needs to change, why this is an important Bill and why the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is essential in supporting the strengthening of democracy around the world.
I thank them all and their teams of officials.
