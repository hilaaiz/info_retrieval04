The Bill is quite technical in nature.
It makes provision for two specific organisations to be granted international status, which, owing to their unique constitutions, could not be included under existing legislation.
However, the wording of the legislation should not distract us from  the organisations cited in it.
Moreover, we should not overlook the primary purposes of these organisations, which are to strengthen parliamentary democracy and provide humanitarian assistance.
In a world where we frequently witness the devastation caused by violence and war, and the growing threats to democracy, the importance of those causes and the organisations that pursue them cannot be understated.
I therefore welcome the Bill, which grants international organisation status to both the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The new status will ensure that those organisations can continue to perform their vital work fully and without restriction.
The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association seeks to promote the values of parliamentary democracy and good governance.
It facilitates dialogues between Parliaments and draws on our collective knowledge to improve our procedures and address the wide-ranging challenges that we, as parliamentarians, may face.
Its efforts have included the development of recommended benchmarks for legislatures and for a code of conduct for Members.

It has also provided guidance on specific and pertinent issues such as improving mental health provisions, the challenges of climate change and the growth of AI.
