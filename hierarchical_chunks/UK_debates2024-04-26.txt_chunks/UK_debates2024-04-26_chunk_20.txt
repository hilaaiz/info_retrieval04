I thank everybody in the House of Commons for their great support in recognising the ICRC and the CPA as international organisations.
This Bill will help both organisations to do their jobs even better.
I thank the Minister and his colleagues at the FCDO for their unstinting support, which I hope continues as the Bill passes to the other place.
