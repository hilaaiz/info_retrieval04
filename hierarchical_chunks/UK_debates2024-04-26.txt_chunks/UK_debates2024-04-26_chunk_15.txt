Friend for his point, and I believe the CPA can be a force for good in sharing good practice for encouraging people from all walks of life to enter politics.
I am about to go on to talk about my experience with the CPA in Grenada, where there were many young people who had been elected for the first time.
It strengthens all democracies if they represent the people they are there to serve.
