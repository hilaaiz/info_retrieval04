Across the country, community pharmacies struggle not only with supply chain problems but with dispensing some of the critical medicines for our constituents at a loss.
I was concerned to read that higher prices for United States pharmaceuticals are on the table for the next stage of trade negotiations with Donald Trump, because an additional £1.5 billion would cost both the NHS and our community pharmacies dear.
What steps is the Department taking to ensure that the NHS, and the vital medicine supply on which we rely, will not be used as a bargaining chip in a trade deal with a highly unreliable US President?
The hon.
Lady has asked an important question about the pharmaceutical industry, which is key to the country’s growth mission and to supporting all our constituents and the entire country.
As we know, my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister is currently attending the G7 summit.
We have good relationships with America, and the Department is working closely across Government to ensure that the same stability of supply remains for our constituents.
Whether he has made an assessment of the potential merits of expanding the additional roles reimbursement scheme to include GPs.
What steps he is taking to improve access to GPs.
The Government inherited a ludicrous situation whereby patients could not get a GP appointment and GPs could not get a job, so one of my first acts was to cut red tape to give practices flexibility to hire GPs, along with an extra £82 million investment.
Thanks to that combination of investment and reform, this Government have recruited an additional 1,700 GPs to the frontline since July, exceeding our target of 1,000.
We have invested an extra £889 million in general practice  this year, taking action to bring back the family doctor.
We do not pretend to have solved all the problems, but change has begun and the best is still to come.
