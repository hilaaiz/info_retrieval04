The Minister has spoken many times about the importance of shifting from hospital to the community.
I have visited many local pharmacies and met the chair of Community Pharmacy Nottinghamshire, seeing at first hand the important work they do to support communities in Mansfield.
Does the Minister agree that community pharmacies have a key role to play in that shift and could help to take pressure off GP surgeries?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right, and I commend him for the work he is doing in his constituency, including with pharmacies.
In many ways, what we want to see is a culture change, because the interface between general practice and community pharmacy is not where it should be.
We believe that pharmacists have a huge amount more to offer, but that requires a better digital interface and better information sharing—a single patient record.
That sort of vehicle will be really important for delivering some of those reforms.
