I thank the Secretary of State for his earlier reply.
In Scotland, there are more quangos than MSPs.
After four years and £30 million of taxpayers’ cash down the drain, the SNP has scrapped its plans for  a national care service—its flagship policy—which was seen as a significant setback for Scottish social care reform, and now we have people going to the pub in chauffeur-driven ministerial cars.
Will the Secretary of State advise his Scottish counterpart on how to stop wasting Scottish taxpayers’ money?
