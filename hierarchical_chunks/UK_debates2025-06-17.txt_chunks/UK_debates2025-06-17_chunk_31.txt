My constituency, in Scotland, has a significant shortage of health and social care workers, despite extensive efforts to advertise recruitment to get people in, as replicated in parts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
The rug has been pulled out from under that by the changes to immigration policy and visas for that sector.
Will the Secretary of State commit to pushing this harder in Cabinet to ensure that we can have more geographic and sectoral visas?
I am really proud of the contribution that overseas workers make to health and social care services across our country.
If they all left tomorrow, the services would simply collapse.
But I think there is an overreliance on overseas staff in health and care services, and that is contributing to levels of net migration that are simply unsustainable.
I have a responsibility to help the Home Secretary bring those numbers down and to give opportunities, through better pay and career progression, to home-grown talent, and that is what we will do.
I have received many emails regarding poor service from pharmacies in my constituency.
In Maryport, residents report opening times not as advertised, long queues, low stocks and delays receiving vital medication.
Will the Minister tell the House how this Government will ensure that the public get the best quality service from our local pharmacies?
I am sorry to hear about the issues that my hon.
Friend’s constituents are experiencing.
I understand that he has raised the issue with the North East and North Cumbria ICB, which is investigating his concerns.
I would be happy to be kept informed, and if he is not happy with the outcome of that investigation, he should certainly come back to me.
This Government are committed to supporting community pharmacies after a decade of underfunding and neglect.
We recently agreed a record uplift to £3.1 billion for 2025-26.
