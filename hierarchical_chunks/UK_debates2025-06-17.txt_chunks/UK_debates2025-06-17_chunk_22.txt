I thank my hon.
Friend for that important question.
The role that midwives play, alongside other community health services such as district nurses, has been chronically underfunded and neglected over the past 14 years.
She will be pleased to know that the role of community healthcare is front and centre in our 10-year plan, and I think she will be interested in and pleased with what she sees when that plan is published.
