The Darzi report pointed out that 13% of hospital beds are occupied by people who are fit for discharge but who cannot get out because social care is broken.
Lord Darzi said that we cannot fix the NHS until we fix social care.
It is nearly six months since the Secretary of State promised cross-party talks and a commission, but the talks were cancelled and never rescheduled and the commission is delayed.
Please, when will the Government stop going slow on social care?
Please, when can we all get around the table to talk about fixing social care so that everyone gets the care they deserve?
I have to correct the hon.
Lady: the commission is up and running, Baroness Casey has started meetings and she had a roundtable just a few weeks ago with people who have lived experience.
The hon.
Lady is therefore not correct on that point and I am sure that she will want to correct the record.
On the point about delayed discharge, the hon.
Lady is absolutely right.
We are reforming the better care fund to get much better interface between hospitals, care and local authorities.
That system and those relationships can and should work much better, but there are pressing, long-term challenges.
We are conscious of that and are working at pace with Baroness Casey to ensure that those reforms are delivered.
