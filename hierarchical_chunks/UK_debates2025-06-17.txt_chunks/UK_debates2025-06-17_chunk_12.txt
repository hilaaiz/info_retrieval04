I thank the hon.
Member for that.
There is no doubt that the NHS, universities and others need to do more to get students, trainees and qualified doctors and mental health specialists in places where  the NHS and patients need them.
We will publish a refreshed workforce plan later this year to ensure that the NHS has the right people in the right places to care for patients when they need it.
