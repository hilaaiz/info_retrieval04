I thank my hon.
Friend for the work that he and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Rachel Blake)  are leading in partnership with the trust and Westminster city council to ensure that the people of his constituency have the hospital they deserve.
As he knows, this will be the most complicated scheme in the new hospital programme, but that is no excuse for the years of delay that the scheme has faced.
The trust now boasts the biggest high-risk repair backlog in the country, so my hon.
Friend is right to ensure that this is not allowed to be put in the “too difficult” pile again.
We look forward to engaging constructively and doing everything that we can to expedite the progress that is desperately needed for his community and our city.
