Mr. Speaker, Pro Tempore Penny Gross's commitment to public service is through her work in Fairfax County.
Though she may be retiring, I suspect that she will continue to remain active in the causes that are important to her.
I commend her for her service and ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating her on her retirement.
