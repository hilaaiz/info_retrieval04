Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Amber Duncan as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Amber is a Community Readiness Specialist for the Military and Family Readiness Center at Travis Air Force Base.
Her duties focus on assessing personnel and family needs while providing work and life services related to the demands of the military mission.
In her role, Amber has initiated countless programs and events to assist servicemembers and their families.
She pioneered a database to track personnel preparing to leave the military workforce, allowing Travis Air Force Base to achieve 100 percent accountability in notifying personnel about the process and options for their transition out of the military.
Amber is also passionate about strengthening military families and connecting them with the local community.
She developed a needs assessment to identify limitations and their corrections, worked with the Base Chaplain Agency in hosting courses promoting the strengthening of family interactions, and has worked to foster resiliency for 46 newly appointed military members.
Amber's work has benefited military personnel and their families, and her dedication to aiding members of the Travis community does not go unnoticed.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional Distrist, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Amber Duncan for her positive contributions to our community.
