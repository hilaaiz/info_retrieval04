Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Alissa Stolz as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Alissa is the Head of School at East Bay Montessori where she has demonstrated outstanding school leadership throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.
The pandemic impacted schools in previously unimaginable ways, and school leaders were called upon to hold their communities together.
Alissa was instrumental in keeping East Bay Montessori intact throughout the pandemic, avoiding any COVID-19 outbreaks and never having to lay off any staff or faculty.
Alissa was committed to in-person learning, and East Bay Montessori quickly reopened with an outdoor classroom set-up that let students and teachers come together and learn in innovative ways.
This decision allowed children to continue to learn through peer collaboration and face-to-face interactions.
Alissa provided a strong vision for East Bay Montessori during times American Montessori Society's magazine, and she was selected to present at the International Montessori Congress in Bangkok.
The impact of Alissa's work goes beyond East Bay Montessori--she is the model of a capable leader who acts in the interest of her community, inspiring educators across the globe.
