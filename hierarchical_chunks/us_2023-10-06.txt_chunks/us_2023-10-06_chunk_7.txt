Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Adjoa McDonald as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Adjoa has dedicated her career to advocating for women and youth in the city.
Adjoa founded the Vallejo Project, an organization dedicated to developing the leadership skills of youth and young adults so they can improve the systems that impact them.
Adjoa's work has created a platform that empowers and uplifts women and youth in Vallejo, providing them with a network to connect, learn, and support each other.
Beyond advocating for women individually, Adjoa also fights to improve the status of women throughout society.
She fights to address issues that impact all women, such as gender inequality, domestic violence, and economic disempowerment.
Adjoa cares deeply about working collaboratively to make broad change.
She knows the importance of her work because she has faced the obstacles that many women in Vallejo, and the United States, experience today.
She is an example of the strength and resilience that women possess and use those qualities to make a difference for the women in her community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Adjoa McDonald for her positive contributions to our community.
