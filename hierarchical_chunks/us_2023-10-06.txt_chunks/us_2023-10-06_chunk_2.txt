Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the 2nd Annual Celebra Grapevine festival which will take place on October 7th in Grapevine, Texas and is dedicated to celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month.
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan established Hispanic Heritage Month to celebrate the histories, cultures, and contributions made by Americans of Hispanic descent.
Consistent with this fine tradition, Celebra Grapevine provides North Texans with an opportunity to embrace diversity and honor the Hispanic heritage that has influenced traditions, art, and cuisine throughout our community.
Celebra means to celebrate in Spanish, which is a fitting name for this festival.
Grapevine's Latino population, which makes up more than 30 percent of the city's population, plays an important role in growing the city's economy and making the city a great place to live, work, and raise a family.
I commend the City of Grapevine and Celebra Grapevine for their commitment to fostering unity and building bridges in our community.
I hope their festival is a great success.
