Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Betty Reid Soskin as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Betty is widely known for being the National Park Service's oldest park ranger who retired at the age of 100.
She has lived in the East Bay since 1927, when her family moved from New Orleans.
As a young woman during World War II, Betty worked as a shipyard clerk for an all-Black auxiliary lodge of the segregated Boilermaker's union.
In 1945 she and her husband founded one of the first Black-owned music stores, which remained open until 2019.
Over the years she has worked as staff to a Berkeley city council member, a state Assemblywoman, and a California State Senator.
In the early 2000s, Betty became involved in the plans to open the Rosie the Riveter
WWII Home Front National Historical Park.
This led to her career as a ranger which began in 2007, at the age of 85.
Betty led talks explaining the importance of the park in memorializing the contributions of women and African Americans working in war industries supporting the U.S. World War II efforts on the home front.
She has used her own experiences and observations as a Black woman to bring light to untold stories of African Americans during WWII and underscore the racism and misogyny experienced by her and countless other women of color throughout her lifetime.
Through hard work and storytelling, she has touched the lives of the thousands of park visitors and millions of Americans who can not only empathize with her story but celebrate and learn from it.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Betty Reid Soskin for her positive contributions to our community.
