Gentleman’s encouragement.
That is why we are investing in home-grown secure energy, including renewables, nuclear and other forms of energy.
In yesterday’s UK-EU trade deal—which I am sure the shadow Minister would like to welcome—we have enhanced our arrangements with the European Union on electricity trading, enabling us to export energy we produce in the UK to the European Union and vice versa.
That will ensure energy security, as well as good jobs and good businesses in the energy sector, for decades to come.
