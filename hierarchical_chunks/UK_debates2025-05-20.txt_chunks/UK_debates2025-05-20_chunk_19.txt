Within the spending review, the key is to improve public sector productivity.

What directives has His Majesty’s Treasury given to Departments to improve productivity through the adoption of artificial intelligence?
Specifically, does that advice include a requirement for the use of agentic AI during the multi-year spending period?
I thought the hon.
Gentleman was going to welcome the investment of Universal Studios in Bedfordshire, which will be a massive boon to the county’s economy.
On supporting the adoption of AI, we are doing two key things.
First, we are supporting that sector investing in the UK, and the deal we secured with the US will help bring more investment into our digital sector.
Secondly, and crucially, we are improving the productivity of our public services.
The hon.

What steps she is taking through the tax system to support vulnerable families.

The personal allowance means those earning below £12,570 pay no tax.
At our first Budget, we decided not to extend the freeze on personal tax thresholds, which was implemented by the previous Government.
