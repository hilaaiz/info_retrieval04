Only last week the right hon.
Lady was trumpeting that the economy had turned a corner, but, as she has just said, it is barely a month since her disastrous jobs tax started to bite.
May I ask her precisely which business confidence survey—just one—she can point to which supports her assertion that everything is coming up roses?
According to PwC’s global CEO survey—that is just one of the surveys—Britain is the second-best place in the world in which to invest, and that is what this Government are doing.
The shadow Chancellor simply is not serious, and his party is becoming completely irrelevant.
He talks about jobs; 200,000 jobs have been created since the general election.
He talks about economic growth; the UK is now the fastest-growing economy in the G7.
He talks about business; we have secured three trade agreements which are backed by British businesses and British trade unions, and the Conservative party opposes every single one of them.
No wonder even George Osborne has said that the shadow Chancellor has “no credible economic plan”.
While the Conservative party plummets into irrelevance, this Labour Government will deliver in the national interest.
