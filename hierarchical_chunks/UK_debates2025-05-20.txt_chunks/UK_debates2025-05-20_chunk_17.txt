I welcome the Chancellor’s answers on growth.
She has been a strong champion of the Oxford-Cambridge growth corridor, but my constituents are concerned to know that she will lend her support to Lord Vallance’s efforts to join up across Departments and ensure that there is the social infrastructure to support the growth.
My constituents worry that hospitals, schools and roads will not keep up with the ambitious pace that Lord Vallance is proposing.
