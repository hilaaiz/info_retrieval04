I thank the Chancellor for that answer—the Government’s commitment to the north is absolutely clear.
We very much enjoyed our visit to Darwen market.
At the same time, however, history tells us that small towns, like those that make up Rossendale and Darwen, can far too easily get left behind and not feel the benefits of major infrastructure investment, despite being the very communities that need to see and feel change  the most.
Does the Chancellor agree that as we implement our investment and growth strategy, and deliver the review of the Green Book, we must put our left-behind communities first?
As part of every major investment decision, we should ask the question: what does this do for our most deprived and left-behind neighbourhoods?
It is only by targeting investment where it is needed most that we can ensure that every community feels the benefit of the growth that this Government will bring.
