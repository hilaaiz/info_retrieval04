Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me.
I congratulate the hon.
Members for Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey (Graham Leadbitter), for Bolton North East (Kirith Entwistle), for Wolverhampton West (Warinder Juss) and for Southport (Patrick Hurley) on making excellent maiden speeches today.
I am so honoured to be here in this historic Chamber today as part of a brand-new group of Green colleagues, who I must now call my honourable Friends.
We are very pleased today to hear a wide range of new Bills being proposed.
We welcome some measures.
Some we will seek to improve and some we will seek to change or add to.
Listening to people in my constituency during the election, it was hard not to be affected by the strength of public feeling and distress about the climate emergency and the degradation of our natural environment, and by the huge desire to defend social justice and public services.
This Parliament must seek to deliver for them.
This is my maiden speech; I stand here thanks to the votes and values of the fantastic people of Brighton Pavilion.
They have put their trust in me and the Green party, and for that I extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation.
Brighton has always been a truly special place, from its origins as a fishing village and Roman villa complex, to its Regency and railway booms, with its huge sense of spirit and a warm welcome to every visitor to our famous beach.
But Brighton has always been so much more than a seaside resort.
The richness and variety of our culture and entertainment is legendary.
From Victorian innovation, through the 1960s of my parents and my own decade of youth in the far away 1990s, to the present day, our music, theatre, comedy and literary traditions have always blended with cutting-edge, creative and exciting counter- culture movements to reflect and enrich the modern world.
Our cultural richness has survived, strived, struggled and then thrived through many turbulent times, not least the recent pandemic, and I am confident it will continue to do so for many centuries to come.
I am proud that the latest census confirms that nowadays my city is home to one of the UK’s largest populations of LGBT+ people, and that we host the biggest and best Pride celebrations, including Europe’s largest Trans Pride, which will be this weekend.
Brighton and Hove is a welcoming city in so many ways, and I am very proud we are a city of sanctuary, committed to a culture of hospitality and welcome for those seeking refuge from war and persecution.
Brighton Pavilion has a history of dedicated, long-serving MPs.
From its first election as a single-member constituency in 1950, it was represented until 1969 by Sir William Burke Teeling, an Irish writer and self-described “amateur tramp”, who walked from London to Newcastle to explore how councils were tackling unemployment.
Our MP was then Julian Amery for 23 years and Derek Spencer for five years, before David Lepper served in this House as a highly-respected and hardworking MP for 13 years.
And, of course, I have one of the easiest and most pleasurable jobs among new MPs in paying tribute to my immediate predecessor.
Brighton is also a special place because it has been at the heart of the green movement in England and Wales, and that continued when our own, beloved Caroline Lucas won the seat for the Green party in 2010.
Caroline held the seat through three further elections, leaving a 14-year legacy that I look up to as a shining mountain to climb, as I take my very first steps here today.
As well as being an excellent constituency MP, of the many ways in which Caroline influenced policy, I was most  charmed by her success in working with the nature writer Mary Colwell to win a new GCSE in natural history.
Helping to inspire and train up a generation of new David Attenboroughs is a real national service.
Most impressive has been Caroline’s steadfast and long-standing opposition to threats to the public’s right to protest.
Caroline lived that principle and through it played a key role in ending fracking in the UK.
I know that all of us sitting here today are humbly aiming to live up to the high standards, values and work ethic that she represented, and to serve here with the same energy and enthusiasm.
It is those principles that will guide my work as an MP, as well as some of my own values and enthusiasms.
People who know my work in other places will be aware that listening to and supporting young people is something I feel very strongly about.
With huge pleasure, I commend to the House the incredible work of Brighton and Hove Citizens, which has just won a huge campaigning victory with a beautiful example of raising up and empowering young people and their voices to make change happen.
With schools across Brighton and Hove working with colleges, religious groups, workers, universities and the charity sector, Brighton and Hove Citizens has this year won a big new commitment from the council.
After a long and engaging campaign, sixth formers Fi Abou-Chanad and Tally Wilcox presented a 2,000 signature-strong petition and won a pledge for hundreds of young people in Brighton schools to benefit from investment in mental health support and counselling.
That is just one group of young people among many inspiring organisations across our country that I cannot wait to hear more about in this job.
They include Green New Deal Rising, the UK Youth Climate Coalition, YoungMinds, People & Planet, the National Society of Apprentices, the National Union of Students and many more.
Young people should have a louder voice wherever decisions are being made, not just when they organise.
I am therefore disappointed to see no specific Bill in today’s list removing barriers to voting for young people, including voter ID and age limits for elections to this House and English local councils that do not apply in Wales and Scotland.
Our 16 and 17-year-olds, and our young people, need a real voice and need those measures in this Parliament.
I hope that, when we debate the Bills put forward in today’s King’s Speech, the voices of young people are sought out and listened to, and that many changes and additions are made where they are needed most, including removing the two-child benefit cap.
I am grateful for the patience of hon.
Members in listening to me.
I greatly look forward to seeing the impact of the young voices I plan to raise up in this Chamber being granted the same attention and respect.
Thank you for calling me to speak, Mr Deputy Speaker.
I am grateful for the opportunity to make my  maiden speech during this important debate.
Like others, I wish to congratulate all those who have spoken before me, particularly those who made their maiden speeches, not least  the hon.
Member for York Outer (Mr Charters)  whose contribution was very substantial.
I am originally from the village of Dunloy in the north-east of Ireland.
I represent the Aberdeenshire North and Moray East constituency in the north-east of Scotland.
I paid close attention when  the right hon.
Member for New Forest East (Sir Julian Lewis)  was advising new Members on our ambitions for the future, particularly because I want to share my ambition.
I am the first MP for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East and I hope to be the last MP for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East.
This is a coastal area that stretches from the River Spey in the west to Cruden Bay in the south.
It is an area noted not only for its industry, but for the industriousness of its people and its communities.
Its long-standing economic strengths are in farming, fishing and their associated sectors, including food and drink production, and, in more recent times, in the oil and gas industries and their supply chain.
The area makes a substantial and significant contribution to the nation’s energy security and food security.
We are now undergoing a new industrial revolution associated with the renewables sector.
As the world adapts to new challenges, I believe that it is our duty in this Parliament to capitalise on the opportunities that now present themselves in the north-east of Scotland.
It is also a most beautiful area—something of an undiscovered gem—with a developing tourism industry.
Members will remember that the next time they enjoy a single malt, an Aberdeen Angus steak, a prawn cocktail or perhaps a fish supper, because the chances are that they came from the industries based in my constituency.
There is also significant poverty—in particular child poverty—in this otherwise prosperous area.
Although this is mainly concentrated in larger towns, it is also a challenge in villages and rural areas where it is often less visible.
Recent figures suggest that around 5,500 children in this constituency are living in serious poverty—some of them in absolute poverty.
To be clear that means that they do not have enough money to meet basic needs for shelter, clothing and food.
That is something that we should all remember in our position of privilege, and it is something that we should all work together on to change.
I want to pay tribute to the outgoing MP, David Duguid, who represented the previous Banff and Buchan constituency, which disappeared in the recent boundary changes.
Some Members will know that David experienced sudden and significant ill-health before the general election was called.
I wish him a speedy and full recovery.
David was an excellent MP who did his best to represent everybody in the constituency, but most notably the interests of the energy, fishing and farming industries.
His efforts were in stark contrast to the way that he was treated in the end when he was effectively deselected by his colleagues.
I wish David and his family well in whatever their future plans may involve.
I also wish to acknowledge the work of the last SNP MP in this area, Eilidh Whiteford, who was an outstanding political representative.
Today in the King’s Speech, the Government had an opportunity to immediately abolish the harmful two-child cap on child benefit and the notorious rape clause, which my former colleague, the outgoing MP for Glasgow Central, Alison Thewliss, worked so hard to end.
The failure to do this is an early indictment of the Government’s policy position.
I was encouraged when I heard contributions from  the hon.
Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier)  and  the right hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) .
But what about the contribution from  the right hon.
Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)  when he said, “No ifs, no buts, just do it.”?
It is simply not good enough for the people of Scotland, an energy rich nation, to pay so much to heat their homes while so many of their bairns are living in absolute poverty.
I will be focusing on this issue over the course of this Parliament.
I will seek to defend the interests of our farming and fishing industries, to protect our public services and to help realise the potential of renewable energy and carbon capture to deliver jobs and economic growth.
But, above all, I shall be a voice for the weak and the disadvantaged.
After 14 years of austerity, we need a change of direction, not more of the same.
I wish to make special mention of the WASPI women who have been so unfairly treated by successive Governments, and who deserve compensation.
To conclude, I thank the people of my constituency for their support at the ballot box, my colleagues in the SNP and in other parties, and the various members of House staff on the Westminster estate, who have been so welcoming and helpful on my arrival and during my induction.
Finally—and Members would not expect me to say anything less—I will be working hard in this place and elsewhere to press the case for the people of Scotland to be afforded their democratic rights to determine their own future.
It is an honour to have been elected to represent Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey, which is something of an amalgam of a couple of previous constituencies.
First, I would like to thank the electorate of the constituency for sending me to this place to represent them and for putting their trust in me for the years to come.
On my arrival here, an amazing job has been done by the House staff, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and others, and I cannot thank them enough for the welcome that they have provided us as new MPs.
I have a number of predecessors that I need to thank, not least because it is nearly two constituencies rolled into one.
First of all there is Douglas Ross, who represented  Moray for the Conservatives for several recent years.
We were not very close on the political spectrum, it has to be said, but there were a number of occasions where we did come together across parties for the benefit of the constituency and the wider region, notably in the achievement of the growth deal for Moray and to maximise the spend that we got on that.
I am sure the official Opposition would also want to thank him for his service in the Scotland Office.
My predecessor in Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey was Drew Hendry, who was a regular contributor from the Scottish National party Benches.
He represented us as an Opposition spokesperson on the economy, trade, foreign affairs, business, enterprise and investment, and transport over several terms as an MP for that area.
He was also an assiduous campaigner on energy poverty, which is a particular issue for the highlands and islands and in Moray.
I hope that energy regulation is one of the areas that the Government’s commission on poverty will look at very seriously.
My right hon.
Friend  the Member for Aberdeen South (Stephen Flynn) , the leader of the SNP in this place, mentioned the two-child cap.
I will not go into too much detail on that because it has already been well covered, but energy poverty is a critical issue for many families throughout the highlands and Moray.
Bringing in a social tariff, for example, would certainly make a big difference to families right across the highlands.
Other predecessors have included several well-known parliamentarians.
Labour Members will, I am sure, be pleased to know that my constituency is the birthplace of Ramsay MacDonald, and it has also been represented very ably by several notable SNP MPs over the years.
One of the most famous was Winnie Ewing, who reconvened the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and also represented the area in the Scottish Parliament, in this place and in Europe.
Her daughter-in-law, Margaret Ewing, was an assiduous campaigner on poverty issues and will be well known to older members of the House—or longer-serving Members of the House is perhaps more parliamentary.
More recently there was Angus Robertson, who led the party in this place for a good number of years and is now a Cabinet Secretary in the Scottish Government.
We can take a quick stroll through Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey.
It goes from the white sands of Lossiemouth, Burghead and Nairn right up to the Cairngorms peaks.
It has the city of Elgin in it, which has now been established as a cathedral city for 800 years; it is celebrating the 800th anniversary of the cathedral being established there.
The constituency has the Speyside towns of Rothes, Aberlour and Dufftown.
Dufftown, of course, is built on seven stills rather than seven hills.
In the Badenoch and Strathspey towns we get Grantown, Aviemore, Newtonmore and Kingussie among others.
We have surfing, skiing and mountain biking.
There is a mountain railway, and we have a national park and a major wildlife park with everything from pine martens to polar bears.
Moving back up to the coast, in Ardersier we have the green freeport.
The Scottish Government have worked closely with the UK Government on that, and I am sure they will continue to do so.
The green freeport is incredibly important to us in Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey.
It is projected to have 3,500 jobs within 10 years, and it will be vital for just transition.
That will need careful scrutiny over the coming years.
Tourism, the labour market and affordable housing are major issues, particularly in the Badenoch and Strathspey area.
Businesses have difficulty with staffing.
They are often open only four or five days instead of seven.
There is not really any significant unemployment—it is about 2% to 3%.
There may be some room for getting more employment from the local labour market, but fundamentally the biggest impact on the labour market there has been Brexit.
Immigration in that part of the world is a really significant issue, in that there is not enough of it.
We have difficulty staffing care homes, the NHS and many businesses, which are fighting over the same labour population.
We have iconic food, drink and fashion brands, including Walker’s Shortbread and Baxters, not to mention the 49 distilleries that produce malt whisky and the numerous other distilleries that produce gin and vodka.
There are also a number of breweries.
We contribute extremely significantly to the Exchequer, and it is really important that we get some of that back.
We also have three military bases.
Fort George currently hosts the Black Watch—the 3rd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland.
Kinloss barracks is home to 39 Engineer Regiment, and RAF Lossiemouth is home to Typhoon, Poseidon and arriving Wedgetail squadrons.
The welfare of service personnel and veterans is absolutely vital, and it is something I will raise frequently in the House.
Civilian aerospace and space are the other major emerging sectors.
Orbex in Forres employs well over 100 people, and it will be doing vertical launches from Sutherland and the SaxaVord spaceport.
The right hon.
Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)  will have to forgive me, but its headquarters are, in fact, in Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey.
Finally there is agriculture.
Crofters and hill farmers based in Badenoch and Strathspey in the Cairngorms national park face particular challenges.
We also have arable and the pork sector in the laich of Moray, where there are again employment challenges that need to be tackled.
Moray West, Nairn and Strathspey is the fifth largest constituency, and it takes more than two hours to drive end to end, but what a drive it is—I would recommend it to anybody.
I look forward to representing the people living and working the length and breadth of my constituency.
I agree wholeheartedly.
The work that the right hon.
Member and I carried out throughout the last Parliament is an example of how we can work co-operatively with Members of opposite parties and find those issues on which we can serve our constituents well.
He joins us at an opportune moment, as I am about to talk about an issue that is close to his heart.
My final urgent request of the Government is one of moral duty: to recognise, support and compensate our nuclear testing veterans and their families.
These are the men who put their lives at risk in dangerous atomic weapons tests to ensure our long-term security.
For decades, campaigners, Labrats, veterans and their families, and the indefatigable Susie Boniface have been fighting for recognition for these heroes.
They have highlighted scientific studies that show increased rates of miscarriage, increased birth defects, and the same rate of genetic damage as clean-up workers at Chernobyl.
Of course, the campaigners take pride in the fact that the Defence Secretary and the Prime Minister met them when Labour was in opposition, and supported their  campaign to receive the long overdue recognition they deserve.
But despite winning the campaign for medallic recognition, the UK sadly still remains the only nuclear power that refuses them adequate compensation, research and support, unlike the US, France, Canada and Australia.
Medal criteria are very limited, there has not been a formal recognition event and even access to war pensions has been impeded.
Veterans, and sometimes their wives, widows and descendants, have reported making repeated requests to gain access to their blood or urine testing records from samples the veterans recall being taken during the nuclear testing programmes.
Sadly, many confirm that their service medical records frequently do not include the test results, and they just do not understand why.
The data is vital for their war pension applications and for understanding the conditions they suffer, but sadly the absence of such records means that many veterans’ war pension applications are refused.
I want to place on record my thanks to hon.
Members right across the House who have continued to support these veterans, particularly  the right hon.
Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes) , who has worked closely with me and campaigners in recent years.
This week, we have both written to the Defence Secretary and the Minister for Veterans and People, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Birmingham Selly Oak (Al Carns) , requesting that they urgently meet us, veterans and campaigners, and work with us to deal with their concerns.
We hope that is made an urgent priority, because ultimately the Government can and should deliver justice for these families, and now is the right time to do so.
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to make my first speech as part of this important debate.
First, may I thank  the right hon.
Member for Herne Bay and Sandwich (Sir Roger Gale)  for his contribution?
May I also pay tribute to all those who are making their first speeches today?
I wish them well today and for the remainder of this Parliament, and I hope that we each manage to repay the trust that our new constituents have placed in us.
I am led to believe that certain conventions apply to Members’ first speeches.
I wish to assure the House that I will abide by those conventions.
Accordingly, I wish to pay sincere tribute to my predecessor, Damien Moore, who diligently served Southport for the past seven years, paving the way for a new Government to ensure that the town’s best days lie ahead.
I wish him nothing but the best for the future.
I also wish to refer to another of my predecessors as the MP for Southport, somebody already mentioned in today’s debate.
At the 1865 general election, William Gladstone was elected as one of the three Members for the South Lancashire county constituency, which took in both Southport and my original hometown of Prescot.
As I am sure Members will appreciate, this fact helped me somewhat over the past 12 months or so in drawing a link between where I was born and where I now represent in this House.
I expect that I am not alone among new Members in having been rather overwhelmed over the past couple of weeks by the mountain of email correspondence that we have received from constituents and others since being elected.
I can, though, take some comfort in the fact that my inbox refers solely to the much smaller constituency of Southport, rather than to the whole of the South Lancashire constituency that William Gladstone represented.
I can only imagine the additional stresses and strains on Members in Gladstone’s day if they, too, had had access to a Parliamentary email address.
As well as being part of the same old county constituency, both Prescot and Southport were also within the boundaries of the old hundred of West Derby.
This fact was brought further to my attention when the Boundary Commission announced during the last Parliament that the new Southport constituency would, from now onwards, also contain Tarleton and Hesketh Bank, two beautiful villages on the south coast of the Ribble.
As a result of this change, I researched at my local library whereabouts the boundary of the West Derby hundred was, hoping that I would be able to say that Tarleton and Hesketh Bank had, many years ago, also been under the same county division as Southport.
Alas, this was not to be.
After quite some hours of research, I realised that the information I was looking for had actually been staring me in the face all along.
It appears that the boundary between the hundreds of West Derby and Leyland lay along—would you believe?—Boundary Lane, and that Boundary Lane is situated in a hamlet called Hundred End.
It is a lesson, I think, in not ignoring the obvious when it is right there in front of you.
My predecessors in previous Parliaments have talked about how they have felt that Southport has sometimes been taken for granted or taken advantage of, and so have subsequently sought to discuss and elevate divisions between the towns of the local borough.
I wish to assure my constituents that I will take a different approach.
Instead, I will work to ensure that our country’s new Government will not look to cause divisions with our  neighbours, whether they be other countries thousands of miles away or even other towns just a few thousand yards away.
Instead, I will work with colleagues to ensure that the Government will look to unite our country in the task of national renewal, because the politics that I believe in is a politics of the common good—a politics where each of us looks out for the wellbeing of the other, rather than tries to do others down.
Many towns and villages in this country have seen better days than over the past few years.
Southport is no different.
Whereas other areas have had, for instance, much-needed housing not built, or much-needed transport links not implemented—two issues that I am pleased to see the new Government are planning to address—Southport’s problems have manifested themselves in the temporary closure of the town’s much-loved pier, and in the town centre, whose main streets need more than their fair share of love and attention.
I promise to work with colleagues in this House and beyond to fix these issues.
The new Government’s priority on economic growth is entirely the right approach.
Unless we get the trend rate of growth back to pre-2008 levels, our task in this Parliament of reducing poverty will be much harder.
The Government have my full support in their approach.
I wish it to be known that I will do my utmost to make sure that Southport’s best days lie ahead of it, that the decline of recent years will be arrested and that the town’s fortunes will be turned around, and that I will work with good people of good faith to bring that about, no matter what their party affiliation.
With that, I would like to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me the opportunity to make my first speech in this place.
I thank the House for the manner in which the speech was received.
Message to attend His Majesty delivered by the Lady Usher of the Black Rod.
The Speaker, with the House, went up to attend His Majesty; on their return, the Speaker suspended the sitting.
Will Members wishing to take their seats please come to the Table?
The following Members took and subscribed the Oath, or made and subscribed the Affirmation required by law: Jonathan Neil Reynolds , for Stalybridge and Hyde
Right honourable Sir Charles Geoffrey Cox, Torridge and Tavistock
Right honourable
Andrew William Murrison, South West Wiltshire
The House has directed the Speaker to make a statement at the beginning of each Session about the duties and responsibilities of hon.
Members.
I begin by reminding Members of their duty to observe the code of conduct and the behaviour code agreed by the House and to behave with civility and fairness in all their dealings.
Unacceptable behaviour will be dealt with seriously, independently and with effective sanctions.
The House asserts its privilege of freedom of speech.
That privilege is enjoyed by Members of Parliament only in their work in this House as private individuals.
We are equal under the law with those whom we represent.
The privilege is there to ensure that our constituents can be represented by us without fear or favour.
It is an obligation upon all of us to exercise the privilege responsibly.
It is incumbent on Members to be accurate in what they say in this House and to correct any mistakes as soon as possible.
All Members can now submit written correspondence directly to Hansard to amend errors of fact in their contributions, as well as being able to correct the record by a point of order.
The Speaker does not have the power to police the accuracy of Members’ contributions—if only I could—and I reflect that to the media, as well.
On courtesy and temperate language, I draw the House’s attention to the guidance on rules of behaviour and courtesies in this House of Commons.
Members must be mindful of the impact of what we say not only  on other Members, but on others who follow our proceedings.
Members should be heard courteously, whatever their views.
In particular, Members should address the Chair, rather than each other directly, and I say to hon.
Gentlemen, please wear a tie or you just might not catch my eye.
Members should remain in the Chamber for at least the next two speeches, or in Question Time, for two substantive questions after their own.
Show respect to other Members.
Of course, I understand that new Members may need a bit of time to familiarise themselves with the conventions and courtesies of the House, and I will take that into account when I am in the Chair, but I urge every Member to study the guidance carefully.
The use of mobile phones in this House is a privilege.
Please try to think about when you need them and when you use them.
Members should be able to ask a question without reading it.
Let us show the ability of this House.
Let us show what we can do by working together.
As I say, new Members will need a bit of time, and I will work with all new Members and take that into account when I am in the Chair, but I urge every Member to study the guidance.
Please read it.
If any advice is needed, come and check with me and the Clerks.
On the criticism of other Members, in this place we are honourable Members, and the language that we use about each other should reflect that.
If a Member falls short of the standards expected of us all, there are ways of dealing with that—not by accusations made as sideswipes during questions or debates.
If we fail to treat each other with respect in debates, that diminishes our work.
It also risks raising the temperature of discussions outside this place, particularly on social media, where discussions already too often descend into online abuse against hon.
Members.
My job is to look after all Members.
If we show respect to each other here, I believe that the public should also show respect to Members, so please let us get it right and let us work together.
I do not want people to agree with each other—this could be the most boring Chamber that I have ever seen, and that would not be good for me either—but please let us make tolerance and respect our main aim.
It is important that hon.
Members can raise matters with me freely.
For that reason, I keep such correspondence confidential.
That includes applications for urgent questions.
I remind hon.
Members that it is equally important that my response, particularly on matters of privilege, is treated with the same respect.
I also wish to give some advice about seeking to speak in the Chamber.
I take into account a number of factors when determining who to call.
One of those is how often a Member speaks.
In other words, if you have spoken much more than colleagues, others will be called before you; I ask Jim Shannon to remember that.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear!”
] I think that falls on deaf ears—[Laughter.]—but colleagues are more likely to be called in the next debate for which they apply if they missed out in the last one.
I know that it can be frustrating not to be called in a debate, or to be called very late.
Prioritising the debates, Question Times, urgent questions and statements in which you seek to participate is one way of trying to avoid that happening.
Staff in my office can always offer further advice.
It will be very frustrating for   Government Members, as there are so many of you, so remember that.
Do not take it out on my office; please blame me at any time.
Finally, I want all Members and everyone in the parliamentary community to be able to go about their work safely, both online and here in Westminster.
The security of this building and those who work here depends on us all.
We have a duty to be vigilant, and to assist those whose job it is to maintain this place as a safe place of work, but I also know that being a constituency MP is about meeting constituents and being able to represent them within our constituencies, and I take that seriously.
Two Members lost their lives not in this House but in their constituency, so whatever I can do to support you, I will.
Make sure that you follow all the security measures.
I never want to receive another phone call like those I have previously, so please look after yourselves and follow the advice.
Your families matter, your staff matter, and this House matters.
Security is at the top of my agenda.
Before moving to the first business of the new Session, I express my best wishes to all hon.
Members and all those who work in the House.
I thank all the staff who have made this transition happen; I really appreciate it.
Please, let us enjoy the next Session.
A Bill for the more effectual preventing Clandestine Outlawries was read the First time, and ordered to be read a Second time.
Before I call the Leader of the House, I can now formally announce the arrangements for the election of the Deputy Speakers.
The ballot will be held on  Tuesday 23 July  between 10 am and 1.30 pm in Committee Room 8.
Nominations must be submitted to the Table Office between 10 am and 5 pm on  Monday 22 July .
Nomination forms and an updated briefing note with information about the election are available in the Vote Office.
I call the Leader of the House to move the motion on temporary Deputy Speakers.
Ordered, That, for the period up to the first sitting day following the election of the Deputy Speakers under  Standing Order No. 2A , Sir Edward Leigh be Chairman of Ways and Means, Dame Siobhain McDonagh be First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Sir Christopher Chope be Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.—(Lucy Powell.)
I have to acquaint the House that this House has this day attended His Majesty in the House of Peers, and that His Majesty was pleased to make a Most Gracious Speech from the Throne to both Houses of Parliament, of which I have, for greater accuracy, obtained a copy.
I shall direct that the terms of the speech be printed in the Votes and Proceedings.
Copies are available in the Vote Office.
The Gracious Speech was as follows: My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, My Government will govern in service to the country.
My Government’s legislative programme will be mission led and based upon the principles of security, fairness and opportunity for all.
Stability will be the cornerstone of my Government’s economic policy and every decision will be consistent with its fiscal rules.
It will legislate to ensure that all significant tax and spending changes are subject to an independent assessment by the Office for Budget Responsibility.
Bills will be brought forward to strengthen audit and corporate governance, alongside pension investment.
Securing economic growth will be a fundamental mission.
My Government will seek a new partnership with both business and working people and help the country move on from the recent cost of living challenges by prioritising wealth creation for all communities.
My Ministers will establish an Industrial Strategy Council.
It is my Government’s objective to see rising living standards in all nations and regions in the United Kingdom.
My Ministers will get Britain building, including through planning reform, as they seek to accelerate the delivery of high quality infrastructure and housing.
They will also pursue sustainable growth by encouraging investment in industry, skills and new technologies.
My Government is committed to making work pay and will legislate to introduce a new deal for working people to ban exploitative practices and enhance employment rights.
It will seek to establish the appropriate legislation to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models.
My Government believes that greater devolution of decision making is at the heart of a modern dynamic economy and is a key driver of economic growth and my Ministers will introduce an English Devolution Bill.
Legislation will be introduced to give new powers to metro mayors and combined authorities.
This will support local growth plans that bring economic benefit to communities.
A Bill will be introduced to allow local leaders to take control of their local bus services.
My Ministers will bring forward legislation to improve the railways by reforming rail franchising, establishing Great British Railways and bringing train operators into public ownership.
Taken together these policies will enhance Britain’s position as a leading industrial nation and enable the country to take advantage of new opportunities that can promote growth and wealth creation.

Before I call the mover and the seconder of the debate, I want to announce the proposed pattern of debate during the remaining days on the Loyal Address: today—debate on the Address; tomorrow—foreign affairs and defence; Friday—planning, green belt and rural affairs;
Monday—economy, welfare and public services; Tuesday—immigration and home affairs.
I now have the privilege to call Peter Dowd to move, and then Florence Eshalomi to second, the Address.
I beg to move, That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty, as follows: Most Gracious Sovereign, We, Your Majesty’s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in Parliament assembled, beg leave to offer our humble thanks to Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which Your Majesty has addressed to both Houses of Parliament.
Happy birthday to Her Majesty the Queen today.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.]
It is an honour to be asked to give thanks to His Majesty.
I start by congratulating you, Mr Speaker, on your election and a warm welcome to new and returning Members, including my right hon.
Friend the “late” Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds).
Congratulations to the Prime Minister and members of his new Government.
It is worthwhile putting into context how I came to be moving the motion on the King’s Speech this afternoon.
Last Thursday morning, I was standing outside the Library minding my own business, watching somewhat bewildered hon.
Members wandering up and down the corridors, tentatively putting their heads into the odd room that may or may not have been a broom cupboard.
And they were actually the returning Members!
[Laughter.]
I cannot imagine what it must have been like for the hundreds of new Members.
It brought back memories of when I undertook similar meanderings in the corridors of power.
Then came the call from the Chief Whip.
My first thoughts were, “Oh dear, what have I done?”
Or not done, as the case may be.
Fortunately, those thoughts soon dissolved when he kindly asked me if I would undertake the Humble Address, which I was delighted and relieved to accept.
Unfortunately, I am not the most competitive sort, which is just as well.
I am afraid I cannot claim to be the first to achieve virtually anything in my family.
It started at birth as I was the last-born child.
Although I was a councillor at a relatively young age, alas, I was not the first, by a long measure, from my family.
I was the leader of a council, but not the first in my family, nor even the first to unveil a plaque on a new public building—that was pretty routine among my forebears.
Nor will I be able to look forward to being the first person in my family to reach 100 years of age—my late grandmother, Nin, ticked that box in 1984 and drove the point home by living until she was 105.
As for being the first MP in my family, I cannot claim that accolade either as there were two before me.
One was the Member—no prizes for guessing—for Bootle.
Until today, my position at the back of the family queue has held sway for decades.
Thanks to a good samaritan in the form of the Chief Whip, I am the first in my family to move the Humble Address to His Majesty.
I am, as we say in Merseyside, made up.
It goes without saying that being a Member of Parliament is an honour, but representing the town I was born in is the icing on the cake.
For those who do not know where my constituency is, it used to be a small fishing village before becoming a bathing resort for wealthy merchants just north of Liverpool—how times change.
Today, my constituency comprises a number of close-knit communities that until after the war were on farmland.
Ford, Litherland, Netherton and Old Roan housed thousands of families after the challenges of the war, and I think that vision can be renewed.
Another part of my constituency, Seaforth, is home to the port of Liverpool, to which I will return in future debates.
The country home of the Gladstone family was in Seaforth.
Indeed, Gladstone wrote about how he had seen “wild roses growing upon the very ground that is now the centre of Bootle.”
Another community, Orrell, expanded as time went by.
Then there is the lovely coastline of Liverpool bay, which has Waterloo and Crosby running along its shoreline, with beautiful views across to the hills of north Wales.
It is also home to Antony Gormley’s “iron men” statues.
Bootle town centre is now home to many Government offices, including the Charity Commission, the Health and Safety Executive and even the Office for Nuclear Regulation.
Given its location and major dock system, during the war, Bootle was a major target of the Luftwaffe.
It was left badly scarred, with as many as 85% of buildings destroyed or damaged.
It paid more than its fair share during that conflict.
So I am proud of my communities and their history, and I want the content of the Gracious Speech to be part of their future.
As much as I would like to think that the Bootle constituency having the largest majority in the country, so I am told, is down to my character, charm and charisma —[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear!”]—which are well known to my colleagues, I really know that it is down to the ambitious programme trailed in the general election campaign and now formally set out in the Gracious Speech.
I welcome a legislative programme based on security, fairness and opportunity for all, on investment, stability and reform—that is not a reference to the Members opposite—and, above all, on service to our communities, our constituencies and our country.
It is about securing economic growth, raising living standards and getting Britain building again with planning reform and quality infrastructure, recognising the challenges of climate change and harnessing technology and the clean energy transition.
Great British Energy advancing investment into renewable energy is fundamental.
If you like, Mr Speaker, it is a new social contract that delivers attainment in education, challenges antisocial behaviour, refreshes support for victims of crime, protects our borders, enhances renters’ rights, offers a new deal for working people and reinvigorates our NHS, among many other proposals.
A renewed local democratic settlement through the devolution proposals set out in the Gracious Speech is welcome.
In short, Westminster and Whitehall do not always know best.
On a day-to-day basis, I am looking forward to getting back to work, especially with new Members—the hundreds of them.
I will continue to work on the various all-party parliamentary groups with which I am involved.
The Gracious Speech includes proposals for a Bill to champion our armed forces and their families, with families being the key element in those proposals.
I use that as a prompt to mention the armed forces APPG, of which I am a member.
As an associate member of my local Crosby Royal Naval Association, I have links with local veterans, of whom there are over 12,000 in my constituency.
In addition, members of my family have been in the armed forces, and my mother and grandmother both received war widows’ pensions for decades, so the least I can do is participate in the armed forces APPG.
In the last year, I have participated in the armed forces parliamentary scheme with the RAF cohort, until that was so rudely interrupted by the general election.
While I am always impressed by inter-service collaboration, I am even more impressed by the rivalry between the services.
Before I bring a veil down on this part of my contribution, I want to relate to the House an anecdote—just one of many I could relate since participating in the scheme—about the nonchalant and insouciant rivalry between the services.
When a Member joins the scheme—and it is well worth joining—they will be asked to go to the Wellington barracks, nearby, to be measured up for a uniform.
When I arrived, I was led through the barracks to the stores.
My conversation with a member of personnel who, it must be noted, was from the army went as follows: “Good morning, sir.
How can I help you?”
“Good morning.
I’m here to be measured up for a uniform.”
“And which service will you be with serving with, sir?”
“The Royal Air Force.”
“In that case, sir, you’ll be needing a set of silk pyjamas and a smoking jacket.”
[Laughter.]
They fit like a dream, Mr Speaker.
Our country faces so many challenges and I believe the wide-ranging proposals in the King’s Speech will go a good deal of the way to tackling those challenges, both at home and abroad.
Only on Saturday evening, I was at a function for one of my local charities, Sefton Women and Children’s Aid, at Liverpool FC’s Anfield stadium, which was a real stretch as I am an Everton supporter.
While I was there, I paid a visit to the memorial to the 97 victims of Hillsborough, so I want to pay particular attention to the inclusion of what has become known as the Hillsborough law in the Gracious Speech.
I thank the many individuals, families, survivors and the coalition of other organisations who have campaigned selflessly for decades to achieve this outcome, including Members of this House.
It means so much to the families of the victims of those who died and the survivors, from our city region and beyond, that the Government will be fulfilling their promise to ensure a duty of candour on public servants.
Justice and respect at last.
It is a privilege to call the seconder.
May I start by congratulating my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bootle (Peter Dowd)  on his fantastic speech?
As the eldest of three girls, we like the last ones because we can blame them for everything.
It is an honour to follow my hon.
Friend and to second the Loyal Address, not only for me but for my constituents across Vauxhall and Camberwell Green.
When I was asked by the Chief Whip, my excitement was quickly replaced by fear because I remembered my attempt to make a Big Shaq reference during Second Reading of the Procurement Bill, which went completely over the head of  the hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Alex Burghart)  and indeed many other Members in the Chamber.
I nearly backed out, but then I remembered that this is my opportunity to get on record that Nigerian jollof is the best jollof, before my hon.
Friend  the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Abena Oppong-Asare)  puts forward any other ideas.
It is nearly 15 years since a Labour Member seconded a Loyal Address; the last Labour Member to do so was my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) , my good friend.
I have to say that the notices I receive when she visits my constituency are perhaps my favourite.
I remember receiving a note from her office saying that she was going to tour the Beefeater Gin Distillery in my constituency the next evening and that I should join her.
Sadly, I do not drink gin—but I know that she drank my share!
I can only say that I look forward to welcoming other Members to my constituency many more times during this Parliament.
Can I remind all Members that it is their duty to let me know if they are attending one of the many fabulous parties in Vauxhall and Camberwell Green—otherwise I will be complaining to Mr Speaker.
It truly is a wonderful constituency.
We have the National theatre, the British Film Institute, the Southbank centre, the Young Vic and the Old Vic, which is currently hosting a play about the life of an MP in which James Corden turns out to be one of their constituents—although I believe he lives in California, so perhaps he should get in touch with the Leader of the Opposition.
We also have the London Eye.
I am sure the whole House will be delighted to know that it received permanent planning status in May this year.
That keeps it safe even from the clutches and planning reforms of the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister.
We have communities from all over the world.
Even among the sea of England shirts on Sunday, there were a few brave Spanish fans proudly wearing their colours—although they may have just been SNP MPs.
We are also home to a number of MPs, advocacy groups and journalists, which means, when I am trying to avoid a journalist or to politely decline an invitation, I often get hit with the dreaded line, “Oh, but I am a constituent as well”.
I do warn journalists and Members that I shall continue my policy of giving no special treatment when they come up to me with any casework.
Like many continuing MPs, the area that I represent changed significantly at this election following the boundary review.
Sadly, this means that I no longer represent one of the Brixton estates that I grew up on, my church and my old primary school.
The church is central to my life and it is a microcosm of Lambeth.
After mass, I can see  the impatience on the faces of my family as I often discuss varied casework from the congregation.
I just want to reassure my hon.
Friend  the Member for Clapham and Brixton Hill (Bell Ribeiro-Addy)  that she is going to receive multiple blessings for all that varied casework.
I know the wards that I have lost will be well represented by her.
Then again, based on past experience, not all the lobby journalists will notice that anything has changed.
If the House will indulge me, I wish to speak briefly to a couple of policy issues that are close to my heart and to the hearts of my constituents and that I am looking forward to working with the new Labour Government on.
As an MP, one of the hardest conversations that any of us will have is with the victims of violent crime.
I have sat in many front rooms holding grieving mothers and fathers as they tell me about their loved ones who have been taken from them too soon.
With every hug and tear wiped away, I can feel their pain and the impact that that has on the siblings and other family members.
Crime rips communities apart, leaving too many people vulnerable and open to exploitation.
One area that I am proud to work on is preventing abuse of gang-associated girls.
Sadly, their mistreatment is just one example of why our streets need to be safer.
The Home Secretary’s commitment to halving rates of violence against women and improving the support for victims should be welcomed across the House.
Over the last couple of years, I have seen at first hand the impact of the cost of living crisis on my constituents in Vauxhall and Camberwell Green and on communities right across the country.
We also know that tackling climate change is one of the most urgent issues facing the world, and that we cannot delay meaningful action any longer.
I am therefore very pleased that the Government are committed to addressing both issues with an investment in the clean energy transition that will lower energy bills for households and restore the UK’s reputation as a climate leader.
But for millions of working people, real change will not come without action on housing.
That is why I welcome the Deputy Prime Minister’s plans to build 1.5 million new homes across the country, including a new wave of council houses, like the one that gave me and my family security.
I still remember that daily commute from a B&B in King’s Cross, and the excitement on my mum’s face when we received the keys to permanent housing—we no longer had to lug our belongings around in black bin bags.
Sadly, in 2024, that is still the case for so many people.
Vauxhall and Camberwell Green is also home to a high number of young people, many of whom are private renters.
The power that section 21 gives immoral landlords to evict tenants for no reason is an outrage.
I am glad that the Government will finally ban no-fault evictions for good.
Lastly, I am proud to be an advocate for the eradication of HIV and AIDS—an issue on which we have made so much progress recently.
Alongside my fellow co-chairs of the all-party parliamentary group on HIV and AIDS, in November last year I had the honour of hosting a reception in Mr Speaker’s House to thank Sir Elton John for his work in this field over the last 40 years.
It was a fantastic event, at which our new Prime Minister reaffirmed his commitment to ending new HIV transmissions in the UK by 2030.
It also means that today’s royal event is the second in the last 12 months at which I have had the privilege of speaking—because we can all agree that Sir Elton is music royalty!
This Parliament sees a large churn of MPs, so may I take this opportunity to congratulate and welcome new Members?
Don’t worry if you get lost; I have been here almost five years and I still get lost.
My one piece of advice is this: make sure you know where Westminster Hall is, because you will always find  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  there, on hand to point you in the right direction—after he has finished speaking in whatever debate is going on that day!
Although it was wonderful seeing so many Labour MPs winning on  4 July , it was mixed with a slight sadness that we had to say goodbye to colleagues who worked across the House for their constituents with great dedication.
Although I am delighted to see my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Rachel Blake)  in her place on these Benches, I want to refer to the important work I did with her predecessor, my friend Nickie Aiken.
As the two MPs responsible for Westminster bridge, we worked together in the last Parliament to commemorate the horrific 2017 Westminster bridge attack, in which six people sadly lost their lives, including the late PC Keith Palmer, and to improve the safety of a very busy and active part of London.
Nickie also worked tirelessly to ensure that the Pedicabs (London) Act 2024 was brought into law, despite the persistent objections of  the hon.
Member for Christchurch (Sir Christopher Chope) , which I am sure many new Members will also get used to.
I also pay tribute to the outgoing Father of the House, Sir Peter Bottomley.
I remember, as a new MP, walking into a meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on votes at 16.
The room was buzzing with excitement, energy and all these young people, and—to my surprise—Sir Peter was in the chair; he really proved that age is just a number.
I must mention my good friend and former constituency neighbour, the new Baroness Harriet Harman.
Her 42 years in office blazed a trail for the rights of women in politics and wider society.
When Harriet was elected, just 3% of MPs were women; that figure now stands at 40%.
While there is some way to go, that rise is a testament to Harriet’s unending work and drive never to take no for an answer.
While I am daunted to have the responsibility of representing parts of her former constituency in Camberwell Green, I could not have had a better example to learn from.
My pledge to her and my new constituents is that I will do my best to carry on her legacy and be a strong voice in Parliament for those communities.
Lastly, I cannot think of a more fitting replacement as the Mother of the House than my good friend, our auntie, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) .
She was elected when I was just six years old, and seeing her in the media, making the voice of black women heard in Parliament, gave me the confidence that I could stand here and ensure people in my community had a voice in the decisions that impacted them.
I say to her, “We stand on your shoulders, and we respect and salute you.
Thank you.”
