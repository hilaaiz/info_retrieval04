I welcome all new Members to their places.
Being elected as a Member of Parliament is a great honour and a great responsibility.
We serve our communities and our United Kingdom.
I know, whatever our political differences might be, we are all motivated by a desire to make life better for our constituents and to make our country stronger.
I know the whole House will join me in deploring the assassination attempt on President Trump.
Our thoughts are with the victims.
Violence and intimidation have no place in the democratic process.
