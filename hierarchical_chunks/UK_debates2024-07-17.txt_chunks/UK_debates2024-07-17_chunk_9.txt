I thank the Prime Minister for giving way during his excellent speech, outlining the hope and renewal within the King’s Speech, which is much needed in constituencies such as mine, Luton North, where over 45% of children are growing up in relative poverty.
What reassurances can he give me and my constituents that he personally takes this issue seriously and that his Government will address it?
