Before I turn to the Address, I am sure the whole House would like to join me in paying tribute to His Majesty the King.
It is typical of his dedication to duty that, despite the medical challenges he has faced, he was here today to open Parliament and will travel to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Samoa and to Australia this autumn.
The King is a true model of public service.
I know the Prime Minister will value his audiences with His Majesty as much as I did.
We all recognise that the King is aided by the constant support of Her Majesty the Queen, and I know the whole House will join me in wishing her a very happy birthday.
Today we also pay tribute to Tony Lloyd.
Tony served the people of Greater Manchester for 45 years, and for 36 of those as a Member of this House.
He was a great parliamentarian, kind and wise.
His family should have enormous pride in the contribution he made to this place and to the community he loved and served.
They are in all our thoughts today.
