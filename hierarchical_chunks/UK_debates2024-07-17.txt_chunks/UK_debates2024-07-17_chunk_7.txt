I welcome the Government’s decision to bring forward Martyn’s law.
I am sure that the Prime Minister will find, as I did, that one of the most humbling parts of the job is seeing people whose lives have been touched by tragedy not turn to anger or bitterness, but campaign to ensure that other families do not have to endure the same pain.
I particularly commend Figen Murray for her work to get this law on to the statute book.
I can assure her that this measure will command consensus in this House, and we will work with the Government to make sure that it becomes law as soon as possible.
