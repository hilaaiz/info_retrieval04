Eenie and Meenie, two white cats from Stanbridge, were recently shot and killed.
Could the Minister outline what discussions she has had with local police to that ensure that these crimes are properly investigated and that the law is upheld?
The abuse of animals using weapons of any type is an incredibly serious matter, and there are such provisions in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006.
There is a range of offences, and I encourage anyone who witnesses this kind of event to report it to the police.
I will certainly discuss what more we can do with my colleagues in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Many of my constituents have raised concerns about e-bikes and e-scooters being a safety hazard when modified or misused.
What is the Minister doing to tackle riders travelling at high speeds on pavements and other pedestrian areas, and help my constituents to feel safe on their streets again?
I can reassure the hon.
Member that dangerous and antisocial behaviour involving e-bikes will be covered by the legislation we are introducing tomorrow to tackle vehicles and off-road bikes used in antisocial behaviour, so that we can keep streets and communities safe.
Antisocial behaviour is too common on the Wirral and it ruins lives.
This morning I spoke to my constituent Henry, who told me that having groups of youths hanging outside, intimidating and damaging property, made him feel like a prisoner in his own home.
What more can be done to tackle such abuse and to support victims?
My hon.
Friend is right to raise this issue.
Too often antisocial behaviour is dismissed as a low-level crime, yet it can make people’s lives a complete misery.
That is why we need more neighbourhood police back on our streets, working in communities to prevent and tackle the kinds of problems that communities face.
