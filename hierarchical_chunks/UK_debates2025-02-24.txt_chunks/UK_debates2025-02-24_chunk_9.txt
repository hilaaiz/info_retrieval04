The recent National Audit Office report on the Government’s response to violence against women and girls, which includes domestic abuse, made a number of recommendations.
My Committee will be considering that issue, but will the Minister comment on what the Government’s response will be to those recommendations, and say how she will ensure that domestic abuse is tackled across the country, including in Gloucester?
I was waiting for that reference to Gloucester.
As the right hon.
Lady will know, the NAO report is largely based on the previous Government’s period in office, and although it makes clear recommendations, it would be premature of me to comment.
However, the strategy to combat violence against women and girls that will be published by this Government in early summer will undoubtedly be looking to the NAO recommendations.
What steps her Department is taking to help reduce demand for sex trafficking and sexual exploitation.
The trafficking of women and girls for sexual exploitation is a horrific crime, and the Government work closely with law enforcement to tackle the drivers of that offending and target prolific perpetrators.
That includes through operational intensification initiatives aimed at tackling modern slavery threats.
The Online Safety Act 2023 sets  out priority offences, including sexual exploitation and human trafficking offences, and starting from  17 March , in-scope companies must adopt systems and processes to address those offences.
