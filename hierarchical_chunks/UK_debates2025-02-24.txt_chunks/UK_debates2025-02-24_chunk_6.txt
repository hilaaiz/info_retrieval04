I thank my hon.
Friend for her answer, and for all the work she has done over many years to champion victims and survivors of domestic abuse.
As she will know, one of the biggest challenges facing survivors and victims in Gloucester is the financial implications of fleeing that abuse.
Will she agree to meet me to discuss my 10-minute rule Bill, the Domestic Abuse (Safe Leave) Bill, which would introduce safe leave for victims of domestic abuse and violence?
