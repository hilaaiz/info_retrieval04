Strong encryption is vital for everyone’s security, but last week Apple pulled its advanced data protection services in the UK after the Home Office had reportedly demanded back-door access to its UK customers’ encrypted data.
Liberal Democrats have long argued that investigatory powers must be proportionate, as any “way in” for security services can be exploited by criminal gangs or, indeed, hostile states to target innocent people.
Given that rights and security go hand in hand, what steps is the Minister taking to ensure that our national security and civil liberties are properly protected?
Why do the Government believe that Apple’s UK customers do not deserve the same privacy rights as every other customer in the rest of the world?

Lady will understand that I cannot comment on operational matters, and it would not be appropriate for me either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notices under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.
This is a long-standing position held by successive Governments for obvious reasons of national security.
What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct; we can and must have both.
The Investigatory Powers Act contains robust safeguards and independent oversight to protect privacy and ensure that data is obtained only on an exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so.
