Thank you, Mr Speaker.
“My son didn’t stand a chance.”
Those were the heartbreaking words of Pooja Kanda, whose teenage son Ronan was fatally stabbed in 2022.
His teenage killers were able to buy multiple dangerous weapons online, without any proper checks.
Following Pooja’s campaigning, we are introducing Ronan’s law, which includes tightening the rules for online retailers, increasing the maximum penalty for selling weapons to under-18s, and introducing much more stringent ID checks at the point of purchase and delivery.
I thank Commander Stephen Clayman for his crucial review in this area, which underpins the reforms, and pay tribute to the Kanda family.
We need to do everything in our power to prevent other families from suffering from terrible knife crime.
Thames Valley police are £1.9 million down this year because of the flawed formula for distributing funds to police forces after a pay award is given.
When will this historical anomaly be fixed?
I will just point out to the hon.
Gentleman that his party had 14 years to address all the things he is so concerned about now.
This Government have increased funding for policing by up to £1.1 billion next year, including £200 million to start redressing the huge cuts in neighbourhood policing that we have seen on our streets in Thames Valley and right across the country, because we need to get police back on the streets.
