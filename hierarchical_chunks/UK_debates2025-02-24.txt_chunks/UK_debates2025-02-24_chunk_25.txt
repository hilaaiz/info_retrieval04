The Government are clear that online platforms are a significant enabler of sexual exploitation, and must be responsible and held accountable for the content of their sites, including taking proactive steps to prevent their sites being used by criminals.
We are implementing the Online Safety Act 2023, which sets out priority offences, including sexual exploitation and human trafficking.
