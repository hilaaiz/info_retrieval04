I thank the Foreign Secretary for advance sight of his statement.
Today marks three years since Putin launched his barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Many people, including Putin, expected Russian tanks to capture Kyiv in days, yet Putin failed to consider the resolve of the Ukrainian people.
Three years on, Ukrainians bravely continue the fight against Putin’s imperialism in defence of their sovereignty.
