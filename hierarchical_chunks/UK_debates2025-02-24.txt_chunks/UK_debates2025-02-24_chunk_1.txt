The hon.
Gentleman talks about the Government’s policies for growing the economy.
A few months ago, we held an international investment summit, at which £63 billion of investment was announced.
As I have mentioned, there was £2 billion announced in the Budget for the automotive industry.
Interest rates have been cut three times, wages are up, and more than 70,000 jobs have been secured in the UK since the Government came to power.
The International Monetary Fund and the OECD predict that the UK will be Europe’s fastest-growing economy over the next few years.
The industrial strategy was scrapped under the last Government; our industrial strategy will be the backbone of ensuring that we deliver growth.
The hon.
Gentleman asked what we were doing.
I have already set out the stability, investment and reform that we are bringing to the sector to make sure that it can thrive.
Hundreds of thousands of people rely on the automotive industry through their work in it, or in its supply chains.
Those are good, well-paid jobs, and we are absolutely determined to ensure that the sector grows.
