In my role as Chair of the Defence Committee, I get the opportunity to meet many ambassadors, Defence Ministers, attachés and other stakeholders, both here in London and at events and gatherings such as the Munich security conference.
There is considerable consternation and anxiety among them about whether long-established and hard-earned alliances, rather than a short-term transactional approach, can still be relied on.
Given the reduced American presence, and as we mark the third anniversary of Putin’s full-scale illegal invasion of Ukraine, people are looking for leadership.
I feel that this is our time as a nation to take that lead on defence and security matters in our continent.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that it can be our Prime Minister who takes that lead in our continent while pulling together our transatlantic, NATO and other allies in the process?
The UK has been ironclad in its support for Ukraine.
We have been forward-leaning as Ukraine’s primary friend in Europe and across the world, under successive Governments.
It is also the case that we have a special relationship with the United States, underpinned by a lot of military and defence capability and support over many, many years and, of course, a very close intelligence relationship.
We bring all of that to bear in ensuring that we get a resolution to this terrible conflict, but a resolution that means we have an enduring peace in which Ukraine is at the centre of discussions.
My hon.
Friend should be absolutely sure that the UK intends to play its part, which is why we will meet with Donald Trump this week.
The Prime Minister has also been at the centre of much shuttle diplomacy over this last period.
