The Minister has set out how we delivered £2 billion-worth of support for the automotive sector in the Budget.
That support is both for manufacturing and for the crucial supply chains in places such as my Black Country constituency and Oxford.
Is she able to set out any further details about how that money will be used to support our brilliant manufacturing?
