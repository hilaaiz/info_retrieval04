The Home Secretary quite conspicuously failed to answer the question that my hon.
Friend  the Member for Weald of Kent (Katie Lam)  asked earlier, so I am going to have another go.

Three weeks ago, I met a nine-year-old boy in Blackpool’s asylum hotel.
He cannot walk, has frequent seizures and is non-verbal.
Since May last year, his family have been requesting a wheelchair, as they have to carry him everywhere they go.
No child, especially one with these needs, should have to go without the equipment that gives them the dignity to live.
Does the Minister agree that such hotels are unsuitable for vulnerable children, and will she personally intervene to help me to get this young lad a wheelchair?
