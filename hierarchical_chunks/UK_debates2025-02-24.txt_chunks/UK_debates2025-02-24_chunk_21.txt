I thank the Minister for her previous answers, and for her commitment to reducing the number of asylum claimants in the UK.
As she will know, the UK is spending 27% of its official development assistance on housing asylum claimants—almost double the OECD average.
Our overseas spend was cut by the previous Government.
Does she agree that in order to reduce the number of claimants coming to the UK, the Government should increase the spend on building peace and security abroad?
