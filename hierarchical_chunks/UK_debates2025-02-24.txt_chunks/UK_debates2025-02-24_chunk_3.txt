Before we begin today’s proceedings, I know that the House will wish to join me in acknowledging that today marks the third anniversary of the beginning of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.
This House has always stood with the people of Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, as they stand up for their ideals, which underpin a peaceful, stable and democratic world.
Our thoughts today are with the people of Ukraine, as well as with our colleagues in the Ukrainian Parliament.
I have to notify the House, in accordance with the Royal Assent Act 1967, that His Majesty has signified his Royal Assent to the following Acts: Arbitration Act 2025 Water (Special Measures) Act 2025.
