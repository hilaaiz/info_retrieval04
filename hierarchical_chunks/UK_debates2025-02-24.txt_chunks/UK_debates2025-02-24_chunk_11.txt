Like my hon.
Friend, I am horrified that such practices should be allowed to continue.
Online platforms have a duty to assess the risk of illegal harms on their services, with a deadline of  16 March 2025 , subject to the codes of practice completing the parliamentary process on  17 March .
Online platforms will need to take safety measures set out in the codes of practice, and to use other effective measures to protect users from illegal content such as that of which my hon.
Friend speaks.
If they fail to do so, they will face significant penalties.
As she might imagine, I will be keeping a close eye on that.
What measures is the Minister taking to address the record backlog of court cases in the UK, which, as the chief inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service and Serious Fraud Office has warned, is on target to hit 100,000?
In particular, can she comment on the call for changes to be made to the way that court cases are prioritised, which at present is resulting in victims of serious crimes, including sexual trafficking, exploitation and rape, facing years-long waits for trials, while less serious crimes are prioritised ahead in the queue?
