I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and for her support for the industry, which is so important.
Through the £2 billion funding, the automotive transformation fund, the exceptional regional growth fund and the advanced propulsion centre research and development fund, we have found innovative ways of supporting the industry.
In January, I was pleased to hear Jatco, a company that makes transmissions for Nissan, announce that it would put its first manufacturing plant in Europe here in the UK; it is converting an old hospital building with a £50 million investment.
That plant will be at the international advanced manufacturing park in Sunderland.
That is the kind of opportunity that we want to create and deliver.
