I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing this matter to my attention.
My officials have investigated, and Serco has referred the case to healthcare partners, who are currently in the process of providing a suitable wheelchair following a thorough assessment of the child’s needs.
Officials are monitoring the situation closely to ensure the family receive the support they require.
