Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Officer Bryan Szostak for his remarkable 25 years of service.
His commitment to the canine program, Canton Police Department, and the City of Canton has been dedicated to the safety and improvement of the community.
I join Officer Szostak's family, friends, and colleagues in extending my best wishes to him in retirement.
