Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Bryan Szostak on the occasion of his retirement from the Canton Police Department after 25 years of service to the city of Canton, Michigan.
His decades of service to our community is worthy of commendation.
Officer Szostak joined the Canton Police Department in 1999 and has served as a midnight shift officer ever since.
For the past 24 years, he has been a member of the department's Honor Guard as one of the founding members and leader, with which he has participated in Posting fallen officers.
Officer Szostak also served the community's youth as a veteran advisor for the Explorer Unit, a program for teenagers interested in law enforcement.
In these roles, Officer Szostak has showed his emphatic commitment to the units he has been involved in.
Most notably, Officer Szostak has been a committed Canine Officer for the past 20 years.
His loyalty and passion for this program has been exemplified in his love for his current canine partner Ragnar, who is retiring alongside Officer Szostak, as well as his two previous canine partners, Poncho and Hoss.
In this role, Officer Szostak has set new standards for training and policing, which will not soon be forgotten.
Over the course of his extensive career, Officer Szostak earned many department awards, in addition to citizen recognitions for his service and commitmment to improving the city.
