lives of Mainers through technical and academic training.
Since the first class of students in 1997, the Loring Job Corps Center in Limestone has helped students from Maine and across the Nation earn high school diplomas, construct long-term careers, and obtain great jobs.
The Penobscot Job Corps has maintained the same mission for the past 45 years.
Education and community service alike are two of the cornerstones of both Job Corps Centers in Maine, resulting in the students not only changing their lives but the lives of those around them.
The program's outreach and development with workforce partners has only enhanced its ability to reach out and enrich the lives of young Mainers.
The Job Corps program encourages the vital education and creativity of bright young students throughout our country.
It is with great pride and appreciation that I congratulate our two Maine Centers and Job Corps for 60 years of critical work.
