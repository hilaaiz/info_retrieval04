Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, today I joined thousands of people in Minnesota who gathered for the public funeral for Burnsville Police Officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, and Firefighter-Paramedic Adam Finseth who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
On Sunday, February 18, 2024, these courageous public servants answered a call to protect a family and our community, and were gunned down in a horrific act of violence.
This heartbreaking incident occurs amid a crisis of gun violence and domestic abuse, and our first responders are on the front lines every day.
Officers Elmstrand and Ruge dedicated their lives to protecting our community.
Firefighter-Paramedic Finseth was committed to saving lives, as he was attempting to do that day.
He also served our Nation proudly in the U.S. Army, twice deploying on tours of duty in Iraq.
Their deaths in the line of duty are a devastating tragedy that touches their families, their fellow first responders, the Burnsville community, the state of Minnesota, and our Nation.
I extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends who loved them.
Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered and honored.
