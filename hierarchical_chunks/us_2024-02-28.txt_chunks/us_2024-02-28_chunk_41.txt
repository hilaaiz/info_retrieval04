Mr. GARBARINO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Congressional Board of Visitors to thank the experts of the Maritime Security Infrastructure Council.
Recognizing the vital role of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in our national security and concerned about outdated and deteriorating conditions across campus, they assembled a straightforward, multi-year plan to bring the campus up to a standard commensurate with its crucial function.
I am pleased to include in the Record a summary of their plan to modernize the Academy's 80-year-old infrastructure as well as a link to the Full Speed Ahead Plan in its entirety, which can be found at <a href='https://wearetheusmma.com/fullspeedahead/'>https://wearetheusmma.com/fullspeedahead/</a>.
Graduates of the USMMA, one of our Nation's five federal service academies, make up more than 80 percent of the U.S. Navy Strategic Sealift Officer Force.
Without these service-committed mariners, the Nation would have no assured source of trained, licensed officers to crew the vessels which move materiel, fuel and supplies to foreign shores in wartime.
Without a comprehensive capital improvement plan and its timely execution, conditions on the USMMA's Kings Point, New York campus will continue to worsen, adversely impacting mission-critical training and hindering recruitment of dedicated service-obligated midshipmen.
For far too long, Congress has ignored the infrastructure required to provide USMMA midshipmen the specialized education and training they need to fulfill their mission.
It is now time to make the institution worthy of their commitment to serve our Nation.
