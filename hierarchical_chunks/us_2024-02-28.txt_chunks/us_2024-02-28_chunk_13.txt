Mr. FULCHER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor five of our precious fallen Marines, including Captain Benjamin Moulton, who were killed in a helicopter crash last week in California.
At 27 years old, Captain Moulton was known for his leadership and determination.
Benjamin grew up with family roots in Emmett, Idaho, and received an ROTC scholarship to the University.
Once commissioned into the Marines in 2019, Benjamin continued to strive for excellence and was promoted to Captain in August of last year.
Captain Moulton was a decorated pilot who flew with precision and skill, navigating through challenges with grace and determination.
His love for aviation and his commitment to excellence inspired all who had the privilege to serve alongside him.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Moulton family and friends as they mourn the loss of this remarkable Marine.
We are inspired by Benjamin's bravery and his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.
