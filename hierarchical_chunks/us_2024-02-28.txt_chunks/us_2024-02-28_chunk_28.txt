Mr. Speaker, even in the darkest hour of our civilization, courageous truth tellers like Ben Cooper refuse to be silenced by fear or indifference.
Ben's impact on our nation's citizens is immeasurable, and scores of young citizens will remember his stories and examples.
Regrettably understanding the savagery of Nazi barbarism is of critical importance in the world we live in today.
Our country should honor Ben's gentle kindness and conviction that touched thousands of fellow Americans.
I ask that my colleagues join me in immortalizing Ben's story.
