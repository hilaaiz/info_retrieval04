Mr. BARR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a special man, Reverend Dr. Keith G. Tyler, Sr. from Lexington, Kentucky.
His church, Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, is celebrating Reverend Tyler's 25th anniversary as their pastor.
Reverend Tyler professed a hope in Christ as a child and was baptized at the age of eight by the late Rev. A.D. Jones in Louisville, KY.
He was called to preach the Gospel in 1985 and went on to be licensed and ordained.
Reverend Tyler accepted the call to serve as pastor at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in 1998.
Under his leadership, membership has more than tripled.
He encourages the delivery of God's word in a variety of methods, including a feed-the-homeless effort, a neighborhood bazaar and community festival, a Women's Conference, and Children's Church.
He launched a live radio broadcast in 2022.
He is a motivating speaker, an inspiring preacher, and an innovative leader.
He enjoys traveling across the nation evangelizing.
Reverend Tyler is an active leader in the community.
He serves many organizations, including the Speigel Hill Community Center, the Black Faith Leaders of Lexington and Vicinity, and the Central KY Council for Peace and Justice.
In addition, he is a trustee of Simmons College of Kentucky, and he serves on the Community Police Chaplain ``Response Team.''
He is the proud father and grandfather of four children and three grandchildren.
Reverend Tyler is to be commended for his ministry over 25 years at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church.
I congratulate him and all the members of the congregation and wish them many more years of serving our Lord.
I am honored to recognize Reverend Dr. Keith Tyler before the United States Congress.
