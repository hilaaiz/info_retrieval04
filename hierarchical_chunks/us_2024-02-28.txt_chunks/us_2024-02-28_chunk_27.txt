Ben's new mission: to teach America's future generations of the impact of prejudice and bigotry, and to promote kindness and compassion.
He spoke at many high schools, including Simsbury and Hall, about his wartime experiences.
His lessons always included advocacy for kindness.
He brought historical events from textbooks to life through his lived memories.
Ben hoped that teaching this part of history would ensure that it would never be repeated.
In 2010, Ben met Henny Simon, a liberated victim of the Nazi concentration camps.
Until her death in 2017, the two visited high schools in Connecticut and taught classes on WWII.
Students across Connecticut gained valuable insight on how precious a thing our liberties and rights are, and how fiercely they need to be defended.
The pair were offered to include their experiences in a documentary titled ``In Times.''
Fortunately, their stories have been immortalized through their lessons and the documentary and countless news articles.
