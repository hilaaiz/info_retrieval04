Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bob Lambe for his lifetime of public service.
His commitment to the Great Lakes Fishery Commission has made a lasting change to the conservation efforts of this organization and will not soon be forgotten.
Throughout his career, Bob has remained reliable and genuine in his work to protect our environment.
I join Bob Lambe's family, friends, and colleagues in extending my best wishes to him in retirement.
