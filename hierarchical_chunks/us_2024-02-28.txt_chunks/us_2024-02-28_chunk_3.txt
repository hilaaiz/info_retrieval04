Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Orange County Chamber of Commerce and to congratulate them on a century of unwavering dedication to the prosperity and success of businesses in Orange County, Virginia.
Over the last 100 years, Orange County's businesses and entrepreneurs have benefitted from the network and expertise provided by the Orange County Chamber.
A cornerstone of Orange County, the staff and members of the Chamber have been a vital force--driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and championing the spirit of entrepreneurship across Orange County.
Notably, the Orange County Chamber of Commerce has encouraged collaboration through their signature events--the Orange Street Festival and the Orange Uncorked Wine Festival.
These events have not only helped nurture countless businesses and forged valuable relationships within the community, but they have also provided families across Orange with memorable experiences and fun activities.
Today, the Chamber boasts a membership of more than 280 Virginians.
Each member, alongside Chamber staff, leadership, and volunteers, has contributed to the success and longevity of the Orange County Chamber.
As their Representative, I wish to extend my greatest appreciation for the work the Orange County Chamber of Commerce does to support the local economy and improve the lives of residents in and around Orange County.
