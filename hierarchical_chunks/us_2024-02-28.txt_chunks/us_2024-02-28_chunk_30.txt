Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important work of New Hampshire's poll workers and volunteers, who oversaw a safe, secure election in the first-in-the-nation primary that took place on Tuesday, January 23, 2024.
For more than 100 years, New Hampshire has been proud to host our country's first presidential primary, an honor our state takes very seriously.
This primary would not be possible without New Hampshire's dedicated poll workers and volunteers.
This year, like every time before, our poll workers demonstrated the power of our democracy and the importance of civic responsibility by dutifully and earnestly conducting this year's election.
I want to thank these citizens for stepping up for our democracy.
New Hampshire's poll workers continue to set an example for the nation in their tireless efforts to count every vote and ensure that the voices prove that despite ongoing efforts to polarize or politicize our elections, our American democracy is strong.
Granite Stater poll workers help inspire increased voter confidence and turnout and ensure a smoother process for our state's elections.
It is critical that all communities throughout our state are able to have their voices heard in our democracy.
Poll workers, local town officials, and volunteers are instrumental to our electoral process, preserving the right to vote for all Americans by remaining impartial and fair throughout the process, from overseeing voter registration to processing ballots.
All Americans deserve to have their voices represented.
