Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 108th Infantry Regiment, of the New York Army National Guard.
Charlie Company's historic record began on April 27, 1898, when the 108th Infantry Regiment was constituted in the New York National Guard as the 3d New York Volunteer Infantry.
The regiment was organized from existing companies in Northern and Central New York.
The unit first began federal service on May 17, 1898, at Camp Black, New York, serving with distinction during the Spanish-American War.
On December 22, 1898, the regiment was reorganized into the 1st Infantry Battalion in Niagara Falls, the 2nd Infantry Battalion in Geneva, and the 3rd Infantry Battalion in Oswego.
Charlie Company 2-108 served honorably in many of the defining conflicts of the twentieth century.
During World War I, the regiment was reorganized and redesignated on October 1, 1917, as the 108th Infantry Regiment and assigned to the 27th Division.
The 108th Infantry Regiment aided allied forces in the Somme Offensive in France and at Ypres-Lys and Flanders Field in Belgium.
In World War II, Charlie Company saw action throughout the Pacific Theater, fighting on the Bismarck Archipelago, Leyte, Luzon, and across the Southern Philippines and the Ryukyu Islands.
For their service in the Philippines, the Company was awarded the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation in July 1945.
For many years, Charlie Company 2-108 has been deployed to critical missions in the Middle East.
The unit was deployed to Iraq in 2004 as part of the 1st Infantry Division and played a pivotal role in securing the city.
They were later recognized with the Valorous Unit Award for their accomplishments.
In 2012, Charlie Company was deployed to Afghanistan as part.
In 2024, Charlie Company participated in African Lion, U.S. Africa Command's largest joint exercise on the continent.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, I am proud to recognize the distinguished service of the men and women of Charlie Company, 2nd
