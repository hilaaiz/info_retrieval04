Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Seaman First Class Francis Alfred Piche, United States Navy veteran of World War II.
Francis Piche was born in Troy, New York, on May 12, 1927.
He was raised and attended school in Troy until he enlisted in the United States Navy on June 26, 1944, serving as Seaman First Class.
He was stationed stateside in Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and in Long Island, New York, before the USS Oklahoma City was called into action.
He served aboard the Cleveland-class light cruiser for operations in support of the Okinawa campaign and continued action against the Japanese islands.
At the end of hostilities, he was part of the patrol off the coast of Japan and the subsequent occupation.
Upon returning to the United States, Piche was honorably discharged in July 1946 and was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with two bronze service stars, and the Navy Occupation Service Medal for his service.
After leaving the Navy, Francis reentered civilian life and pursued a career with the Ford Motor Company in Green Island, New York.
He worked as a floor inspector for two decades before retiring in 1977.
During his free time, Francis served as a communicant at St. Joseph's Church and was a loyal member of the American Legion Legnard-Curtin Post 927.
Francis married his wife Audrey in 1946 and together they had six children, Francis, Colleen, Laurie, Paul, Diane, and David.
He enjoyed spending time with his family, which grew to include twenty-four grandchildren and many great-grandchildren.
Francis' dedication and service to the United States is truly remarkable.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, I am honored to recognize his extraordinary life.
