Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the success of Dolly Parton's Imagination Library in the State.
This new initiative increases literacy and education among our state's youth and will foster an invaluable love of reading for our state's precious youth.
I express my deepest gratitude to Dolly Parton and the State of Missouri for bringing this program to the youngest constituents in my district.
Dolly Parton's Imagination Library delivers books monthly to children's homes from their birth until their fifth birthday.
For the children and their families receiving the books, the program is completely free.
In Missouri, this program thrives thanks to the generosity of Dolly, nearly 60 affiliates and legislation passed by the state to establish and administer Dolly Parton's Imagination Library for all children in Missouri 0 to 5 years old.
In 1995, Dolly Parton--already an award-winning and chart-topping artist--established an Imagination Library in her home county in Tennessee, inspired by her father who could not read.
Since then, the program boasts recipients from five countries around the world.
As of this year, it has delivered over 250 million books to over 3 million young children.
Dolly is an incredible philanthropist, and her record international musical phenomenon.
We are thankful to have our very own Imagination Library here to continue inspiring future generations of leaders through literacy.
Though Dolly Parton's Imagination Library has been an ``Unlikely Angel'' in helping our state advance early childhood literacy, the establishment of the Missouri Imagination Library
