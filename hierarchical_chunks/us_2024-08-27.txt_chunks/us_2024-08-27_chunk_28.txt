I was privileged to work alongside Miguel on the National Genome Resource Center, where his insights into the role of science in shaping New Mexico's economy were invaluable.
His passion for both science and community was truly inspiring, and I learned so much from him.

His passing is a profound loss not only to his family but also to the scientific community, to our civic community, and to all who were fortunate enough to know him.
Miguel's legacy will continue to inspire all who knew him.
