Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Sandy Lauder.
Over the last two decades, Sandy has spent thousands of hours volunteering in the Richardson community.
He has been a dedicated volunteer with Richardson Police Department's Volunteers in Police Service program for nearly 17 years, along with completing Richardson Citizen Police Academy's Class 25.
To this day, Sandy still serves on the board of the Citizen Police Academy Alumni Association.
In 2015, Sandy joined the Richardson Community Band where he plays a dual role as trombonist and band president.
As the president, Sandy collaborates with other bands in the area to perform jazz and big band classics for Richardson Senior Center, retirement homes, community fairs, and the Dallas VA Hospital.
Sandy also teaches English and citizenship classes at Woodcreek Church in Richardson as part of the Building English Skills Together program.
Previously, he served as president of his homeowner's association, and he currently coordinates his neighborhood's crime watch patrol.
Sandy's community involvement spans beyond Richardson city limits.
For 20 years, he has volunteered as a DFW Airport Ambassador, greeting international guests and answering their questions.
According to the DFW Airport Customer Programs Coordinator, Sandy ``has been a superhero coming to the aid of millions of travelers through his service.
He is kind and helpful to all who work around him and he rarely misses a shift.''
At 91 years young, he credits his longevity to ``staying positive and volunteering.''
In his own words, ``It's never too late to enjoy life and serve your fellow man.''
I'd like to thank Sandy Lauder for going above and beyond to serve our North Texas community.
