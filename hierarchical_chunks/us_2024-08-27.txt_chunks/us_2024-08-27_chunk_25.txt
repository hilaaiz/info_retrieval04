Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the impact and service that Dolly Parton's Imagination Library will continue to have in Missouri's Fifth Congressional District and the rest of the ``Show-Me'' State.
I speak with the voice of Missouri's entire Fifth Congressional District as we say a heartfelt ``thank you'' to Dolly Parton's Imagination Library as we celebrate and congratulate them on all their current achievements and those to come.
