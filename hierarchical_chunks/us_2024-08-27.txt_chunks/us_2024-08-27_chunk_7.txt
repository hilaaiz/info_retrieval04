Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor a remarkable leader, Fire Chief Mike Starr, who has dedicated 27 years of his life to serving and protecting the citizens of Southlake, Texas.
In 1997, Starr joined the Southlake Fire Department, working as a firefighter and paramedic.
As a result of his unwavering dedication and commitment, he rose through the ranks, taking on the positions of driver, engineer, and captain of operations.
Then, in 2008, Starr earned the title of Fire Chief, a role he has used to make a lasting impact in North Texas.
During his tenure as Fire Chief, Mike Starr led the department through a period of significant growth and transformation.
Under his leadership, the department expanded its personnel from 45 to 74 members and oversaw the openings of Station 1 DPS Headquarters and the Station 3 North training facility.
Chief Starr's vision and commitment to excellence have been the driving force behind these achievements, ensuring that the fire department not only meets but exceeds the needs of our growing community.
Throughout his distinguished career, Chief Starr has embodied what it means to be a true leader.
His dedication and hard work have been recognized through numerous honors, including the Teamwork Award in 1998 and the Director's Award in 2006.
In 2007, he was named Firefighter of the Year, a testament to his outstanding service.
Chief Starr has always focused on leading and developing a department that models best-in-class service delivery.
In the Fire Department's 2023 annual report, Chief Starr highlighted the importance of continuous improvement through daily ``quick drills'' for line personnel, ensuring operational effectiveness and preparedness.
His leadership has been invaluable, and as Southlake City Manager Alison Ortowski noted, his guidance has been instrumental in navigating the challenges of growing a fire department while maintaining the highest standards of service.
As Chief Starr prepares to retire at the end of August, it is both an honor and a privilege to recognize his 27 years of exemplary service.
I would like to extend my deepest gratitude for his contributions and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.
