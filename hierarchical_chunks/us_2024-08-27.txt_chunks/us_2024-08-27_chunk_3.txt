Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate a Hoosier who has not only faced the adversity that afflicts the lives of soldiers after service but has been able to overcome those obstacles.
The culmination of Kris Bertrand-Glomski's experiences and perseverance has guided her efforts to enact the change our military women and men deserve to see in our community.
Kris first answered the call to serve her country in 1989 and served in the Navy until 1993.
With a Bachelor of Social Work from Indiana University, a Master of Science in Vocational Rehabilitation, and a certificate in Mental Health Counseling from Butler University, she has since put her expertise into providing steadfast support to the Indianapolis veteran community.
Working at the federal and state levels, Kris has impacted the dayto-day lives of others as a member of multiple organizations, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs and most recently Indiana's Veteran Service Office.
Seeking to bridge this important work across Indiana, she established the Hoosier Women Veterans Program and was instrumental in the passing of the Women Veterans Program bill.
Kris is a shining example of lifelong advocacy.
Her efforts to provide resources for women veterans have garnered numerous accolades, such as the Torchbearer Award and, more recently, the HUMANA scholarship to continue learning how to best assist her fellow veterans.
Often, women veterans tend to be underrecognized for their efforts and impact.
Beginning with its namesake, the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero Award was created to highlight exemplary Hoosier women veterans whose service to their community and Nation is unparalleled.
Therefore, it is with great pleasure to commend and uplift our Hoosier women veterans who proudly, continuously serve our people, community, and Nation.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Kris Bertrand-Glomski.
I thank her for her service.
