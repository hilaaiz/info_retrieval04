Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate a pillar of public service, James Bartelli of Waterford, Connecticut.
James is retiring this year as the Director of Utilities from the Waterford Utility Commission after 39 years of dedicated service.
His almost four decades of outstanding expertise and dedication to his community will be sorely missed.
James's professional career has been defined by his service to the community.
James began his journey with the Waterford Utility Commission in 1985 when he started as a sewer maintainer and has worked his way up from apprentice to director.
From a young age, James was able to apply and develop his specialized knowledge and caring disposition to a range of different positions with the Utility Commission.
James has since remained a dutiful protector of his community in Waterford, serving in many different capacities with the Waterford Utility Commission.
Given his steadfastness, James was promoted several times within the Utility Commission, quickly moving up the ranks.
He spent more than 20 years as the Assistant Director, making changes for staff and customers of the Waterford Utility Commission that enhanced the community.
His valuable contributions to Waterford residents in all situations were recognized time and time again and he achieved the position of Director, a position he has dutifully held for the past two years.
James's dedication to his work is evident in his demonstrated enthusiasm to jump into action in any scenario no matter how complex, working through bad weather, budget crises, and anything in between.
