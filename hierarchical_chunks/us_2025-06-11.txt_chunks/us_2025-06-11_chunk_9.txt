Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate this year's winners of the Congressional Award.
The Congressional Award honors those who strive to be part of something bigger than themselves.
With this award, Congress recognizes young Americans who devote their free time to an important activity.
It could be taking on a public service project, pursuing a hobby or new skill, starting a physical fitness program, or going on an outdoor expedition.
Participants set goals in these areas, and how they do in meeting them determines the level of award they receive, Just as important, they receive the sense of pride that comes with fulfilling a mission.
The program, established in 1979, is a great way to motivate young people to develop the building blocks of good citizenship.
I congratulate each of the awards' winners.
I include in the Record a list of this year's Congressional Award Gold Medalists from around the country, including three recipients from the great state.
