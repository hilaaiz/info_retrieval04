Mr. OBERNOLTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jeff Willis on his retirement from the Big Bear City Fire Department after nearly four decades of dedicated service.
Throughout his career, Jeff served as a firefighter, engineer, captain, division chief, assistant chief, fire marshal, and fire chief.
Jeff is renowned in our community as a selfless and caring individual and is a true friend to all who have the privilege of knowing him.
A resident of the Big Bear community for over 48 years, Jeff attended local schools prior to joining the Big Bear City Fire Department as a paid call firefighter at 18 years old.
Jeff was promoted to paid call engineer within 2 years and advanced to the rank of fire captain just 2 years later--a true testament to his unique skillset and exceptional abilities.
In 2007, at just 43 years old, Jeff became the youngest fire chief in the history of the Big Bear City Fire Department.
Jeff's additional accolades include serving as a board member for the Fire Districts Association of California and as both chair and vice chair of the Joint Legislative Task Force representing the California Fire Chiefs Association.
Jeff's decorated career and service to Big Bear City would not have been possible without the support of his family.
His wife, Yvette; his three sons, Brandon, Jordan, and Kadon; his two stepsons, Joshua and Brennan Eddy; his mother, Barbara; and his late father, Ken, were instrumental in supporting his work in keeping our community safe.
Jeff had a profound impact on our community and the Big Bear City Fire Department.
Heather and I deeply appreciate Jeff for his years of service, and we wish him and his family well as they enter this next stage of his already eventful and purposeful life.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jeff Willis and celebrating his retirement.
