Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Justice David H. Souter, who passed away recently at the age of 85.
Justice Souter served our Nation with integrity, humility, and an abiding respect for the Constitution.
In retirement, he spoke rarely but when he did, his words resonated with profound clarity.
In 2012, he warned that democracy cannot survive too much ignorance.
He spoke not from partisanship, but from deep historical understanding.
When citizens no longer grasp how their government works, the path opens to authoritarianism.
He said, ``That is the way democracy dies... an ignorant people can never remain a free people.''
Those words echo even louder today, when civic trust is fraying, institutions are under siege, and loud voices offer simple answers to complex problems.
This is not a moment for cynicism or despair.
But neither is it a time for complacency.
Justice Souter's warning was not about left or right.
It was about whether we choose understanding over manipulation, engagement over apathy.
Let us honor his legacy by committing ourselves anew to the serious work of fostering a democracy of, by, and for the people.
