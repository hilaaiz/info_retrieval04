I am glad to see the Government starting to tackle some of these issues.
Will the Minister assure me that people on freehold housing estates with covenant issues in places like Basildon and Billericay will also be included  in any legislation?
They often face service charge increases of tens of per cent every single year, and they need that same assurance being provided to leaseholders that the Government will think about that and take action.
I assure the right hon.
Gentleman that the Government are thinking about the plight of residential freeholders alongside leaseholders.
As I just said, we will consult this year on implementing the provisions in the 2024 Act, which provides those residential freeholders with new consumer protection provisions.
They will have that immediate safety to come in, as we look at how we reduce the prevalence of such arrangements in the longer term.
Leaseholders at South View on Upperton Road in Eastbourne face an extortionate bill of up to £40,000 each to repair unsafe balconies.
The communication from Morgans and Stredder Pearce, who are both responsible for fixing that, has been woeful, and delays are leading to costs spiralling further.
Will the Minister urge those organisations to improve the speed and responsiveness of their communications to protect South View’s leaseholders from further costs?
