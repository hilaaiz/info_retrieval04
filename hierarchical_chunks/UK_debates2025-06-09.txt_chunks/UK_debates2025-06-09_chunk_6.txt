I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point, and I would like further information on that case.
The Government recognise the considerable financial strain that rising service charges place on leaseholders and tenants.
Overcharging through service charges is completely unacceptable.
We intend to consult in the very near future on the measures in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 designed to drive up the transparency of service charges to make them more easily challengeable if leaseholders consider them to be unreasonable.
