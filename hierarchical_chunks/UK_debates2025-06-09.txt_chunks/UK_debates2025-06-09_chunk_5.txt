I thank the Minister for his positive engagement with me on the issue of a safe crossing at roads on the Wynyard and Queensgate estates in my constituency, but can I also bring to his attention the issue of service charges at the Willow Sage Court estate?
Does he agree that our leasehold reforms must ensure fair service charges?
I can send him further information about this case if he wishes.
