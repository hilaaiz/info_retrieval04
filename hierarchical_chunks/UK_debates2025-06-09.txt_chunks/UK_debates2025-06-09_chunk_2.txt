I thank all the campaigners, citizen scientists and volunteers with whom I have been working throughout my campaign to restore the Pang.
I also thank the ARC project, the Rivers Trust, the Angling Trust, Pang Valley Flood Forum and Berks, Bucks and Oxon Wildlife Trust, as well as all members of the Pang Flagship Chalk Stream Partnership, which supports a range of initiatives to restore the Pang.
They are all dedicated advocates whose restoration efforts are making a real difference.
Chalk streams are rare and valuable habitats.
Their mineral-rich, stable waters are home to a plethora of species.
