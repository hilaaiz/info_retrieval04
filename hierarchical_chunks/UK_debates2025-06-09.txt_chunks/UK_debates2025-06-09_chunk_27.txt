I thank the shadow Secretary of State for the constructive way in which he has approached this issue.
We all remember what happened at Grenfell and the work that the previous Government did, and we are continuing that work, as outlined in phase 2 of the recommendations.
The buildings Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham North and Kimberley (Alex Norris)  has been meeting—as I have—members of the community, RBKC and others to make sure we continue on that journey.
I hesitate to say, though, that the previous Government made a lot of promises that are challenging.
We will always put safety first, and we are working to ensure that we deliver on that.
