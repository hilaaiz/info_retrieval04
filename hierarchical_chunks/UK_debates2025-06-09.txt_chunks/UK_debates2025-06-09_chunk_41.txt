I thank my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith)  for securing this very important urgent question.
Question after question, and letter after letter, the Government have consistently treated Parliament with complete disregard on this matter.
They have stonewalled legitimate inquiries about national security, ministerial discussions and warnings from security bodies.
I get that the Minister is compromised, in that he has a quasi-judicial responsibility here, but his colleagues in the Home Office and the Foreign Office do not, and they could answer these questions.
