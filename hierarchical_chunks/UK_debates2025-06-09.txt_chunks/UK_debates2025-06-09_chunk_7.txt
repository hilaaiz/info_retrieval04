I congratulate the Government on the bold action they are taking to end the feudal leasehold system for good, which will ensure that future flat owners will never again be treated as second-class homeowners.
But as the Minister is well aware, there are millions of existing leaseholders, including thousands in my constituency of Hendon.
Will he update the House on the work the Department is doing, building on the path forward outlined in the commonhold White Paper, to strengthen protections for existing leaseholders, including on the conversion of leaseholds, ground rents and right to manage?
The Government remain committed to providing existing leaseholders with greater rights, powers and protections over their homes.
We commenced the right-to-manage measures contained in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 on  3 March .
We remain firmly committed to tackling unregulated and unaffordable ground rents, and we will deliver that in legislation.
We will set out further detail on our proposed approach to enabling the conversion of existing leaseholds to commonhold in our draft leasehold and commonhold reform Bill later this year.
Inflation-busting estate management fees for little or no service plague residents across the country, including those of the Brackenleigh, Greymoor Meadows and Denton Mill estates in my Carlisle constituency.
What assurances can the Minister give my constituents and those of other hon.
Members that the Government’s actions will curb those atrocious practices by estate management companies?
