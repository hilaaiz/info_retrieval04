I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that point; I recognise that many hon.
Members across the House are affected by this issue.
The Government remain committed to protecting residential freeholders on private and mixed tenure housing estates from unfair charges.
We will consult this year on implementing the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act’s new consumer protection provisions for the millions of homes subject to the charges affecting my hon.
Friend’s constituents, and we will bring measures into force as quickly as possible thereafter.
