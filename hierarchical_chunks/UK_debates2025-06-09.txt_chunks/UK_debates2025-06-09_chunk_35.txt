I welcome the enhanced protections for tenants in the Renters’ Rights Bill, but data from The Londoner shows that for London tenants, there is only one enforcement officer per 7,500 private rented homes.
Given the new enforcement burdens that the Bill places on councils, will the Minister please ensure that they have the resources to protect private tenants?
