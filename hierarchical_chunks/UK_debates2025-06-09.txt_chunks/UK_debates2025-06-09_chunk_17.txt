I welcome the Minister’s commitment to supporting skills training in the construction sector.
Does he agree that skills training needs to be particularly focused on the sustainable skills, and will he join me in congratulating the low-carbon technology training centre in my constituency, as well as the new university in Hereford—its first cohort of engineers graduated just last month?
Does he welcome such initiatives, and will the Government put more funding into supporting the construction and engineering skills that our building sector will need?
