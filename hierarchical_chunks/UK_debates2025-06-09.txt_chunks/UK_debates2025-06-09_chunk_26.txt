As the Secretary of State has said, Saturday marks the eighth anniversary of the Grenfell tragedy.
As she knows, I can confirm to her that I will work constructively with her and her colleagues to deliver remediation, building safety and the best outcomes for local communities.
The previous Government committed over £5 billion for remediation; will the Secretary of State confirm that the spending review will continue to provide such financial support?
Will she also confirm that she will meet the previous Government’s pledge to co-fund with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea the renovation of the Lancaster West estate, and that the £85 million from central Government needed and promised to finish the works will be provided?
