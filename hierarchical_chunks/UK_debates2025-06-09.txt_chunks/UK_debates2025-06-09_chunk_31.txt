I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the opportunity to talk about community ownership of those locally loved assets.
We know such places endure during difficult times; they provide good employment for local people and they normally employ a more diverse workforce base.
We were pleased in the previous round to get money out to a number of schemes through the community ownership fund.
We will legislate for an improved community right to buy, too.
We are very much aligned in this space on the exceptional importance of community ownership.
