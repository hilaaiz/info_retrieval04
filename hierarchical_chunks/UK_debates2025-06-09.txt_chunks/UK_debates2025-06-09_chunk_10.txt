I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that case.
I recognise the problem that he alludes to.
We want to bring in as soon as possible measures to standardise service charges in particular and make them more transparent.
I wonder if he might write to me and the Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham North and Kimberley (Alex Norris) , who is responsible for building safety, with details of that case so that we can look into it further.
