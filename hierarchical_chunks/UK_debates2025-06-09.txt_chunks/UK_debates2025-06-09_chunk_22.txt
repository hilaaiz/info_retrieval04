I thank my hon.
Friend for her work in championing those issues.
We are fundamentally reforming how we assess councils’ relative needs and resources, to ensure that funding is distributed to where it is needed most.
That includes accounting for councils’ ability to raise resources locally, which the previous Government promised to do but ultimately failed to do in balancing the numbers.
Targeting funding in that way will enable councils that have had to scale back services the most to be able to catch up and to ensure that everybody, across the whole of England, is able to access decent public services.
