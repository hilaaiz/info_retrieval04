The right hon.
Member mentioned cables, but it would not be appropriate to comment on any specific national security issue.
On whether the Chinese embassy issue was raised during UK-US trade talks, again it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of those talks.
Suffice it to say that we do not recognise the characterisation set out in The Sunday Times article, in which that was referenced.
It is important to emphasise that only material planning considerations can be taken into account in determining this case.
As I say, I cannot comment in any detail on such a case, and this case is not yet before the Department.
I understand that the Minister cannot comment on this case, or any individual case, but national security is of the utmost concern to everybody in this country and in this Chamber.
When an application comes before the Secretary of State, and in granting applications from foreign Governments, will national security be a material concern for the Government?
