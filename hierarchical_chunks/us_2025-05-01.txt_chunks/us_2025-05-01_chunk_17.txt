Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
I am pleased to announce that Jayden Saxton of Fort Jennings, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.
Jayden's offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Naval Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one serve our country but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
Jayden brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Ottoville High School, he participated in student government, FCCLA, National Honor Society, and was on the honor role.
Throughout high school, Jayden was involved in soccer, earning his varsity letter and becoming team captain.
I am confident that he will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Naval Academy.
