Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
I am pleased to announce that Christian Soltis of North Ridgeville, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Christian's offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
Christian brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Elyria Catholic High School, he participated in National Honor Society, National Society of High School Scholars, Buckeye Boys State, and was on the honor roll.
Throughout high school, Christian was involved in football, wrestling, and track and field, earning his varsity letter in all three.
I am confident that he will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Air Force Academy.
