Mr. McGARVEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Christina ``Elise'' Wobbe, a vibrant and talented individual who touched the lives of many through her passion for the performing arts and her kindness.
Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Elise's journey was marked by dedication, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to her craft.
From a young age, Elise immersed herself in the world of dance, singing, and acting.
Her early start in dance paved the way for a lifelong love of performance.
She showcased her talents at the Youth Performing Arts School (YPAS) at duPont Manual High School, where she graduated in 2024.
Elise's excellence was further recognized when she attended the Governor's School for the Arts in 2022, specializing in musical theater.
Continuing her artistic journey, Elise enrolled at Syracuse University as a first-year musical theater major.
Her commitment to excellence earned her a place on the Fall 2024 Dean's List.
She actively contributed to the university's theater community, serving on the production staff and costume crew for the Department of Drama's production of ``Pippin.''
Elise's unexpected passing on February 14, 2025, in Syracuse, New York, was a profound loss to all who knew her.
Her warmth and genuine nature left an indelible mark on those around her.
Her family fondly remembers her ability to light up any room and her knack for turning strangers into friends.
They expressed, ``She lived her dream each and every day with exuberance, determination, and genuine kindness.''
In recognition of her impact and to honor her legacy, the family has established the Elise Wobbe Scholarship.
This scholarship aims to support a YPAS senior pursuing a career in the performing arts, ensuring that Elise's passion continues to inspire future generations.
Elise Wobbe's legacy is one of passion, kindness, and artistic brilliance.
Her spirit continues to inspire, reminding us of the profound impact one individual can have on their community.
