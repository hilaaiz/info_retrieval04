Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating John Paul Gray on his offer of appointment to the United States Military Academy.
Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available, and I am positive that John Paul will excel during his career at the Military Academy.
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation.
