Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to pay special tribute to an outstanding student from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
I am pleased to announce that William Sikora of Avon, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.
William's offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
William brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Avon High School, he received the College Board National Hispanic Recognition Academic Achievement Award, the AP Scholar with Distinction Award, attended Buckeye Boys State, and was on the honor role.
Throughout high school, William was involved in wrestling, earning wrestler of the week.
I am confident that he will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
