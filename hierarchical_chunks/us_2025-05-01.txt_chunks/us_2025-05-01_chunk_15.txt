Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Christian Soltis on his offer of appointment to the United States Air Force Academy.
Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available, and I am positive that Christian will excel during his career at the Air Force Academy.
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins her service to our Nation.
