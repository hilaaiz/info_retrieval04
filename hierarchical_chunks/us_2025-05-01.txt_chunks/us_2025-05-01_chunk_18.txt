Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Jayden Saxton on his offer of appointment to the United States Naval Academy.
Our service academies offer the finest military training and education available, and I am positive that Jayden will excel during his career at the Naval Academy.
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their best wishes to him as he begins his service to our Nation.
