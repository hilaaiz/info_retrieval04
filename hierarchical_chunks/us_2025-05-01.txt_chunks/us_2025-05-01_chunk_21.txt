John Paul Gray of Findlay, Ohio, has been offered an appointment to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.
John Paul's offer of appointment permits him to attend the United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming Class of 2029.
Attending one of our Nation's military academies not only offers the opportunity to serve our country but also guarantees a world-class education while undertaking one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of their lives.
John Paul brings a tremendous amount of leadership, service, and dedication to the incoming Class of 2029.
While attending Findlay High School, he participated in Gliding Stars Ice Skating, Buckeye Boys State, High School Business club, and was on the honor role.
Throughout high school, John Paul was involved in track and field and cross country, earning his varsity letter in both.
I am confident that he will carry the lessons of his student and athletic leadership to the Military Academy.
