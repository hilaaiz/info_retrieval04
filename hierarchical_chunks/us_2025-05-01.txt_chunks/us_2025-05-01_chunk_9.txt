Mr. JOYCE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Gettysburg Borough Master Patrol Officer Dennis P. Bevenour, who retired after serving the community with distinction for over 16 years.
Officer Bevenour joined the Gettysburg Police Department as a Patrolman in September 2008 and was promoted to Criminal Investigator, Intelligence Officer and Master Patrol Officer.
He entered law enforcement after a 27-year career in the United States Air Force.
His impressive record of public service also includes roles as a volunteer firefighter and Probation and Parole Officer.
Officer Bevenour was widely respected by colleagues and supervisors for his expertise in criminal investigations.
He was instrumental in securing grant funding to enhance the security of the borough building and to upgrade the police department's records management system.
Throughout the Borough of Gettysburg and beyond, Officer Bevenour's legacy of dedication, professionalism and community service will be forever respected and appreciated.
On behalf of everyone in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I express gratitude to Officer Bevenour for an extraordinary record of military and public service and offer fond wishes for joy and contentment in retirement.
