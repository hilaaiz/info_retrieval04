Mr. HIGGINS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Louisiana State 
Representative Kimberly Coates for her efforts to pass HB 467, a bill expanding access to Fresh Natural Milk.
Louisiana's unfounded prohibition on natural milk was primarily a consequence of Federal interference.
Despite fresh natural milk's benefits, the FDA holds that only pasteurized dairy should be consumed.
Requiring the dairy industry to abide by this standard ensures the destruction of natural milk's holistic composition.
HB 467 legalizes the sale of natural milk and dairy products, reinstating freedom of choice to Louisiana consumers, and providing millions of Americans with access to an uncorrupted source of nutrients and health.
In its natural state, fresh milk is a nearly perfect food.
Hundreds of studies have confirmed a connection between pasteurization and lactose intolerance, concluding that pasteurized milk's molecular decomposition allows it to seep through the gut, resulting in various health afflictions.
Fresh, natural milk that has forgone pasteurization retains self-contained enzymes, facilitating its digestion and conferment of health.
Accordingly, 
Representative Coates' ``Fresh Natural Milk Bill'' will provide millions of Louisianans with a previously unrealized ability to consume dairy.
