Mr. Brown's deployment to Europe during World War II, nothing could keep these two from their eventual marriage on October 26, 1946.
Blessed to grow up in a large and loving family, Mary knew that was what she wanted for her and Miley.
They went on to have seven children--Jackie, Ethel, Miley Jr., Wanda Annette, Herbert, Marilyn, Murray Lee, and Emma Jane.
Mary also raised Sean, her grandson, as her own.
Being believers and people of faith, Mary and Miley prioritized keeping their family rooted in the Word.
They brought their children up in the St. James Missionary Baptist Church, where they were spiritually and emotionally nurtured through Sunday School and weekly church services.
Additionally, Mary kept busy with church duties, singing in the choir and cooking for various church events, whether that be for anniversaries, church unions, funerals, or whenever else she was called upon.
However, with sunshine there must come rain.
Mary's heart became overwhelmed with sadness when Miley passed away on December 23, 2001.
With that said, nothing could keep Mary from bringing goodness to all she met with and joy to those around her.
She now lives in Fairburn, Georgia, where she lives with her youngest daughter, Marilyn.
Mary embodies what it means to be a righteous person of faith.
She has lived several lifetimes in her 100 years on this planet and witnessed numerous changes in our nation throughout the years.
Despite this, she never stopped being who she was, and loved all who crossed her path.
``Do unto others as you would have them done unto you''--this is the golden rule 
Mrs. Bishop-Brown stood by.
I hope that we can all learn from her example as we celebrate her long, continued life.
May God continue to bless 
Mrs. Mary Louise Bishop-Brown.
