Equipped with the skills she garnered from her Aviation Operation Aircraft Technology and Systems Maintenance Technology degrees, Laura McKee provided vital assistance to the Iraqi and Enduring Freedom Operations.
Her service in combating authoritative beliefs, insurgency, and securing a free world is admirable.
The experiences she collected while deployed not only fueled her aspirations to support a free, just world, but broadened her scope of how she can best support the peers that came before and after her as military personnel.
Today, she is among Indiana's champions for women veterans, and she strives to increase veteran education and access to federal and state benefits and resources.
Having recently been named Indiana's first Women's Veteran's Coordinator for Indiana Veterans Affairs, I am confident her recent appointment will continue to create a positive impact for all veteran women.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Laura McKee as we celebrate her legacy of outstanding accomplishments and advocacy.
