Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to present Laura McKee, Assistant Chief Inflight Refueler and member of the 72nd Air Refueling Squadron, with the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Hero Award for this month of June.
Inspired by its namesake, this award was created to highlight exemplary Hoosier women veterans whose service to their community, country, and nation is unparalleled.
Called to be a freedom fighter, Laura McKee worked to proudly serve her country by acquiring a bachelor's certificate from Indiana University and two associates degrees from the Community College of the Air Force.
