Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Rhys Taylor Frost, president of the Donora Fire Company, who sadly passed away on June 24, 2024.
Rhys was born and raised in Donora, Pennsylvania.
He had a passion for his local community and always wanted to be a first responder to help those in need.
At only 14 years old, Rhys became a volunteer firefighter at the Donora Fire Company and later became an emergency medical technician (EMT) in 2018.
Through his determination and selfless work ethic, he became president of the company a year later in 2019.
Rhys never stopped finding ways to serve southwestern Pennsylvania and always answered the call of duty.
It was his dream to simultaneously serve as a policeman, EMT, and firefighter, a testament to his desire to protect and defend his community.
Those who knew Rhys best will never forget his infinite selflessness and his eternal love for Donora.
As the community comes together to celebrate his life and legacy, I am grateful for his vast impact on our commonwealth and his fellow Pennsylvanians.
