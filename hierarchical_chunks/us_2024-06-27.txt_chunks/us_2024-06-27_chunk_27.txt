Mr. Eunice also led the development of benchmarked intergovernmental service agreements, partnering with Lowndes County on the operation of the base water and wastewater treatment plants, a shared-use golf course, and municipal services agreements.
His efforts led to the first Defense Community Infrastructure Program project in the State of Georgia, contributing to the 23d Wing and Lowndes County being awarded the 2023 Air Force Community Partnership award.
I am honored to represent distinguished public servants and veterans like 
Mr. John Eunice.
I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.
