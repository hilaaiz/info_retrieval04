Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Colonel Mixon on his appointment as Garrison Commander.
Colonel K. ``Chad'' Mixon began his military career in 1993 as an enlisted infantryman at Fort Bragg, NC.
Now known as Fort Liberty, it is the home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces and is the world's largest military installation.
Colonel Mixon's more than 30year career in the United States Army includes commissions within North Carolina and would extend to positions at both Fort McPherson, Georgia, and Fort Polk, Louisiana.
I am honored to recognize Colonel Mixon's accomplishments and am forever grateful for the service of the men and women throughout the United States Armed Forces.
Colonel Mixon would return to Fort Liberty, North Carolina in April of 2010 as a Supply and Services Troop Commander, Squadron Operations Officer and Squadron Executive Officer in the U.S. Army Special Operations Command.
He served as Logistics Operations Officer in the Deputy Chief of Staff at Headquarters, Forces Command and would be appointed as the 307th BSB Battalion Commander in 2016 before transitioning to the Joint Special Operations Command as the J4 Chief.
Over the course of 12 years Colonel Mixon would deploy in seven overseas operations including three deployments in Iraq and two in Kuwait.
Colonel Mixon has been extensively decorated and awarded for his military contributions.
His diverse military endeavors extend to the Carolinas Collegiate Institutes, serving as a Transportation Officer through the Campbell University Army ROTC Program as well as a Professor of Military Science at the University.
Colonel Mixon's devotion to his country and our great state is beyond admirable and is accomplished through the support of his wife, Charlotte, and two sons, Chase and Cole.
His appointment is well deserved, and I look forward to celebrating his future success.
