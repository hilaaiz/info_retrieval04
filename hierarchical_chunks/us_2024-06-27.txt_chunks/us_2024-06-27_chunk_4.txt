Foundation for Youth's Chinatown Community Cultural Center.
Since opening its doors in 1972, the East Wind Foundation for Youth has been committed to empowering young Angelenos to become the next generation of global leaders.
Headquartered in Chinatown, this nonprofit equips young people with the skills they need to cultivate an inclusive community that brings families, friends and neighbors together while honoring their Chinese culture.
The East Wind Foundation for Youth hosts countless cultural programs throughout the year, such as their annual essay writing contest, lion dance performances, martial art training and community service.
Through these opportunities, young people are encouraged to think critically, build up their self-confidence and create lasting friendships while celebrating their shared Chinese heritage.
While the foundation's programming is aimed at uplifting students, its impacts reverberate throughout our Los Angeles neighborhoods, improving the lives of families and entire communities.
By providing creative and academic outlets for students, the foundation is reducing the likelihood that young people engage in gang violence, and is thus promoting safer neighborhoods.
The grand opening of the Chinatown Community Cultural Center allows the non-profit to further expand its arts and educational services to constituents of California's 34th Congressional District, with a focus on the history of Chinese Americans in Los Angeles as well as the history of the organization.
