Representative Coates work, guiding HB 467 through both chambers of the Louisiana State Legislature, is to be commended.
Her bill passed the Louisiana House of Representatives in a 96-1 vote and through the Louisiana State Senate in a 32-3 vote.
These wide margins of support reflect 
Representative Coates' determination and skill as a legislator.
