Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pleasanton Unified School District Superintendent David Haglund on his retirement after seven years of service with the Pleasanton Unified School District on Thursday, August 1, 2024.
A native of Southern California, David received his Bachelors degree from Hope International University in 1985.
He immediately took his talents to the classroom and began teaching for ten years.
He then returned to school to receive his Master's degree in Educational Leadership from California Baptist University and a Doctorate in urban school leadership from the University.
David began his career in school administration by serving the Riverside Unified School District in various leadership roles for 15 years.
When he began his tenure with Pleasanton Unified School District, David immediately addressed some of the district's most pressing issues.
He stewarded a $270 million bond measure for school facility upgrades and fiercely advocated for several other policies and measures that improved student performance and experience.
David states that his favorite moments of each school year are the fist day of school and graduation, because they provide him the opportunity to tell every student how proud he is of them.
From his experience in the classroom to leading an entire school district, David has firsthand experience in every aspect of the educational process.
He has demonstrated a level of connection with students, staff, and community members that every educator should strive for.
His commitment to improving the learning environment of every student and staff member will be evident long after his retirement.
I thank David for his exceptional educational leadership at the Pleasanton Unified School District for seven years.
His cheerful presence and creative thinking will be deeply missed.
I wish him welldeserved rest and relaxation as he returns to Southern California to spend time with his family, including his three grandchildren.
