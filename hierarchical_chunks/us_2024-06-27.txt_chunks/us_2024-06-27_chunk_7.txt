Mr. FROST.
Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate the 20th anniversary of New Image Youth Center located in the Parramore neighborhood of Orlando.
New Image Youth Center's contributions over the past 20 years cannot be measured.
With just $5 and a game of Monopoly, the mustard seed was sown, and NIYC was born.
Founded by licensed therapist, entrepreneur, and author Dr. Shanta Barton Stubbs, her goal was to transform the narrative of the Parramore community and shift the mindset from surviving to thriving.
New Image Youth Center prides itself on being a safe haven for K-12 Orlando youth.
For the past 20 years, their dedicated staff and volunteers have equipped their youth with the tools and space to pursue their wildest dreams.
New Image provides mentorship and programming rooted in mental health counseling, academic support, social development, and more.
Their love for their kids goes beyond the call seek employment and post-secondary education.
I thank New Image Youth Center for 20 years of dedication and service.
Their contributions continue to make a profound difference in our community, and we are grateful for their support and commitment to make Central Florida a better place for all.
