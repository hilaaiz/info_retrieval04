The Liberal Democrats want to see more people in work, including those with disabilities.
Sadly, the significant blocker to those people getting into work is the appalling state of the health and social care system left behind by the Tories—to my mind, in more ways than one.
We desperately need the new Labour Government to drive forward with reforms to invest in and improve our health service.
The devil is in the detail of these proposals.
I fear what we will find as we turn over rocks over the next few days, particularly for the most vulnerable.
The Secretary of State has described the system as broken, so how will she drive significant change through the measures?
I fear that this is just tinkering around the edges when we need real culture change within the DWP and investment in our NHS.
That is absolutely essential.
I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that we need extra investment in the NHS and to overhaul the culture of the DWP, and that is precisely what we are doing.
We are investing an additional £26 billion into the NHS, an extra £172 million into the disabled facilities grant to help disabled people to live independently, and £3.7 billion into social care, which is such an important issue.
We need a decisive cultural shift in the DWP.
That is why our Get Britain Working plans include proposals to overhaul jobcentres.
We have also said today that we need to look fundamentally at our safeguarding approach.
Our Pathways to Work programme is genuinely just that.
For some people, getting out of the house is an achievement; for others, it is maybe going along to a community group, doing voluntary action or getting skills.
That is what we mean, and we will work closely not only with the NHS and social care—and my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care—but with voluntary organisations, which have such a vital role in helping people on to a pathway to success.
