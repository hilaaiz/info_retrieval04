In the recent advice for its seventh carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee highlighted the urgency of ensuring cheaper electricity so that households can transition away from gas heating.
When will the Government act to improve energy security and reduce costs for the households seeking to adopt low-carbon heating by reforming policy costs on energy bills?
As we discussed earlier, the CCC raised an important issue that we need to look at.
The key question on this so-called rebalancing is that it must be looked at in the context of understanding the principled case, while also ensuring that if we go down that or another route, we do so in a way that is fair.
That is the work that my Department is engaged on.
I have recently met a number of families who are members of the British Coal staff superannuation scheme.
While I know they will welcome the Minister’s earlier comments, as has been said, many are in their 70s and 80s, and they are keen for answers.
Could the Minister expand on her earlier comments to say more about the next steps and when my constituents might get a sense of the timeline and progress going forward?
