At the last general election, I made a promise to ex-miners in my constituency that a Labour Government would deliver justice on the MPS investment reserve fund and return it to its members.
I am delighted that at the end of last year, this Government delivered, providing a boost of more than 32% to their pensions.
However, in my constituency there are more than 600 BCSSS members, who are still really concerned about this issue, so I would welcome the Minister’s answer on that.
Can she reassure them and me that the trustees will continue to update the members of that scheme?
At the moment, there is a degree of uncertainty on what progress can be made over the coming months.
