Now that the Conservative party opposes large-scale solar, net zero and onshore wind, I am tempted to ask the Minister what he makes of that party’s new energy policy, which is to take us back to the past, rub two sticks together and hope for the best.
Instead, will he update the House on the progress of Great British Energy in delivering our clean energy mission?
I think we have rehearsed the arguments about the absolute failure of the previous Government over the past 14 years.
The Conservatives have just gone further back today.
On GB Energy, I was delighted to be in Aberdeen yesterday to join the board of GB Energy for its first board meeting.
The Bill will soon, we hope, complete its passage through Parliament.
It can then get on with delivering for the British people.
If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
Britain produces 1% of global climate emissions.
China is the world’s largest emitter, yet no UK Energy Secretary has visited it in eight years to make the case for it to do more.
That is why I have been in Beijing making the case for climate action.
Engagement, not negligence, is what fighting for Britain looks like.
On climate, as on so much else, this Government believe that Britain can only protect our national interests by engaging on the international stage.
The Bacton energy hub in my constituency is undergoing a green transition, which I support because I believe in protecting our natural environment and boosting our economy through net zero—two things the Conservatives seem to have abandoned.
Green hydrogen at Bacton needs wind power to be brought in from the coast.
Will the Secretary of State help to make that happen, and will he visit Bacton with me to see the potential for himself?
This, among many others, is a very, very important potential project and the hon.
Gentleman is right to make the case for it.
Green hydrogen is absolutely part of our energy mix in the future.
