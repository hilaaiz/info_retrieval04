I thank the Minister for her answer and for her hard work to increase payments to mineworkers and their families across the country.
After digging for coal for many years, 1,600 miners and their families have received an uplift of nearly £30 a week in my constituency of Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney.
However, progress is still needed on the staff superannuation scheme.
The trustees of that scheme confirmed to me that the average age of pension members is 76, so with time marching on, will the Minister outline the next steps to help members of the staff scheme?
