I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I can tell him that the Minister for Industry held a roundtable with a whole range of industry voices on this precise topic last week.
He is right about this issue.
There is scepticism about CCS in some parts of academia and elsewhere.
All the evidence that I have seen from the Climate Change Committee, the IPCC and others, including the International Energy Agency, is that CCS technology has a crucial role to play on something like 20% of emissions.
He is also right to say that carbon removal is the next stage of that journey, and it is something that my Department is heavily engaged in.
