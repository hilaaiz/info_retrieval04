I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He underlines the importance not just of delivering on energy projects but the wider economic benefits from building infrastructure—the kind of infrastructure that the Conservatives now oppose.
He is right that in order to deliver these projects, we need to see investment in rural communities by the Scottish Government.
We will continue to press them on those issues.
