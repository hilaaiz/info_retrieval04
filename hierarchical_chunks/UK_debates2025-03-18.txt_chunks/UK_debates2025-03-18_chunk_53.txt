I thank my hon.
Friend for her response.
We will publish the equality and poverty impact analyses alongside the spring statement.
I know that she is a lifelong champion of sick and disabled people, and she has rightly raised concerns, including through the Select Committee, of vital issues such as safeguarding.
I look forward to receiving the Select Committee’s report on that in order to learn from the evidence that it received.
Although this is a substantial package with those estimated savings, spending on working-age sickness and disability benefits will continue to rise over this Parliament.
The last forecast was that they would continue to rise by £18 billion.
As she says, these are important issues, and  we need to work to get this right to ensure that proper support is in place for people.
I genuinely look forward to working with the Select Committee to get all these proposals right.
