My hon.
Friend is a brilliant advocate for her constituency, and on this issue of manufacturing jobs.
If we look at what this Government are doing—from GB Energy to the national wealth fund and the clean industry bonus—we see that this Government are determined to ensure that we manufacture in Britain.
We care about where things are made, and we will make those good manufacturing jobs happen.
