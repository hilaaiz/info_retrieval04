Martin, a disabled resident, lives in his park home in Maidenhead.
After his boiler broke down two months ago, he has faced significant challenges.
He is unable to apply for the boiler upgrade scheme, as park homes do not get energy performance certificates, and the National Energy Foundation, which visited him three weeks ago, has still not provided him with a response.
Will the Secretary of State outline what support he can give Martin and other elderly residents without heat or hot water?
