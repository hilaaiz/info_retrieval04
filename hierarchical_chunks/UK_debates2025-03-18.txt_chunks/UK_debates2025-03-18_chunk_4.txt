The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to introduce the warm homes plan.
What steps he is taking to introduce the warm homes plan.
Our warm homes plan will upgrade up to 5 million homes with technologies such as heat pumps, solar panels and insulation, helping families to lower bills and improve their homes.
Last week we allocated £1.8 billion to local authorities and social housing providers to help low-income households and social housing tenants.
We will publish further plans following the spending review.
The warm homes plan delivers a welcome uplift in resources for domestic energy efficiency.
Failures by Governments, energy companies and local authorities over a number of years have left my constituents paying huge energy costs, with poor connectivity, failure to install smart meters or smart meters not working when they are installed, and not-fit-for-purpose electric heating systems in the Braes villages.
Does the Minister  agree that the Government must do all they can to end fuel poverty, and will he meet me to discuss how to hold accountable those who are responsible for the ongoing issues in my constituency?
My hon.
Friend raises a number of important issues.
It is about having a tough regulator in Ofgem, it is about smart meters that work, and it is about every decision the Government take seeking to tackle fuel poverty.
That is why I was incredibly pleased that we announced the extension of the warm homes discount to an extra 2.7 million families, with an extra £150 next winter to help families.
That is what this Labour Government are all about.
