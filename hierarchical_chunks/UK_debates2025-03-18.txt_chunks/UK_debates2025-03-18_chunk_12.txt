I thank my hon.
Friend for his remarks; he is right to talk about the British Coal staff superannuation scheme.
The initial focus of our work was on the mineworkers’ pension scheme, which was in our manifesto.
We had to work at pace on that commitment, and we are working with the Government Actuary’s Department on how the surplus-sharing arrangement will work going forward.
That big piece of work is under way, but my hon.
Friend is right to point to the tens of thousands of people who are in the BCSSS.
I too have met the trustees, and we are working as fast as we can through the issues associated with that scheme.
The two schemes are different—they operate in different ways—but the Government are the guarantor for both of them, and I will reconvene trustees to continue discussions with them and take this matter forward.
