I thank my hon.
Friend for his concern for his constituents.
As I said, I am very receptive to calls from BCSSS trustees.
I wrote to the Chancellor, who sent back a positive response, and we are now taking the next steps in this process.
I will be reconvening trustees to meet and talk about it again.
