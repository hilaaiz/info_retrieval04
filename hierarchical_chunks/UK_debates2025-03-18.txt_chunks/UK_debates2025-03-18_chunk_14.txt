I thank my hon.
Friend for his concern for his constituents who are in the BCSSS.
I am very receptive to the calls from BCSSS trustees.
I wrote to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury at the end of last year to begin discussions.
We have received a positive response from him, and we are now taking the next steps to move this process forward.
