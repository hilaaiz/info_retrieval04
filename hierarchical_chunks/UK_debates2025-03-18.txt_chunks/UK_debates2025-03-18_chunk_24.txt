On  6 February , the Prime Minister announced that he would “take on the blockers” and build new small modular reactors, but do those blockers include his own Government?
With essential work being delayed and paused at Sellafield, possible job losses at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and still no certainty for Sizewell C due to a general fear in the industry that the spending review will stymie the ambitions of Great British Nuclear, are the biggest blockers to new nuclear in the UK not in Labour’s Treasury?
I am not sure how many times the hon.
Member promised he would get to the final investment decision on Sizewell under the last Government—I think he and his colleagues promised that at least five times in the House—and of course it did not happen.
I gently repeat that the previous Government managed no new nuclear in 14 years, and he himself admitted that the Government had moved too slowly in getting nuclear projects off the ground.
We are working at pace, and we will deliver the result of the competition in the spring.
Sizewell C is also moving at pace, and we will have final answers in the spending review.
We are going to run on a bit because we are behind.
We have hardly got through any questions.
What steps he is taking to support workers’ rights in the renewable energy sector.
For this Government, good pay and conditions for workers and the role of trade unions must be at the heart of the renewable energy sector, because that is the only route to a fair transition.
Since we came to office, EDF Renewables has announced recognition agreements with four major trade unions.
We applaud it for its decision, and we want others to follow suit.
Through the Office for Clean Energy Jobs, we are also working with industry and trade unions to support fair pay, terms and conditions in the sector.
