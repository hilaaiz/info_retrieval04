I thank my hon.
Friend for her continued interest in this issue.
Despite significant challenges, COP29 agreed a new climate finance goal and finalised guidance on international carbon markets.
We would have liked more progress in certain areas, such as on mitigation outcomes.
We look forward to playing an important role in the run-up to COP30 in Belém, to ensure that more progress is made.
