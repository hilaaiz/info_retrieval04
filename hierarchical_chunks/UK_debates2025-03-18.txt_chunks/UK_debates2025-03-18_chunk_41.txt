The Minister may be aware that SSE is supporting more than 1,000 new homes in rural Scotland to aid energy  infrastructure development.
Does he agree that the SNP Scottish Government’s failure to get a grip on our rural housing crisis is a major barrier to infrastructure development, and will he urge SSE to expand the scheme into my constituency, where we have key projects around the communities of Killin, Lochearnhead, Tyndrum and Crianlarich?
