I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson)  for bringing the Bill before the House.
As an environmental campaigner for the past 22 years, I very much support any Bill, including my own Climate and Nature Bill—a shameless plug—that encourages the shift away from fossil fuels.
However, I do not support every measure that increases the use of renewables, which is why the sunshine Bill is so important.
