I am pleased that the Minister is developing strong new standards, which will combine Labour’s ambition to build high-quality homes in the right places and the ambition to protect our environment.
Our commitment to action will bring lower bills to my constituents.
That is sorely needed after a difficult cost of living crisis, lasting for years, which has put pressure on household bills.
In this way, we can really support our constituents.
Through our meaningful action on more sustainable renewable sources of energy, we are making a difference to our climate.
It is pretty clear that the climate crisis does not respect rhetoric, weapons or borders; it does not care how many likes you get on social media or how viral your clip goes; it responds only to action, and the action  the Government are taking gives me hope for the future.
Across my constituency, people are taking action, and doing their bit to shift us toward cleaner energy.
We must meet their ambition for a greener, sunnier and more secure future.
