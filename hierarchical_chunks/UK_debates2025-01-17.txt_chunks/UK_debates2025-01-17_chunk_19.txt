I thank  the hon.
Member for Cheltenham (Max Wilkinson)  for bringing forward this Bill, which deals with an issue that matters deeply to my constituents and to me.
This winter we have seen the devastating impact that climate change  can have on communities, and colleagues
and I have watched in horror as wildfires have spread through California and flooding has impacted my constituency and many areas across the UK.
Now, more than ever, we must find ways to weave the pursuit of clean, home-grown energy into everything we do, and solar power will make a vital contribution.
