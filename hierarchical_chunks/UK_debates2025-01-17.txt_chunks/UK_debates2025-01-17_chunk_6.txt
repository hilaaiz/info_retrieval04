I thank the hon.
Member for letting me interrupt his excellent speech, which is loaded with fantastic puns that I would be very proud of.
What discussions has he had with industry on making sure that we have the correct skills pipeline, so that we have enough installers and other people required to ensure that solar panels are installed efficiently and effectively, and to maximise the economic benefit to this country?
