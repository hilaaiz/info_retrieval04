We know that we cannot tackle the housing crisis without tackling the climate crisis.

As a member of the all-party parliamentary group on ClimateTech, which is chaired by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Exeter (Steve Race) , I was pleased to attend a recent event in Parliament, where we met start-ups working on innovative solutions to decarbonise the built environment.
The Government’s steadfast commitment to this agenda and to policies such as Great British Energy and the warm homes plan were warmly welcomed by the businesses I met.
