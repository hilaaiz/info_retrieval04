I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing the Bill to the House.
It is so important that it almost feels like a no-brainer.
Many of my residents share with me their frustration about trying to navigate the process of installing solar panels.
There are questions about which provider to go with, how it works, and all the technical details.
Does he agree that not only does the Bill have an environmental benefit, but it will—as he has started to explain—take that burden from residents and empower them?
They will benefit from lower bills without all the faff.
