I welcome the fact that the Government have already made a commitment to developing the next generation of homes with high energy standards and efficiency.
It is better for our pocket and for the planet.
Labour is clear that the crisis in our climate and in nature needs serious action.
That is why, in the election, we committed to tripling solar power by 2030.
Solar energy has an important role, and it is a part of GB Energy, which supports our mission to make our country a clean energy superpower.
We are meeting our pledges with action: we are approving solar projects that will power the equivalent of almost 400,000 homes.
I note that this Government, in just one week, has consented to more solar than the last Government installed in an entire year.
That shows the marked difference this Government are already making in an area that the whole House is clearly passionate about.
