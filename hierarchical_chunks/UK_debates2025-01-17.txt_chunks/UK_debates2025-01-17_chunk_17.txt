I thank the hon.
Member for the good points she raises, but I would like to see more solar panel installations that are motivated not by profit, but by concern for people and planet.
That is my concern about some of the very large solar installations we are seeing proposed across the country, including in my constituency of South Cotswolds.
We are rightly proud of our beautiful countryside, so a proposal for a 2,000-acre solar farm has provoked outrage and objections from nearby communities.
Some 88% of respondents to an early consultation are against the plans.
Some might say that their sacrifice is necessary for the greater good, but when I put myself in the shoes of nearby residents, I cannot agree.
