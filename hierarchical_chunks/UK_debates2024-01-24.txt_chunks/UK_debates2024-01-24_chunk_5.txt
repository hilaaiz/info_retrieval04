I join the Minister in passing on our condolences to the Secretary of State and his family on their bereavement.
I also wish everyone a happy Burns day for tomorrow.
I thank the wonderful Ayrshire musicians in the Public Gallery, who treated us to some entertainment last night.
Since the Government have been in power, working people have paid on average 10p on the pound more in tax.
The supposed party of low tax has created the highest tax burden on working people in 70 years, making this the biggest tax-raising Parliament since records began.
In Scotland, the SNP has looked at that tax burden and said, “Hold my beer,” as everyone earning more than £28,000 pays even more tax than they would in England.
What impact does the Minister think that historically high tax burden has on the Scottish economy?
The Government remain focused on reducing the tax burden when it is prudent to do so, but as the hon.
Gentleman identifies, we have an additional challenge in Scotland in the high tax agenda put forward by the SNP Scottish Government.
I share his concerns about the impact that that is having on the ability of the Scottish economy to perform to its full potential.
