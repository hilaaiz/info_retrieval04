I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his warm words about our emergency services and utility workers.
On his specific point about flooding, he will have heard the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is responsible for this area, comment earlier in the week that, “Flooding resilience in England is a priority for DEFRA, as part of a whole-society approach to resilience outlined in the UK Government resilience framework.”
For example, the Government are investing a record £5.2 billion in the  flood and coastal erosion risk management capital programme.
Since 2021, over £1.5 billion has so far been invested in flood defence projects across England, with over 67,000 properties better protected.
