I thank the Minister for his positive answers to the questions.
Farmers in my constituency tell me they cannot recall floods and rain quite like this; indeed, they tell me the volume of rain has been of biblical proportions.
I hail from the coastal constituency of Strangford, where storms hit with a fury that is possibly not fully grasped.
The coastline defences around Strangford loch and within my constituency have been subjected to a level of onslaught never before seen.
Can the Minister confirm what discussions he has had with the Department in Stormont, to which Westminster gave substantial financial help to address coastal erosion?
Perhaps the same level of assistance can be offered again.
