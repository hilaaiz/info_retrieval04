The Prime Minister has had quite a week—from endlessly fighting with his own MPs to collapsing in laughter when he was asked by a member of the public about NHS waiting lists—so I was glad to hear that he managed to take some time off—[Interruption.]
Order.
I wanted to hear the Prime Minister, and I am certainly going to hear the Leader of the Opposition.
Those on the Conservative Benches who do not want to hear him can certainly leave.
That is how it is going to be, so get in order.
Some of you will be wanting to catch my eye again, and that is not a good way to do it.
I love this quaint tradition where the more they slag him off behind his back, the louder they cheer him here.
More!
The same goes for those on the Labour Benches.
You can have a joint cup of tea.
I was glad to see that the Prime Minister managed to get some time off yesterday afternoon to kick back, relax and accidentally record a candid video for Nigel Farage.
The only thing missing from that punishing schedule is any sort of governing or leadership.
So was he surprised to see one of his own MPs say, “He does not get what Britain needs.
And he is not listening to what…people want.”?
The right hon.
and learned Gentleman talks about what Britain needs, what Britain wants and what Britain values—and that from the man who takes the knee, who wanted to abolish the monarchy, and who still does not know what a woman is.
Just this week, one of his Front Benchers said that they backed teaching divisive white privilege in our schools.
Looking at his record, it is crystal clear which one of us does not get Britain’s values.
