The Minister seems to think that having your pocket picked for £10 and getting £2 back is something to be grateful for.
The fact is that working people all across the country, including in Scotland, are  paying for the Tories’ crashing of the economy.
We know that the Barnett formula results in an additional £19 billion of public spending in Scotland’s economy, but last week The National reported that the SNP was being encouraged by its sister party in Wales to join the campaign to ditch the funding formula.
Sixteen years of SNP Government have left Scotland’s public finances with a £1 billion black hole.
We are in the middle of the worst cost of living crisis in generations, yet historically high taxes are already being imposed on working people to pay for it.
Losing the Barnett formula would devastate Scotland’s public finances and economy like nothing we have seen before.
Will the Minister join me in demanding that the SNP rule out the policy to bin the Barnett formula?
The biggest enemy of the Barnett formula and of devolution in Scotland is the SNP.
It wants to rip up the devolution settlement and stop the Barnett formula, which results in millions of pounds of extra investment going into Scotland each year.
The Conservative Government remain absolutely committed to devolution, the Barnett formula and more investment into Scotland.
Whether he is taking steps to promote co-operation between businesses in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The United Kingdom Government have taken action to make trade between Scotland and Northern Ireland easier.
The UK Government have also committed to providing funding to deliver targeted improvements to the A75.
That will provide better links between the Cairnryan ferry terminals serving Northern Ireland and south-west Scotland, benefiting businesses on both sides of the north channel.
