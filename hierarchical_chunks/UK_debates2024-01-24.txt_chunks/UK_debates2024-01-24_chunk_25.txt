I am glad that my hon.
Friend has such a worthy campaign to support his constituents.
I will ensure that his request for a meeting goes to the most appropriate Minister, who may be able to advise him on how possible his proposal is.
According to the NAO, since plans were first unveiled in 2020 the Environment Agency has cut by 40% its forecast of the number of additional properties that will be better protected from flooding by 2027.
In Feltham and Heston, the level of water on our streets during storms that is unable to drain away is getting higher and higher.
I have to push the Minister on this: is he confident that his plans will be sufficient to keep homes and businesses across the country safe from flood-related damage?
This is a huge and growing concern.
The hon.
Lady will have heard me say a moment ago that the NAO was pleased that the Government have taken steps to address extreme weather  as part of a whole-system approach, which can have real advantages when floods are coming.
For example, it enables appropriately trained emergency workers to be sent out to clear storm drains and ensure that anything that might make the floods worse is cleared out of the way.
She will also have heard me say that DEFRA has committed a great deal of money to improving flood defences over the past three or four years, and that tens of thousands of homes are better protected as a result.
We are not complacent, and are always looking at ways we can improve that.
