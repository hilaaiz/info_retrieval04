I welcome the Minister’s statement and the excellent work by the team at the Cabinet Office, who I know work extremely hard on these problems.
As he will know, my constituency is home to some of our most precious chalk streams and winterbournes.
I am sure that he is aware that water levels in the Bourne Valley and in villages to the west of Andover are perilously high.
He will understand the ecological importance of those rivers, and the risk of the sewage system being overwhelmed and leaking into the chalk streams.
The Environment Agency and Southern Water are doing great work.
There is a huge pumping operation under way to avoid that calamity, but further significant rainfall might overwhelm the entire system.
In his post-match analysis, once the weather calms down, will he consider giving special priority to identifying work that is required in areas of particular ecological sensitivity?
Significant work has been done up and down my constituency over the past 10 years by the flood resilience group, Southern Water, the EA, and indeed riparian owners, but more could still be done, and it needs a certain amount of concentration.
