The Minister will, like many, understand that the economic powerhouse of the United Kingdom is usually centred in the south-east of England, to the detriment of the south-west of Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Will he do more to ensure that that small 12-mile stretch of water between Scotland and Northern Ireland is bridged in business terms by greater co-operation and expansion opportunities for people on either side of it?
The hon.
Member makes an important point.
I fully recognise the strong links between south Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the potential to enhance those economic ties is great.
Improved transport links, including the A75 and ferry links, are undoubtedly part of that.
I look forward to working with him to see how we might be able to enhance and improve those links.
