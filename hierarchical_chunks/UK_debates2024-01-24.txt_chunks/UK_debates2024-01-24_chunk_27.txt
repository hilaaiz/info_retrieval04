I thank my right hon.
Friend for his observations.
As a former resident of 70 Whitehall, he understands the problems in great depth, and the chalk streams of Hampshire have no finer defender than his right honourable self.
He makes a serious point about ecological sensitivity.
It is right that we pay attention not only to the immediate threats to life or property but to our natural environment.
As we know, if we do not do so, the damage can be irreparable and long lasting.
