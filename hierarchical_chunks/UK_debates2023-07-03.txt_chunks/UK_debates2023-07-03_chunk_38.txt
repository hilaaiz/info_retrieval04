I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
I would not want to finish without mentioning that, as of  Monday 26 June , unleaded petrol is 143.43p per litre, and that has reduced, on average, by 47.5p from June last year, and diesel is 145.6p per litre, and that has reduced by 53.3p per litre on the previous year.
I will write to the hon.
Gentleman to make sure that I can properly inform him in answer to his question.
