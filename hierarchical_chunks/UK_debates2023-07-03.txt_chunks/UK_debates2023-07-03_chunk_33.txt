I thank the CMA for its report and the Government for accepting the recommendations, although I think we are putting too much faith in price transparency to solve the market problem.
I was interested to see in the trend profit margins for supermarket retailers and non-supermarket retailers that supermarkets are consistently increasing their margins while non-supermarket retailers are not.
Will the Minister follow up with retailers, in the light of this report, to make sure that we check that the margins come down next year and in the following year?
