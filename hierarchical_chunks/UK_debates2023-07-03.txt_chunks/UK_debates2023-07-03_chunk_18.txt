I thank the hon.
Gentleman for our meeting with the families a few weeks ago.
As I said to him on the phone last week, whenever he and the families are ready to have further discussions with Home Office officials, they will be ready.
The timing of that will be guided by the hon.
Gentleman.
On the substance of the Government’s reply, we have committed to doing some things straight away.
For example, the National Police Chiefs’ Council has been funded to set up an accredited training programme for firearms officers—that was one of the recommendations.
In due course that will become mandatory.
