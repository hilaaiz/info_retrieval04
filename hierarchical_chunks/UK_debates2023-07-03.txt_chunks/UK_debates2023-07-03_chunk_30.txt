In March, the RAC revealed that retailers are making a three times bigger margin on diesel than they were at the beginning of last year, and motorists are seeing absolutely no benefit from the Chancellor’s fuel duty cut.
Given the Government’s dither and delay on taking any sort of action, how does the Minister feel when the Government’s flagship policy to help motorists is having little to no impact?
We are furious that these price cuts have not been passed on to consumers.
That is why we asked the CMA to investigate and to get further into the detail, and it is why we will implement its findings in full.
As my right hon.
Friend is aware, I have been campaigning on the issue of fuel prices in west Berkshire for about a year and a half.
One thing that has been particularly disappointing is the fact that fuel prices in every single neighbouring constituency are 5% to 8% lower.
I wrote to the CMA and I am pretty disappointed to read its response today, which tells us a lot.
