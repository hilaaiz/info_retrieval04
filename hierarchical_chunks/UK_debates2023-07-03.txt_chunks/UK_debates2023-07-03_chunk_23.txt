I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He and the RAC are right to highlight the particular issue in rural communities such as those that he and, indeed, I represent, and the particular pressures on consumers there.
He will understand that rural fuel duty relief is a matter for the Chancellor and that what we need is a properly functioning market.
That is why we are implementing the findings of the CMA in full and putting in place an interim regime, starting next month.
