We want to see tougher action on things such as antisocial behaviour and public drug use; we should have zero tolerance for any of those things.
As part of the ASB strategy we are launching instant justice, whereby people who perpetrate acts of antisocial behaviour will rapidly—ideally within 48 hours—be made to do clean-ups and those kinds of things in their local area, to pay back visibly, publicly, rapidly and with enforcement.
We are trialling that in 10 police force areas, starting this month, and it will be rolled out to every police force in the country, with funding, by April next year.
I completely agree with everything my hon.
