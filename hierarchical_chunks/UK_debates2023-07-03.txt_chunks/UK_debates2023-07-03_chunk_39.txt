This report clearly shows that residents in Burnley and Padiham and our villages have been overcharged for their fuel for too long.
Does my right hon.
Friend think that the Competition and Markets Authority now needs to relook at the ownership changes at Asda?
As the Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero, that perhaps stretches slightly beyond my brief, but, as those on Treasury Bench will have heard my hon.
Friend’s question, I am sure that he will be able follow up with others who have direct responsibility.
I wish to thank the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care for coming to the Chamber to make his statement.
It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not do so on Friday when the world heard what he had to say before we did.
The Prime Minister is a Member of Parliament.
He is answerable to the Members of Parliament from all political parties.
I have to say that his behaviour was not acceptable.
He may be the Prime Minister, but the Members of Parliament should hear first.
I am very pleased that the Secretary of State is doing it the right way.
The Government note the comments that you have made from the Chair, Mr Speaker.
I would love them to take what I have said on board.
That is also noted, Mr Speaker.
May I, on behalf of the Government, note the passing of the former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake?
He had a distinguished career in public service, including as chief executive of Sheffield Council and chair of King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, as well as being head of the civil service.
We send our condolences to his family and friends both in Whitehall and across the civil service.
