I thank the Minister for his reply.
Some young people who are arrested because they are guilty of antisocial behaviour, or so-called low-level crime, are released without charge because there is a reluctance to criminalise them.
Too often, those youngsters go on to commit further multiple crimes, and are arrested and released without charge each time.
What steps will my right hon.
Friend take to end this roundabout of unpunished crime and ensure that young people who repeatedly break the law are not released without charge but are treated as what they are—criminals?
