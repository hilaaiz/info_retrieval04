You are going to be here a while yet.
Is the Home Secretary concerned by recent revelations about the investigation into the Stephen Lawrence murder and what happened in the Brink’s-Mat aftermath?
Is she concerned about some of the out-of-work organisations that our police belong to?
The recent reports on the Stephen Lawrence case are an operational matter for the police, which I cannot get involved in, nor should I. That is a judgment for the police on operational and casework decisions, within which we do not interfere.
We have a good track record on the Met turning around performance.
Mark Rowley’s turnaround plan and leadership efforts to restore confidence and rebuild trust with London are working.
We need to back him to get the best results possible in London.
There is a tweet going around regarding a man who identifies as a trans woman.
The tweet reads that the trans-identified man who “appeared in an @itvnews report about ‘mothers’ has posted an image ‘breastfeeding’ a baby.
Do you think it’s ok to mock women like this?”
I think that is a valid question, but I am also extremely concerned for the welfare of the child.
Will the Home Secretary’s Department look into that for me, please?
While we respect all the rights of those in the trans community, it is clear that biological men cannot breastfeed.
It is remarkable that we are in a position where the Labour party leader cannot define a woman.
I think he said something like 99.9% of women do not have a penis.
On that basis, we cannot rule him out from running to be Labour’s first female Prime Minister.
My constituent Sarah has been waiting more than six months for a biometric resident’s permit, during which time she cannot work, access free healthcare or leave the country.
Will someone do something to get her the status she deserves, so that she can go on with her life?
I would be happy to look into the case for the hon.
Gentleman.
The number of foreign national offenders eligible for deportation has now reached a record almost 12,000.
Almost 4,000 of those left prison more than five years ago and even those volunteering for deportation are still here.
Will the Minister get a grip on the deportation department within the Home Office and make sure those people are chucked out of our country?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
We want those individuals to leave the country as swiftly as possible.
The published figures show that FNO returns increased following the pandemic—by 14% in the latest 12-month period ending December 2022 compared with the previous 12-month period—but, quite clearly, there is more work to be done.
Liverpool is a city of sanctuary.
Currently, we have 237 Afghan families who have been languishing in a hotel for two years.
The council must rehouse the families by  11 August .
Can the Minister say what will happen if we are unable to find suitable accommodation?
Will they be made homeless and thrown out on the street?
