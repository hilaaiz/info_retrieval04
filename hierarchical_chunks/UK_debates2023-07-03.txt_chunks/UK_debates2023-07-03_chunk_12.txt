I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his work on the all-party parliamentary group, and I am sure that the Policing Minister and/or I will meet him to learn more about the vital work that he has led.
May I take the opportunity to applaud the officers of Cheshire police force in the hon.
Gentleman’s area?
I have had the pleasure of meeting the excellent chief constable, Mark Roberts.
I applaud the Conservative police and crime commissioner, John Dwyer, who has rolled out a scheme on antisocial behaviour that provides more CCTV and increases the first-responder response.
There is a record number of police officers in Cheshire, and the force has received over £3 million-worth of safer streets funding.
The results are a 26% fall in neighbourhood crime and a 17% fall in drugs offences in Cheshire.
That is common-sense policing, thanks to the police officers and Government support.
