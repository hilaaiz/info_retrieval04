I welcome the introduction of a real-time fuel price comparator, but such a tool already exists, albeit in a slightly clunky form.
I draw the Minister’s attention to the fact that it is not enough just to tell people what the prices are at different pumps in their local area.
It must be transparent to consumers whether they are in a general area that has higher or lower prices, so that their MP can make representations on what the supermarkets may be doing in that area and the CMA can intervene properly.
