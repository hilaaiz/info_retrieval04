I thank my hon.
Friend for his excellent question.
The answer is no, I cannot think of anything other than the campaigning by Councillor Steve Tuckwell and others, which forced the Mayor into a last-minute, self-interested, screeching U-turn.
I would like the Mayor to do a U-turn on all the other police stations he is threatening with closure.
