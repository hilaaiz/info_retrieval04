Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 200th anniversary of the City of Washington, Illinois, a proud and resilient community I am honored to represent.
Founded in 1825 by blacksmith William Holland, Washington began as Hollands Grove and was renamed in 1837 to honor President George Washington.
The city quickly grew, electing its first town president in 1839, officially incorporating in 1857, and reorganizing as a city in 1878 with Peter Fifer as its first mayor.
Washington holds a strong connection to Abraham Lincoln, who visited often while traveling the Tenth Judicial Circuit.
In 1857, he defended two residents accused of helping escaped slaves along the Underground Railroad, marking a powerful moment in the city's history.
Washington later gained national recognition through George Heyl's pony farm, home to champion Shetland ponies including King Larigo and Creations King.
The original barns still stand on North Main Street as a tribute to that chapter.
The city's strength was tested in 2013, when a powerful EF-4 tornado destroyed more than one thousand structures and took the lives of three residents.
In the aftermath, the people of Washington came together with courage and compassion, rebuilding stronger than ever.
Today, Washington is home to more than 16,000 residents.
The city has become a destination for visitors who annually flock to its Good Neighbor Days festival in the spring and to the quaint locally owned businesses occupying century-old buildings lining its historic downtown square.
I congratulate the City of Washington on its bicentennial and commend its citizens for carrying forward a legacy of perseverance, service, and pride.
I look forward to its continued success in the years ahead.
