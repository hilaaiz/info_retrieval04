support police and first responders in several counties throughout the First Congressional District.
The work of organizations such as Operation We Care is incredibly meaningful and important to our military and first responders.
I would like to thank 
Mr. and 
Mrs. Merritt for supporting those in our community that work to keep us safe at home and abroad.
I wish 
Mr. and 
Mrs. Merritt the best of luck in continuing their efforts to make Maryland's First Congressional District better in every way.
