Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy.
Tom Cousins was one of the most influential figures in Georgia's history, transforming Atlanta into one of the Nation's leading cities.
At just 16, he enrolled at the University of Georgia, earning a degree in finance and graduating in the top ten percent of his class.
After graduation, he served in the United States Air Force, rising to the rank.
Following his service, he founded a real estate company with his father, becoming the largest homebuilder in Georgia.
Tom later purchased key properties in downtown Atlanta and was instrumental in relocating the St. Louis Hawks to the city.
Beyond business, he led the East Lake revitalization project, turning the neighborhood into a thriving urban community.
His vision and leadership left an enduring mark on Georgia and its capital.
Today, we remember Tom Cousins for his extraordinary contributions.
