Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Judge Edmundo B. Garcia, Jr., a devoted husband, father, public servant, and community leader from San Diego, Texas.
Born in 1936, Judge Garcia dedicated his life to education and public service.
For 32 years, he served the San Diego Independent School District as a teacher and administrator, shaping the lives of countless students.
He later went on to serve as Duval County Judge from 1995 until his retirement in 2006, and again as Interim Judge in 2022, earning the respect and trust of his community.
Beyond public office, Judge Garcia was a proud U.S. Army veteran, a 4th Degree Knight of Columbus, and an active member of the San Diego Rotary Club and the Sociedad Catolica Mutualista.
His civic leadership extended to board service, including the First State Bank of San Diego, and he will be fondly remembered as ``the voice'' of the San Diego Fighting Vaqueros.
Judge Garcia's legacy is rooted in faith, family, and service.
He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Rosa Maria, his children, grandchildren, great-granddaughter, and a grateful community.
