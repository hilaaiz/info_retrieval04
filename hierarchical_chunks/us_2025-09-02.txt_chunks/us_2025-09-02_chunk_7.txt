Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Anne Matthews, the first female Vice President of Rotary International, on being awarded South Carolina's highest civilian award, The Order of the Palmetto.
Authorized by Governor Henry McMaster, The Order of the Palmetto is awarded to the State's most accomplished and esteemed individuals who make a significant contribution to a particular community.
Anne represents all that this award entails as she has devoted her life to helping those in need.
As a fellow Rotarian myself, I have witnessed Anne dedicate her life to serving the people of South Carolina and beyond in many capacities in business, Rotary International, and more.
Having degrees from Coker College, Appalachian State University, and a doctorate from the University of South Carolina, Anne also excelled in education, including as President of the National Business Education Association.
Additionally, she served as president, chair, and/or board member of numerous national and state boards, promoting and speaking across America and internationally on critical educational issues and the need to serve the less fortunate.
Anne has worked in 73 countries, championing humanitarian efforts, and promoting South Carolina values.
Notably, as chair of the Polio Eradication Advocacy Task Force for America, where we worked together with other members of Congress to raise over four billion dollars for the global fight against Polio.
Anne embodies leadership, compassion, and service.
She has achieved many accomplishments and has contributed greatly to the state.
I send my warmest congratulations and best wishes.
I am appreciative for all she has done for South Carolina.
