Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the late Larry Stokes, who passed away on July 10, 2025.
Dr. Stokes was a well-respected and beloved professor at Savannah State University.
He dedicated his life to education and influenced countless students during his tenure at the University.
Because of his unwavering commitment, Dr. Stokes will be fondly remembered for his contributions to academia.
He is also known for fostering a love of learning within his classroom and amongst students.
His life was marked by his marriage to The Honorable Judge Tammy Tokes, whom he met and married in 2002.
Their relationship is often described as a testament to love, mutual respect, and shared values.
Together, they created a loving home for their two children, Kendall and McKenzie.
Dr. Stokes also took immense pride in being a grandfather and greatly cherished the memories with his loved ones.
Today, I ask that we all take a moment to remember Dr. Stokes' legacy of knowledge, kindness, and compassion.
