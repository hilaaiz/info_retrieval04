Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, along with my wife, Vivian and the more 765,000 people of the 2nd Congressional District in honoring Wynnton Hill Baptist Church on its 164th Church Anniversary.
May the blessings of the Lord be upon Wynnton Hill Baptist Church as it continues this sacred journey to bring souls to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
