The overriding priority was, of course, Ukraine.
Last week in Jeddah, the United States and Ukraine reached a common position.
A ceasefire offer is now on the table, and American weapons and intelligence are flowing once again.
This demonstrated what this House has always known to be true: under President Zelensky’s leadership, Ukraine is serious about peace, sincere in its efforts to pursue a just and lasting end to this appalling war, and unrelenting in its determination to ensure that Ukraine remains democratic, free, strong and prosperous.
At the G7, the UK and our allies were united in our unwavering support for Ukraine’s defence of its freedoms; united in support for Ukraine’s pursuit for peace; and united on what is required to make that happen.
Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, and Putin who must choose.
Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace?
Will you stop the fighting, or will you drag your feet and play games, and pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummelling Ukraine?
My warning to Mr Putin is this: if you are serious, prove it, with a full and unconditional ceasefire now.
On whether Putin will deliver, I must tell the House that I see no sign yet that he will.
The G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously.
We are not waiting for the Kremlin.
If it rejects a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play.
We can all see the impact that the G7’s unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia’s faltering economy—social spending is down, and inflation and interest rates are sky high.
There can be no let-up in our efforts.
In Canada, we discussed where we can go further to target Russia’s energy and defence sectors, further squeeze its oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets.
