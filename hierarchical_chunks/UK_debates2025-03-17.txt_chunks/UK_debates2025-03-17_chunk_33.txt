I absolutely agree with my hon.
Friend’s point.
Does the Sentencing Council understand that, with these guidelines, it is totally out of touch with the mood of the British people, totally out of touch with the mood of the Government, and totally out of touch with the mood of the House?
And therefore, why will it not agree to delay these guidelines until they have been properly debated in this House?
To be fair, the chair of the Sentencing Council met the Lord Chancellor last week, and it was a constructive meeting.
He is awaiting a letter from the Lord Chancellor, which he promises the Sentencing Council will consider and respond to before  1 April .
As a former local authority lead for youth justice, I saw at first hand how important pre-sentencing reports can be in shaping effective and progressive outcomes in justice.
However, it cannot be right that access to them is determined by factors such as race and religion.
I applaud the Justice team for making such a strong and robust response to the Sentencing Council’s guidance so far.
Can the Minister assure me that unlike the last Government, who were clearly asleep at the wheel during the consultation, we remain willing to take whatever action is needed to uphold this important principle?
I agree with my hon.
Friend that the last Government appear to have been asleep at the wheel, rediscovering their mojo only once they were in opposition.
Last week, the Prime Minister announced that he is abolishing NHS England to make sure the NHS is brought back under democratic control.
Will the Minister be lobbying the Prime Minister to abolish the Sentencing Council to make sure sentencing is brought back under democratic control?
