With permission, I shall make a statement about last week’s meeting of G7 Foreign Ministers.
We met at a pivotal moment.
Some Members of this House may have doubted that we could find common ground, and some of our global competitors may have hoped that we would fail, but after 36 hours of talks, we were united.
Britain united with our allies to make our citizens more secure.
National security is a foundation of this Government’s plan for change, and we are leading from the front.
