The Sentencing Council is—it should not need saying—a non-political body whose guidelines are carefully drafted and widely consulted on.
These guidelines received positive responses from the Justice Committee under its previous Chair and from the previous Government.
They do not require that a pre-sentence report is ordered, they do not limit who should be the subject of such a report and they do not tie the hands of the sentencer.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that by dragging the Sentencing Council into the political arena without good cause, the shadow Justice Secretary degrades both the Sentencing Council and himself?
My hon.
Friend the Chair of the Select Committee makes a good point about the way in which the shadow Justice Secretary conducts himself.
The important thing is that the Lord Chancellor had a constructive meeting with the chair of the Sentencing Council and there is now a process in place to address this issue.
