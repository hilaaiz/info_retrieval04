I welcome the new powers in the fraud Bill, and note the huge increase in pension credit fraud in recent years.
Can the Minister explain how capital fraud and fraud in which recipients stay out of the country for longer than the rules require, which together account for 50% of all pension credit fraud, will be targeted under the new rules?
