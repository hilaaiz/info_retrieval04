My hon.
Friend is right to raise this issue.
The eligibility verification measure in the new Bill will do just that, providing a crucial data feed to help us identify fraud that relates to pension credit as well as to universal credit and employment and support allowance.
This will flag up claimants who are potentially in breach of eligibility under capital and abroad criteria, so that we can start to lower the unacceptable level of fraud and protect the public purse.
What assessment she has made of the impact of the pensions triple-lock on pensioners in North Durham constituency.
Our commitment to the triple lock throughout this Parliament means that spending on the state pension is set to rise by £31 billion a year.
Individuals are set to see increases of up to £1,900 a year, benefiting 21,000 pensioners in North Durham and 12 million people in Britain as a whole.
