Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Sam Hill and 
Mrs. Lillian Hill for their lifetime of service to their community.
Throughout their lives, Dr. and 
Mrs. Hill have dedicated their time and energy to serving their community.
Throughout their career in the field of education--Dr. Hill as the provost of Northern Virginia Community College and 
Mrs. Hill teaching students who are deaf and hard instruction that prepared them for their next steps.
Along the way, they have also volunteered with countless local organizations, donated their expertise and time as board members of various organizations, and have been involved with the Hylton Performing Arts Center since its inception.
Their commitment to service is clear and worthy of recognition.
Their devotion to the betterment of their community, and the selfless mentality they bring to their volunteer work, serves as a shining example that we all can strive to follow.
To pay tribute to Dr. and
