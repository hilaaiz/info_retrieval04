Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Household Goods Shipping Consumer Protection Act.
This bill would give the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) more authority to protect consumers from fraud in the interstate transportation of household goods.
Specifically, this bill would give FMCSA the authority to assess civil penalties against unregistered shippers and against entities that hold consumers' personal goods hostage, give FMCSA the express authority to reimburse states for enforcing federal consumer protection laws related to the transportation of household goods and establish requirements to ensure that motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders that seek registration are operating legitimate businesses.
