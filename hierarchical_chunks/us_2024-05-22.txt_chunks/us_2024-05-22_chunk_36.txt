Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Bicentennial of Lorain County, Ohio.
The perseverance of pioneers and settlers to overcome the challenges faced during the early years of the county's history has persisted throughout the past 200 years.
The hard work and spirit shown by generations of county residents have made Lorain County an outstanding example of American ingenuity.
In 1822, the Ohio Legislature enacted legislation creating Lorain County; however, the county became judicially independent in 1824.
The original proposed name for the county was ``Colerain'', but the final name ``Lorain'' was chosen by Heman Ely, who had previously founded and named the City.
The county's name is based on the former German and now French province of Lorraine and encompasses roughly 923 square miles.
The county is an asset to the great State of Ohio through its many contributions in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture.
