Mr. Ricke played a key role in negotiating national labor contracts for Ford laborers over the past twenty years, amassing gains for workers and keeping jobs from being eliminated.
He drew experience from his start as an hourly worker while keeping an eye towards the future to lead with compassion and advocate for the workers' best interests.
Please join me in recognizing the numerous and remarkable contributions of 
Mr. Bernie Ricke to Southeast Michigan, and Michigan's 12th Congressional District.
