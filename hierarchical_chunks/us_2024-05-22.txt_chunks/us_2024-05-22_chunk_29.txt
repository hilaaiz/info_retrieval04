Thanks to the tireless leadership and encouragement from the teams' coaches, staff, families, classmates, and community--these talented young men and women earned a state championship title and all of us across southern Minnesota are incredibly proud to call them our own.
Congratulations to the Mavericks on an unbelievable season.
