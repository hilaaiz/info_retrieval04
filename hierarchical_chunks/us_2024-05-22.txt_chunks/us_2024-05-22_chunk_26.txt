Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a notable constituent from my district, 
Mr. Darren Corson of Newtown, Pennsylvania who is retiring after over 40 years of dedicated service as a Public Servant.
Darren graduated from Temple University with a bachelor's degree in accounting.
After graduation, Darren made the decision to devote his career to public service and joined the Department of Treasury's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) where he remained for over 40 years.
During his career, Darren spent time working in many parts of the IRS, including Criminal Investigations Division, Exam, and Problem Resolution.
In 2000, Darren joined the Taxpayer Advocate Service after Congress ordered the creation of a Taxpayer Advocate as an independent organization within the IRS.
Since then, he has worked tirelessly to advocate for the rights of taxpayers facing individual and systemic issues.
However, after forty years of dedicated government service and leadership, Darren is retiring.
Today, I am proud to recognize Darren Corson as an individual who has devoted his career to public service in an organization that impacts all Americans across the country.
We are incredibly grateful for the impact Darren Corson has made throughout his long career at the Internal Revenue Service.
As an avid sports fan, he will enjoy spending more time rooting for the Phillies.
We are all incredibly grateful for the positive impact Darren has had through his long career, and we wish him countless blessings during his retirement.
