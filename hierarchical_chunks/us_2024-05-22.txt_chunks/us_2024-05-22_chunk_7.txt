Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the members of the Denton County leadership delegation who are visiting Washington, D.C. this week.
The Denton County Chambers come to visit every two years, and I am once again honored to host them this year.
I value these trips as they give our local leaders an insight and first-hand experience of what's happening here on the Hill.
Legislation that we work on highly affects our communities back home.
I am pleased to offer this opportunity and welcome the members of the Denton County Chambers to our Nation's Capitol.
I would like to thank them for their continued collaboration with my office in ensuring the economic prosperity of Denton County, making Texas the best place to live, work, and raise a family.
I would like to include in the Record the following names of the Denton County delegation: Lisa Carignan, Doug Carignan, Erin Carter, Lori Fickling, Nina Hernandez, Kelly Heslep, Cindi Howard, Jon Kixmiller, William Meredith, Jim Moll, Kelly Murray, Scott Murray, Claire Powell, Sally Quezada, Ingrid Rex, Ryan Schroer, Kristi Tucker, Elliott Tucker, Ben Utley, Lori Walker, Neal Walker, and Charlotte Wilcox.
