with addresses where no legitimate operations take place, often designating their official address as a retail package store, vacant parking lot or business address unrelated to the registered entity.
FMCSA already requires motor carriers to designate a principal place of business and disclose common ownership.
However, FMCSA may only take enforcement action after the entity is already registered and refuses to cooperate with investigations at the designated address.
This bill would also permit states to use Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program and High Priority program funding to conduct commercial regulatory and consumer protection standard reviews and enforcement actions against household goods motor carriers, brokers and freight forwarders.
It would also clarify that states may retain the penalties and fines imposed in proceedings relating to violations of household goods statutes and regulations.
These provisions would support states in their efforts to protect the American people from predatory practices.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
