Mr. RUPPERSBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I had to miss yesterday's vote due to being stuck in traffic.
During that time, I was unable to make Roll Call vote No. 219.
Had I been present, I would have voted in the following manner:
YEA on Roll Call No. 219, On Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as Amended, the Federal Disaster Tax Relief Act.
