Mr. Green's artistry in lyrics served as a rallying cry for social change and inspired a generation of writers to utilize music as a tool for organizing and activism.
Mr. Green's albums are a part of the Smithsonian Institution's Folkways Collection.
His musical significance and impact as a musician were recognized when the late Pete Seegar said, ``There should be a ballad.''
In turmoil times, where speaking out on social issues was frowned upon, 
Mr. Green continued to press forward.
He is a true trailblazer, performing music of inclusive and transformative lyrics, at civil rights, labor, antiwar, and LGBTQ+ movements.
I am honored to congratulate 
Mr. Green for his successful contributions to both the art and social movements.
I am confident that he will continue his life path of exceptional work.
