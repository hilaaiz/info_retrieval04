Representative Mike Ezell is co-leading this bill with me.
FMCSA receives thousands of complaints every year from Americans who are the victims of fraud in the shipment of household goods.
Fraudsters have launched moving companies with fake 5-star online reviews to draw in customers, intending to overcharge customers or to hold their personal goods hostage until an additional fee is paid.
After receiving negative reviews, fraudsters open a new moving company under a new name and a new FMCSA license.
FMCSA lacks the authority to prevent and punish these types of fraud.
In 2019, a Department of Transportation Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ruled that FMCSA lacks authority to assess civil penalties for violations of commercial regulations and registration requirements, including unauthorized brokerage and for failure to return household goods to consumers.
Under current law, as interpreted by the ALJ's decision and final agency order, FMCSA may not assess civil penalties for violations of commercial regulations.
Instead, the Department of Justice must initiate an action in federal court.
This bill would reverse the ALJ's decision and provide explicit authority for FMCSA to adjudicate and assess civil penalties for unfair business practices and consumer protection violations, as well as give FMCSA authority to enforce roadway safety regulations against fraudsters.
This bill would also provide explicit authority to FMCSA to withhold registration from any applicant that fails to provide a valid principal place of business or disclose common ownership with any other registered entities at the time of registration.
