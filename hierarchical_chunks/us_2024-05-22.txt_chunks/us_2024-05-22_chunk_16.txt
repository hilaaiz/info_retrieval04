Mr. FINSTAD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Ken Axelson; a World War II veteran and cherished member of the Wanamingo community, who passed away on April 11th, just a week after celebrating his 100th birthday.
Ken graduated from Red Wing High School in 1943, and afterwards--like many in the Greatest Generation--he answered the call to serve his country.
As a combat medic for the U.S. Army, Ken landed on Omaha Beach on DDay, and was later transferred to the 101st Airborne Division.
During the Siege of Bastogne, he and his unit were held captive by German forces for five months before they were liberated by U.S. troops.
When he returned home from the war, Ken married his wife, Billie, and raised their six children in Wanamingo, where Ken was active in the community, working as a carpenter, building inspector, and photographer.
When he wasn't doing what he loved--spending time outdoors--Ken was giving back to those around him.
He served on the Wanamingo City Council, while also giving his time to the volunteer fire department and the Wanamingo VFW.
Ken was a true embodiment of who we are in southern Minnesota.
He served his country, put his family first, and was never too busy to lend a hand to a fellow neighbor.
He leaves behind a legacy that will long be remembered.
May he rest in peace.
