I welcome the five new defence technical excellence colleges just announced, but we need a skills pathway right across the country.
I have been working with ADS on a defence curriculum that could be delivered across colleges and universities nationwide.
What plans does the Minister have to support defence learning right across the country, and will he meet me and ADS to see if we can roll out a trial?
