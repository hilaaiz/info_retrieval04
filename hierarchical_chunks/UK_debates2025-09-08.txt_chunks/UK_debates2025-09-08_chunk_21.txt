I thank my hon.
Friend for making that important point.
The cadet forces are an inclusive organisation, and I have been delighted to be able to visit branches throughout the country, for instance in Cornwall.
A couple of weeks ago I visited a summer camp to observe the diversity of the cadets, which, in some cases, is far better than it is in the armed forces.
Currently, 36% of community-based and 39% of school-based cadets are female.
That is a positive, important and encouraging trend, and I hope that it will continue over time.
