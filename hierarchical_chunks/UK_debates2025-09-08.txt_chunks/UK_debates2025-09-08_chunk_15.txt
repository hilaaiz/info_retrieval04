I welcome the Minister to her place.
Over the past year I have had the privilege of taking part in the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and have met people across the United Kingdom and beyond.
One of the issues that arises when it comes to retention is that of the families of overseas workers in the armed forces.
They have no access to work opportunities, and there are no specific visas or agreements with other countries where our armed forces are based, which means that they must often take pay cuts or not relocate with their partners in the forces.
Will the Minister think about what we can do to support armed forces workers overseas?
