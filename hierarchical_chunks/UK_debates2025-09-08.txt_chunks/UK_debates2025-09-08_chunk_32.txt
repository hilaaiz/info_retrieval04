I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his continuing championing of not just defence businesses in his constituency, but defence in total.
The amount of parliamentary questions I have answered from him certainly shows his strong interest in this area.
I want more of our defence budget focused on novel and innovative technologies.
That is what we announced in the strategic defence review, with 10% going to those advanced technologies.
There is a real opportunity to create more jobs that provide the world-leading innovation that will give us the edge on the battlefield, because the nation that innovates the most will be the nation that wins in any conflict.
I would be very happy to discuss that further with him.
