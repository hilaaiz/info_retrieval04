The Prime Minister has made tackling small boats and closing every asylum hotel a priority.
Last week, I met ministerial colleagues from across Government to discuss how Defence will contribute to that work.
We have deployed a military planning team to assist the Border Security Command and the Home Office, looking at military and non-military sites for temporary but adequate housing so that we can accelerate closing asylum hotels.
The safety and security of my constituents is my No. 1 priority.
Given the national security risk posed by some of those who cross the English channel illegally, I ask the Minister to look again at using military assets to physically stop those small boats from landing in the first place.
Will he do that today?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and I share his passion for keeping our country safe.
I refer him to the work of Operation Isotrope, a military operation undertaken by the last Conservative Government that put the Navy in charge of securing the English channel.
That operation concluded that naval assets were not suitable for that task; it is already a dangerous crossing, and it concluded that military assets only made it more dangerous.
That is why the armed forces are now assisting the Home Office and the Border Security Command, looking at how we can provide the accommodation that will enable us to close the asylum hotels, as well as how we can speed up the processing of asylum applications—something the Government that the hon.
Gentleman backed shamefully stopped when they were in power.
There is a lot of work to do, but we are making progress.
