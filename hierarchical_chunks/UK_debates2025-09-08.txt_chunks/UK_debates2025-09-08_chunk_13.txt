I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for his question.
The Ministry of Defence is part of the cross-Government response to small boats.
We are stepping up our support to assist our colleagues in the Home Office.
The Home Office remains the lead Department, but as every Department can contribute something to this effort, it is right that the Ministry of Defence does so.
We continue to protect the nation and deliver the changes as laid out in the strategic defence review.
Our No. 1 priority remains to keep this country safe.
