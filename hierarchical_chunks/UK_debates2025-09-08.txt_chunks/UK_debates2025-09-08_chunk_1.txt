Before we begin today’s business, I wish to inform the House that during the summer recess I had the honour of attending the sixth World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in close collaboration with the United Nations.
The conference brought together 100 Speakers from around the world to discuss the vital role that Parliaments play in strengthening global governance and bridging the democracy gap in international affairs.
A key theme was the urgent need to restore public trust in democracy and its core institutions.
Following my time in the Chair on Thursday, I travelled to Ottawa to participate in the 23rd meeting of Speakers of the G7 countries, hosted by the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons.
The summit focused on the shared challenges facing democratic systems, including the rise of disinformation and increasing political polarisation.
It was a valuable opportunity to exchange perspectives and explore collaborative approaches to safeguarding democratic values.
