The burden of policing these protests is falling on certain forces more than others.
That was also the case during the disorder last summer.
Can the Minister give some reassurance that the Home Office is providing the support that is needed to those forces to ensure that they can manage the protests and so that their doing so does not distract from day-to-day policing?
The Chair of the Select Committee makes an important point.
Yes, I can give her the assurances that she seeks.
The right hon.
Lady is right that recent activity has provided particular burdens on particular forces.
The Home Secretary and I, and of course the Policing Minister and colleagues right across Government, work very closely with the police and we will ensure that they have the necessary resources for the important job that they have to do.
Last August, a police officer was hospitalised after being hit with a sledgehammer while responding to a Palestine Action attack on a business near Bristol—a fact that was absent from our debate when we voted to proscribe that organisation recently.
The attackers had sledgehammers, axes, whips and other home-made weapons.
Does the Minister agree that that crosses the line of any legitimate protest—into terrorism?
Yes, I would.
