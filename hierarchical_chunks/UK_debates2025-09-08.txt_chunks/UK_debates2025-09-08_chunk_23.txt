I thank my hon.
Friend 110%.
The cadets are all about social mobility, giving kids opportunity and getting them up and out, and that is what Labour is all about.
From my perspective, the air cadets are amazing.
I went to the summer camp, which had everything—flying planes, STEM, sports and flying drones—and it was absolutely outstanding.
I congratulate the Harlow air cadets; hopefully, I will get to visit them in due course.
