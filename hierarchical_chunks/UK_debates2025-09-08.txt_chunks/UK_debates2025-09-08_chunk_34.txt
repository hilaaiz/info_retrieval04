I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and thank the workers on the Clyde for their professionalism.
It made the collective ministerial effort across Government much easier knowing that we have professional, dedicated and excellent workers on the Clyde who are able to build the Type 26 frigate, and on the opposite side of Scotland, supporting the workers at Rosyth, to build the Type 31 frigate, too.
There is a huge future on either side of Scotland for British shipbuilding, and hopefully more export orders as well.
