I thank my hon.
and gallant Friend for his question.
It is not lost on me that during the troubles there were major explosions in key cities all over the country.
From Brighton to Brimingham, individuals from both sides of the House had to take the precaution of checking under their beds and their cars, and ensuring that the lights were on before they went into certain rooms, because the chance of close-quarter assassination by terrorists was ever present.
Some service personnel who were deployed to secure the peace paid the ultimate sacrifice and 200 families lost loved ones.
That means that mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters had the truth denied to them as soon as the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Act 2023 came into place.
As a service person, I would always want my family to know what happened to me if I were to be killed in a conflict.
Repealing and replacing the legacy Act will enable that, but we must ensure that the process does not come with punishment for veterans.
We will ensure that protections are in place to allow us to get to the truth, and to ensure that no one can rewrite history or make veterans suffer any more.
