I have served overseas and observed this issue at first hand.
Discussions with the Cabinet Office are ongoing, and I hope to update the hon.
Member in due course.
The brave men and women who serve in the armed forces are the very best among us, and I look forward to learning more about our Royal Air Force personnel when the RAF town show comes to Falkirk this week.
The cumulative 10.5% pay increase for non-officers since last July and the additional £1.5 billion to be spent on service housing demonstrate the Government’s commitment to upholding the armed forces covenant, but what further actions are Ministers considering to recognise and retain our armed forces personnel?
My hon.
Friend has rightly mentioned the largest pay rise in 20 years.
I am particularly delighted that we can now say that no member of the armed forces is paid less than the national living wage.
Of course we have much more to do; I look forward to getting to work on it, and I hope to have a meeting with my hon.
Friend to discuss that.
