Medway has a proud tradition with its former dockyard in Chatham.
Last week, I visited the BAE Systems aviation centre in Rochester in my constituency to see its graduates and apprentices.
What more can be done to support graduates and apprentices in defence?
Will the Minister take the opportunity to visit the BAE Systems site to look at that work in person?
