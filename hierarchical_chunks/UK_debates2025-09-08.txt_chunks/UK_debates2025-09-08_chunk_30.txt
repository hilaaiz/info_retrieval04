I thank the Minister, who is a regular visitor to Northern Ireland, for his answers.
Thales has received significant contract work from the Ministry of Defence, with 200 jobs coming out of that, and Spirit AeroSystems has also achieved some  of that, with extra jobs, but many other defence companies could also take advantage.
Will the Minister confirm that those other companies will have the same opportunities?
