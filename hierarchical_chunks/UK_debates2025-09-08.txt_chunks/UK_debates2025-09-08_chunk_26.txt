I thank my hon.
Friend for celebrating the investment we are seeing.
Foreign direct investment is a really important component part of building our ecosystem for defence industries.
Britain is the very best place to invest in defence industries, with a talented population, increasing skills, increasing defence spending and a military that is respected the world over.
We have a huge opportunity to do even more, and when I announce details of the defence industrial strategy shortly, I hope he will support that work as we seek to go further in using defence as an engine for growth in every part of the country.
