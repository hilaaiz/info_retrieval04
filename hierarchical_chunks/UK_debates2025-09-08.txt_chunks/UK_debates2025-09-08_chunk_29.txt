Shortly before recess, I visited a small precision engineering firm that is involved in tooling in the defence industry.
It shared the challenges it faces in looking at defence contracts and explained that there seems to be no priority for UK businesses, unlike in France where French businesses are prioritised.
I am sure the Minister agrees that defence investment boosts growth across our constituencies.
Will he meet me and the business to understand how we can boost British businesses in that sector?
To a Minister just promoted by the son of a toolmaker in the reshuffle, tooling is a very appropriate question.
We are targeting more of the increased defence budget at British companies, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, with the development of the new defence SME hub, which will allow more SMEs to access the defence contracts we are providing as part of our growing renewal of our armed forces.
I would be very happy to meet the hon.
Lady to discuss her constituency business.
