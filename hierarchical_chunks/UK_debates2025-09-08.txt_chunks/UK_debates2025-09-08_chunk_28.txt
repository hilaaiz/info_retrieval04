I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and for championing the BAE site in Rochester.
We want more defence companies to invest more in skills.
In the defence industrial strategy we are publishing today, we will not only make further investments in defence technical education colleges—with £182 million to deliver that—but provide additional support for school-based activities and university partnerships.
I would be very happy to come to Rochester to see for myself the amazing work of the apprentices.
