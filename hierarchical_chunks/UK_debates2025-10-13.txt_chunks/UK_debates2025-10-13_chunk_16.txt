I thank the Secretary of State for that response.
Cornwall has been given an ambitious annual target of 4,400 homes, and I sincerely hope that a large proportion of those will be for the 25,000 Cornish families on the housing waiting list.
I meet so many constituents in social and private housing who have been left high and dry by dodgy developers who go into liquidation before they can deliver vital infrastructure,  such as roads and sewerage works.
Will the Secretary of State please meet me to discuss the enforcement tools that local authorities need to properly hold those developers to account?
