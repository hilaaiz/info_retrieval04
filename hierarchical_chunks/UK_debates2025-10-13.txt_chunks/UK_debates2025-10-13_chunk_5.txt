I am always happy to meet the hon.
Gentleman and others on issues as important as this.
I had the pleasure of visiting Newlyn in his constituency not so long ago and some of those issues were made apparent to me by people living in the area.
We announced top-ups to the affordable homes programme in the autumn and the spring, and in March we announced £2 billion as a downpayment for the new social and affordable homes programme, which is now open for bids.
Homes England can and does vary grant rates on the basis of bids from social housing providers.
Importantly, the available £39 billion covers a range of tenures, including community-led housing.
I would expect and hope to see increases in the way that he has described.
The only way to solve the housing crisis is, as my right hon.
Friend so articulately puts it, to “build, baby, build”.
In my constituency of East Worthing and Shoreham, the median wage is £37,000, but the median house price has soared to more than 10 times that.
What will the Government do to ensure that social and affordable homes are built for my constituents who desperately need them?
