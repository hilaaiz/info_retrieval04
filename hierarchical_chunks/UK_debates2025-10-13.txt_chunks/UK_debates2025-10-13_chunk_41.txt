With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement about the terrorist attack on  2 October  and the action that the Government are taking in response.
Let me start by calling this attack what it was: an evil act of antisemitic terrorism that targeted innocent worshippers on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, which was carried out by a terrorist pledging his allegiance to the warped ideology of Islamism.
I pay tribute to the two men who were killed on that day, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby.
Their bravery saved countless lives.
On behalf of the whole House, I offer my deepest sympathies to their families and their friends.
May their memory be a blessing.
