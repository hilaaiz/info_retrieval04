I thank the shadow Home Secretary for his response and for the way in which he made it.
I look forward to working with him and with all Members across the House as we deal with what I hope will always be a shared issue and a shared problem.
Where there is agreement and consensus in this House on the measures that we should take, I hope we will be able to progress those matters quickly.
