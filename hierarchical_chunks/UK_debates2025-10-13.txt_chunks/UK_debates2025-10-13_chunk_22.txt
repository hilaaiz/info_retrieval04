I welcome the Secretary of State and his Ministers to their positions.
I very much look forward to welcoming them to meetings of the Select Committee; we are a fair and robust Committee.
The Minister highlighted the inter-ministerial group, which the former Secretary of State chaired and saw as being very important.
The issue cuts across all departmental groups.
It is important, because within two months, as we go into the next year, and in the next financial year, we will see over 170,000 young children in temporary accommodation —in homelessness.
That should worry all of us.
The inter-ministerial group has met four times.
Can the Minister confirm that the group will continue to be convened—and if it will, who will chair it?
