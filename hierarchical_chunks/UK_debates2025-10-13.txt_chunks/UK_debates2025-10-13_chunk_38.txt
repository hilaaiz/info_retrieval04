I thank the Secretary of State for taking the decision to invest £20 million through the Pride in Place scheme in my constituency.
For 14 years, two communities—Woodrow and Greenlands —have been forgotten, while inequalities in health, jobs and skills have risen.
Does the Minister agree that the right people to decide where that £20 million will go are those who know their communities best?
