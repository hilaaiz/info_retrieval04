There are over 560 families on Gosport borough council’s waiting list for social housing, yet despite taking power a few years ago, the Liberal Democrat council has not built a single extra council house.
Meanwhile, the complaints I get in my mailbag about the substandard quality of council accommodation grow more and more every single week.
What is the Secretary of State doing to encourage such inadequate councils to build a greater quantity and better quality of council accommodation?
The hon.
Lady will be aware that the Government have reintroduced home building targets that were scrapped by the previous Government.
It is important that we have those targets and that they are achievable, and councils will be held to account to achieve them.
I am working on an acceleration package to encourage more building in which local authorities  will be key partners, and we will make announcements on that in due course.
Of course, the hon.
Lady will be aware of the changes we are making to drive up standards in council and other social housing, which we will insist are enforced and carried through.
