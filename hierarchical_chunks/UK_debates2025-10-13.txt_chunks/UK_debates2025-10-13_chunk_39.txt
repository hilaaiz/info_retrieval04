I thank my hon.
Friend for his enthusiasm.
He is absolutely right: we are putting right the neglect and decline that we saw after 14 years, where communities had been held back because the last Government failed to invest.
We are putting communities at the very heart, and I look forward to working with colleagues across the House to unlock the potential to change our places.
