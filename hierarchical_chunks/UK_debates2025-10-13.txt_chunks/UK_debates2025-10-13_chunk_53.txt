We must all be clear that the attack did not happen in a vacuum.
Antisemitism is widespread on Britain’s streets, and British Jews have been living in fear, particularly since Hamas’s horrific terror attacks of  7 October 2023 .
The Liberal Democrats are committed to ensuring that our Jewish friends and neighbours feel safe walking the streets and worshipping in their synagogues.
Those who spread antisemitic hatred or incite violence against Jews, whether online, at marches or elsewhere, must be stopped.
That is never acceptable.
