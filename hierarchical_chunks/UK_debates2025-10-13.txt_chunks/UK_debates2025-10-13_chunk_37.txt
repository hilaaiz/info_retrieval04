Do the Government accept that it is possible to bring in elected mayors and new strategic authorities without forcibly merging county and district councils in unwanted, cumbersome and remote unitary authorities?
There are two processes going ahead: the devolution process, driven by economic imperatives to unlock the growth prospects across the country; and the reorganisation process, which is being done to ensure that we have more streamlined and effective public services.
We are doing those in tandem, because the last Government failed to get a grip of local government structures and the funding pressures across the piece.
We are getting on with it and we are driving it forward.
Both processes are being driven with huge collaboration from local authorities across the country.
