I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting this incredibly important issue and for always championing his constituents in Rochdale.
He is quite right to highlight the appalling record of the Conservative party on temporary accommodation for families and children, and on homelessness and rough sleeping.
Our drive to build more social and affordable homes will tackle its failure head-on.
We will reduce homelessness levels and the need for temporary accommodation by providing more secure and affordable homes up and down the country, with a particular focus on social rent, including record numbers of new council homes.
