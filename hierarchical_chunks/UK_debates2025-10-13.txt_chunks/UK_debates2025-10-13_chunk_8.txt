It falls to me to open the bowling for the Opposition Front Bench, so I congratulate the right hon.
Gentleman on his appointment and welcome him to his place today.
The previous Government awarded the Mayor of London almost £9 billion of funding to build a total of 151,000 affordable homes in London.
The second tranche of that money amounted to £4 billion, which was to build 35,000 homes between 2021 and 2026.
To date, only 997 have been completed, with 443 of those homes being acquisitions rather than newly built.
What plans does the Secretary of State have to hold the Mayor of London to account for this lamentable failure?
