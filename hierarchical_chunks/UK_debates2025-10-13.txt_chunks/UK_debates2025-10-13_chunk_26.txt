I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his words of welcome.
I refer him to the comments that I made to colleagues.
The homelessness strategy is on its way.
I am afraid that we could not overturn 14 years of wrong choices in the time that we have had in office—that is not realistic—but our strategy on its way.
If there is cross-party support for going much further to reduce the use of temporary accommodation and ensure that everyone has a roof over their head, I will happily work with him to do that together.
