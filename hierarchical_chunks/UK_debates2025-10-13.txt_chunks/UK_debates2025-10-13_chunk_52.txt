I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of her statement.
This is my first duty as my party’s home affairs spokesperson; I only wish that it was not in response to such a tragedy.
My party’s thoughts are with the families of Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, who were tragically killed.
Our thoughts  are also with those who were injured, the congregation, and the wider Jewish community, which was the target of a vicious attack on its holiest day, Yom Kippur.
