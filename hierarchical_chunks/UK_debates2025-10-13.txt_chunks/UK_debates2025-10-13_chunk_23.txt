The Chair of the Select Committee makes the case extremely well.
If anybody in this Chamber is not worried about temporary accommodation, they are not paying attention; that is how serious this is.
It is terrible for our kids, and for the taxpayer, because it is so expensive.
I will follow up with her.
A lot of work has already been done on the homelessness strategy.
We want to get it confirmed as soon as possible.
I will engage fully with the Select Committee on the strategy to ensure that we get it right, and we will come back to her shortly with the details of how we will do that together.
Every night, over 1,000 children are homeless in my city; they are either in temporary accommodation, or even worse off.
Does the Minister agree that this is totally unacceptable for a modern society, and that the Government must bring forward its cross-departmental plan to tackle youth homelessness?
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to what I just said to the Chair of the Select Committee, but let me confirm again that any child in temporary accommodation, particularly B&B accommodation, who has not got enough space to do their homework pays the price—not just through what they are going through today, but in the future.
We cannot accept that.
We cannot stand for it, and we should work together across this House to bring this to an end.
Thanks to the action of the previous Government and councils up and down the country, 90% of rough sleepers were got off the streets at the beginning of the pandemic,  five and half years ago.
Tragically, since then, most of those people—young and old—have returned to rough sleeping.
In constituencies like mine, street homelessness is not so obvious—people are living and sleeping in woods, ruins and so on—yet the tragedy is still there.
What lessons can the Minister and the Government learn from that rapid removal of homeless people from the streets in 2020, so that they can implement it again?
