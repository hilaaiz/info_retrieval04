I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his point.
Homelessness can be about rough sleeping, but there is also hidden homelessness.
Our forthcoming strategy needs to consider all that in the round.
He asks me what lesson I take from what happened a few years ago—and, I would argue, from how we reduced rough sleeping in the past.
I would say that politics is about choices.
We took the choice last week to invest, in-year, an extra £84 million in preventing and addressing homelessness.
That is the right thing to ensure that everybody in this country is safe and has a roof over their head.
