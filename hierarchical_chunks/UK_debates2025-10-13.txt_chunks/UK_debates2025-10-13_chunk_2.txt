The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to build more social and affordable homes.
What progress he has made on meeting social housing targets.
What steps he is taking to build more social and affordable homes.
It is a privilege to be appointed as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.
May I start by paying tribute to my predecessor and former Deputy Prime Minister, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner) , for all she has done since the general election last year on workers’ rights, local government and building council homes?
She made a real and lasting difference.
In July, the Labour Government published a five-step plan to deliver the biggest increase in social and affordable housing in a generation, and to transform the safety and quality of social homes.
The affordable homes programme will deliver 110,000 to 130,000 affordable homes.
Under the new £39 billion social and affordable homes programme, we have set an ambition of 300,000 new homes over 10 years.
We will set targets after the initial bids.
I was lucky enough to grow up in a council house in Rochdale in a stable and secure home with an affordable rent, but sadly that is an opportunity and a childhood denied to far too many children in my constituency today.
Why?
Because under the last 10 years of the Conservative Government, the number of families on the housing list trebled.
Does the Secretary of State agree that reducing the number of children in temporary accommodation should be not just the mission of this Government, but the moral mission of this Government?
