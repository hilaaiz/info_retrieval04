I welcome the Secretary of State to his position and declare an interest as a volunteer member of the Cornwall Community Land Trust.
The Secretary of State will be well aware that a perfect storm has hit the construction industry as far as the delivery of social housing is concerned: tender forecasts  are not encouraging, Homes England’s scoring matrix is proving to be inflexible, and the cost-value ratio used by registered providers is not helping and is providing a disincentive to deliver in the most deprived communities.
There are thousands of homes that community-led CLTs and others could be delivering now.
Will the Secretary of State meet me and fellow members of the community-led housing sector?
Otherwise, we will be waiting another five years to get shovel-ready affordable homes off the ground.
