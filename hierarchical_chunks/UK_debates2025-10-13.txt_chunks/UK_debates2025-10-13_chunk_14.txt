What information his Department holds on the proportion of people granted asylum status living in the private rented sector.
My Department does not hold data on the proportion of people who have been granted asylum status living in the private rented sector in England.
It is extraordinary that the Minister does not have that answer.
Too many asylum seekers are arriving in our communities far too quickly because the Government have failed on their promise to smash their gangs.
People have had enough, and this Labour Government do not seem to have any answers.
What actions will the Minister take to support local communities and public services to deal with the growing number of asylum seekers in our communities?
I am afraid I will take no lectures from the hon.
Gentleman, as it was the previous Conservative Government—in which he served as a Minister—who lost control of our borders and presided over the complete breakdown of the asylum system.
This Government are restoring order to that system, speeding up decision making and reforming the appeals process to cut the asylum backlog and remove those with no right to be here at a much faster rate than the previous Government.
Our country has a proud history of providing sanctuary to those fleeing persecution.
Genuine asylum seekers who have been granted refugee or humanitarian protection status should be welcomed.
The hon.
Gentleman would have said the same some years ago, and it is a sign of just how far his party has fallen that he cannot now bring himself to do so.
