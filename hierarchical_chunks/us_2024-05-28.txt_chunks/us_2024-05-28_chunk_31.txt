Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month and to recognize an extraordinary individual from Rochester, NY, who is making a profound impact on our Jewish community: Thomas Fink.
Tom Fink is the embodiment of service in my hometown.
Tom is a past president of Temple B'rith Kodesh and a former National Board Member of the Union.
He has been active in volunteer work and social activism for decades, particularly on the issue of homelessness and affordable housing.
He has dedicated himself time and time again to bettering our region, going above and beyond to serve his neighbors in ways both big and small.
During Jewish American Heritage Month, it is my privilege to recognize Thomas Fink for his selflessness, generosity, and dedication to uplifting our Jewish community.
Rochester is a better and brighter place because of his leadership.
His legacy will leave a lasting mark on all those whose lives he has touched.
