Mr. Speaker, throughout its history, Leon's Heroes has remained steadfast in its commitment to honoring the legacy of our military members, past and present.
I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the organization for its outstanding dedication to the community, to our veterans, to our active service members, and to our first responders.
Leon Wolek and the many devoted volunteers involved with this extraordinary organization are truly worthy of our highest praise.
