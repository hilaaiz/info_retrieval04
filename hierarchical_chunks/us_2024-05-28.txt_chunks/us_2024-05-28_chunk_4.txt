It is a great privilege to introduce our next speaker whose persistence ensured this memorial took its place on the National Mall 20 years ago.
Her commitment to this Memorial and the Greatest Generation is unparalleled.
The longest serving woman in Congressional history, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur.
In 2014, Ambassador Williams called Congresswoman Kaptur, the mother of the World War II Memorial for her critical role in moving legislation through Congress and her devotion to World War II veterans.
Congresswoman Kaptur continues to support the Memorial, recently leading efforts for the United States Mint's 2024 Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin program to help fund Memorial's, maintenance and educational programs.
It is my great honor to introduce the mother of the World War II Memorial: Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur.
