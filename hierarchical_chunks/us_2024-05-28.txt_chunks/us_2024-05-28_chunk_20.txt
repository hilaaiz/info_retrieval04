Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Marine Corps Lance Corporal George Cassar, Purple Heart recipient, for his service to our Nation, as he serves as Grand Marshall of the City of Dearborn's ninety-eighth Memorial Day festivities.
Lance Corporal Cassar joined the Marine Corps in October 1966 and served until 1969.
During his service, Cassar displayed remarkable bravery and perseverance, earning two Purple Hearts.
The first was awarded after his tank was hit by a rocket, and the second was given when he was wounded by shrapnel.
Since his retirement from military service, Lance Corporal Cassar continues to serve his community, coaching basketball for an impressive forty-seven years.
Please join me in recognizing Lance Corporal George Cassar for his service to our Nation.
