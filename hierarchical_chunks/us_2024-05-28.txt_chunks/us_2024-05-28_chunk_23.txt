Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month and to recognize an exemplary individual from Rochester, NY, who is making a profound impact on our Jewish community: Joy Getnick.
Joy Getnick serves as the Executive Director of the University of Rochester Hillel.
She has quietly but powerfully done vital work over these last several months guiding our young students, particularly with the rise of antisemitism on campus and throughout society.
She is an educator and leader not just on campus, but across all.
Joy is also the founding director of Camp Seneca Lake in Israel, a summer Israel program for teens.
Her commitment to uplifting and mentoring students is helping to shape the next generation of leaders, and her legacy will live on through each of the lives she has touched.
Jewish American History Month is the perfect opportunity to recognize and honor our local Jewish neighbors who are working diligently to make our community a better place.
I can think of no better example than Joy Getnick, and I commend her for her many accomplishments.
