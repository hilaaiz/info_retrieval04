Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month and to recognize an outstanding individual from Rochester, NY, whose contributions have made a lasting impact on our local Jewish community: Isobel Goldman Isobel Goldman served for 18 years as Director of Community Relations at the Jewish Federation.
In that capacity, she created and directed the Rochester Jewish Coalition for Literacy, which started with six volunteers and under her leadership, grew to over 200 people who went once a week to Rochester City Schools to assist with students in K-6 with literacy skills.
She also served as the Director of Grants at the Max and Marian Farash Charitable Foundation where she started the First in Family College Tuition-free program, led Jewish Education programming, and started an initiative to help fund scholarships for teens hoping to travel to Israel.
She has truly embodied the spirit of service to others.
This Jewish American Heritage Month, it is my honor and privilege to recognize Isobel Goldman.
Her extraordinary legacy has uplifted the lives of everyone who calls Rochester home and will continue to inspire us all for decades to come.
