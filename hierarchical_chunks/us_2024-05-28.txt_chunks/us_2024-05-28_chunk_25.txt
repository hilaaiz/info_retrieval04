Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, today I stand before you to recognize May 2024 as National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
Awareness Month.
We honor individuals who have been affected by ALS and pledge unwavering support to patients and their families.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), known by many as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease in which the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord stop working and die.
Over time, a person's mind loses connection with the muscles, slowly taking away the ability to walk, talk, eat, and eventually breathe.
After symptoms develop, most patients only live for another 2-5 years, and despite its destructive nature, currently no one knows what causes most cases of ALS and there are no cures.
Today, an estimated 31,000 people in the United States are living with ALS.
In order to combat this devastating illness, we must increase education and support research.
ALS Awareness Month deepens the public's awareness of people with ALS' dire circumstances, and acknowledges the terrible impact this disease has, not only on the person, but on his or her family and the community.
It further recognizes the research being done to eradicate this disease and is why I sign an annual appropriations letter each year requesting increased funding for ALS research.
Our commitment to accelerating the pace of discovery must remain unwavering, fueled by the hope that one day, ALS will be a livable disease for everyone, everywhere, until we can cure it.
