The Friends of the National World War II Memorial annually presents the Brigadier General Charles E. McGee Unity Award to individuals or groups that exemplify the spirit of unity and shared values prevalent during World War II.
Named after Brigadier General Charles Magee, an original Tuskegee Airman, this award honors those who actively work for community betterment and embody the moral integrity of General McGee and the Greatest Generation.
We're proud to present the fourth annual Brigadier General Charles E. McGee Unity Award to Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur.
Representing Ohio's 9th District since 1983, Congresswoman Kaptur has dedicated her career to promoting unity and cooperation, focusing on economic development, veterans affairs, and environmental conservation.
In 1987, Congresswoman Kaptur recognized the need for a national tribute to World War II veterans and introduced legislation to create a Memorial.
Her persistent advocacy led to the passage of the World War II Memorial Act in 1993.
Dedicated in 2004, the Memorial has since welcomed 100 million visitors.
Congresswoman Kaptur continues to teach the lessons of the war, and promote values of unity, and cooperation.
Her legislative and community efforts foster bipartisan cooperation, emphasizing common ground and governance.
Here to present Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur with the Brigadier General Charles E. McGee Unity Award is Yvonne McGee, daughter of the late General McGee.
