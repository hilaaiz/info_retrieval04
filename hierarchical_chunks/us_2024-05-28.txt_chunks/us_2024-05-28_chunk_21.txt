Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month and to recognize an extraordinary individual from Rochester, NY, whose accomplishments and contributions have left a lasting impact on our region: Howard Konar.
Howard Konar has a longstanding history of leadership in Rochester and has done extensive philanthropic work locally and across the country.
He serves as a trustee for the William & Sheila Konar Foundation supporting Jewish life and culture and as a member of the Board of Governors for the Jewish Federation.
In 2008, then-President George W. Bush named Howard to the council of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
His positive influence can be felt across every facet of our Jewish community.
During Jewish American Heritage Month, it is my privilege to recognize Howard Konar.
He has dedicated himself to honoring the history of the Jewish people and has worked tirelessly to strengthen the future of our local Jewish neighbors.
