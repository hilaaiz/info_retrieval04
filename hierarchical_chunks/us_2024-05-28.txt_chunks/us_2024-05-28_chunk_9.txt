I just want to say it's an honor to be here to represent my father, and he would be here to represent, as this award is all the men and women of that generation.
He used to love to talk with young people.
He always gave him his 4 P's, I think you exemplify all of those, which is perceive, prepare, perform, and persevere, which I know you had to do to get this to happen.
So, it's our honor, and thank you to Holly and everyone from the World War II Memorial.
Thank you.
