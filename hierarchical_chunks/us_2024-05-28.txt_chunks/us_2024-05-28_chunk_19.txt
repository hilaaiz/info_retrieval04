Mr. Gorczyk enlisted in the Navy in 1966.
While serving, his ship was hit directly by rockets.
Drawing on resilience and teamwork, Gorczyk and his crew were able to escape danger and reach safety.
For their bravery and injuries sustained, Gorczyk and his fellow crew members were awarded Purple Hearts.
In 1968, after an honorable discharge, Gorczyk left the Navy as a seaman.
He returned home to Michigan to study photography at Macomb County Community College after his service.
He remains an active member of the Vietnam Veterans of America--James Huard Chapter 267 and The American Legion Post 364.
Please join me in recognizing Seaman Edward Gorczyk, for his commendable service to our Nation.
