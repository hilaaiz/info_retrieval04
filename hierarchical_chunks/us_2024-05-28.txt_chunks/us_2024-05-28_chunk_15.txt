Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the National Commission to Combat Workplace Sexual Harassment Act, which would establish a national commission to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.
I have modeled this bill on bills Congress has passed to establish commissions to address other national problems.
Specifically, this bill would establish a commission to carry out a comprehensive investigation and study of workplace sexual harassment in the United States.
A national commission would assure the American people that Congress takes sexual harassment seriously, beyond just the high-profile workplace instances.
Most importantly, the commission would hear from a cross section of workers--from office and factory workers to retail and food service workers.
The commission could travel or invite witnesses to the District of Columbia from throughout the country to recommend changes in laws or regulations and best practices to prevent, investigate, respond to and penalize sexual harassment in the private and public sectors.
Our constituents expect Congress to take on the problem of sexual harassment throughout our national economy.
A national commission could help reach and reduce sexual harassment, a form of gender discrimination, where the average American works.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.
