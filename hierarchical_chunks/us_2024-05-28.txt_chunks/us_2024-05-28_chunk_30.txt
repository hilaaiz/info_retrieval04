House.
I'm so appreciative to have had him in my personal and committee offices.
On behalf of my personal office and the Committee on House Administration, we want to thank Will for his great services and friendship.
We wish the very best of success to Will, Steph, Jack, and Ada as they start a new chapter back home in Wisconsin.
