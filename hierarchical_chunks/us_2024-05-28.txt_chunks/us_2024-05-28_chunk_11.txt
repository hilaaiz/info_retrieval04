Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, with the introduction of H. Res. 1261, I join my colleagues on the House Committee on Homeland Security in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the creation of the United States Border Patrol.
It is important that we honor the service and sacrifices of the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol and their families, past and present.
Since the U.S. Border Patrol's creation on May 28, 1924, Border Patrol agents have shown commitment and dedication to safeguarding our Nation by securing and protecting our borders.
The U.S. Border Patrol has seen its mission expand greatly since its first stations opened in Detroit, Michigan, and El Paso, Texas, in 1924.
Congress expanded its duties to patrolling the seacoast in 1925.
U.S. Border Patrol's Air Operations officially commenced in 1941.
The tragic events of September 11, 2001, underscored the importance Patrol operations.
With each new mission set, the men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol have consistently risen to the challenge.
As we mark the agency's centennial, we particularly remember the 156 Border Patrol agents who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
The United States Border Patrol has overcome significant challenges while protecting Americans and our national security.
I take this opportunity to thank the nearly 20,000 agents currently protecting the 6,000 miles of international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters.
I also celebrate the agents who came before them and the families who endure great sacrifices and provide unwavering support to those who serve in the United States Border Patrol.
