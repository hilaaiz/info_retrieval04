I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this issue and for the two examples that he has given.
The downgrading of Basildon hospital is deeply disappointing.
The Care Quality Commission has set out immediate actions for the trust leaders to deliver improvements.
Our decisions in government have seen a £26 billion boost for our NHS, helping to deliver over 5 million extra appointments.
I gently point out that he was elected to represent a Reform party that would dismantle our NHS and charge people to see their doctor.
