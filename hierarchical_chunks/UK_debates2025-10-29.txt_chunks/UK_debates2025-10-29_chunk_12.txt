I thank the right hon.
Lady for her words about our late colleague Hefin David.
I congratulate Lindsay Whittle on his victory and on becoming a Senedd Member; I am sure that he will work very hard for his Caerphilly constituency for the next six months.
As she will know, I am not going to comment on discussions between myself and the Chancellor ahead of the Budget.
She will have to wait and see what the Chancellor says on  26 November .
