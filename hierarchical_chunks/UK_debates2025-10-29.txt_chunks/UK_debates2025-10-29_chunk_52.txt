The Minister has rightly emphasised the importance of securing the swift and urgent supply of aid to all those in need in Gaza, but he has also mentioned that some of the crossings remain disrupted or fully closed.
What reasons have been given for the continued delay in reopening all the crossings?
There has been some public reporting of Israeli concerns about the Allenby bridge, particularly after the violence there.
Rafah is a subject that we have discussed many times in this House, and it remains an  absolutely critical artery.
It is true to say that in both the Allenby crossing and Rafah there will need to be agreement between both countries.
I hope that agreement can be secured quickly, that Israel removes the restrictions in place, and that we see the free flow of aid through those crossings very shortly.
