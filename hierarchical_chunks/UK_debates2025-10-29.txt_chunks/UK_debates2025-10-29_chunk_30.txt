I am speaking on behalf of my constituents Shannon and Tyler, who lost their two-year-old son Hudson earlier this year.
Worried about their son, they called 111 and were told that he had gastroenteritis.
In fact, Hudson had a twisted bowel and, after being rushed to hospital a few days later, he tragically died.
Shannon and Tyler are full of praise for the NHS medical staff who worked so hard to save their son’s life, but they just wish they had been offered an in-person   appointment sooner, which might have given a more accurate diagnosis.
They want Hudson’s legacy to be better access to face-to-face NHS appointments for children under five, so that other families do not face this tragic situation.
Their online petition on the matter has gained over 80,000 signatures.
Will the Prime Minister join me in sending the best wishes of the House to Hudson’s family, and will he ensure that they meet a Health Minister to discuss their courageous campaign?
