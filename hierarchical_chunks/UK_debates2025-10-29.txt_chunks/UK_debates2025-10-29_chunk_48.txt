I thank my hon.
Friend for his kind words.
There are two areas in which aid will be particularly vital.
Of course, there are the immediate needs of the Gazan people.
Most recently at Sharm el-Sheikh, the Prime Minister announced a £20 million contribution to the humanitarian programme to meet those needs, which will be focused on water, sanitation and health.
There is also a need for the sustainable reconstruction of Gaza.
The message that we hear so often from Palestinians is that they wish for their own companies and private sector to be engaged in that endeavour, and do not simply wish to see the World Bank or the United Nations leading the charge.
They, too, want to take agency in those questions.
That was one reason we involved them so closely in the conference that I held in October.
