Reform says that it stands up for the working class, but the truth is that it never has—its Members voted to block the Employment Rights Bill again and again.
Does the Prime Minister agree that only this Government are on the side of working people?
It is Labour that is creating tens of thousands of jobs, like in our deal with Turkey; it is Labour that is getting rid of zero-hours contracts; and it is Labour that is protecting workers from unfair dismissal from day one.
I am proud that we have delivered the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation—which the Tories and Reform have voted against at every turn, as they always do with any form of workers’ rights and protections.
The deal that we struck on   Monday with Turkey is worth £8 billion, 20,000 jobs and 10 years of work in manufacturing the Typhoons.
It was possible only because we are a trusted member of NATO.
Reform would be an absolute nightmare on defence—it would not be a trusted member of NATO because it is Putin-friendly.
Targets for cancer patients beginning treatment within 62 days have not been met by any NHS trust for 10 years—a legacy of the last Conservative Government.
If those targets had been met in every month of 2025, so far nearly 3,000 breast cancer patients would have started their treatment on time.
Will the Prime Minister ensure that the national cancer plan, which I asked for a year ago, makes it possible for the 62-day target to be met, along with recruiting much-needed cancer specialists and replacing outdated equipment?
