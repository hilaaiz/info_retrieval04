After wantonly scrapping the Rwanda scheme, the Labour Government are now overseeing record-breaking figures of illegal immigrants.
It is reported that the scandal is now engulfing north Wales, where more than 200 illegal immigrants have tried to gain entry to the country on ferries from Dublin to Holyhead.
Meanwhile, there is talk about Penally military camp in south-west Wales, which was previously condemned by the Welsh Labour Government.
It appears that their policy, along with Reform’s, is from boats to barracks, as is happening in Scotland and Sussex, yet Plaid says that there is no such thing as illegal immigration.
Does the Minister agree that her Government and Plaid have no idea about and no interest in how to make our borders safe?
I fear that the Conservatives forget about the chaos that they created.
We inherited a broken system after 14 years of chaos, and contracts that we have to honour, but in the past year we have halved the use of hotels.
We have removed 30,000 people who have no right to be here.
It is not job done, as I say, but it is a work in progress.
We can compare that work in just one year with 14 years of chaos under the hon.
Lady’s Government.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to improve cross-border rail connectivity between Wales and England.
We are investing at least £445 million in Welsh rail in order to right years of underfunding by past Governments.
That will mean new stations and more and faster trains along the key lines, and will improve cross-border connectivity, create jobs and boost economic growth.
