I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this important issue, which I know is of real concern to him.
I reassure him that I am in regular contact with Chief Constable Jon Boutcher and the PSNI on it, as he would expect.
As he is aware, we provided a record settlement of £19.3 billion a year on average for the Executive, and we invested £113 million in additional security funding for the PSNI to help to address specific security challenges.
While it is for the Executive to set the PSNI budget, I reassure him that our commitment is to keeping people safe in Northern Ireland.
