That is a vital question from my hon.
Friend, who follows these things closely.
As I said in my last answer, to get to the volumes that we need, we will need both Rafah and the Allenby bridge to be reopened.
It is welcome that there appears to be an increase of aid through Kerem Shalom—both UN aid and private trucks.
It is vital that the Palestinian private sector, particularly in Gaza, can get goods in, restart the market and enable people to go about their normal lives.
We will, as he would expect, continue to work with all our partners until we see the reopening of those crossings.
