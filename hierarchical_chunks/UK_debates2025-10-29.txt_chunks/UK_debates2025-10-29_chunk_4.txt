I welcome the Minister to her position at the Dispatch Box.
I know she will be excellent at the job.
I also refer to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
Welsh farming is central to the Welsh economy—we can all agree on that—but it is now facing a double whammy from the mad sustainable farming scheme from Labour in Cardiff, and the frankly bad family farm tax that has been dreamt up by Labour in London.
The Farmers’ Union of Wales tells us that more than 85% of active farms in Wales will have IHT bills that exceed their incomes.
That spells economic disaster.
Why is Labour so deaf to the voice of farmers in Wales?
