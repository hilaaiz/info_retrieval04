I thank the Minister for his statement and his focus on maintaining the ceasefire.
I stand in solidarity with the many ordinary Palestinians living under Hamas and with the families in Israel waiting for their loved ones to be returned, but I cannot conclude that what Netanyahu has done in the last 24 hours was proportionate in any way.
I continue to hope and pray for peace.
With peace will come the opportunity to rebuild Gaza, but I do not see how that can be done when Israel holds so many people without charge, particularly healthcare workers.
My constituent Eman is really concerned about Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, who is being held.
Does the Minister agree it is really important that people, particularly healthcare workers, should not be held without charge?
Is he having negotiations with Israel on their release?
