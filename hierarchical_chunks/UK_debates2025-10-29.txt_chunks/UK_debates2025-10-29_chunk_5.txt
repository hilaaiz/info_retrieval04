As I said, the Government want to strike that fair balance, and that is what they are doing.
Our reforms mean that the majority of those claiming agricultural property relief will not be affected.
That is a fair approach that balances fixing our public finances after the chaos of the Conservative party, and maintaining much needed support for families, farms and the wider rural agricultural community.
