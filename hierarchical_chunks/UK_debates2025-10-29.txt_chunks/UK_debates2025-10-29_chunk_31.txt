I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that tragic case.
I am sure that I speak for the whole House in saying that we send our sympathies and thoughts to Hudson’s parents, Shannon and Tyler.
I will make sure that they get the meeting that he has asked for.
This is exactly why we are working to improve access to face-to-face appointments for those who want one.
To enable that, we have delivered the largest cash uplift for GPs in a decade, have put over 2,500 GPs into general practice, and are upgrading 1,000 surgeries to deliver 8 million more appointments.
