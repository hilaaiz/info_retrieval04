I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this matter, which I know is personal to him.
We are investing £600 million to improve diagnostic capacity and are rolling out new radiotherapy machines, including, I am pleased to say, in his local trust.
We have seen real improvements, with 148,000 more people now having cancer diagnosed or ruled out within 28 days, but I acknowledge that there is more to do.
The national cancer plan will set out how we will go further and deliver the best care for every patient.
