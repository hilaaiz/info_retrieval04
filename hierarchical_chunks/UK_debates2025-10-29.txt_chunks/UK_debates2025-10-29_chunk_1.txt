Minister, welcome.
Thank you, Mr Speaker.
As a proud Welsh MP I am honoured to be here for my first Welsh questions.
We fully recognise the role of farmers and the agricultural community in Wales.
That is why one of the first things that I did as Minister was meet members of the Farmers’ Union of Wales at the farm of one of its members just two weeks ago.
I will be meeting with the National Farmers’ Union later today to discuss important matters for its members, including inheritance tax.
This Government have also made sure to protect the farm budget for Wales, ensuring that the full £337 million has been allocated to the Welsh Government.
