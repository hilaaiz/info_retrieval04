My hon.
Friend has been a strong champion for this rail investment, which is the key to unlock Wales’s economic potential.
It includes funds to progress the five Burns stations in Cardiff East, Newport West, Somerton, Llanwern and Magor and Undy.
I will continue to work with the Wales Rail Board and the Welsh Government to ensure that the community my hon.
Friend represents is given the infrastructure that it needs.
The huge potential of both the north-west of England and north Wales is being held back by poor rail infra-structure.
The last Conservative Government committed themselves to spending at least £1 billion to upgrade and electrify the railway lines from Crewe and Warrington through Chester and into north Wales, but this Labour Government have scrapped those transformational plans, at a time when economic growth is a priority.
Will the Minister seek to reinstate the vital rail infrastructure investment in the Mersey Dee and north Wales region?
That money just did not exist.
We are investing a historic £445 million in Welsh rail to right years of underfunding by previous Governments, unleashing Wales’s economic potential.
That will mean new stations, faster trains on key lines, and connecting people with well-paid and better jobs right across Wales.
Two Governments are working in partnership to deliver for the people of Wales.
Order.
Before we come to Prime Minister’s questions, may I welcome, in the Gallery, the honourable Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka and his delegation?
