I welcome the statement from my hon.
Friend.
It is fairly clear that the Israeli Government agreed to the peace deal only because they felt they had to, not because they necessarily wanted to.
After all this time, we still have not got aid flowing into Gaza in the way we would all want to see.
What further action can the Government take to put pressure on the Israeli Government to ensure that all the aid that is needed actually gets in, and gets in quickly?
