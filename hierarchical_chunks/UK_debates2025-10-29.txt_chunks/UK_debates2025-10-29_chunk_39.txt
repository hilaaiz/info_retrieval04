I thank my hon.
Friend for raising these tragic cases, which have a huge impact on families, friends and communities.
I know that she is a passionate and dedicated campaigner on this issue.
Every single life lost to knife crime devastates communities.
That is why we banned zombie knives and ninja swords and are strengthening controls on online knife sales.
We are also giving stronger powers to the police in our Crime and Policing Bill, which both the Conservatives and Reform voted against.
