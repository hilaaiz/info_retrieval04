I welcome the Minister to her place.
The impact of the changes to IHT goes far beyond just farmers.
Last month, a Pembrokeshire farm gathered 57 businesses from vets, machinery dealerships, and milk processors, to electricians and fencing companies, employing almost 11,000 people.
Almost half of those were totally reliant on incomes from local farms.
Have the Government fully considered the ripple effect of that policy on farms in Wales and across the UK, including in my constituency?
