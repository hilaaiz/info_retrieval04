I welcome last month’s news that Newport city council and Caerphilly county borough council will each receive £21.5 million from the UK Labour Government’s Pride in Place scheme.
That funding will empower communities across my constituency to invest in community assets and their local high streets, drive local growth and create jobs, thus reducing the cost of living.
Does the Secretary of State agree that at last in Wales, we have two Labour Governments delivering for the people of Wales?
