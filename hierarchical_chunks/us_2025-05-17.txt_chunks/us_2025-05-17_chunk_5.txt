Mr. ISSA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Bo Mazzetti--a veteran, a veteran statesman, and a relentless champion for tribal sovereignty and the people of the Rincon Band of Luiseno Indians.
For over two decades.
Bo not only led his own tribe but also helped lead California's Native nations into a more prosperous future.
Known for his steady hand, quiet dignity.
and unmatched resolve.
Bo was most importantly a leader who never failed to listen.
From San Diego County, to Sacramento, and all the way to the halls of Congress--he made historic changes to advance tribal sovereignty.
Be it tribal water rights, infrastructure modernization, or unjust gaming compacts.
Bo brought common sense solutions to difficult problems.
A Vietnam veteran, Bo remained devoted to leadership and service from the time he enlisted in the Navy.
And to those of us who had the honor to serve and work alongside him--he was a friend.
Bo's legacy will live on in the lands he protected, the institutions he built, and the generations he empowered.
My prayers are with his wife, Mary, his children.
and the entire Rincon community,
