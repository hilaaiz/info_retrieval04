Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I celebrate the remarkable life and upcoming 100th birthday of George Howard, an African American World War II veteran and an esteemed resident of Lansing, Michigan.
Born in Birmingham, Alabama on February 22, 1925, 
Mr. Howard has led a life of service, resilience, and love for his fellow man.
His story is one of transformation, from facing adversity and discrimination to building meaningful and trusting relationships across racial lines.
