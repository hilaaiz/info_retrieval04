Mr. Howard's service earned him multiple decorations, including the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, and the WWII Victory Medal.
The experiences 
Mr. Howard had during the war affected his outlook on life.
While serving in Italy and Switzerland, he encountered a level of respect and equality from Europeans that was often denied to him in the segregated American South.
These experiences fueled his desire to promote equality and understanding among all people, a mission he has carried with him throughout his life.
Upon returning to the United States, 
Mr. Howard once again faced the harsh realities of a segregated society.
Though he had served with honor and integrity, he and other African American veterans were excluded from celebrations.
Despite the lack of recognition and disrespectful treatment, he remained focused on the values he fought for during the war.
He expressed deep gratitude for President Truman's decision to desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces in 1948, a significant step towards equality.
After his military service, 
Mr. Howard moved to Brooklyn, New York, and eventually settled in Michigan, where he built a career as a physical therapy technician at Ingham Medical Center in Lansing.
His professional dedication was matched by his passion for jazz music.
A proud father of three, he and his saxophone were often exiled by his children to a friend's basement to practice in the early days of developing his talent.
Eventually, he was not only performing locally but also traveling across the country to study and listen to other jazz artists.
At the age of 92, he realized a lifelong dream by recording his first CD, ``George Howard and My Jazz Brothers,'' thanks to the support of his friends.
