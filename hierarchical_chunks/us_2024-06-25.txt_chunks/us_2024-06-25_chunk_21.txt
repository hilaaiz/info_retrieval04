Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I use today to congratulate Donna M. Chiera on her retirement as President of the American Federation of Teachers New Jersey (AFTNJ).
Ms. Chiera has dedicated over 40 years of service to the education field and her contributions and accomplishments are truly deserving of this body's recognition.
As President of AFTNJ, Donna Chiera brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the position.
She worked as a special education teacher and resource room teacher for the Perth Amboy Public School District for more than 30 years until her retirement from teaching in 2011.
Furthermore, 
Ms. Chiera also served as president of the local union, Perth Amboy Federation of Teachers, from 1991 until 2013, as well as AFTNJ executive vice president for grades pre-K through 12.
Her longstanding involvement with AFT and her tenure as an educator exemplify
