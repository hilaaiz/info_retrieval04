Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of Joey Chiang, the current president of the Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce of North America (TCCNA).
Mr. Chiang works tirelessly to lead the TCCNA in their mission to support and connect Taiwanese business members in North America.
TCCNA was established in 1986 as a non-profit organization.
TCCNA encompasses thirty-five regional chambers primarily composed of Taiwanese immigrants.
These regional chambers span the U.S. and Canada, including major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, New York, and here in the nation's capital.
Under the careful stewardship of past presidents, TCCNA has grown into the largest transnational civilian organization in North America.
Serving as a vital platform for communication between Taiwanese businesses in North America and the Taiwanese government, TCCNA regularly advocates for the importance of bilateral U.S.-Taiwan trade relations.
As of June 22, 2024, the TCCNA is celebrating its 36th annual meeting of the board of directors.
This impressive milestone is a testament to the dedication and passion that TCCNA members bring to their organization.
TCCNA would not be what it is today without the guidance of President Joey Chiang.
Mr. Chiang, a talented developer in his own right, has led TCCNA to gather forty new directors under his term.
His expert hand brought TCCNA great success in their annual Washington DC Door Knocking Event, where the organization visited over fifty members.
Furthermore, 
Mr. Chiang is not only a talented and successful leader but a generous benefactor.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, he personally arranged and donated millions of masks from Taiwan to the United States for frontline workers.
Mr. Chiang's zeal, generosity, and expert governance has significantly enhanced economic and cultural exchanges between Taiwan and the U.S.
