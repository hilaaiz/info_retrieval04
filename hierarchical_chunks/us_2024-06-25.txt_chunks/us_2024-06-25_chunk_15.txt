Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Doug Durham who passed away at the age of 94 on April 11, 2024.
Doug served honorably in the United States Navy during the Korean War and continued his dedication to serving our country after leaving the service.
Born in Reed City, Michigan on July 7, 1929, Doug served on the first ship to leave the United States for Korea, the USS Endicott DMS 25.
On the Endicott, Doug took part in the mission to sweep mines in Hungnam Harbor and assist in the Christmas Miracle evacuation of 105,000 servicemembers from the Chosin reservoir.
He was honored as a Humboldt Hero and was selected to participate in an Honor Flight to Washington, D.C. to see the memorials built to honor him and others that served.
Doug continued to serve his country in the private sector after leaving the Navy.
He was instrumental in the development of a groundbreaking missile detection system during his 30-year career at Lockheed.
His contributions to this field were invaluable.
He was a committed patriot, but his service to this country was not purely through national defense.
Doug had a passion for volunteering.
He devoted much of his time to the Humboldt Senior Resource Center, Area 1 Agency on Aging, the Ingomar Club Board, and the Historical Committee.
When Alzheimer's claimed the life of Doug's spouse, Virginia, he established a caregiver support group to make sure that others had the help and training they needed to care for family members stricken by the disease.
Doug was captivated by the beauty of our natural world and found solace in nature.
He
