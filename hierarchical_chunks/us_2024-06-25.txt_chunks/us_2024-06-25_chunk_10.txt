Mr. Howard's life is a testament to the power of perseverance and the strength found in service to one's country.
To this day, he strongly believes in the fundamental principle that all men are created equal and has spent his life fostering understanding and respect among different cultures.
He is also deeply committed to ensuring that people learn about the significant contributions of Black soldiers who have served our country, from the Revolutionary War to World War II to today.
It is with great respect and admiration that I recognize George Howard's extraordinary contributions and wish him a joyous celebration of his 100th birthday in the United States House.
