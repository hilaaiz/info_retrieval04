Mr. LaTURNER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation for a member of my staff, Mike Howard, who has recently embarked on a new job off the Hill after nearly three years of service as my communications director.
Mike began in my office in August of 2021, and has served since then as a trusted advisor who has constantly sharpened our team and ensured that we are able to get out the message of our work here in Congress to my constituents from Galena to Atchison.
Mike has spent countless early mornings and late nights preparing with me for interviews, town halls, committee hearings, and making sure that we are able to clearly explain the work that we do here.
Mike will be sorely missed as he moves on to this new role, but I would like to thank him once again for his dedication and commitment to the people of the Second Congressional District.
