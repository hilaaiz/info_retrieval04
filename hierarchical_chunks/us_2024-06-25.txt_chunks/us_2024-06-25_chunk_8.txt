Mr. Howard's service to our nation began when he was drafted into the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1943.
During World War II, he served in an allBlack unit and was responsible for handling and organizing munitions, a duty that often placed him under enemy fire.
His bravery was demonstrated in key campaigns, including in Naples and the Rome-Arno operations in Italy, and his attachment to the 12th and 15th Air Forces and the Mediterranean Allied Air Force.
