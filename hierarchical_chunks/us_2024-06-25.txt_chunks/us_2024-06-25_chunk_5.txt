Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to congratulate 
Mrs. Faythe Petersen of Norfolk, Nebraska on her retirement.
Faythe is a longtime public servant with over 44 years of service with the Norfolk Fire and Rescue.
Over decades, she supported generations of first responders both on call and off.
She assisted with public education programs, helped plan for emergencies and disasters, and coordinated with local, State, and Federal public safety responders.
With her efforts, Norfolk Fire and Rescue was better able to serve the community.
I know she will be greatly missed in the department.
On behalf of the First District of Nebraska, I thank Faythe for her service to the community of Norfolk, and extend best wishes to her on her retirement.
