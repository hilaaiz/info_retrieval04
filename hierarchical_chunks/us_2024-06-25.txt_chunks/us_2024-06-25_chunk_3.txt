Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Open Buffalo and the remarkable work they do to make our community a more just, equitable place for all.
Founded in 2014, Open Buffalo is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing racial, economic, and ecological justice.
Open Buffalo works to make Western New York a community free from discrimination and poverty by prioritizing long-term solutions to address systemic inequities.
Through all of its actions, Open Buffalo leads with the values of empathy, accountability, collaboration, and restorative justice.
Open Buffalo's work takes place through two main avenues--leadership development and advocacy.
They help to create Buffalo's next generation of skilled changemakers, hosting leadership trainings to empower our youth to make a positive difference in our community.
Further, Open Buffalo has increased civic engagement in our community by giving individuals the platform to voice their own opinions and ideas.
Since Open Buffalo's founding, they have been a key advocate in social justice-based change, making a tangible impact on the lives of Western New Yorkers.
Today, I wish to highlight their newest project, the Open Buffalo Ecology Center.
The creation of the ``Eco Center'' will provide 10 acres of community green space on the East Side of Buffalo.
Open Buffalo will host recreational activities and educational events for all in the community to participate in.
For 10 years, Open Buffalo has conducted the grassroots work to make our community a more equitable place for everyone.
Please join me in congratulating Open Buffalo on their 10th Anniversary and thanking them for their remarkable service.
