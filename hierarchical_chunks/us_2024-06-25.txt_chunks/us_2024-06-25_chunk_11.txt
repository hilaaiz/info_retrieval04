Mr. LaTURNER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in appreciation for a member Hunley began in my office in October of 2021 and since then has dedicated her time, energy, and expertise to improving the lives of the people of the Second Congressional District.
From serving as a legislative correspondent and ensuring we provide thoughtful replies to each constituent letter to shaping our office's appropriations process as my legislative director, Jackie has made our office better with her quick wit, work ethic, and desire to serve others.
Jackie has become an adopted Kansan during her time with our team, not least because she met her husband, Chance--a fellow Southeast Kansan, while serving on our staff.
While we will miss her as she has moved on to serve her own home state of Iowa, I extend my deepest gratitude for her time of service to myself and my constituents and look forward to seeing her excel in her new role.
