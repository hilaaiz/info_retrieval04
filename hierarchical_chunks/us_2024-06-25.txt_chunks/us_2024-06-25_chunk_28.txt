Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to recognize Major Russell Bartholow for his 17 years of service with the Nebraska Army National Guard.
Russell Bartholow joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 2007, motivated to do something for our country and for this world.
In 2008, he was sent to Afghanistan, where he spent 22 months serving as the head of a five-person ``Effects Cell.''
He was responsible for developing and conducting civil-military projects in the nine northern Afghanistan provinces.
His team completed 31 projects, including providing innocent children with clothes, food and toys.
Major Bartholow always went above and beyond what was asked of him.
When he saw the innocent children, he worked hard to find them a safe place to play.
He was able to negotiate with Afghan businessmen and elders to raise over $200,000 in funding for a park.
This park included a soccer field, basketball court and merry-go-rounds and provided an oasis of hope and safety for the kids affected by war.
His heart for service and dedication to the children and civilians are further seen in his being awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his coordination of $12 million in funding for roads, schools and clinics.
