Over the past three and a half years, the Biden-Harris administration's policies have put Americans last, diminishing our national security and draining hard-working Western North Carolinians' hard-earned savings.
This administration's failed policies have caused sky-high inflation, record-high gas prices and an unprecedented invasion of our borders.
During my district work period, constituent after constituent--including many small-business owners--have shared about the effects of high prices on running a business.
Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants continue to flood our borders, endangering the safety and well-being of every American.
The radical, sanctuary-city policies are incentivizing illegal immigration, and your hard-earned tax dollars should not be used to serve illegal immigrants and further signal to the world that America's borders are open.
To reverse such harmful policies that are rewarding illegal immigration and to protect women from sex offenders and abusers, I voted for the No Bailout for Sanctuary Cities Act and the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act and will continue to push for policies that serve the best interests
