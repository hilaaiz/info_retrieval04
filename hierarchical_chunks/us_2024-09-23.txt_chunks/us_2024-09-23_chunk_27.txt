The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represents the greatest threat to American values and national security in our lifetime, and we must counter the CCP's efforts to gain leverage over our nation and beyond.
President Xi Jinping has gone so far as to say that he will do whatever it takes to bring Taiwan under his control, including through military force.
From securing our supply chains and protecting American technology to defending American biosecurity and drug manufacturing, the nearly three dozen bills that the House advanced are a step toward reducing China's leverage over the U.S. and strengthening U.S. dominance.
Just one of the bills that I am co-sponsoring and voted for that would directly affect Western North Carolina is the Protecting American Agriculture from Foreign Adversaries Act, which amends the Defense Production Act of 1950 to require the Secretary of Agriculture to be included on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for agriculture-related issues.
It also requires CFIUS to review and potentially block purchases of farmland by foreign adversaries that pose a national security risk.
We cannot allow enemies of the U.S. to buy up America's farmland, which poses a food and national security threat, and I will continue to work with the House to combat the CCP's aggression here at home and overseas.
