Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize Bob Gomez.
Bob is a leader in Republican Legislative District 3, which includes the northern most areas of the 8th Congressional District and a population of over 236,000.
Bob has worked tirelessly to educate, train, and inspire the next generation of citizens through civic engagement.
His efforts to work collaboratively with other leaders have been instrumental to the success of Republican elected officials and candidates in the state legislature and beyond.
I am thankful for his leadership and dedication to conservative principles.
I sincerely appreciate his service to the legislative district and to the state.
