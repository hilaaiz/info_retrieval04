Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention, the outstanding work of Mission Quilters which recently completed their 10,000th quilt that will be donated to global communities in need of basic supplies.
Mission Quilters is a group of about 20 volunteers at the Lord of Life Lutheran Church in Schaumburg, who gather every Thursday morning to stitch quilts.
This tradition dates to 1985, when Carol Langseth, the wife of the church's then-pastor, had the goal of creating handmade quilts to provide comfort to those in need around the world.
I am very pleased to report that just last week, the group reached a milestone with their 10,000th quilt.
These quilts are distributed both locally and to communities in nine countries, through the Lutheran World Relief organization.
Mission Quilters relies on the donations of materials from individual quilters and other organizations.
These materials are then cut and used to create a variety of quilts.
Volunteers participate in the process by sewing and layering the quilt squares.
Working together, they produce at least four quilts per week.
In fact, the quilts produced by Mission Quilters could cover 185 football fields and stretch 22,222 yards.
The finished quilts are first used
