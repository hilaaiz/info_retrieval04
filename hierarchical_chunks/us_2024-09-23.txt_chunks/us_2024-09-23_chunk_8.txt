Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating AltaMed on this historic milestone as an exceptional health care leader, advancing quality care for Latino, multi-ethnic, and underserved communities in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, and helping other Community Health Centers throughout the state scale up their efforts to address health disparities through transformational change.
