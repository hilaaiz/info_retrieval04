Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, it is my honor to recognize someone who has been a force in the North Phoenix area, Basil Fernimos.
Basil is a founding member of the North Valley Constitutional Republican Club.
As a passionate constitutionalist, Basil has been responsible for organizing and leading conservative efforts in the northern parts of our congressional district.
I am thankful for Basil's efforts and dedication to bring awareness and educate the public.
I sincerely appreciate his service to the 8th Congressional District and to the state.
