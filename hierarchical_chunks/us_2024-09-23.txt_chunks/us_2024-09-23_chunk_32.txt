It was a privilege to welcome members of WNC Chambers of Commerce for their retreat during which they focused on problem-solving and opportunities to improve workforce development and local economies.
America's risk takers and job creators have long been under attack from Washington, and I'm striving to reduce regulations, create a better tax climate, and help develop a workforce that provides opportunity and fuels our economy by fixing how Washington works.
With my warmest regards, Chad Edwards, Member.
