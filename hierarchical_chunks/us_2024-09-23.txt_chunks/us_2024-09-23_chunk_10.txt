Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Hanover volunteer Fire Department of Hanover, Illinois for celebrating their 135th anniversary.
In the 1800's, Hanover's file protection was virtually non-existent.
The Hanover community rallied together to organize a fire company and purchased a Button hand fire engine in the summer of 1889.
Later in 1890, a 414-pound fire alarm bell was gifted to the fire company by the ladies of Hanover and a tower was built on the North side of the town hall to house it.
On January 29, 1924, a new volunteer fire company was organized by twenty-two men.
In the summer of 1942, the War Public Works Fire Station was built and was used by the Hanover Fire Department until another building, located at 201 Fillmore Street, was completed in 1970.
The Hanover Fire Department remains at that Fillmore Street location to this day.
The illustrious history of the Hanover Fire Department is a testament to the strong spirit of community present in Illinois and demonstrates the importance of first responders and their service.
As a Member of Congress, I will continue to support Illinois communities like Hanover and their emergency first responders who honorably serve their communities.
For 135 years, the Hanover Fire Department has served the residents volunteer fire department in Illinois.
Today, we celebrate the Department and commend its multitude of volunteer fire fighters for their dedication to Hanover.
I extend my sincere congratulations to the Hanover Volunteer Fire Department of Illinois for a successful 135 years, and I wish them even more success going forward.
