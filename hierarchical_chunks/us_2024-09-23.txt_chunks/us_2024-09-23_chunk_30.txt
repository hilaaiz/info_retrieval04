The National Federation of Independent Business is a voice for small businesses across our nation, and I'm grateful to have been selected for this year's Small Business Guardian Award.
As someone whose background is in business, I understand the challenges that Main Street faces, including heavy-handed government regulations.
We need more pro-growth, pro-smallbusiness policies so that small businesses can thrive and create jobs.
