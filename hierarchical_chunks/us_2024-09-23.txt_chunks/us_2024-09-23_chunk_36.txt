to adorn the pews of the Lord of Life Lutheran Church and, after being blessed, are sent to various parts of the world.
For nearly 40 years, Mission Quilters have donated their quilts to countries such as Georgia, Tanzania, Ukraine, Angola, Mali, Guatemala, and the Democratic Republic of Congo Mission Quilters' quilts have also comforted Syrian refugees in Lebanon, as well as in other parts of the world that are affected by war.
Locally, they have kept our communities warm, by distributing their quilts through organizations such as North Side Housing and Supportive Services in Chicago, WINGS, and Lutheran Social Services of Illinois for those in need.
The men and women of Mission Quilters embody public service at its best.
As their representative in Congress, I am deeply honored to recognize the significant contributions.
They have helped to bring families together and provided support to those affected by war and natural disasters through their quilting.
It is for this impact that I wish to extend my gratitude and appreciation to the Mission Quilters.
