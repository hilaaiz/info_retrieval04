Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mr. Joshua Martoma, a beacon of inspiration and the recipient of the prestigious Silver Knight Award in the social science discipline.
This award, a testament to his exceptional academic prowess and remarkable community service, is bestowed upon high school students in Broward and Miami-Dade County.
Joshua is a shining example of turning adversity into triumph.
His father served time in federal prison during Joshua's youth, which inspired him to cofound the nonprofit KidsMates alongside his two younger siblings.
To assist children who also grew up with a family member who was incarcerated.
His organization donated over 5,000 books, games, and movies to federal prison rooms, reaching prisons in 23 states.
He is passionate about informing the public of this crisis, and his essay titled ``Parental Incarceration Is a Silent American Epidemic More Common Than Childhood Asthma'' addresses this issue.
His essay placed him in the Top 11 winners of The Learning Network's 10th Annual Student Editorial contest and was published in the New York Times.
