Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the South Redford School District as they celebrate the grand opening of their Innovation Center.
The Innovation Center proudly offers new programming for building trades, culinary paths, welding, health professions, and hospitality.
This new programming will open innumerable doors to so many students within the district, ensuring that they find what fits their passions.
The Center is also equipped to ensure that its students have the needed career preparatory skills to succeed after graduation.
These skills include the creation of an Educational Development Plan, apprenticeship programs, and paid or non-paid internships.
Additionally, the Center works to guide its students into any path they choose to embark on.
This means that they put an important focus on aiding their employability or assisting them with navigating postsecondary institutions.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in celebrating the opening of Redford School District's Innovation Center and the subsequent launch of their newest programming.
