Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary individual from my district, Reverend Dr. Yvonne Kaye, whose dedication and contributions as a mental health professional have profoundly impacted the Bucks County region and beyond for over five decades.
Dr. Yvonne Kaye, a graduate of the University of London, moved to our community in 1968.
She furthered her education by earning degrees from Marywood University and Columbia Pacific University in Thanatology.
Throughout her illustrious career, Dr. Kaye has been a beacon of hope and support for those navigating the challenges of grief.
In collaboration with Dr. Larry Schmitzer, she championed Triumph, an organization dedicated to instilling hope among individuals in the medical and education sectors.
Dr. Kaye's impact extended beyond traditional avenues of support.
For eighteen years, she hosted the Dr. Yvonne Kaye Show on WWDB radio, providing a platform for individuals to engage in meaningful conversations and receive invaluable guidance on various life challenges.
The unwavering support of her partner of twenty-seven years, John Roberts, played a pivotal role in Dr. Kaye's journey.
Although John is no longer with us, his influence continues to inspire her work and dedication to serving others.
Dr. Kaye's nurturing spirit extends to her family and the wider community.
Her involvement with the Cancer Support Community at Gilda's Club in Warminster since its inception in 2003 underscores her enduring commitment to supporting those in need.
Dr. Yvonne Kaye's multifaceted contributions as a mother, grandmother, storyteller, writer, published author, thanatologist, humorist, and former radio show personality reflect her profound dedication to uplifting and enriching the lives of others.
Her resilience, empathy, and unwavering commitment to the well-being of our community are truly commendable.
Dr. Kaye's work in bereavement, particularly with families who have lost children, serves as a testament to her compassion and dedication to healing.
In recognition of her outstanding service and positive impact, we extend our deepest gratitude to Dr. Yvonne Kaye.
May she continue to inspire and uplift those around her for years to come.
