Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent of my district, Solebury Police Chief Dominick P. Bellizzie who is retiring on July 1, 2024 after 48 years of dedicated and faithful service to the citizens of Southeastern Pennsylvania.
After high school, Dominick joined the United States Navy where he served prior to his law enforcement career.
He found his lifelong career on May 17, 1975 when he started as a police officer at the City of Philadelphia Police Department, working in patrol, investigations, administration, and narcotics.
Dominick has had extensive police training, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
Chief Bellizzie was also selected by the International Association of Chiefs methods.
In 2002, Chief Bellizzie became the Chief of Police for the City of Coatesville Police Department in Chester County, Pennsylvania.
He left Coatesville Police Department in 2006 to lead the Solebury Township Police Department.
Under the leadership of Chief Dominick Bellizzie, the Solebury Township Police Department was transformed from a pre-21st century department to an innovative community-based police department.
The principles of leadership, service, honesty, integrity, humility, purpose, and trust were part of Dominick's devotion to law enforcement and his officers.
I wish to congratulate Dominick on his almost five decades of service to the citizens of Bucks, Chester, and Philadelphia Counties, and on his well-deserved retirement from the Solebury Township Police Department.
