Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Holocaust Survivor Day.
On June 4th, we come together to celebrate the survivors for their bravery, sacrifices, and lives.
Holocaust survivors are our teachers, and it is our collective responsibility to pass on the legacy of their testimonies.
I would like to recognize and honor the following survivors Frances Gaspar, 103 years old; Chaim Greenberg, 102 years old; Lucy Blicker, 102 years old; Elaine Lefkowitz, 101 years old; Hana Altarac, 104 years old; Allan Feld, 105 years old; Rena Reiter, 101 years old; Rosa Lindenberg, 100 years old; Rose Boyarsky, 100 years old; Herman Haller, 100 years old; Betty Eisdorfer, 100 years old; Estelle Dreese, 100 years old; David Elefant, 100 years old; Miriam Rozenbaum, 100 years old; and Lena Porter, 100 years old.
