Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ms. Sophie Whiteside, a truly exceptional individual who has been bestowed with the Silver Knight Award in the speech discipline.
This award, a symbol of academic excellence and community service, is a testament to Sophie's outstanding achievements and her significant contributions to her community.
It recognizes her dedication, talent, and the positive impact she has made in the lives of others.
Sophie's intelligence and eloquence can be seen in her success as a two-time Tournament of Champions Bid Earner for debate.
Her dedication is displayed through her participation in twenty national-level speech and debate tournaments, and her talent led her to place sixth in the State of Florida for policy debate by the National Speech and Debate Organization.
She has also been a beacon of kindness to the elderly community, as she was inspired to establish the Sending Sunshine Pine Crest Chapter in 2021 in honor of her grandmother, who passed away after suffering from dementia in her later years.
Through this nonprofit, she has worked tirelessly alongside her team of 260 members to make the elderly feel appreciated by sending over 5,300 handwritten letters to local and international senior homes.
