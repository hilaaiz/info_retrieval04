Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Caribbean American Heritage Month to celebrate the contributions of Caribbean-Americans to Michigan's 12th Congressional District and all across our Nation.
National Caribbean American Heritage Month was first recognized in 2005.
This was the culmination of many years of efforts by organizations around the world to spotlight the numerous contributions to our Nation.
Caribbean Community Services, a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, Michigan, has proudly uplifted that history.
They routinely host numerous events that celebrate the rich cultural heritage of the Caribbean and its impact on our communities in southeastern Michigan.
I am incredibly proud of the important work Caribbean Social Services undertakes to foster diverse and welcoming communities.
I especially want to highlight their leadership in ensuring these contributions are recognized and valued as we celebrate Caribbean American Heritage Month.
Please join me in recognizing National Caribbean American Heritage Month and the contributions of Caribbean Americans across our Nation and the 12th Congressional District.
