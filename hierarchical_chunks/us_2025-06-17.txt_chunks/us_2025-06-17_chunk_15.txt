Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, last week the Republican Majority in the House of Representatives decided that they know better than the residents of the District of Columbia what their local government needs.
All Members of Congress are sent here by our constituents to represent their interests, and to vote on matters of federal importance.
We aren't sent here to rule on specific local ordinances or funding decisions made by the cities and counties in any of our districts.
Yet Republicans have brought three bills to the floor--H.R. 884, H.R. 2056, and H.R. 2096--to do exactly that.
They want to tell the District of Columbia's 700,000 residents that the laws and policies they have voted for, and that were crafted by their local elected officials, are null and void.
