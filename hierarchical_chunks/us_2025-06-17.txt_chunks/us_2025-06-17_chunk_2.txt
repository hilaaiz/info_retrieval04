Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Dave Olson, President and Program Manager at Savannah River Mission Completion (SRMC), upon retirement after more than 40 years of dedicated work and service.
Before being named President and Program Manager, Dr. Olson served as the president of the former Savannah River Site (SRS) liquid waste contractor.
He has years of experience in safety, security, project and risk management, maintenance and engineering in nuclear materials processing, and much more.
SRMC is responsible for the safe reduction of curies in aging waste tanks at SRS.
As one of the Department of Energy's largest production sites, SRS performs actives ranging from environmental cleanup and protection to nuclear materials storage and disposition.
Under the leadership.
Olson, SRMC has worked more than 21 million hours without an injury that has caused a missed worked day, ensured that all facilities are operating safely and efficiently, and met five key regulatory milestones to remove waste from and clean tanks to prepare them for operational closure.
Dr. Olson has many accomplishments to be proud of and has aided greatly in the success of SRMC.
Best wishes for a wonderful retirement.
I am appreciative for all he has done for South Carolina.
