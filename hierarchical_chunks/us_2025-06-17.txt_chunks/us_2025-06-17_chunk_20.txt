Mr. Choi understands that Taekwondo is more than a martial art--it is a means of storytelling, cultural connection, and youth empowerment.
Through his leadership and mentorship, he has inspired students across North Texas to embrace both the physical and philosophical dimensions By nurturing discipline and pride within a diverse community, Mr. Choi has built a lasting legacy.

We commend 
Mr. Choi for using sport as a bridge across generations and communities.
