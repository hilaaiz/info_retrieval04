Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pamela Ott on the occasion of her retirement after more than two decades of distinguished service to the City of Pleasanton, California.
Pamela has dedicated over 22 years to serving Pleasanton with vision, leadership and unwavering commitment to public service.
She began her career in Pleasanton as Executive Director of the Downtown Association and joined the city government in 2003 as the Economic Development Director.
In 2021, she was appointed Assistant City Manager, a role in which she has excelled in until her retirement on June 20, 2025.
Pamela holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Florida and a Master's in Organization Development from the University of San Francisco.
In addition to her public service, she has given her time to local causes, including the Valley Humane Society Board and the Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley Advisory Board.
Throughout her career, Pamela has played a vital role in shaping Pleasanton's economic development.
She led major business recruitment efforts that brought transformative companies such as Workday, 10x Genomics, and Veeva Systems to the city.
Her work on the Johnson Drive Economic Development Zone helped deliver a vibrant new commercial hub, including a Costco and two new hotels.
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Pamela took swift action to support local businesses by designing and implementing innovative recovery programs that helped them stay afloat and connected to their customers.
Her leadership was essential during a time of great uncertainty and change.
As a Pleasanton resident since 2001, Pamela has been more than a public servant, she has been a dedicated neighbor, a compassionate leader, and a steadfast champion for her community.
As she steps into retirement, I offer my deepest gratitude for her service and wish her all the best as she is afforded more time with her husband, Jim, and daughters, Melissa and Kelsey.
