noncitizens to vote in local elections.
I have serious concerns with allowing noncitizens who do not hold a green card to vote in local elections, but this is the wrong way to go about addressing that.
I voted present because I can't support repealing a local D.C. law, but I do support having a conversation about how we define voter eligibility nationwide.
I voted No on H.R. 2096, the Protecting Our Nation's Capital Emergency Act, because it would repeal part of a local D.C. law to give the police department increased authority to address incidents of serious misconduct and discipline officers.
I voted No on H.R. 2056 because we shouldn't be nullifying a local law to tell an individual police department where they must divert their resources and how they can best serve their community, including residents who are immigrants.
