Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Sabra Raymer is a firefighter paramedic with over six years of experience in emergency response, known for her humility, resilience, and deep committment to serving others.
Like anyone else, she is navigating life's challenges while striving to leave the world better than she found it.
She doesn't seek recognition for titles or accolades but takes pride in being someone who will extend a hand when others are down, bring calm to chaos, and offer comfort during life's hardest moments.
Raised with strong values of integrity, respect, and love, Sabra credits her parents for shaping her character and purpose.
Her journey hasn't been easy--she put herself through school, experienced personal lows, and worked relentlessly to rebuild and rise.
She knows that life will test you, but believes that anything can be overcome with heart and determination.
Her dedication has been recognized with a Community Service Award in March 2021, a Letter of Commendation in August 2021, and her courageous role in Hurricane Ian water rescue operations, for which she received a Campaign Ribbon in February 2024.
With a heart for advocacy and inclusion, Sabra also helped design and launch Pride shirts for her county, raising awareness and fostering a culture of belonging within the department.
Through this initiative, she helped raise over $900 for the Zebra Youth Foundation, supporting LGBTQ+ youth in Central Florida.
Now in the process of becoming a peer support advocate, Sabra is especially passionate about mental health awareness in the fire service--an industry that can sometimes make individuals feel invisible or out of place.
With the support of her County and community allies, she proudly stands up for those who need to feel seen, supported, and valued.
She continues to serve not only as a first responder but as a voice, a helper, and a source of strength for those in need.
