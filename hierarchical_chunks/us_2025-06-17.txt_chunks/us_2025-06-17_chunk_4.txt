Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate six decades of the Aquarium.
An interactive water exhibit that celebrates the natural wonders of our aquatic world and provides a deeper educational understanding of our diverse ecosystems, the Aquarium is a gem of Western New York's cultural and educational institutions.
The Aquarium of Niagara was one of the first of its kind.
Founded in 1965 by a small group of chemists and scientists, it served as a successful model for inland aquariums around the world.
Upon its opening, it became the first inland aquarium to develop and use artificial seawater to maintain exhibits; this sparked a revolutionary practice now used in most inland aquariums.
Located in Niagara Falls, New York, the Aquarium of Niagara welcomes over 200,000 visitors each year and is the only aquatic museum within 250 miles of the United States.
They serve as a hub for educating the community on aquatic life, consisting of two buildings and housing 180 species.
Visitors come to see an array of mammals, penguins, and more than 1,200 fish and vertebrae, many of those being rescued species.
Additionally, they provide guests with visual experiences to explore all of their marine life exhibits.
There is a variety of scheduled programming offered daily as well as hands-on experiences that create inspiring opportunities for visitors.
Today, we honor one of Western New York's one-of-a-kind establishments and its commitment to bringing the wonders of the seas to visitors from around the world while providing the highest quality of animal care possible.
Please join me in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Aquarium of Niagara and their achievements and continued success as they remain an enduring source of connection to marine life for generations to come.
