Tomorrow—on Friday the 13th—the EU’s general product safety regulation comes into effect.
Businesses are telling me that the  additional costs will mean that they can no longer sell to the EU and to Northern Ireland.
What steps is the Department taking to ensure that small businesses are supported as the regulation comes into effect?
As the hon.
Lady rightly pointed out, the regulation comes into force tomorrow.
Actually, it covers things that most businesses are doing already, but we have provided guidance for businesses, including online marketplaces, on how the regulation will apply in Northern Ireland.
We will continue to engage with businesses and online marketplaces to ensure that we are supporting them in dealing with this new regulation.
I declare an interest as an officer of the all-party parliamentary group on critical minerals.
Although Cornwall sits on some of the richest deposits of critical minerals in the world, including tin and lithium in my constituency of Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, there are significant geological reserves right across the United Kingdom, including in the north of England, Northern Ireland and the lands of our Celtic cousins in Wales and Scotland.
Will the Minister confirm that domestic critical mineral production and processing will form a key part of the Government’s industrial strategy?
