I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important issue.
As she knows, the national prescribing position in England remains that gluten-free bread and mixes are provided to everybody who requires them, but, as she says, the local integrated care boards are now responsible for arranging provision in their areas.
I will ensure that the Health Secretary has heard her question and gives her a full reply.
