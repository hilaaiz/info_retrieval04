I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question, and for his interest in his constituents and their jobs in the steel industry.
As he says, we have met to talk about this, and I have nothing new to add today,  other than that we continue with our conversations with British Steel.
We are working as fast as we can.
Obviously, it is ultimately up to British Steel to decide what it wants to do and take forward, but we stand ready to support and work with it.
