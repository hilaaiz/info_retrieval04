The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support the steel industry in South Yorkshire.
The steel industry has been in decline, and we intend to turn this around.
That is why we are developing a steel strategy, investing up to £2.5 billion and working at pace.
The steel sector in South Yorkshire and across the UK has been neglected for too long, and we intend to change that.
Stocksbridge Speciality Steels in my constituency is a world-leading plant, with specialist capability to produce cleaner and stronger high-grade steel for our aerospace industry.
The plant supports hundreds of jobs and has an exceptional on-site skills training centre, with links to local universities.
Will the Secretary of State meet me to discuss the future strategic significance of Stocksbridge Speciality Steels and its fundamental importance to our national steel industry?
