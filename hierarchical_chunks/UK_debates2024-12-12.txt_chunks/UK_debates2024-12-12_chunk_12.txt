I welcome the hon.
Member’s question.
She is right that some of the issues that most affect businesses in our constituencies often sit in other Departments.
The role of my Department is to focus on and champion those issues across all of Government, whether they sit neatly in the Department or not.
She correctly highlights the incredible and important role that rural businesses play, and their social as well as economic benefits.
Her points about transport were well made.
One of the big changes in the Budget was the ability to focus on long-term investments, which was recognised by the Office for Budget Responsibility in its assessment that the productive potential of the UK will grow significantly over the next decade because of that increased  focus—investment, investment, investment.
Transport is a great element of that, whether in my constituency or in hers.
I assure her that the needs that she articulates are considered at the highest levels of Government.
