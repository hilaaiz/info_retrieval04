I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that important matter.
Given the sums of money involved, I can understand why that is a substantial issue for businesses in her constituency.
It relates to the duties that were charged at a time of significant political uncertainty.
This is a Treasury issue relating to taxation, but I promise we will get her the meeting she needs, and work with her to ensure that she gets the answers she requests for her constituents.
