I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important matter.
He is right to highlight the importance of grassroots sport, culture and others to our local communities and high streets.
He will be aware that we have a curriculum review at the moment.
We are also ensuring there is funding for grassroots sport in England, and he might want to note that the Government’s plans for devolution and supporting our high streets will be announced imminently to this House.
