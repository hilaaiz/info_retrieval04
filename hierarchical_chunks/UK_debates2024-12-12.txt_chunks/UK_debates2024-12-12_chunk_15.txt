I commend my hon.
Friend on her work with the Ramsgate empty shops action group.
Her experience on her high street is sadly echoed up and down the country—under the Conservative party, vacancy rates on our high streets shot up.
High street rental auctions, which are the new powers that my hon.
Friend alludes to, will help local councils to bring vacant units back into use, working with local communities.
That will hopefully help to drive co-operation between landlords and councils and make town centre tenancies more accessible and affordable.
We are encouraging local authorities to take advantage of those powers.
As I suspect my hon.
Friend already knows, colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government are looking to do further work in this space.
