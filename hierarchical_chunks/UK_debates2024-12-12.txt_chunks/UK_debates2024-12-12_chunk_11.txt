Small businesses are at the heart of our local communities.
Firms such as Carbon ThreeSixty in my constituency are cutting-edge manufacturers of carbon fibre products.
However, its growth as a small business is seriously affected by its ability to attract and retain quality staff, predominantly because of the poor public transport and completely non-existent cycle routes.
These issues cut right across Departments.
I would therefore be grateful if the Secretary of State could confirm what discussions he has had with ministerial colleagues in other Departments about how rural transport infrastructure would greatly support small and medium-sized businesses.
