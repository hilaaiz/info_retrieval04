Leicestershire police has signed a reported £800,000 contract with Palantir—a company that has a worrying history of racial profiling and surveillance concerns in the USA.
It has since removed all the contract details from the public record, and the Home Office holds no central records of such a deal.
What reassurances can the Home Secretary give that the people of Leicester are protected from intrusive and discriminatory policing practices?
How can transparency and oversight be upheld in such partnerships where no central records are kept?
I wonder whether the hon.
Gentleman might write to me with the details of what he has outlined.
If so, I will look at them.
