What steps her Department is taking to help tackle knife crime.
We have taken action to ban zombie knives, and the ban on ninja swords will come in this August.
We are also bringing forward Ronan’s law, which puts stronger restrictions on online sales, through the Crime and Policing Bill.
There will also be additional funding, through the hotspot action fund, for high-visibility patrols in the areas with the most knife crime and antisocial behaviour.
