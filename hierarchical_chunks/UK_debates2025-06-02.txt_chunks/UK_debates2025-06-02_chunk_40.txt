I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
As she will know from the many times I have said it before, I do regularly remind the Cabinet that this is an important aspect of being a Cabinet Minister, or indeed a Minister.
We are doing our very best to make sure that there are regular oral statements to this House on important matters and that they are brought here first.
In the absence of an oral statement, there is a written ministerial statement, of which notice is given the day before so that colleagues have ample time, as she says, to properly scrutinise all these announcements.
