We also have to balance statements with the rest of the day’s business.
I would point out to colleagues that we have an important Second Reading debate today, with dozens and dozens of Members down to speak.
We are now having two urgent questions before a very important statement and then other business as well.
We do have to balance these things in the House’s interests, but the statement is being made to the House today.
The Defence Secretary will shortly be in his place, and I am sure he will spend a long time answering questions on it.
I am sure that criticism was not aimed at me for granting two UQs.
The reason I have granted two UQS is that the Government did not come here first with the strategic defence review.
If they had, we would not be having the UQs and there would be no pressure on time.
Trust, integrity and transparency must be the watchwords of our politics, but those principles were worn extremely thin under the previous Government.
What steps is the Leader of the House taking to redouble our commitment to trust and integrity, because our constituents expect no less?
