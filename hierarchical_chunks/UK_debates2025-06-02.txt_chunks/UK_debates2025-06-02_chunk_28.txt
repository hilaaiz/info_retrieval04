I welcome what my hon.
Friend has said; this is a problem up and down the land.
At the moment, police forces are doing their best, but the Crime and Policing Bill will allow them to seize vehicles that are being used in an antisocial way, without having to give any warnings, and then to destroy them.
That is the way forward, but I pay tribute to the work that is already ongoing with police forces.
