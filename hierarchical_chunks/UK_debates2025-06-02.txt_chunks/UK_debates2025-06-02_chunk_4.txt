The problem with the immigration system we inherited is that it had very high levels of low-skilled immigration, but what the economy actually needs is low levels of high-skilled immigration.
We need to attract worldwide top talent for some key sectors, many of which are based in Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, so that we remain globally competitive, but businesses tell me that long visa processing times work against that.
Now that we are seeing lower levels of immigration, will the Government be reprioritising resources
so we see faster processing of skilled worker visas?
