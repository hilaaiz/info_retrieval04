I think the word the Leader of the House was looking for was “sorry”.
There is much in this place which, as we know, is complicated and arcane, but the ministerial code is crystal clear on this point.
The job of the Leader of the House is to represent this place and Back Benchers of all parties around the Cabinet table to make sure that this place hears things of such vital importance first.
As important as public transport is, may I suggest that the defence of the realm is a little more important than the Government’s buses Bill, which will have no Divisions this evening?
Will the Leader of the House please tell us why she thinks No. 10 is getting this so wrong and what she is doing to try to put it right?
I am certainly sorry if members of the media have been given sight of the SDR ahead of Members of this House.
My understanding is that it is being published for the first time in this House today.
As I said earlier, we have put on a statement; that was always our intention.
We were always going to have a major statement today on the SDR and that is indeed what we have done.
Even though there is other important business today, MPs from across the House will have ample opportunity—I am sure they will take that opportunity—to scrutinise the Defence Secretary not only today but on future occasions via Select Committees and elsewhere.
I declare an interest, as a member of the Modernisation Committee.
I thank you, Mr Speaker, for standing up for us Back Benchers and for granting so many urgent questions—I say that as someone who speaks in most of them on behalf of the people of Harlow.
Does the Leader of the House agree that part of the Government’s remit is to modernise and to bring back trust in politics?
Will she outline what she has been doing to that end and the work that the Committee has been doing to make this place more accessible?
