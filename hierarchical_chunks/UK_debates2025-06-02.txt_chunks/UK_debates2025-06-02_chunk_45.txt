I thank my hon.
Friend for that question, and I do find it slightly strange that Conservative Members seem to think that they are somehow now the upholders of parliamentary democracy and standards in Parliament.
I am afraid that some of us have much longer memories.
We are taking steps to raise standards, behaviour and the culture in this House, and indeed to make sure that the House is respected.
