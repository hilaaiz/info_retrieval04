I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this matter, and I am very happy to meet her.
The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is working to ensure that those who need to leave Gaza, and are able and eligible to do so, are supported in that.
I am very happy to look at this matter with my hon.
Friend.
