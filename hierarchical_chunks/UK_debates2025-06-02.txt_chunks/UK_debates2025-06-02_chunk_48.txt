I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work he does on the Modernisation Committee.
He will know that one of the remits we have set out for the Committee is to ensure more time for Back Benchers to scrutinise Government business.
That is a key part of modernising Parliament, and it will ensure that this Chamber is, and will be in the future, the real crucible of national debate that we want it to be.
I am sure we will see that today and on other days.
