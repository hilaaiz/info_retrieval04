I thank the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister for visiting my constituency last week after the horrific incident following  the Liverpool football club victory parade.
Will the Home Secretary join me in congratulating the emergency services on acting so swiftly, but also in condemning the Reform UK party and the far right for trying to stoke up hatred?
Can she explain how her Department will tackle this misinformation to prevent further action in future?
