I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his kind words at the beginning of his question.
He is absolutely right that part of my job, which I take incredibly seriously, is to uphold this House in Government, and to ensure that the rest of the Government respect this House, come to this House to be scrutinised, and are open, transparent and available to this House.
It is a message that I relay very regularly and I am sure I will relay it again later today.
I say gently to him that Government announcements do happen outside of Parliament sitting, and that has long been the case.
Managing announcements over the course of a few days can often be a challenge, but I reassure him that on the strategic defence review, we were always going to make the statement to the House today, with the publishing and the laying of the 150-page document to the House first.
I reiterate that there is a balance to be struck.
People want time to read and digest before they can question the Defence Secretary.
That is always a balance, too.
