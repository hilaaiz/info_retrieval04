I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He will be aware that visa processing times can vary based on the type of visa and where people are applying from.
However, for most applications, even those made outside the UK, decisions are usually made within three weeks.
He will also be aware that we are looking at how to reform our immigration system as a result of the record levels of net migration under the previous Government, and making sure that we focus our immigration on the needs of our economy is a priority for this Government.
