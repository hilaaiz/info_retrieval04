I thank the Secretary of State for her answer.
My constituents around Weston Shore have had enough of exactly the kind of thing she describes.
Antisocial motorbikes are racing outside their homes every night.
The constant noise disturbs everyone’s sleep, yet they have seen no meaningful enforcement in recent years.
The Secretary of State has outlined that further powers are coming.
Will she confirm that she expects local police forces to use these powers fully to tackle this issue seriously, so that this blight on my constituents’ lives can be stopped?
