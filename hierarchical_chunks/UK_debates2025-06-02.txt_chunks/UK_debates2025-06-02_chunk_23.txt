Another group for whom the immigration White Paper is creating uncertainty is refugee families.
Family reunion is a vital route by which refugees can safely reach the UK, free from the grasps of criminal trafficking gangs.
The Government should be looking for more ways to facilitate refugee family reunion, not hindering it.
It is unclear how the White Paper’s reforms on English language requirements will apply to refugee family reunion.
Will the Minister acknowledge the needs of this unique and vulnerable group?
Is she able to provide clarity on the level of  English language proficiency that people who apply for refugee family reunion will be expected to have once the reforms are implemented?
