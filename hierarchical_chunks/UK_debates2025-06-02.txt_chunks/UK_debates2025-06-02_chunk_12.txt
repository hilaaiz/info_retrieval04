I thank the Home Secretary for her response.
In Kent we are using section 59 powers to confiscate bikes, including in Snodland and Walderslade in my constituency.
However, the police have stated that  the legislation is not powerful enough, and that they welcome powers to seize bikes.
Can we ensure that police inspectors and police and crime commissioners are given guidance and that the number of vehicles seized is monitored, so that we can stop this problem once and for all?
