Last month, I had the honour of visiting RBSL—Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land—in my constituency.
Along with many defence companies and organisations, it is so proud of its effort to help Britain to defend itself here and around the world.
The SDR provides certainty to industry, but we need to go further to ensure that every Government agency, body and Department—from skills and infrastructure to planning and the availability of land—gets behind its ethos.
Does the Secretary of State agree that creating growth cluster zones will provide certainty to local communities and assist in that mission?
Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
We have followed—[Interruption.]
You want an answer from me, Mr Speaker, and I will certainly give you this: we have followed the procedure from the last defence review, when the shadow Defence Secretary,  the hon.
Member for South Suffolk (James Cartlidge) , was a Defence Minister.
I was the shadow Defence Secretary at that time.
We had no advance copy of the defence review.
We were not offered a briefing, which I have offered him and the other Front Benchers.
I am really concerned to ensure that the House has proper access to the report, but we have been following convention.
You are quite right, Mr Speaker, that copies of the defence review are in the Vote Office, as is established procedure.
They would normally be made available when I sat down after my statement.
In these circumstances, following your encouragement, I suggest that Members of this House be given access to them in advance of my statement.
