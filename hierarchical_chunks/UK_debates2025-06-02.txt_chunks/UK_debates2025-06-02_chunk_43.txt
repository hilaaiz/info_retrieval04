I thank the hon.
Member for that.
I will make no apology for the fact that we are doing lots of things—we are making lots of announcements, and we are delivering the change the country voted for—and that does bring with it competing demands.
As I say, when the House is in session, statements and updates will be made to this House first.
Sometimes that will be via a written ministerial statement and sometimes it will be by an oral statement—it depends.
