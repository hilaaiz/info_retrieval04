My hon.
Friend is exactly right.
The issue he raises will resonate with people across the country; whether it is Southampton or south Tyneside, too many areas are facing the blight of off-road bikes and street racing.
At the moment, the police have to give people multiple warnings.
It can be two strikes or three strikes and the bikes are still on the streets.
That is not good enough.
We want to make it much easier for the police, so that it is one strike and out.
