As the right hon.
Member is now the shadow Lord Chancellor, may I remind him that we do not comment on cases that are sub judice?
That includes commentary that everyone is aware relates to cases currently going through our legal processes.
What I will say is that those are independent decisions for the Crown Prosecution Service, which ultimately decides what charges to bring.
In live police investigations into complex cases, it is appropriate that those investigations, the charging decisions and, ultimately, the cases are done by the independent parts of the process and that there is no interference from Government.
May I also say that we will be returning to this matter straight after the case, as Members right around the House, including me, have great concerns?
I assure the House that we will come back to this subject, but, in the meantime, the trial must go ahead.
In Stoke-on-Trent, survivors of rape and sexual assault are supported by the local charity, Savana, which is dependent on rape and sexual abuse funding and funding that it receives from the police and crime commissioner to provide its counselling and independent sexual violence advocate service.
Will the Minister help it with its budget setting by confirming today when it will receive its settlement figures, and give an indication as to whether those figures will be similar to last year’s allocations?
May I also invite her to come to Stoke-on-Trent to see the amazing work that it does?
