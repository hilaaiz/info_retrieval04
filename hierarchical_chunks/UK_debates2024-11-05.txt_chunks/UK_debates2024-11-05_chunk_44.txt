I thank the Minister for his response and for reiterating the importance of getting regional air connections right, as that can help to underpin economic growth.
I hope he agrees that we should not allow ourselves to be distracted.
Does he agree that large parts of our country could be better served by better regional rail connections, which would hopefully reduce some of the congestion at our airports?
