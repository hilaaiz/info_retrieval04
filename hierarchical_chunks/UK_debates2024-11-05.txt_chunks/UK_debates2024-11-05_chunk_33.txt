I have gone soft.
I know that the issue of connectivity across the UK is of great interest to the hon.
Gentleman and many of his constituents, as connectivity strengthens the bond between our communities.
Cancellations affect passengers and businesses, who rely on punctual services and connections, and have an impact on confidence.
It is the responsibility of airlines and airports to work together to minimise delays and cancellations.
Connectivity across our country is vital; the Government jointly fund three public service obligation routes to London, including from Derry/Londonderry.
However, the UK aviation market operates predominantly in the private sector, and it is for airports to invest in their infrastructure and for airlines to determine the routes that they operate.
I recognise the importance of Belfast City and Belfast International airports for local communities and businesses.
The Department for Transport is actively engaging with regional airports, including those in Northern Ireland, to understand how the Government can support and unlock opportunities for growth.
