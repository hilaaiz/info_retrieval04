I thank the hon.
Lady for that really important question, and I urge everyone in the House to get involved in the 16 days of activism—this year’s theme is “It starts with me”, which I think is a lesson that we should all take on board.
The Prison Service assesses the impact of online influences and  the need for rehabilitation for convicted terrorists in the first year after their sentencing, but digital citizenship education forms just one part of that rehabilitation.
Once we get our prison population under suitable  control—following what happened under the previous Government—we will be able to do more of this  important work.
Offenders convicted of violence  against women and girls are also eligible for accredited programmes, although that will depend on their assessed risk and need.
