I thank my hon.
Friend for her bravery and for speaking out about her experiences as a victim-survivor, which has undoubtedly helped countless others.
She is right that this will take every single Department across Government looking into how we stamp out violence against women and girls in our communities and society.
She is also right about funding.
We are currently looking through the funding we received at the Budget, and in due course I will be able to outline how we will support services.
If she would like me to meet her to discuss this further, I shall be happy to do so.
