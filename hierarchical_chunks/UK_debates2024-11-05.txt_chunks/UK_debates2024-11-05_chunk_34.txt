I thank the Minister for that answer.
Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
We would not have a United Kingdom without her, and Members in this Chamber would be a lot poorer for the lack of Northern Ireland.
We are thankful to be a part of these British isles, and have fought hard to remain so.
However, being a part constitutionally and being a part practically are very different things, and the fact is that people need to take a plane or a boat to come across to the mainland.
Three million passengers travelled on scheduled domestic flights in the UK between July and September 2021, and the third and fourth most popular routes were between Belfast and London.
We have a huge share of domestic routes, and the reason is clear: people in these parts of the United Kingdom have such strong links, and such a strong need to go between them.
