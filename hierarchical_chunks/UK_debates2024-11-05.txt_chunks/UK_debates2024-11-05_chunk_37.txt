Last month, 18 flights between Belfast City and Heathrow were cancelled, and I can only imagine how difficult that must be for Members from Northern Ireland and their constituents.
The previous Transport Committee, in its aviation reform inquiry, recommended that the Government revise the public service obligation routes and the subsidies to improve domestic air connectivity.
Does the Minister agree that that is important to connecting Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK, and will he bring forward work on that?
