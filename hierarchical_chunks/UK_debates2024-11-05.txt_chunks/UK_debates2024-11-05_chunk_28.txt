I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that very important question.
He is right: all parts of this country—all our nations—are experiencing an epidemic of violence against women and girls.
We have already spoken about the 16 days of action, which will highlight what we can all do to stand against this abhorrent crime.
I am working with my counterparts across all the devolved nations on how we tackle violence against women and girls.
I will bring forward more information in due course.
