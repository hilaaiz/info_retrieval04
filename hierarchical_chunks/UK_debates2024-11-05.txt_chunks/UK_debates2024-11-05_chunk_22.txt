I thank the shadow Secretary of State for his question.
He will be aware that charging decisions are a matter for the independent Crown Prosecution Service.
What the Home Secretary has announced, and what I have been working with her on, is the introduction of a presumption of anonymity for all firearms officers if they find themselves being charged by the CPS.
We believe that such a measure could have made a difference in this case.
The Home Secretary has also announced measures that resulted from the police accountability review work undertaken by the previous Government, and we are taking those forward.
