I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the brilliant work of Savana.
The charity does tremendous work in supporting victims and survivors of these abhorrent crimes.
This financial year, the Government are providing  £41 million of ringfenced funding for ISVAs and independent domestic violence advisers.
Now that the departmental budgets for 2025-26 have been announced, the internal departmental allocations process is taking place.
I have written to police and crime commissioners to assure them that they will be told of the settlement by the beginning of December, and I would love to visit Savana in Stoke-on-Trent.
