An estimated 80,000 disabled young people are unable to benefit from their child trust fund savings, because their families are being thwarted by a complex legal process before they can access them.
The previous Government let these families down by tolerating that, so this Government need to act.
Will the Minister commit to simplifying this agonising process to ensure that these disabled young people get the cash that they deserve?
This Government recognise the difficulties that parents and guardians of young people who lack mental capacity can face in accessing their child trust fund.
I recently met the hon.
Member’s colleague,  the hon.
Member for Horsham (John Milne) , and his constituent about this issue.
The Government will consider what can be done in a way that safeguards those who lack capacity.
Several constituents have contacted me about the sentences being handed down to climate protesters, with some seeing these sentences as too long given the pressure on our prison system.
Will my hon.
Friend confirm whether there are any plans to look afresh at sentencing for these types of offences in the context of crowded prisons?
The right to protest is an important part of our democracy, but it has to be exercised within the law.
Sentencing in individual cases is, of course, a matter for independent courts.
In the past week alone, there have been four reported sexual assaults or attempted sexual assaults against women in Londonderry.
I know that justice is a devolved matter, but on average 140 women have been killed every year during the past 15 years.
It is an issue that we cannot ignore.
Will the Minister consider asking her counterparts in the devolved regions to bring a determined focus and unity of purpose to tackling violence against women and girls, to ensure that they all feel safe, no matter where they live in the country?
