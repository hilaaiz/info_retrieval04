Thank you very much, Mr Speaker.
I can sympathise with  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) , and I thank him for tabling the urgent question, because we consistently have the same problem at Edinburgh and other Scottish airports, with a lack of connectivity and the disruption that that causes.
I understand that the weather was a key reason for the delays this weekend, but another was delays at air traffic control, which is under pressure because of staff shortages and rising traffic.
Eurocontrol, the main organisation supporting European airspace, has warned that to keep passengers safe and stop disruption better co-ordination is required between aircraft operators, airports and others across the continent.
Will the Minister tell me what conversations the Secretary of State has had with European partners on building resilience in air traffic control?
Do the Government have confidence in the robustness of air traffic control in the UK to serve our connectivity properly?
Officials engage regularly with their counterparts across Europe and the European Union.
The Government have committed to airspace modernisation, which will improve resilience.
I look forward to support from Liberal Democrat Members in the near future as we progress towards modernising airspace right across our great nation and nations.
