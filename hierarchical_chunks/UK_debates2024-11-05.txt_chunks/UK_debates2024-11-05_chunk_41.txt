I thank the hon.
Gentleman for all he does in this space.
I join him in encouraging the shadow Secretary of State to go to Northern Ireland, which is a fine country.
The hon.
Gentleman knows that I visit regularly, coming through Belfast and Derry/Londonderry.
It is a great place to live, visit, work and do business.
On the specific points about prices, I think there are 19 flights or more a week in summer from Derry/Londonderry, which is well connected.
I suggest that the hon.
Member gets involved with the airlines and the airport owners but, yes, we can look at that when we come up to review the public sector obligation.
