I want to ask about domestic abuse.
For too long, domestic abusers have been able to exploit a loophole in our legal system, whereby the domestic abuse that they perpetrate is masked by the ambiguous conviction of common assault.
This has meant that, under this Government and the previous one, domestic abusers have qualified for early release schemes.
When I pushed the Secretary of State on this issue the other day, she admitted that her measures to exclude domestic abusers from early release were “not of course fully comprehensive.”—[Official
Report,  22 October 2024 ; Vol. 755, c. 206.]
The Liberal Democrats believe that things need to go further.
Will the Minister meet me and domestic abuse charities to discuss some of our proposals for closing the loopholes so that victims and survivors get the justice they deserve?
