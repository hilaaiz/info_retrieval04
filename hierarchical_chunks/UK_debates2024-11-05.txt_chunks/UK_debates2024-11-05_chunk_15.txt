I thank the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for his question.
He will know that certain offences are excluded from the SDS40 early release scheme, not the offender.
This Government put in strict protections to protect the public, unlike the previous Government, who introduced an end-of-custody supervised licence scheme.
Those who are released from sentences for common assault are flagged for domestic abuse markers, and they are given priority for electronic monitoring and risk assessments.
I meet the sector regularly to look at what else we can do.
We are learning lessons from SDS40, but this Government are committed to halving violence against women and girls.
