I thank the hon.
Member for standing up for her local airport in Aberdeen.
As someone who recently caught a connecting flight in Manchester from Newquay, going on to Aberdeen, I can say that Loganair provided an excellent service.
It was a great honour to visit Aberdeen airport recently to see its helicopter base for North sea oil and its importance to the transition that we will begin with our clean energy mission.
I suggest that the hon.
Member takes that up with Andy,  the chief executive there, and perhaps the new director of corporate affairs, Gavin Newlands, the former MP for Paisley.
