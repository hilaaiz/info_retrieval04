Mr. WEBER.
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, due to a family health issue that required prompt attention, I missed two suspension votes last night regarding our greatest ally, Israel.
Had I been present, I would have voted yes--without reservation--for both measures: I unequivocally reaffirm Israel's right to exist, and I support the immediate release of all hostages taken by the jihadist terrorist organization Hamas.
I am thankful that my colleagues in Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of these measures.
Anyone familiar with my voting record knows that I have always stood foursquare in support of Israel and will continue to do so.
Hamas must be eradicated, all prisoners must be released, and we must continue to remove any shred of doubt about Israel's right to exist.
