Mr. SCALISE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize a local television station, WDSU Channel 6, on their 75th Anniversary.
On December 18, 1948, WDSU became the first television station to ``sign on'' in the State of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region and for the next nine years would remain our only local station.
Starting with the invocation of archdiocesan chancellor Monsignor Charles J. Plauche in 1948, WDSU has been an eyewitness for historical moments that have shaped our region.
WDSU was on the scene during the building of the Crescent City Connection which connects New Orleans' East Bank to the West Bank.
The station was there to provide the first live election results in the Greater New Orleans area, and WDSU reporters were the only ones to live broadcast the World's Fair in New Orleans in 1984.
The station chronicled the moments leading up to landfall of Hurricane Katrina, with coverage during the storm, and the days, months, and years following as the people of Southeast Louisiana recovered and rebuilt.
The station has since covered other major storms to hit the area including Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Laura, and Ida.
The name WDSU is widely recognized across the Greater New Orleans area but not
