many know the significance behind the name.
The ``W'' in WDSU is used by stations east of the Mississippi River.
The ``D'' honors the Desoto Hotel where the original radio station, formerly known as WCBE, broadcasted above.
The ``S'' is a nod to the old New Orleans States newspaper, and the ``U'' recognizes Joe Uhalt who bought the original radio station.
It is truly my pleasure to recognize WDSU's 75th Anniversary.
On behalf of the great people of Louisiana's First Congressional District, I thank the anchors, photographers, journalists, and the whole staff at WDSU for their continued coverage of breaking news, historical events, and representation of the Greater New Orleans area, ensuring our community is informed and entertained.
WDSU's commitment to public service and broadcasting does not go unnoticed and is appreciated by the entire New Orleans region.
