Mr. Speaker, as has also been the case for each of his predecessors that my office has had the opportunity to host, I have benefitted greatly from Christian's training and background.
This recurring process that the fellowship program fosters, strengthens civilianmilitary understanding for future leaders of the greatest military in the world, which I believe is a necessary component of a strong democracy.
Our Nation is best served at sea and here onshore by officers and leaders of the highest caliber, like Christian.
He embodies such qualities and has a promising career ahead in continued service to our nation, and we owe him such gratitude.
I ask that the House join me in wishing CDR Christian Woodside, his spouse Leigh Anne, and their two daughters, Hannah and Charlotte, the best of luck in their next life chapter.
