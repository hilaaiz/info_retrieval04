Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Dallas Fire-Rescue Captain Kenneth Zacharie.
Earlier this month at a Nimitz High School basketball game, Kenneth, alongside an Arlington Lamar High School Athletic Trainer and Arlington EMS supervisor, worked to save a young athlete when she collapsed on the court during pregame warm-ups.
The young athlete went into cardiac arrest and Kenneth swooped into action, using chest compressions and a defibrillator.
As a result of his heroic actions, the student-athlete is now on the road to recovery.
Kenneth's wife coaches the Nimitz High School girls' varsity basketball team.
Luckily, Kenneth brought their three sons to the game earlier than usual and was there when the student-athlete collapsed before the game began.
As the Captain of the Rapid Intervention Team, Kenneth is no stranger to serious situations and was able to work with others to provide a swift, lifesaving response.
I'd like to thank Captain Kenneth Zacharie for being a shining example of the heroes that make North Texas such an amazing community to live in.
