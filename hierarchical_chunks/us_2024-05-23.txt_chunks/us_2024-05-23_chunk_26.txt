Mr. GOMEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional contributions of Esther Kim, our Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS) fellow, who has used her talents for the betterment of California and the U.S. Congress as a whole.
From astutely demanding answers from the Food and Drug Administration on how lead-tainted food was able to get to the plates of children and what the agency would do to ensure it never happened again, to building key coalitions of support and helping pass through the House a bill to redesignate a Koreatown post office in honor of activist Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, Esther's insights and diligence have made real change and pushed important congressional efforts forward.
As she prepares to enter Yale Divinity School in the fall, I am certain her time in Congress is only the beginning of the impact Esther Kim will make on our nation.
I know I speak for everyone who encountered Esther on the Hill when I say we can't wait to see what she will do change the world next.
