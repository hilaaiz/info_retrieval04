Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today celebrating the life.
Virginia was an incredible representation of answering our Nation's highest calling.
She served her country with honor in WWII and afterward throughout her local community, bringing joy, enthusiasm, and love to everyone she met along the way.
We mourn with her loved ones and thank them for sharing Virginia with us.
