Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable mother, humanitarian, and beloved community figure as she celebrates a milestone in her extraordinary life.
Mrs. Janie B. Randolph will celebrate her 100th birthday on June 4, and I join family and friends in celebrating this significant occasion.
