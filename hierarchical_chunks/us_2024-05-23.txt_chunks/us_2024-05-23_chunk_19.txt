Mr. Koenig made no waste of his four years serving the community of San Angelo.
Under his leadership, San Angelo was established as the Visual Arts Capitol of Texas, the 2024 Best Visitor Center in Texas, and the 2024 People's Choice Award for Best Destination for Arts and Culture in the State.
Along with these accolades, San Angelo has seen significant economic growth due to a surge in new local businesses, tourism, and overall quality of life.
Due to his hard work and enthusiastic support for the city, it is safe to say that Mr. Koenig left the greater San Angelo community in a better position than he found it.
Beyond his duties at the Chamber of Commerce, Walt was also a civic leader for Goodfellow Air Force Base.
Mr. Koenig was heavily involved at the base, including going out of his way to speak with students from other countries in their native language.
Throughout his tenure, Mr. Koenig consistently went above and beyond in his unwavering support for the community, which left an indelible mark on the city.
He and his wife, MG, poured their hearts out for our community, and for that, I will always be thankful.
Walt is a good friend of our office and our community--he will be missed dearly.
I am proud to honor 
Mr. Walt Koenig's incredible contributions to the city of San Angelo during his successful tenure.
I extend my most heartfelt wishes to his family for a smooth transition as they embark on their journey to Italy.
