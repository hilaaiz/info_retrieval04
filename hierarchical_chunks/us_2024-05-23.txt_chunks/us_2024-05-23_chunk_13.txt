Mrs. Williams was born on December 20, 1943, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
She spent most of her childhood on a small family farm in Henderson County, Texas, where she developed a passion for horticulture, conservation, and self-reliance.
Mrs. Williams graduated with honors from East Texas State University with a bachelor's degree in art and a master's degree in education.
It was during this time that she met her husband of 58 years, Doug.
Afterwards, 
Mrs. Williams began her career as a schoolteacher at Texarkana Independent School District, where she taught for 33 years.
She participated in professional development workshops and trained with the Hatton W. Sumner Institute to improve her understanding of individual freedom and civic responsibility.
Throughout the years, 
Mrs. Williams was recognized as a distinguished educator who strived to make a difference in students' lives.
After retiring from TISD, 
Mrs. Williams stayed in touch with Highland Park Elementary School and volunteered to help train new teachers.
She was a board member of the Bowie and Miller County Literacy Council and a treasurer for the Texas Classroom Teachers' Association.
For her outstanding work, the TCTA selected 
Mrs. Williams as the ``Retired Teacher of the Year'' in 2003.
She also served as an election judge for Bowie County for over twenty years and attended numerous GOP conventions statewide as a delegate.
I am saddened to hear.
Williams' passing.
Her legacy of dedication, public service, and family values will be remembered for many years to come.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to honor 
Mrs. Williams' wonderful life.
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.
