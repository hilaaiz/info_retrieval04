Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the City of Ann Arbor on the occasion of their bicentennial.
For the past 200 years, Ann Arbor has stood as a beacon of progress, diversity, and excellence.
From its humble beginnings to its current status as a thriving and exemplary city, this milestone is a testament to their commitment to innovation, education, and community.
We are excited to see what the residents of Ann Arbor can accomplish in the years to come.
