Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Will Neitzel, a member of my staff for the last five and a half years.
Will joined my team as I opened a new office and started my first term, serving Wisconsin's First Congressional District.
Will has been an integral member of my team.
While serving in my personal office, Will's candor, hard work, and humor have been tremendous assets to my office.
When first starting my office, Will was essential in getting my mail program up and running, working tirelessly to produce dozens of letters each week.
As a policy staffer Will helped Wisconsin families and small businesses better understand and navigate federal programs.
After serving as one of my lead staffers in my personal office, Will then moved to the Committee on House Administration when I became Chairman in January of 2022.
Will quickly became my Wisconsin advocate with the Committee, always thinking of ways House Administration can benefit the people of Wisconsin's First District.
Will also jumped right in and helped lead the Committee's widely successful ``Running an Effective Committee in the Majority Series'', ``Level Up: GOP Staff Development Course'', and the ``Intern Lecture Series'', among many others.
With Will as a part of my Member Services team, the Committee has held briefings and education trainings for over 2,000 Members of Congress and their staff.
This team has also successfully completed over 600 Member-related requests.
Will also spearheaded the planting of the Sugar Maple tree on the U.S. Capitol Grounds commemorating the 175th anniversary of the State.
