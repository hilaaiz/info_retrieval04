School and later, Escontrias STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, art and math) Academy.
Notably, in 1924, the academy initiated a vocational program, teaching practical skills like carpentry, cotton farming, and animal husbandry, exemplifying the academy's commitment to a holistic education, preparing students for both academic and practical success in life.
Since then, the Escontrias STEAM Academy has evolved into a hub of innovation.
From its humble beginnings in adobe structures to its current status as a leading institution for STEAM education, the academy has remained steadfast in its mission to provide innovative learning opportunities.
As we commemorate its centennial milestone, we remain committed to ensuring that every child, regardless of background or circumstance, has access to the transformative power of education.
The legacy of Escontrias STEAM Academy serves as a beacon of hope and opportunity for generations to come.
Today, I am honored to pay tribute to the Escontrias STEAM Academy for its century of educational excellence and its profound impact on the lives of countless students, families, and the broader community.
