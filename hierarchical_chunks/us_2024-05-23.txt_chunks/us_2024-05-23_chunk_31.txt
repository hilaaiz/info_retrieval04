Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Somerset Borough Police Chief Randy Cox on his 47 years of service to our community.
Randy felt called to serve from a young age and always wanted to be a police officer.
He began his law enforcement career as a police officer in 1977 for Seven Springs Borough in Somerset County, Pennsylvania.
He transitioned to the Ligonier Borough Police Department in 1981 and rose to the rank of police chief in 1990.
On August 9, 2004, Randy became the chief of the Somerset Borough Police Department, where he served for the past 19 years.
Randy kept a local and positive approach to his law enforcement duties.
Through his teaching role at the Westmoreland County Community College Police Academy and Penn State-Fayette, Randy prepared officers for all the hardships associated with law enforcement.
Additionally, he graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy's 204th Session in 2001.
Randy took this education and incorporated what he learned into training sessions at local academies.
He also served as an assessor for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Law Enforcement Accreditation Committee to ensure that all police officers were qualified for the job's rigorous duties.
He demonstrated a long-lasting commitment to southwestern Pennsylvania law enforcement officials, and his legacy will be remembered for generations to come.
