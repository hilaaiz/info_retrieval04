Last year Bradford faced the highest increase in car insurance prices in the whole of Yorkshire, with the average premium standing at a staggering £879.
Will the Leader of the House grant a debate in Government time on the car insurance rip-off which means that law-abiding citizens such as her constituents and mine are left paying for the reckless criminality of others?
I am sure that if the hon.
Lady were to apply for a debate it would be well attended, because there is a huge amount of interest in these issues.
As she will know, our legislation to ensure that competition is working well and the consumer really is king will also ensure that people are able to get the best price from, in particular, online companies, if need be going through a broker in the case of insurance.
However, I shall make sure that the Department has heard about the hon.
Lady’s concerns in the context of her own constituency.
