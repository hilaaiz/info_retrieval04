I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this.
I know that the situation in Gaza, particularly what we hope might happen over the coming days, is very much at the forefront of people’s minds.
He will know—and I have given many examples—the complexity of the situation there and what the Israel Defence Forces are trying to do in very difficult circumstances, but of course we all want to see a pause in hostilities to enable humanitarian assistance to get to where it needs to be and we hope for hostages to be returned home.
There have been a number of opportunities to discuss this on the Floor of the House, not least with the usual Prime Minister’s questions and other questions to Departments.
I shall make sure that the Foreign Secretary has heard what the hon.
Gentleman has said, and he will know that the doors of consular services, but also  of Departments that are closely monitoring what is happening on the ground, are always open to Members who have particular concerns.
