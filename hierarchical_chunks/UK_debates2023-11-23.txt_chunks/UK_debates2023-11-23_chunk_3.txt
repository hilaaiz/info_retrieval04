I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question, and I pay tribute to her for her many years of service in the Cabinet.
I agree with her characterisation of the civil service.
Indeed, in my time working in various ministerial roles, I have seen true professionalism and dedication.
However, I think she is absolutely right that we need to improve both our data analytics and the data flow into Government.
One of the things we learned during the covid pandemic was, for example, that setting up the data centre in the Cabinet Office massively improved the amount of data we received.
That enables us to deal with these very fast-moving situations and, indeed, we have used it in subsequent crises.
