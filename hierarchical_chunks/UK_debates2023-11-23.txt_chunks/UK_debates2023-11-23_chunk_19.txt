The Minister, a few moments ago in answer to specific questions, said that this was not a matter for him.
Of course, the problem with the ministerial code is that the public do not have confidence that it is actually being delivered.
There is very little transparency around investigations and around referrals to the independent adviser on Ministers’ interests.
With particular reference to Lord Cameron’s appointment, will the Minister commit to publishing all the correspondence with the ministerial adviser on the code, and any correspondence around the list he had to give to the permanent secretary on his interests prior to appointment?
With the greatest respect, I do not think the hon.
Gentleman understands that the independent adviser on Ministers’ interests has wide-ranging powers.
Within two weeks of appointment, a Minister will have to fill in a form which was recently changed—two months ago—and has over 30 pages covering a wide range of aspects of their interests.
There is then a process where the permanent secretary of the relevant Department comments on that and the independent adviser will then publish an update of relevant interests.
This is a thorough process.
I met the independent adviser yesterday.
I suggest to the hon.
Gentleman that he writes to the independent adviser to seek the correspondence he wishes.
