I welcome the Paymaster General to his place.
In his new role, he will have responsibility for the efficient delivery of Government services and entitlements on which our constituents rely.
One such entitlement, of course, is the winter fuel payment.
Earlier this week, he was reported as saying that some pensioners do not need the winter fuel payment, so can he tell us which group of pensioners he had in mind when talking about who should lose the winter fuel payment?
