Further to earlier exchanges, many of us have constituents stuck inside the hell that is Gaza, and in trying to get them out, we are struggling to get information out of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.
I have always found  the right hon.
Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell)  to be an honourable and honest man, and he is doing his best to help to get people out, but it is still difficult getting that information.
Could we have a statement, or at least a written statement, setting out the channels that might be open to us so that we can get people home?
I will certainly make sure that the Foreign Office has circulated an updated contact list to all Members of this House.
We will make sure that is done.
The consular services are the best point of contact in most cases for hon.
Members, but in the meeting I spoke about earlier in this session, I also emphasised the importance of the Foreign Office and in some cases the Home Office making sure that they are in regular touch with Members who have a particular interest in this issue.
I would be happy after this session to ensure that the Foreign Office gets in touch with the hon.
Gentleman to talk about any issues he needs support with.
Will the Leader of the House update us on the legislation to create an independent regulator for men’s football?
My constituents who support Everton are frustrated about the process their club has gone through and worry about unfairness.

Will she tell us when the Bill will be published and when Second Reading will be?
Hear, hear.
