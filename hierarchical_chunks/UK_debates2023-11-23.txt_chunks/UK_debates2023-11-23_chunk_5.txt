I welcome the Minister to his new role.
He will know that time is of the essence, with a victim of this scandal dying every four days.
He also knows that there is nothing to stop the Government setting up a compensation scheme now.
The failure to do so is weighing heavily on the minds of those affected.
The cynical would think that the Government are just kicking the issue into the long grass.
Can the Minister tell us when he hopes to report on preparations for compensation and appoint a chair for an appropriate body to run the scheme?
