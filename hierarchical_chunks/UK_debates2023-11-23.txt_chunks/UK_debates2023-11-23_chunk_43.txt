I thank the hon.
Gentleman for championing Conscious Recovery in his constituency.
I am sure the whole House would want to thank all the volunteers who work for that organisation, as well as those who work for many organisations across the country and in our own constituencies, too.
I am pleased that he has been able to raise the profile of this important issue, and I thank him for his campaign work on it.
It is critical, particularly for young men who are very vulnerable to not opening up about their mental health issues, often with terrible consequences.
We should applaud all efforts to ensure that they get the help and interventions they need.
