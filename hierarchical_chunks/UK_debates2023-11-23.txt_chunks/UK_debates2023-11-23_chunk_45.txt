I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that matter, on which there was audible agreement from around the House.
I know that this issue is supported by many people, and I am one of them, as a Portsmouth football club fan and having done the largest and fastest ever community buyout of a football club in the UK.
We have spent a great deal of effort on this.
As she knows, we will be bringing legislation forward, and she will not have long to wait for that.
She will not be surprised to hear that further business will be announced in the usual way.
