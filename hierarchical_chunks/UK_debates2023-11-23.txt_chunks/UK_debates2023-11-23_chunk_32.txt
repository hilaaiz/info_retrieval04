I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work he is doing to support his farmers—I know it is a lot.
He is a consistent champion for their interests, and he is right to encourage them to stand firm.
I am pleased that NFU Sugar and British Sugar are resuming negotiations on next year’s sugar beet price, and I hope they can work together to agree a mutually acceptable deal as soon as possible for the benefit of both growers and processors.
My hon.
Friend may wish to raise this matter on  7 December  with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
