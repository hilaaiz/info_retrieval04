I welcome the Minister to her post.
If her Front Bench is full of common sense, which will she tackle first: a Home Secretary who thinks that Stockton North is a proverbial toilet; a Foreign Secretary who, during a critical time in geopolitics, is not even  accountable to this House; or a Transport Secretary whose Network North plan thinks that Manchester is in Preston?
