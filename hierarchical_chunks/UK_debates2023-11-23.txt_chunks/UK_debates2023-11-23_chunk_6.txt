What I can say to the hon.
Lady is that I am familiar with the range of activities that need to take place.
I am getting into the detail of every single one of them, but I have to gain collective agreement before I can announce anything to this House.
This House will be the first place I make any announcements, when I have secured that.
I acknowledge her frustrations, and I am doing everything I can.
I will update the House as quickly as I can.
What steps his Department is taking to improve access to public sector procurement processes for small and medium-sized businesses.
The Procurement Act 2023 will deliver simpler, more effective public sector procurement and help small and  medium-sized enterprises secure a greater share of approximately £300 billion of expenditure per year.
The Act places a requirement on contracting authorities to assess the particular barriers facing SMEs throughout the entire procurement life cycle and to consider what can be done to overcome them.
The renewable energy sector offers great opportunities for SMEs to become involved in the supply chain.
Many of them are unaware of the public sector tenders that are out there.
What are the Government doing to ensure that SMEs are made more aware of the opportunities available?
I very much encourage my hon.
Friend to take this matter up with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, but for my part I understand that anyone bidding for contracts for difference, our main renewable support scheme, must submit supply chain plans, including how many applicants will support SMEs.[Official Report,  10 January 2024 , Vol. 743, c. 6MC.]
The Department is also consulting on reforms that will give greater revenue support to applicants using more sustainable supply chains, including those that make greater use of SMEs.
