I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this—very sadly—timely question given the events of this week.
As she knows, speeding is a critical issue and one of the biggest killers globally, affecting many countries.
As well as measures we take at home, she knows that we make a big contribution to reducing the number of deaths on the road elsewhere.
It is an excellent topic for a debate.
I will download her interest to the Secretary of State, and I am sure that if she applied for a debate, it would be well attended.
