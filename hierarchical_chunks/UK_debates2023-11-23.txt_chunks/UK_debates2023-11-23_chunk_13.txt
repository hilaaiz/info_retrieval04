I have seen the reports in the paper describing me as the Minister of common sense.
I appreciate that the concept is difficult for Opposition Members to grasp.
I am committed to delivering common-sense decisions, such as delaying the ban on petrol and diesel cars, delaying the ban on oil and gas boilers, scrapping High Speed 2 from Birmingham to Manchester and reducing the overseas budget—all common-sense policies that those on the Opposition Benches have voted against.
Those on the Government Benches are full of common sense.
I am building on all those policies.
