I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this matter.
All the work done to strengthen local communities, particularly after those two tragic  incidents, is a credit to his constituents.
He will know that a number of Departments, but particularly the Home Office, have done a huge amount in recent years on combating violence against women and girls.
Measures need to range from education at an early age, right through to ensuring that victims and potential victims have all the tools they need to enable them to avoid harm.
This is an issue that is keenly followed by all Members.
If he were to apply for a debate it would be well attended, but I will make sure that the Home Secretary has heard what he has said today.
We all send our best wishes to his constituents.
