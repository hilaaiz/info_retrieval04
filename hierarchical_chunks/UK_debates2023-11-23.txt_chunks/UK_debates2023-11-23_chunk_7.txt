I thank the Minister for his response and  the hon.
Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)  for raising this matter.
Northern Ireland, and particularly my constituency of Strangford, have a great many small and medium-sized businesses that depend greatly on opportunities for Government contracts.
What discussions has the Minister had with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland on a united approach, similar to that referred to by the hon.
Member for Cleethorpes?
I would love to see that in Northern Ireland.
