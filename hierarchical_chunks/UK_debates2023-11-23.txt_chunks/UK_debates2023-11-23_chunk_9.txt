I welcome my old friend and sparring partner,  the right hon.
Member for Salisbury (John Glen) , to his post.
Questions have been raised about whether all benefits in kind received by the Foreign Secretary while he acted as a lobbyist for Greensill Capital have been properly declared.
Will the Minister confirm whether his tax affairs were examined and considered by the House of Lords Appointments Commission before approving his appointment?
If not, will the Government now investigate to see if all such matters, including any use of offshore trusts, were properly declared and taken into account before the appointment was made?
