May we have a debate on antisemitism at the Football Association?
The FA board, which for years lit up Wembley for numerous causes and campaigns, has now said that it will not light up Wembley ever again for any non-entertainment reason.
This is because it has been shamed by its antisemitic decision not to light up the stadium when 1,400 Jews were murdered in the pogrom of  7 October .
Should the national lottery even fund organisations that seem to regret every death and injustice apart from the death of Jews?
My right hon.
and learned Friend the Culture Secretary discussed the lighting of the arch with the Football Association at the time and expressed her disappointment about how it approached that situation.
As was announced in the autumn statement, we are making further funds available to combat the rise in antisemitism.
We are also repeating the £3 million uplift to the Community Security Trust to fund its critical work, to ensure that that work is able to continue and to meet the unfortunate demand.
However, my right hon.
and learned Friend makes a very good point.
Whatever businesses or organisations we are involved in, we can all make a difference by calling things out, while also, critically, showing support to particular communities.
I think his point was well made.
May we have a debate on improving road safety?
I recently met a community speedwatch group in Bath, a bunch of highly dedicated and motivated people who stand for hours in all weathers, facing abuse.
They have caught 80,000 speeding vehicles, yet they see very little result for their hard work.
Speeding kills: a third of road fatalities are down to speeding.
Would Road Safety Week not be a perfect opportunity for such a debate to show that the Government really take the issue of road safety seriously?
