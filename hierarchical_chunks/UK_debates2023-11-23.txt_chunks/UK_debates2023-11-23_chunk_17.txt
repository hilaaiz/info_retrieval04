I congratulate the new Minister without Portfolio on her position, and I wish her well.
Having seen the Prime Minister’s struggles using a contactless card at a petrol station, and his impression that a private helicopter is the best way to get to Southampton, I think he probably was in need of some common sense, so it is no surprise that the right hon.
Lady has been referred to in that way.
Given she is in the market for some common-sense ideas, I suggest that the Government adopt a policy that people who live here pay taxes on all their income, and abolish the non-dom tax status.
Perhaps she could cast her mind to abolishing the tax breaks for private schools, and spend that money on the 93% who go to state schools.
Is it just the case that this Government are totally out of common sense and ideas?
It does not surprise me that those on the Labour Benches attack private schools, which lots of parents want to send their children to.
For them, that is common sense.
For them, that is freedom of choice, which I stand by.
Of course, should they close private schools down, the public sector would have to find billions more to fund it: again, not value for money—something that I am here to deliver—from Labour.
What recent assessment he has made of trends in the level of compliance with the ministerial code.
