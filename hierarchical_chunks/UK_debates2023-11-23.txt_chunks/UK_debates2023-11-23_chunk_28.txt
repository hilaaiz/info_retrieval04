I thank  the hon.
Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)  for, and join with, the sentiments she expressed about Israel and Gaza.
We all hope that some of the hostages are able to be released in the coming days, and our thoughts are with everyone affected by that.
It is incredibly important that this House is kept up to date.
She will know that the Procedure Committee is looking at that and will shortly make some announcements on how it thinks the Foreign Secretary can best come to answer questions from hon.
Members.
