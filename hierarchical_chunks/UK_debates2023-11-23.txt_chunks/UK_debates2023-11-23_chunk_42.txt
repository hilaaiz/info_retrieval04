I note that the Leader of the House failed to respond to the question from my hon.
Friend  the Member for Manchester Central  (Lucy Powell)  about the Government’s Rwanda policy.
The right hon.
Lady will be aware of reports that if, as seems likely, the Government are unable to find a legal way to take that policy forward, they are considering using the Falkland Islands as an alternative.
Will she take this opportunity to either confirm or deny that the Falkland Islands is a possible alternative to Rwanda?
I am very happy to knock that one on the head.
It is not an alternative to Rwanda, and nor are various other places that have been mentioned, including the Orkney Islands.
That would be definitely out, given the reliability of Scottish National party ferry services.
Last Sunday was International Men’s Day, which is a brilliant opportunity to highlight the positive contribution that men make to society, as well as some of the challenges we face.
Foremost among those is men’s mental health and, in particular, the high rates of male suicide.
I recently visited Conscious Recovery, an inspiring Blackpool charity that supports those dealing with mental health issues and raises awareness of those issues in our community.
Will the Leader of the House join me in thanking and praising those brilliant volunteers and charities who do enormous work in this area and who make so much difference?
Will she support a debate on improving mental health and preventing suicide?
