county for almost three decades and through numerous challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
Her leadership and passion kept the department running and kept vital services open for the people of Jefferson County.
Her impact is not limited to her role as Deputy Director.
As a member Healthier Jeffco Alliance, Lynnae has collaborated with organizations across Jefferson County to promote a smarter, fairer, and more equitable health care system.
Her work, and the dedication she has shown to her community, are a proud example for every Coloradan.
The people of Jefferson County owe Lynnae a debt of gratitude.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Lynnae on her well-earned retirement and to thank her for her commitment to our community.
