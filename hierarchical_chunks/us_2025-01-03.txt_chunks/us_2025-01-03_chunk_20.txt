Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent from my district, Lenny Ward, Sr.
As a veteran and dedicated community service member, Lenny has devoted his career to his country and community.
Through military service and volunteer work, Lenny has spent most of his life cultivating a lifetime of purpose and spirit.
His relentless care and advocacy for others does not go unnoticed, and therefore I wish to commend him today.
Since Lenny was a child, he was driven to serve his country in the military.
Lenny put his aspirations and life on hold and joined the United States Air Force from 1962 through 1966 as a Medic.
During his time in the United States Air Force, Lenny was deployed to Vietnam from 1965 through 1966.
Lenny spent much of his career at Pine Valley Golf Club as a Caddy Master from 1994 through 2013.
His infectious positive attitude will always be what he was most proud of during his career.
His charisma and smile made people gravitate towards him.
I am beyond proud of and exceptionally grateful for Lenny Ward, Sr.'s service to our great Nation and grateful for the legacy he has left in our community.
His dedication to this country as a United States Air Force Vietnam Combat Medic demonstrates the highest commitment to the values that make America the beacon of liberty to the world.
I am truly impressed by his determination to achieve greatness.
I wish him nothing but the best for all that he has done for his country and community.
