Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor James ``Jim'' Wallace who has diligently served his community as County Administrator for Herkimer County for 45 years.
Jim is highly regarded by his peers and throughout his community, as he was unanimously appointed by the Herkimer County Legislature.
First appointed in 1979, Jim has been an incredible champion for Herkimer County working to increase investment and promote economic development during his time as County Administrator.
Through his role as County Administrator, Jim worked closely with the Herkimer County Industrial Development Agency (IDA).
They came together to expand businesses, enhance economic development, and create jobs throughout the county.
These results have been seen in the investment of millions of dollars in energy, manufacturing, healthcare, and tourism industries across the county.
If you asked Jim, he would be among the first to credit his success to his hard-working staff and colleagues but there is no doubt that Jim's stalwart leadership has been invaluable to Herkimer County.
Former Herkimer County Legislature Chairman Vincent Bono has characterized Jim as a well-respected man with a wealth of knowledge, calling him a tremendous asset to Herkimer County.
I am proud to represent individuals like Jim in my district who diligently work for the betterment of the North Country.
On behalf of New York's 21st district, it is my privilege and honor to recognize the incredible accomplishments of James ``Jim'' Wallace.
I congratulate him on his incredible achievements and look forward to witnessing his future endeavors in the community.
