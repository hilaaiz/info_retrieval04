Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Garry Douglas for his hard work and advocacy on behalf of the North Country and its business community.
In December 1992, 
Mr. Douglas was selected to lead the North Country Chamber of Commerce from a pool of over 100 candidates.
Prior to this, he served as Executive Assistant to Congressman Gerald Solomon for fourteen years.
During his time in the Chamber, 
Mr. Douglas has worked tirelessly to provide members with multiple services and expand that membership.
Today, the North County Chamber of Commerce boasts a membership of over 4,200 businesses across Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, and Warren Counties.
During his tenure, 
Mr. Douglas has weathered many economic storms.
When a local air base was forced to close under the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, 
Mr. Douglas seized the opportunity to expand into the Canadian market.
Mr. Douglas and the Chamber Board were swift to fill the vacuum left by the closure with new business for the community.
Similarly, when faced with the Covid-19 pandemic, he created an economic plan to assist all the businesses in the North Country, not just Chamber members, on how to navigate New York State's regulations.
He also instructed Chamber of Commerce staff to assist small businesses in securing federal and state resources.
