Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northville Central School girls' soccer team, the Falcons, on a hardfought championship game victory following an impressive season.
The Falcons, led by head coach Doug Hammons, won the state championship 1-0, on a goal from freshman Lexi Ginter on a rebound from Korrine Bly's free kick in the twenty-fifth minute of the game.
The Falcons' defense maintained steady pressure and emerged victorious over the Copenhagen Golden Knights.
The Falcons' 2024 season finished with a 15-7 record and the New York State Class D State Soccer Championship.
They are the first Western Athletic Conference team to win a state championship in girls' soccer-- a remarkable accomplishment.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the Northville Falcons on their tremendous 2024 soccer season culminating with the New York State Class D Soccer title.
