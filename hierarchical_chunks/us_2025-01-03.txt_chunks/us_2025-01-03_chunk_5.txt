Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Patrick ``Rick'' Engle on being elected St. Lawrence County Sheriff.
Rick has been an outstanding leader in the St. Lawrence County community and has worked for the Sheriff's office for 23 years.
Rick enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during his senior year of high school as part of the Marine Corps' delayed entry program and graduated basic training in 1991.
During his time in the military, he served as a fire team leader, squad leader, patrol team leader, and as a motor vehicle operator instructor.
He also deployed overseas, serving on peacekeeping missions in Haiti and Cuba during his time as a Marine.
Following his time in the Marine Corps, Rick decided he wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement to continue serving his community.
He began working road patrol for the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office as a deputy in 2001.
Rick then worked his way up to investigator before running for Sheriff himself.
During his campaign for Sheriff, Rick pledged to listen to his community and focus on providing service over politics--a promise he upholds as County Sheriff each day.
He has worked to strengthen relationships between St. Lawrence County's law enforcement agencies and other first responders, rescuers, and emergency service providers.
Rick's selfless leadership and dedication to his community, exemplify why his colleagues specially requested he run for the Sheriff's seat and why officers with eight local police unions supported his bid.
On behalf of New York's 21st district, I am honored to recognize the distinguished, decades long service and commitment to his community of Sheriff Patrick ``Rick'' Engle.
I congratulate him on his incredible achievements and look forward to witnessing his future endeavors in the community.
