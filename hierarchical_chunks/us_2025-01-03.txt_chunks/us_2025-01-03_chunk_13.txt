Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Patrick J. Kelly, a St. Lawrence County native who was named New York State's economic developer of the year by the New York State Economic Development Council (NYSEDC).
In January 2012, Patrick was appointed the St. Lawrence County Industrial Development Agency's Chief Executive Officer and has since served faithfully in this capacity overseeing the agency's planning, initiation, implementation, and administration of programs.
In this role, Patrick encourages and attracts industries to locate or expand within St. Lawrence County, boosting our local economy.
In 2023 alone, Patrick helped lead 45 IDA projects in St. Lawrence County which helped retain 615 jobs and create an additional 225 roles in our community.
Patrick was elected as the NYSEDC Board Chair in 2020 following his success in St. Lawrence.
As Board Chair, Patrick showed himself to be a true leader as someone who understands how to create economic opportunity and knows how to build consensus to move initiatives forward.
Upon receiving his award, Patrick congratulated his team and the many people that helped him and the program succeed showing true selflessness and thoughtfulness.
While Patrick serves as CEO and as NYSEDC Board Chair in his professional life, he is also a loving husband to his wife, Jackie, and a caring father to his children balancing his busy career with his loving family.
On behalf of New York's 21st district, it is my privilege and honor to recognize the incredible accomplishments of Patrick J. Kelly.
I congratulate him on his incredible achievements and look forward to witnessing his future endeavors in the community.
