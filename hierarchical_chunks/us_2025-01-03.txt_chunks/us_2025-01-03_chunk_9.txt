Mr. Douglas has received many accolades during his time leading the Chamber from local, regional, and state organizations.
City & State Magazine has recognized 
Mr. Douglas on both its Economic Development Power 75 list and its Upstate New York Power 100 list.
While Mr. Douglas would be the first to credit his team at the Chamber with much of his success, there is no doubt that his visionary leadership has significantly enhanced the North Country's economic development.
Earlier this year, the Town of Plattsburgh officially named a road in the newly opened Clinton County Business Industrial Gateway as Douglas Boulevard in honor of his service to the region.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, I am proud to celebrate the achievements of my friend Garry Douglas.
His dedication to public service and tireless support of small businesses across the North Country has benefited many and will continue to help the North Country for decades to come.
