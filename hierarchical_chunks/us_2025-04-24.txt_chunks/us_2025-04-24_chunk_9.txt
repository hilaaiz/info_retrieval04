Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a milestone in Illinois' transportation history, the 40th anniversary of Metra, which has been an essential part of the fabric of our region's transportation network.
Since its founding in 1984, Metra has provided reliable, safe, and efficient rail service for millions of residents and commuters throughout the Chicagoland area.
Metra plays a crucial role in connecting neighborhoods, supporting local businesses, and ensuring that individuals can travel easily to work, school, and recreational activities.
As the second-largest commuter rail system in the United States, Metra has helped foster economic growth by supporting both suburban and urban development and providing a convenient and sustainable alternative to driving.
With 243 stations and 11 routes spanning nearly 500 route miles, Metra connects communities across the six-county Chicago area.
Serving over 300,000 riders on an average weekday, Metra is the backbone of the region's transit system, enabling people to commute safely, reliably, and efficiently.
Over the last four decades, Metra has adapted to the evolving needs of its riders, weathered economic challenges, and embraced innovations in technology to enhance the rider experience.
The agency's leadership has embraced modern technologies, improved accessibility, and continuously enhanced customer service to meet the growing demands of its passengers.
Whether through the expansion of services, improvements to stations, or the adoption of innovative rail solutions, Metra has remained dedicated to serving the people of Illinois with the highest standards of service.
Today, we recognize the hard work and dedication of Metra's employees--from conductors to engineers, from planners to customer service representatives--whose efforts have helped ensure the continued success of this critical public transportation system.
