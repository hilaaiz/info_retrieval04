Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate National Auctioneers Week, taking place this year between April 28 and May 3.
The National Auction Association, located in the Kansas Third District, is the centralized headquarters for all auctioneering businesses, and I thank them for their advocacy on this matter.
Additionally, I would like to recognize Livestock Marketing Association and the National Auto Auction for their advocacy work on this.
An auction is one of the oldest methods of purchasing and selling goods and remains a prevalent practice in businesses throughout the country.
And with rising prices, auctioneering remains a steady method of both purchasing and selling goods competitively.
Auctions, and the auctioneers that run them, allow buyers an equal chance of receiving competitive prices for purchases and also allow the seller to receive the best possible return.
The hardworking auctioneers that spend their time coordinating with clients and holding these events deserve recognition, and so I heartily support National Auctioneers Week.
