Mr. Speaker, today we recognize the Jolly Boys for their contributions to not only the lives of individuals and families but have also strengthened our community.
I ask that I am joined to express gratitude for the Jolly Boys of Williamsville, whose spirit of volunteerism and selflessness should serve as an inspiration to all.
