Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor 
Mr. Basil Piazza, a dedicated public servant and long-time resident of Williamsville, New York whose tireless contributions to his community and his country have left a long lasting impact.
Mr. Piazza's legacy spans decades of leadership, service, and unwavering commitment to the betterment of the Village.
A native of North Buffalo, 
Mr. Piazza graduated from Canisius University in 1965 with a degree in English.
After relocating in 1968 to the Village of Williamsville with his family, he began a successful teaching career for 36 years throughout Western New York.
His commitment to education and mentorship, even while serving in local government, speaks to his selflessness and passion for helping others succeed.
