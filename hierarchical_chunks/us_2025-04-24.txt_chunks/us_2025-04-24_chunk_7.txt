Mr. JOHNSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Reformed Church in the United States.
The Reformed Church in the United States was founded in 1725, proclaiming the Gospel while serving communities across our Nation.
I'm especially honored to note the pivotal role that South Dakota churches have played in advancing the mission and heritage of the Reformed Church in the United States through the Eureka Classis and beyond.
During the Revolutionary War, one-fifth of German Reformed pastors served as chaplains in the Continental Army.
One member, Captain Peter Humrickhouse, even crossed the Delaware River with General George Washington and delivered critical supplies to Yorktown, helping secure our Nation's independence.
Presidents George Washington and Theodore Roosevelt both recognized the influence and integrity of the Reformed Church.
President Washington openly praised the loyalty and devotion of its clergy and congregants.
President Roosevelt regularly attended Grace Reformed Church in Washington, D.C. and laid its cornerstone himself.
This June, members and friends of the Reformed Church in the United States will gather at Mount Rushmore in my home state to mark this historic tricentennial milestone.
It is fitting that such a celebration should occur in South Dakota, a state shaped by faith, perseverance, and patriotism.
Join me in recognizing the Reformed Church in the United States for 300 years of devotion to faith and service.
