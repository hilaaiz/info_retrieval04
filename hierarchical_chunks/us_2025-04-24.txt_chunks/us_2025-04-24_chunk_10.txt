Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Metra and extend my deepest appreciation to everyone who has contributed to its success.
I look forward to continuing to work with Metra as it builds on its remarkable 40 years of safe and reliable commuter rail service in the Chicagoland area.
