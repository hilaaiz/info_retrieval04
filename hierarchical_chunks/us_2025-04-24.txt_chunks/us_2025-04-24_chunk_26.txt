them as the ``Jolly Boys''.
The name stuck, and to this day, the Jolly Boys of Williamsville continue to symbolize that spirit with everything they do.
From the very start, the Jolly Boys set themselves apart by committing to a simple yet profound mission: to raise funds exclusively for local children and families facing financial difficulties, primarily through youth sports and activities.
They embraced the values of volunteerism, ensuring that all their efforts were carried out by volunteers and that every dollar raised went directly to those in need.
Through their commitment, the Jolly Boys have transformed the lives of many, providing vital resources and support to families in Williamsville and beyond.
As their efforts expanded, the Jolly Boys continued to evolve, they were able to start using their resources to support homeless shelters, cancer research, local parks, and historic preservation efforts.
Their commitment to the community has never shifted, and their impact will be seen and felt for centuries to come.
