Mr. Speaker, Marjorie Curtiss is an exceptional woman who answered the call to support her Nation in its darkest hour.
Her story, which is woven into the fabric of our Nation, is nothing short of remarkable.
I urge my colleagues to join me and all of Michigan's Seventh Congressional District in wishing her a very happy 100th birthday.
