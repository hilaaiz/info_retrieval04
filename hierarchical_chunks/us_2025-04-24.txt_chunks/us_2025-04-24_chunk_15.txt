Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exemplary life and leadership of the late Mayor William F. Murphy, a public servant who dedicated his career to the betterment of Woodridge and its neighboring communities.
Mayor Murphy's 41 years of leadership, as Village Trustee from 1972 until 1981 and then Mayor from 1981 until 2013, was paramount to the growth of Woodridge into the thriving village we see today.
His negotiations brought water from Lake Michigan to DuPage County and sustained Argonne National Laboratory's research capabilities.
He served in countless organizations, including as president of the DuPage Mayors and Managers Conference and the Illinois Municipal League, demonstrating Murphy's aspiration to use local government to uplift the community.
Mayor Murphy remained deeply thoughtful and responsive to his residents' challenges.
He consistently listened to their feedback and worked towards addressing their needs.
Mayor Murphy also championed the ProLogis Fund, providing college scholarships and non-profit grants to empower the next generation of leaders and advocates.
In addition, Mayor Murphy had a distinguished career as an educator, principal and Assistant Superintendent for 29 years for Woodridge School District 68, even having a local school named for him upon his retirement.
