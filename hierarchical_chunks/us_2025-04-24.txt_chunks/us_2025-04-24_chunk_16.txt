Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have represented such a dedicated leader who governed with the utmost humility.
I ask you all to join me in honoring his legacy through the Woodridge Village Hall renaming.
May the ``William F. Murphy Village Hall'' serve as a lasting reminder of his service to our community.
