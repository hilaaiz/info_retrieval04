Emergence Health Network (EHN), the local mental health authority in El Paso, has a dedicated facility focusing on behavioral needs and services.
The Veterans One Stop Center (VOSC) in Northeast El Paso provides behavioral health services and additional support to veterans, active-duty military, and their families.
Recovery-oriented care is offered to meet the needs of veterans, thus promoting hope and encouragement.
EHN's partnership with Fort Bliss has proved to be a tremendous benefit as an additional resource and support system for these individuals to solve the wait and intervention times for care.
EHN's Veteran's One Stop Center has the capability and resources to expedite these services to a much-needed population and can provide care to service members anywhere from two to five days of initial contact.
Today, it is my privilege to honor Emergence Health Network's Veterans One Stop Center for the grand opening of their new facility in East El Paso and thank them for their ongoing efforts to help our veterans, active-duty military, and their families.
