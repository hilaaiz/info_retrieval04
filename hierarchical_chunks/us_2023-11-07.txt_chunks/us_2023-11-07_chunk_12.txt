Mr. NEAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual whose unwavering dedication to providing exceptional care to the most vulnerable in our society, Frank Romano.
For over four decades, Frank Romano has been creating and nurturing several successful enterprises that provide essential services to elderly and disabled individuals.
His notable portfolio includes skilled nursing, assisted living residencies, adult day health programs, as well as home care services and senior transportation.
A graduate of Merrimack College and the Harvard Business School Program in Entrepreneurship, Frank embarked on his entrepreneurial journey at IBM in Boston where he worked for six years, interspersed with a two-year leave of absence to honorably serve our nation in the Vietnam War.
Upon his return, he channeled his passion and expertise into establishing his first healthcare facility in 1972, laying the foundation for what has been a long career synonymous with dignity, care, and deep-rooted respect for the care of our elders.
Frank has served on the Board of Governor's for the American Health Care Association, the largest association in the United States representing long term and post-acute care providers.
His contributions have not gone unnoticed, as he was honored with the Joe Warner Patient Advocacy Award, acknowledging his unparalleled commitment to senior care.
On Thursday, November 16th the Massachusetts Senior Care Foundation will honor Frank at its annual breakfast.
Today, 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the many years of service Frank has dedicated to his profession, which will undoubtedly continue to inspire and uplift our community for generations to come.
