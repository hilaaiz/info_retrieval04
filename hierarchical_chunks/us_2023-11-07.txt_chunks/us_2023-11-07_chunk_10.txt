Mr. CAREY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of Kellie Ruetsch, a constituent from Plain City, Ohio.
Kellie is a regional operations manager for Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Service.
She was recently recognized as one of Superior Ambulance's ``Stars.''
Every year, Superior Ambulance recognizes a handful of its EMTs for their exceptional leadership skills.
An EMT since 1997, Kellie has devoted her life to helping others.
Apart from being an EMT, Kellie is also a paramedic and a firefighter.
Despite volunteering countless hours to her community and raising two children, Kellie has also found time to advance her skills and professional growth.
In 2016, Kellie was offered a leadership position in which she immediately excelled.
In 2017, Kellie obtained her EMS instructor license and completed Ambulance Service Manager training in 2022.
Kellie's colleagues and superiors say, that she's someone who leads by example, never seeing a task as below her station.
Plain City and central Ohio are better places to live because of people like Kellie Ruetsch.
I salute her service to our community.
