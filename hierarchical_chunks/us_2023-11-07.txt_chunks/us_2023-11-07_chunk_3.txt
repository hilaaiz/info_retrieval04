Mr. ALLRED.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commemorate a historic achievement by the Texas Rangers.
The Texas Rangers won the World Series for the first time in franchise history despite many setbacks and injuries along the way.
On Friday, November 3, 2023, Arlington, TX hosted a well-deserved Championship Parade.
As a Congressman for North Texas and a lifelong Rangers fan, I am excited to celebrate this hard-fought victory with the Rangers and my fellow fans.
Achievements such as this don't happen overnight, and they take the support of families, friends, coaches, fans, staff and crew.
It really does take a community.
And the Metroplex should be proud.
As a former professional athlete myself, I know the hard work it takes, day in and day out, to practice and work to win as a team.
All while forging ahead in the face of adversity.
They have shown that North Texans are champions, and we couldn't be prouder of what they all have accomplished together.
Go Rangers.
