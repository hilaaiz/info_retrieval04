Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pleasant Valley High School volleyball team for being undefeated and winning the AHSAA Class 2A state title.
On November 1, 2023, Pleasant Valley High School defeated Sand Rock for the 2A state championship in straight sets at Bill Harris Arena in Birmingham.
Pleasant Valley's volleyball squad won its sixth state championship in program history led by head Coach Dana Bryant, who notched her 559th and final victory as a coach.
