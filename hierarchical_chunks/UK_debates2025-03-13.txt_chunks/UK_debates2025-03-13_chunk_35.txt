Free school meal eligibility should be looked at in the round.
That is why this Government are developing a child poverty strategy, which includes free school meals.
In the meantime, the hon.
Lady will be aware that we are rolling out free breakfast clubs in schools, because she is right that having a meal inside a child can stop them feeling hungry, but it can also help them to learn, concentrate and do better at school.
That is why we are committed to those free breakfast clubs, and to our child poverty taskforce, which will also look at free school meals.
This Sunday marks Disabled Access Day and the importance of accessibility and inclusiveness for all.
Sadly, disabled people in Luton South and South Bedfordshire cannot access Luton station because of the delays and failures of Network Rail in progressing the Access for All programme and installing lifts at Luton station.
Will the Leader of the House grant a debate in Government time on how our plan for Great British Railways will improve infrastructure and ensure reliable, affordable and, importantly, accessible train services for everybody?
I am sorry to hear of the frustrations and problems that my hon.
Friend’s constituents have had with station accessibility, which gets raised with me in business questions regularly.
The Government are committed to improving it.
They are difficult challenges, and the Rail Minister is actively considering the best approach to the Access for All programme, but I will ensure that he has heard her question and that she gets a full reply.
