I thank the Secretary of State for that answer.
Just yesterday, Parliament approved Labour’s new deal for working people—the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation.
This will see a pay rise for more than 200,000 working Scots, many in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency, and a marked improvement to terms and conditions, which will be beneficial to our young workforce.
Does he agree that with a Government committed to improving the pay, terms and conditions  of workers across the country, the working people of Airdrie and Shotts will always get a better deal with Labour?
