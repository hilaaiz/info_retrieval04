I thank the hon.
Member for her question, and I thank Alison and Kevin for their important work.
We already talked about the difficult choices that the Government faced and the unenviable choices that had to be made.
Health and social care was a beneficiary of the additional revenue that needed to be raised to meet some of the challenges we face, but we are not casual about the impact of that, and we recognise the pressures that come from that.
I would say that I do not agree.
Taxes have to apply to every sector, and we cannot carve out certain sectors.
However, I appreciate the pressures that she articulates.
That is why the rest of the Government’s agenda is set to address all those factors.
