I thank the hon.
Lady for raising such an important issue, which is of great concern to her and many others in the House.
I am sure that in the coming days, not just with tomorrow’s private Member’s Bill but with the two days of debate on the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill, we will have plenty of time to debate these sorts of issues in the House.
