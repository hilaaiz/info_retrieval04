The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking with Cabinet colleagues to support businesses in rural areas.
Businesses in rural areas offer significant potential for growth and are central to our economy.
We are working across Government to unlock the full potential of rural businesses as part of the Government’s growth mission.
We are committed to launching a business growth service inspired by the US Small Business Administration, which will operate in partnership with devolved Governments and the growth hub network in England to make it easier to access support from Government for all businesses.
In conversation this morning with Trudy Morris, the CEO of the Caithness chamber of commerce, she outlined the sheer importance of tourism businesses to the local economy and the farmers in Scotland.
The concern expressed to me is on the rate of VAT on tourism and similar businesses, and although we do not know whether the Highland council will impose a tourism levy, that could be a double whammy.
I do not expect for one instant hon.
Members on the Front Bench to say, “Jamie, you can have a cut in the rate of VAT”—well, I dream sometimes—but I would be grateful for a meeting to discuss the nature of the problem and how we could possibly tackle it.
You might get a chocolate biscuit these days.
I apologise to the hon.
Gentleman, as I cannot fulfil his dreams right now.
However, I am happy to meet him to talk about that issue.
I recognise that there is considerable interest in that question from the hospitality industry, so I am happy to meet to hear, in a bit more detail, the particular concerns expressed to him.
