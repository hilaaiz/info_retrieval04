I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
I am hugely sympathetic to families who have suffered from hormone pregnancy tests.
She will be aware that Baroness Cumberlege’s independent review highlighted the healthcare system’s failure to listen to patients’ concerns around those tests.
She will also be aware that the causal links have been reviewed many times, but I will ensure that Ministers get back to her with a full update.
