Friend for his support.
Around 140,000 workers in north-east England will feel the benefits of this direct pay rise.
I know his North Durham constituency well—I am no stranger to Chester-le-Street—and not only will his constituents get a pay rise, but his local shops, his restaurants, his pubs and more will get what they need most of all: customers who have got a bit of money to spend.
