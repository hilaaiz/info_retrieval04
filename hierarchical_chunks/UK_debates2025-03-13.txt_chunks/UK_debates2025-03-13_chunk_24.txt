Thank you, Mr Speaker.
Fly by Nite haulage, based in Redditch, is trusted to deliver by the biggest names in music, TV and theatre.
However, post-Brexit rules on visa and work permits are damaging the creative industries’ opportunities on the continent.
Would the Minister agree to meet me to discuss how we can break the logjam and support British success stories such as Fly by Nite?
It was Chris Bloore’s turn.
I am following the Order Paper, but I am going from side to side.
Chris Law will come afterwards; he was not next.
There are many Members called Chris.
