The right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to raise the issue of Capture.
As he will know, we have published our response to the independent Kroll report on the Capture software issue and the way in which the Post Office responded to the data that came out of it.
We have been meeting sub-postmasters who used the Capture system and who were the victims in that regard to talk through a redress scheme with them.
We are also working closely with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and have made it clear to the Post Office that it must co-operate with requests from the CCRC so that we can speed up its deliberations on the 21 cases.
I recently met a constituent who is a former postmaster affected by the Horizon scandal.
He has applied for compensation but feels that the process is taking too long, with unreasonable asks.
Given the legal ruling that postmasters should be afforded the benefit of the doubt, what steps is the Department taking to ensure that compensation claims are processed fairly and without delays that could further affect the victims?
As my hon.
Friend will know, we inherited a compensation process that was perceived by many sub-postmasters as being slow, legalistic and adversarial, so we have already taken a series of steps to try to speed things up, particularly in trying to get out more fixed-sum payments—for example, we are moving in more staff to support work on the compensation process.
If she would like me to look in more detail at her constituency case, I am very happy to do so.
