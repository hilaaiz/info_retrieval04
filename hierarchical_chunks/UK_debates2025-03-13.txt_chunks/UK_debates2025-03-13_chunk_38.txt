I thank the Chair of the Backbench Business Committee, as ever.
He has announced a number of important debates that will be popular among hon.
Members, on issues such as Thames Water and, as has been raised with me a number of times including recently, pelvic mesh and valproate.
May I join him in the advice he gives to hon.
Members and also in wishing those celebrating Purim and Holi the best of times this week?
