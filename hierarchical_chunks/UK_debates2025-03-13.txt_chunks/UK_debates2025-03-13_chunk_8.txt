I thank the Minister for his answer.
My constituent George Stevens runs a microbusiness in Lydd making handcrafted stringed instruments; it has been running for over 30 years and he has many EU customers.
He is deeply worried about Brexit-related red tape, which is holding back his EU exports.
Can the Minister give him an assurance that, as a result of the proposed measures, he will now find it easier to trade with the EU?
