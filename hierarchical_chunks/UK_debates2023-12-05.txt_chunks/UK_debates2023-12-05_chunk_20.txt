The Minister will know, because it covers her constituency as well, that the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust does vital work in mental health, but there simply is not the resource, and I am afraid that parroting about parity of esteem does not tackle the issues.
Wait times are 190 days for children and young people in her constituency and mine.
I recently spoke to a mother in Peacehaven whose son is waiting for an  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis.
His performance at school is in rapid decline, but because of the wait times he is not eligible for support in school via any education, health and care plan to start to turn things around.
What assurances can the Minister give my constituents, and indeed her constituents, that the wait times for mental health will come down and that resources will be given to these partnerships, rather than just empty words?
The hon.
Member is absolutely right: we know that in Sussex we have higher rates of mental health illness than in many other parts of the country, with a 15% increase in Sussex A&E attendances.
He might not be aware of them, but multiple schemes are available in Sussex.
Health in Mind is offering psychological support to those suffering stress and anxiety, which can be self-referred.
We have the Sussex mental health crisis line, now open 24/7, which is accessed via the 111 service.
We have mental health professionals rolling out the blue light triage service in Sussex, and we have the Brighton and Hove mental health rapid response service, open 24/7, to which anyone can refer themselves urgently.
Perhaps if he looks at some of the services provided locally, he will be able to reassure his constituents.
