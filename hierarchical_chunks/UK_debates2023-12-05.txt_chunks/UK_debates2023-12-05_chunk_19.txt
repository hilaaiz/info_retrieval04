The Care Quality Commission now says that almost two thirds of England’s maternity services are rated inadequate or requiring improvement in safety, up from 55% last year.
The Government have been told time and time again to recruit more midwives, and to value midwives so that they do not want to leave the profession in the first place.
As a result of ministerial failure, mothers—especially those from black and ethnic minority groups—do not get the safe, good-quality maternity care that they deserve.
What is the Minister’s plan to properly improve maternity care?
The hon.
Lady may not have listened to my first answer.
We have increased the number of midwives—it is up 14% since 2010—and increased the number of midwifery training places by 3,650.
We have also introduced a maternity support programme that is providing intensive support for the 32 trusts that are going through it.
The hon.
Lady may want to speak to her ministerial colleagues in Wales, where Labour runs the health service, because Healthcare Inspectorate Wales recently issued an immediate improvement notice to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board for its maternity services.
We will have to go a bit faster.
What steps she is taking to improve access to mental health services.
We are improving mental health services, transforming them with an extra £2.3 billion a year.
We have already seen some improvements in the delivery of those changes from giving mental health services parity of esteem with physical services.
