I welcome the Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box for his first statement, particularly as this week marks 100 days in the job.
The UK has an important role to play to strengthen regional stability in the middle east.
That is why the Leader of the Opposition has met and spoken with leaders in the region, including from Jordan, Palestine, Israel and Qatar.
That is why the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) , has visited the region twice in recent weeks, and that is why we welcomed the initial deployment of UK forces on  13 October .
They will do the job with total professionalism, and we thank them for that.
