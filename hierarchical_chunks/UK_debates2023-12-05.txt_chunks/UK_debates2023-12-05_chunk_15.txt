I thank my right hon.
Friend very much for her kind words.
She will remember how much I enjoyed sitting on the Front Bench alongside her when we were in the Home Office.
In terms of her work in Essex, she is a formidable campaigner and she will know that the decision on such a healthcare centre lies with her integrated care board, to which the Government have given some £183 million of capital funding between 2022 and 2025.
I am sure she will make a compelling case to the ICB for such a centre in her constituency.
Interestingly, the Mid and South Essex integrated care board is one of seven sites receiving additional support and funding from NHS England to address health inequalities, and I know she will pay close attention to how that is spent.
