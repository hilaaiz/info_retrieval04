The Secretary of State needs to be very clear with the House: 15,000 people have already died in Gaza, and 1,200 have died in Israel.
Israel is clearly pushing the entire population southwards, if not out of the Gaza strip altogether.
Is Britain involved in the military actions that Israel has taken, either physically or by providing information in support of those military activities?
I think the House needs to be told.
What is the long-term aim of British military involvement in Gaza?
The simple answer is no, and I hope that clears it up.
I am surprised to hear the right hon.
Gentleman talk just about people being killed.
They were murdered.
They were slaughtered.
It was not just some coincidental thing.
I understand and share the concerns about the requirement on Israel, on us and on everyone else to follow international humanitarian law.
When Israel drops leaflets, when it drops what it calls a “knock” or a “tap” and does not bomb until afterwards, when it calls people to ask them to move, when it issues maps showing where Hamas have their tunnels and asks people to move away from them, that is a far cry from what Hamas did on  7 October , when they went after men, women and children.
