The right hon.
Gentleman asked about the information flow; I can reassure the House that only the United Kingdom will have the ability to provide that information, and that is how we will ensure that it is used for the appropriate purposes.
He asked about the number of hostages; the United Kingdom has not confirmed exact numbers, partly because it is still unclear whether some may have died in the original  7 October  event or in subsequent events, and whether some may be being held.
We do not want to cause additional stress, but we know that there are still British hostages being held.
The right hon.
Gentleman asked about protecting the ships.
They are, of course, extremely capable ships—the last ship to be deployed, HMS Diamond, is capable of looking after herself, one might say—and we are benefiting from a great deal of co-operation with allies in the region to assist with that force protection.
The right hon.
Gentleman also asked about British forces in the wider region who may be in, for example, Syria or Iraq.
Again, we take their force protection very seriously.
As  the right hon.
Gentleman will understand, I cannot go into operational specifics, but we keep it under constant review.
Lastly, the right hon.
Gentleman asked about humanitarian aid.
This country has provided £60 million-worth of additional aid made available for Palestinians, and four flights have taken off so far.
Members on both sides of the House will realise that the problem is not just providing the aid but getting it into Gaza.
The Rafah crossing presents a considerable barrier to that, for all sorts of security reasons.
I am actively looking at different routes, and the right hon.
Gentleman will understand that that is one of the reasons I am going to the region this week.
