How will the Secretary of State ensure that UK surveillance flights support hostage rescue and not Israeli operations?
How many British hostages remain in Gaza?
How will the UK Navy ships that the Secretary of State has deployed protect commercial shipping routes?
What action is the Secretary of State taking to boost protection for UK personnel, especially those at joint allied bases?
What is he doing to open up the maritime routes for humanitarian aid that he has told us about today?
Finally, how many more RAF aid flights will take off this month to get much-needed aid into Gaza as the winter cold sets in?
