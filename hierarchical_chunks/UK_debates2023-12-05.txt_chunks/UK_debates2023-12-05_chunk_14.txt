I thank the Secretary of State for her response and welcome her to her new role; it is a real pleasure to see her in her position today.
My Witham constituents have one of the highest patient-GP ratios in the country.
That brings many challenges in accessing  the NHS, from primary care to dentistry, social care and hospital appointments, some of which have been exacerbated by industrial action.
Will she give an update on the work she is leading to address some of those issues and will she support my work and campaign locally to get a new primary health centre in Witham town?
