Last week another dentist in my constituency told my constituents that they were no longer able to provide NHS services.
These people have literally nowhere else to go nearby.
I want to come back to what my hon.
Friend  the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Kim Johnson)  asked about the underspend, because we had a meeting with the ICB and it was specifically told that the ringfence was being disapplied.
Does the Secretary of State agree that that money should be spent on dental services and that that instruction should be given by her today?
I agree, and that is why NHS England has provided guidance, as I set out earlier.
