I welcome the Secretary of State’s answers, including his confirmation that, as has been reported, the Shadow R1 is being deployed.
I note that the intention is to use a range of surveillance aircraft.
Will the Secretary of State tell us what other assets he is intending to use?
Given the significant tasking, the threats to shipping and the ongoing commitments to, for example, Operation Shader, will he comment on what is being deprioritised to allow this mission to take place?
Finally, in view of the recent threats to the Rivet Joint aircraft—I know that there are defensive aid suites on board—will he confirm that due consideration is being given to the protection of crews, given all the likely threats in the area and the presence of Iran?
