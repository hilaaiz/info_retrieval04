The Secretary of State’s predecessor took a strong interest in the deaths that took place in the Essex mental health trusts, and a statutory inquiry is now taking place.
Will she meet me and our Essex colleagues, and the families, to discuss that important inquiry, so that they can have justice for the loved ones they have lost?
I would be very pleased to meet my right hon.
Friend, the families and other Essex MPs to discuss that important inquiry.
