I thank the Minister for meeting me yesterday to discuss the proposed closure of Darlington’s booking office.
I also met David Horne yesterday afternoon to discuss that issue.
I remain deeply concerned that our mainline station, which is currently receiving £139 million of expansion investment, will be left without a booking office.
The elderly, disabled and vulnerable rely on help from our ticket offices, and if a station has barriers, that help needs to be in front of those barriers, not behind them.
Ticket machines and apps have cut-off times, making purchases impossible in the minutes running up to a train leaving.
Will my hon.
Friend look into that problem?
Will he assure the House that there is proper consultation, and that some ticket offices can be saved?
Will he make it clear that representations can be made by letter and not just by email?
