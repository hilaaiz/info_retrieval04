The Rwanda asylum plan was declared so poor that it threatened the rights of asylum seekers not to be tortured or subjected to inhumane treatment, and it was found incompatible with a host of international conventions.
Those were the findings of the Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court will inevitably reach the same conclusion.
How much taxpayers’ money does the Attorney General estimate the Government will spend appealing this illegal plan?
I absolutely do not accept the premise of the hon.
Lady’s question.
The divisional court was a strong win for the Government.
At the Court of Appeal, the majority found against us, but we also had a strong judgment from the Lord Chief Justice.
We believe that the assurances we have had from Rwanda regarding asylum protections there are robust, and we intend to make those arguments strongly in the Supreme Court.
What steps she is taking to increase prosecution rates for cases relating to violence against women and girls.
Work is going on across the criminal justice system to drive up prosecution levels.

The Solicitor General and I recently visited CPS South Wales to discuss its future plans.
The Jade’s law campaign is gathering more supporters with each passing day, united in our belief that a man such as Russell Marsh should have no say over the future of his children, whose mother he so viciously murdered.
Will the Attorney General engage in a serious and sympathetic discussion with her colleagues in the Ministry of Justice about how we can make Jade’s law a reality?
While I always enjoy my discussions with the hon.
Lady, I am afraid that I am not a Minister in the Ministry of Justice.
I am happy to pass on her points to those Ministers.
The Attorney General’s Office stays completely separate and independent of the Ministry of Justice, and it is important that we maintain that.
