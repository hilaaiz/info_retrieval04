The former Lord Chancellor,  the right hon.
Member for Esher and Walton (Dominic Raab) , when told of the demise of his Bill of Rights, said: “All the wrong people will celebrate.”
Was the Attorney General celebrating the defeat of that attack on our European convention rights?
Will she now stand up to other of her Cabinet colleagues who repeatedly transgress international law?
They did it with the Northern Ireland protocol, with the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, with the Illegal Migration Bill and again this week with the Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters)
Bill.
She is the Attorney General, so if she will not stand up for the rule of law, who will?
I absolutely can and do stand up for the rule of law.
The Government are committed to the rule of law domestically and committed to maintaining and upholding our obligations under international law.
That is made quite clear to all Ministers.
