I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question; I, too, have a well, but it does not supply our drinking water.
I think a lot of people have wells on their properties, or locally on their roads or wherever.
The issue he has raised is a matter for the Northern Ireland Administration, but here the Drinking Water Inspectorate has commissioned research into the impact of future private water supplies, as well as the whole regulatory model and legislative framework.
