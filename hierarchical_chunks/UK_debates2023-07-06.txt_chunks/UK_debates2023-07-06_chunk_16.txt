I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his interest in this matter.
There are three broad strands to our work on accountability.
First, we have provided expert assistance to Ukrainian investigators.
Secondly, alongside the international community we will continue to provide the ICC with funding, people and expertise, though I accept that the crime of aggression cannot be prosecuted there.
Thirdly, we are exploring other options to hold Russia accountable for the crime of aggression.
