The hon.
Gentleman is quite right to raise the concern that with delay comes victim attrition.
The answer lies in support.
The ISVAs that I mentioned earlier are invaluable in ensuring that victims are willing to continue their case to trial.
What assessment she has made of the adequacy of the level of prosecution rates of serious violent crime in the west midlands; and if she will make a statement.
On our recent law tour, the Attorney General and I saw at first-hand the work of the Crown Prosecution Service west midlands serious violence unit.
As my hon.
Friend would expect, the CPS prosecutes violent crime robustly.
As the Attorney General will know from intimate knowledge, serious violent crime is thankfully not something that Lichfield suffers very much from at all, but that is not the case in the broader west midlands.
What can the CPS do to demonstrate to people in the west midlands that it will have a zero tolerance attitude and take action against serious violent crime?
The sale and use of drugs is driving serious and violent crime.
Last year, for drugs offences the CPS in the west midlands had a conviction rate of over 90%.
I agree with my hon.
Friend’s zero tolerance approach.
What recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the unduly lenient sentence scheme.
The unduly lenient sentence scheme remains an important tool, ensuring appropriate sentences for the most serious crimes.
Last year, we referred 139 cases to the Court of Appeal and the sentence was increased in just under 70% of those cases.
