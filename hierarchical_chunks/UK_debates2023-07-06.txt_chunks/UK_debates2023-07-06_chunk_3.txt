The price of wheat peaked at £350 a tonne.
It has subsequently fallen to below £200 a tonne—not much more than it was before the invasion of Ukraine.
Why has the price of bread in our supermarkets not fallen, too?

I recognise the fact that global wheat prices have now come back down.
We work closely with retailers, processers and the hospitality sector to make sure that there is not extra profiteering in the marketplace.
We will continue to have discussions with those representatives and will work with the sector to make sure that food is reasonably priced for our constituents.
The farming Minister will know that in north Northamptonshire we have some of the best farmers in the country who are  facing these challenges, like every other farm up and down the land.

That is a very kind invitation.
It is always a pleasure to visit Northamptonshire, and, if my diary allows, I will of course meet my hon.
Friend and his farmers.
