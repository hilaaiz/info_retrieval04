I thank the Solicitor General for his response.
He will recall that I contacted him on behalf of a number of my constituents about a child sex offender in my constituency.
Our local newspaper, the Stoke Sentinel, reported the sentencing of that offender beneath the headline, “Pervert Walks Free From Court”.
My constituents are rightly concerned that such serious offenders can receive a non-custodial sentence.
Given that my right hon.
and learned Friend has been unable to intervene, will he review the way in which such offending is evaluated, so that such cases can be considered?
