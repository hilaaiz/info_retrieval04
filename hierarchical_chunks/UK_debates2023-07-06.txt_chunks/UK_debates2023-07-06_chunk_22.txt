I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
I would be delighted to pick this up with her outside the Chamber if she would like more detail on the work we are doing.
I work very closely with the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin.
His team are currently investigating and prosecuting 92,000 open war crimes cases during a conflict—something that is unprecedented.
We are providing help at every level, including prosecutorial and evidence-gathering help.
We are a keen part of the atrocity crimes advisory group.
We have been training judges.
We are keen to help with the wider accountability question on the international stage as well.
At all levels, we are absolutely determined to help our friends in Ukraine.
