The Minister says that he has engaged with relevant disabled people’s organisations, but there has been widespread opposition to ticket office closures from such organisations, including Disability Rights UK, the National Federation of the Blind, Transport for All, Royal National Institute of Blind People, Royal National Institute for Deaf People, Guide Dogs and Scope.
The Minister thinks that taking expert staff out of station ticket offices and putting them on the platform will help people, but how will people know which member of staff to go to for the help they need?
A ticket office means that people know where to go to get that help.
If those staff are to be redeployed, there will not be a single redundancy, will there, Minister?
I have a funny feeling that these proposals will go down not like a yellow submarine but like a lead balloon.
I have stated the position with regard to redundancies.
A deal is on the table but the RMT will not give it to its members to make a determination.
It included a commitment to no compulsory redundancies until December 2024.
It is for the RMT to decide whether it wishes to get that protection in place.
I will say the same thing to the hon.
Member that I have said previously: I have worked with those groups; they were the first I met and are at the forefront of my mind in ensuring that this works.
From a passenger perspective, if they want to reach out to a member of staff for any reason, they will do so, and members of staff will—because they are great members of staff—signpost them to somebody else.
All members of staff must have the requisite training, and they do.
I have great faith in our railway workforce to continue looking after passengers.
I believe that these changes will bring more benefits in that regard.
