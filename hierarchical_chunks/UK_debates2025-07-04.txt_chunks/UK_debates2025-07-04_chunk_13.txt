I thank all Members who have contributed to constructive and positive debates during each of the Bill’s stages.
I have to say that the constituents of my hon.
Friend  the Member for Northampton South (Mike Reader)  must be delighted that he did not pursue his career on the forecourt.
He mentioned work of the Animal Welfare Society and his passionate membership of it.
He also reminded us all of the importance of doorstep dogs and—one of my favourites—dogs at polling stations, which always seem to appear whenever the election day is.
I thank him for his support and join him in supporting Four Paws, Battersea and the Countryside Alliance.
