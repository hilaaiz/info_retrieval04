I thank the hon.
Member for his insights as a vet, and for emphasising what so many people across the House know: these changes are vital.
May I also say how grateful I am to the hon.
Members who took the time to serve on the Bill Committee?
I am truly grateful for their support and contributions, and for the conversations I have had with many of them about the Bill.
