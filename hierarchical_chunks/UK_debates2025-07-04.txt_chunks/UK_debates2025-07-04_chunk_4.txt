I thank the hon.
Member for introducing this fantastic Bill, which does important things for animal welfare.
Sadly, my constituency  has a problem with dog-on-dog attacks, which are truly distressing to their owners.
The overwhelming majority of dog owners in my constituency are incredibly responsible and keep their dogs under control at all times, but a tiny minority are doing a great deal of damage.
Does the hon.
Member have any thoughts on what we could do about that?
