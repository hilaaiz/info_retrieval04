I thank  the hon.
Member for Winchester (Dr Chambers)  for bringing forward the Bill, and for all his work to get it to this stage.
We should also thank the former hon.
Member for North Devon, who I understand brought forward the Bill in the previous Parliament; it did not quite get through Parliament before the general election.
It is good to see proposed legislation moving from one Parliament to the next and having cross-party support.
