I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Bolton West (Phil Brickell)  for his support and for raising the importance of ending smuggling.
Smuggling is the wrong thing to do for the welfare of animals and for our biosecurity, and that is a really important point.
He also raised how we need to bring down the demand for mutilated dogs, and I think we can do more across the whole House on that issue.
Of course, I agree with him that ferrets are a northern icon.
