I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Crawley (Peter Lamb)  for his support.
He is right that Santa’s sleigh has a separate licensing system, so there is no difficulty in reindeers passing between any borders on the night of  24 December .
I recognise his support for the welfare of animals, and we must do better.
I will take away his important concerns about social media advertising.
