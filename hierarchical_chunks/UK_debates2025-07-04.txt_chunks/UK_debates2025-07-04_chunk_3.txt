I very much appreciate that intervention from my hon.
Friend.
Yes, one important part of this Bill—which I will come on to—is biosecurity.
There are a lot of diseases that we do not see in the UK that can affect humans as well, such as rabies and Brucella canis.
There are also diseases such as distemper that affect other dogs; we do not see those diseases in the UK, but there is a risk of them coming in and becoming endemic.
My partner Emma, who is here today, is an epidemiologist at the University of Surrey, studying diseases such as rabies in dogs and the risk of them transferring across borders.
It is a very live issue.
Those who purchase an animal are often completely unaware of the smuggling process, which is devastating.
When people go to buy a puppy, they are completely unaware that there is a reasonable chance that it has been smuggled in from abroad.
My hon.
Friend is laying out clearly the need for change.
A number of my constituents, including Ann from Bredbury, Shannon from Marple and Ashley from High Lane, have been in touch to ask me to support him in his endeavours.
People are staggered that some of these practices are not yet outlawed.
Does he agree that some of his proposals in the Bill are closing loopholes that people already expect to be closed?
That is an insightful intervention from my hon.
Friend.
Yes, most people are shocked at the sheer scale of puppy smuggling.
The Dogs Trust did a study looking at one of the online platforms with puppy adverts, and up to 50% of those adverts turned out to be for puppies that had possibly been smuggled in from abroad.
In the last 12 months, one in five vets said they had treated animals that they believed had been smuggled from abroad.
This is not a niche issue; it is a systemic issue within the pet trade, and these loopholes need to be closed.
