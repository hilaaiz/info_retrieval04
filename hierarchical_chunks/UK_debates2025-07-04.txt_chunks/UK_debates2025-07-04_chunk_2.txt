I thank my hon.
Friend for introducing this Bill, which I know means a lot to the great number of my constituents who have contacted me.
They are particularly concerned about the conditions that puppies are smuggled in, but also that many animals coming into this country illegally bring conditions that we have eradicated here, or have cropped ears and tails.
They are very keen to see my hon.
Friend’s Bill pass, but can he assure us that more can be done in future to make sure, in particular, that we stamp out those illnesses?
