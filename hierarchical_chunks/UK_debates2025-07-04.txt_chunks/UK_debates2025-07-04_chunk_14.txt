My hon.
Friend  the Member for Congleton (Sarah Russell)  mentioned dog-on-dog offences.
Those are offences under section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, and we are working with the Crown Prosecution Service to update its guidance to make that clear.
We are also working with stakeholders to encourage responsible dog ownership and reduce dog attacks.
As my hon.
Friend quite rightly pointed out, this is about a minority of dog owners, but it is extremely distressing for anybody involved.
My hon.
Friend  the Member for Glasgow East (John Grady)  mentioned stray dogs and the difficulty they have in gaining trust, which is so true, as well as the damage that cruelty to animals can do throughout a pet’s life.
He also mentioned the importance of social media and how we can ensure that all of us in this House are sending the right message that we think the practice of mutilating animals is unacceptable.
