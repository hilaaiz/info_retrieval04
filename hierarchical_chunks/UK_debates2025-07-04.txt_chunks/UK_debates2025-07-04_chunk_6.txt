I thank the hon.
Member for introducing this important Bill, which I support.
He talks about the impact of diseases that puppies might have when they are brought in.
Does he agree that there are also diseases that have potential impacts on human health, often for the veterinary surgeons or nurses who are looking after them?
For example, diseases such as Brucella canis could lead to miscarriage for a lady if she is looking after one of those puppies while pregnant.
