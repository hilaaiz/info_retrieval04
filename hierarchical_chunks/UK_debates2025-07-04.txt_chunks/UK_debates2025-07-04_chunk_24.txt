I thank  the hon.
Member for Chester South and Eddisbury (Aphra Brandreth)  for bringing forward this Bill, which is immensely popular  with local farmers.
I have met with the NFU and its membership repeatedly over months, if not most of the last year, and it is always one of the first things they mention to me.
I commend her for her sterling work and for the collegiate way in which she always conducts herself, including in this matter.
