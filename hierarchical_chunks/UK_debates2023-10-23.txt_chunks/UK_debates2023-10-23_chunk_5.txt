As we have heard, this is a very serious issue.
Recent research from the National Union of Students shows that almost one in five full-time students work more than 20 hours per week alongside their studies—they are working even more than in previous years—and 40% of students say that work is having a negative impact on their studies.
Students are clearly struggling with the Conservatives’ cost of living crisis.
How does the Minister expect students to balance their studies and employment to pay their bills?
Does he acknowledge that this is now forcing many students out of higher education?
Actually, the opposite is true.
We have a record number of students going to university.
Disadvantaged students are 71% more likely to go to university now than they were in 2010.
We have a huge package of support.
I have mentioned the £276 million for disadvantaged students.
We are doing everything we can to help disadvantaged students.
