I welcome the idea of the advanced British standard assessment, although the name is unwieldy—acronyms are used elsewhere—and difficult to export.
That aside, has there been any more exploration of what the curriculum would look like and of how many years young people would need to study for the qualification?
Does it mean the end of GCSEs?
