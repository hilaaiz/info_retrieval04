I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.
I agree with him and the Leader of the Opposition that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is truly horrifying.
To prevent a catastrophe it is essential that far more aid reaches the people who need it and it is vital that the hostages are unconditionally released.
Hamas’s evil attacks have claimed far too many innocent lives already.
Israel unquestionably has the right to protect its citizens and target these brutal terrorists in line with international law, just as we all have a duty to prevent more needless civilian deaths.
Does the Prime Minister agree with many of us, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, that the UK should be leading diplomatic efforts to secure a pause in hostilities with a temporary humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the hostages to be released and to get aid into Gaza?
