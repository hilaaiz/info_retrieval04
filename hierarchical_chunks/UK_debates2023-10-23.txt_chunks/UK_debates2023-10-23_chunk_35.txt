I thank the Prime Minister for all the efforts that he and his team are making at this time.
During the important discussions that he was having with leaders in the region at the end of last week about getting more humanitarian assistance into Gaza—and that is exactly right—was he able to obtain any new information about the welfare of hostages who have been taken by Hamas into Gaza?
They include many elderly people, toddlers with medical needs and disabled people.
Is it not important for us to make sure that they are not forgotten, and that the supplies going into Gaza reach the hostages as well?
