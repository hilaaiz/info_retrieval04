I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
My first speech in the House of Commons was about that very subject.
The six encounters that I mentioned are the minimum.
Obviously, many schools do more.
Only last week, I attended Oasis school in Bristol, and watched students being encouraged to take up apprenticeships and to hold an apprenticeship careers fair.
We are doing huge amounts.
I mentioned the apprenticeship skills and knowledge network, which is going around schools and encouraging pupils to take up apprenticeships.
That involves more than 2,000 schools and 680,000 pupils.
We need to do as much as possible to educate students about apprenticeships and to ensure that they have the encounters that he rightly talks about.
