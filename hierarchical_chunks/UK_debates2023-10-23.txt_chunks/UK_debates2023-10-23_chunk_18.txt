I was really sorry to hear about the difficult experiences of my hon.
Friend’s constituent; I was disturbed to hear what has gone on.
I know that my hon.
Friend has raised the matter in correspondence with the Department, which the Under-Secretary of State, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wantage (David Johnston) , recently addressed.
I hope that her constituent is now safely settling in at her new college, but the Schools Minister and I will absolutely look at this again.
