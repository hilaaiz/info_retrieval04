Friend for raising this important issue.
There is no place on British streets for demonstrations, convoys or flag-waving that not only glorify terrorism but harass the Jewish community.
There is no place for antisemitism on our streets, which is why we have also increased funding for the Community Security Trust to protect British Jews from these types of incidents.
The decisions that she refers to are typically operational decisions for the police and local communities, but I will very much bear in mind what she has said in our further engagements with those entities and individuals.
