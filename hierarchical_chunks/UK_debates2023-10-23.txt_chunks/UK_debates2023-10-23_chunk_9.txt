I thank the Minister for his response and his positivity.
I echo the request of  the hon.
Member for Banff and Buchan (David Duguid)  to ensure that all the benefits of higher education are present not only here on the mainland but across the whole United Kingdom.
I know that is the Minister’s wish, but can he confirm that, when it comes to higher technical qualifications, girls and ladies will have the same opportunities as young fellas and young men?
