I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.
My constituency has been the location for two major solidarity with Palestine protests over the past two Saturdays, and I suspect that there will be more to come.
The Jewish community in Westminster has highlighted to me that these protests start just a few minutes’ walk from synagogues and that they coincide with the end of Shabbat services.
Does the Prime Minister agree that, if further such protests go ahead, the timing and location of their starts should be considered, to take into account that members of the Jewish community are still worried about their safety and that the protests coincide with their Shabbat?
