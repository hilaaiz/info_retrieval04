As I have said, we do of course keep the list of proscribed organisations under review, but we do not routinely comment on whether an organisation is or is not under consideration for proscription.
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to my earlier comments: hateful extremism of the type that we saw this weekend has no place in our society, and it should be met with the full force of the law.
A group of 100 journalists from around the world have just been shown some indescribable raw footage of the  Hamas attacks in a private screening.
According to a BBC journalist, it features a father and two sons aged roughly seven and nine seen running into a shelter in their underwear.
A terrorist throws a grenade into the shelter, killing the father and badly injuring the two boys, who run back into the house covered in blood.
The two children are screaming for their father, and saying that they are going to die.
The terrorist is seen calmly drinking water from the family’s fridge.
That is just one of the videos that have been shown to 100 journalists from around the world in the last couple of hours.
Will the Prime Minister confirm that any person in the United Kingdom supporting this vicious terrorism will be subject to the full force of the law?
I saw much of the same footage myself on my visit to Israel last week and I can tell the House that it is absolutely horrifying to watch.
When we hear in this House about Israel’s actions, it is important to have those images in our mind.
What happened to its citizens was unforgivable and it has every right to defend itself against that.
I can also provide my right hon.
and learned Friend with the reassurance that, as he well knows, under the Terrorism Acts of 2000 and 2006, the glorification of terrorism, support for proscribed organisations and the encouraging of terrorism are all offences and will be met with the full force of law.
