The Prime Minister said in his statement that this was a moment for moral clarity, and I agree with him.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire at the moment: 34 trucks have gone in, set against a normal backdrop of hundreds going in every day.
We are on a precipice, with people including women and children in hospitals dying because of shortages of power, water and food.
I welcome the money for aid but, if it cannot get in, it is not helping.
What can the Prime Minister do to get that aid in, in the quantities that will prevent avoidable deaths in Gaza?
Last week, President Sisi himself commended the United Kingdom for our diplomatic efforts to ensure the access of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and I thank my right hon.
Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Development Minister for their efforts in that regard.
We in this House should be proud of the UK’s efforts to ensure that that access is now open.
Of course we need more, and that is why the logistical support that we can provide to ensure that high volumes of aid can flow freely to the people who need it is imperative.
The Development Minister is extensively engaged with the UN on that topic.
