I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his constructive comments and his support.
Just to recap, on humanitarian aid, by announcing an additional £20 million today, we will be doubling our aid to the region, where we are already one of the leading contributors of any country in the world.
The Development Minister, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) , will remind me, but I think that about 10% of the UN mission in the region is funded by UK contributions.
Most of our aid is funnelled through that.
It is also worth bearing in mind that President Sisi specifically commended the efforts of the UK alongside the US in ensuring that the Rafah crossing could be open and functioning.
That is testament to the work of the Development Minister, the Foreign Secretary and our team on the ground.
