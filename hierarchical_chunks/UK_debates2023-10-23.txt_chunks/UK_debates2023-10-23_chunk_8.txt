My hon.
Friend is a champion of science, technology, engineering, maths and skills, and he will know that education is devolved.
The devolved Administrations are responsible for their education systems,  but the Department for Education is working with the Governments of the UK.
We engaged at both official and ministerial level when the advanced British standard was announced.
We look forward to continued engagement as it is hopefully adopted across the United Kingdom.
