Ms. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary landing of the first boat carrying Haitian refugees to South Florida.
On December 12, 1972, the first report of Haitian refugees, often called ``Haitian Boat People,'' fleeing to the United States, was documented.

Central streets were named after Haitian cultural icons such as Felix Morisseau-Leroy and heroes on Plas Kamoken in Little Haiti.
Toussaint Elementary was home to the first Haitian American principal, and Morningside Elementary
