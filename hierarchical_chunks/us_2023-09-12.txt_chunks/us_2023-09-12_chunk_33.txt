Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th birthday of Schreiner University in Kerrville, TX.
A generous donation of land and finances by Captain Charles Schreiner in 1917 made this possible.
He served with distinction in the Texas Rangers.
Capt. Schreiner outlined his vision for the Institute as ``facilities for high grade instruction and military training for boys and young men as preparation for college and university work.''
James J. Delaney served as the first president of Schreiner Institute.
From the beginning, it has been committed to the Reformed tradition of the Presbyterian Church.
The first class of female students was admitted during World War II.
Formal military training ended in 1971, and the Institute became fully coeducational.
In the year 2000, Schreiner's governing board voted to change the school's name to Schreiner University.
The years immediately following the name change saw various renovations and new buildings take shape on campus.
Online classes started in 2014 and have expanded since then, now including a full online master's program.
Recently, Schreiner introduced their Military Academy Preparatory School to provide paths for students into military service.
In its 100th year, Schreiner University is proud to bring back a pastime from its early days, football.
Other sport disciplines for students include soccer, wrestling, equestrian, shooting sports, and tennis.
Today, Schreiner University president Charlie McCormick oversees a campus that offers over 30 different degree options.
I am proud that the Hill Country is home to a university the caliber.
Congratulations on 100 years of helping students achieve more.
