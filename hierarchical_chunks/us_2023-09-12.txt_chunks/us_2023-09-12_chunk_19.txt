These days there is a golden silence Overcoming the shouts of the prophets Of old and new, ``peace, peace''
And there is no peace But the silence of sealed echoes Shalom's doves find shelter at the Wall where wailing has not abated, The silence of the cloud of glory Encircling God's city like an embracing Wedding canopy.
The voice of the groom And the voice of the bride Whose rejoicing is Jerusalem's signature, Are ever preserved under the heavy silence Prayers refusing to concede victory to A spirit bespeaking not the contrition And afar to placate the One Who only pardons those seeking The promising power of peace.
