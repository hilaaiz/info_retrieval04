Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Latino Health Access, an organization that works tirelessly to uplift communities, promote health equity, and create sustainable change.
Latino Health Access (LHA) has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to these ideals through its mission, which partners with communities to aid through education, services, consciousness-raising, and civic participation.
Latino Health Access's mission is multifaceted, encompassing the delivery of culturally appropriate health-related services and programming to address pressing health concerns, as well as engaging individuals in low-income, low-opportunity areas to transform their environments and effect positive, concrete changes in their homes and communities.
Since its establishment in 1993, Latino Health Access has been a trailblazer in the field of public health by pioneering the Promotor de Salud/Community Health Worker (CHW) model in the United States, recognizing the potential of individuals from within communities to advocate for better health and living conditions.
The Promotores y Promotoras, who are integral to the Latino Health Access approach, are community members themselves, living within the very neighborhoods they serve, and are dedicated to promoting, connecting, and linking their communities with vital health services while also advocating at local, county, and state levels for policies that enhance overall living conditions.
Today, equity lies at the heart of the Promotor Model, which contributes to building healthier and more resilient communities by providing systems navigation services, surmounting barriers to access, and amplifying community leadership and participation, while simultaneously advocating for policy, systems, and environmental changes that address the social determinants of health.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the profound impact of Latino Health Access and its Promoter Model.
