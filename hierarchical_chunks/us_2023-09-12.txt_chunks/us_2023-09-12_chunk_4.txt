Those who knew 
Mr. Birkenstock will tell you that he was always generous and kind.
He never knew a stranger, and happily engaged every individual he met.
Mr. Birkenstock always put family first and committed much of his time to his grandchildren.
In his free time, Mr. Birkenstock was passionate about golfing, woodworking, hunting, fishing, and sports; he was a loud and proud supporter of the Iowa Hawkeyes, Green Bay Packers, and the St. Louis Cardinals.
A devoted man of faith, 
Mr. Birkenstock was a longtime member of the Knights of Columbus fraternal organization and St. Mary's Catholic Church in Dodgeville, where he served on the church council and taught Sunday School.

I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to recognize 
Mr. Birkenstock's life and service to our Nation.
He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew him.
