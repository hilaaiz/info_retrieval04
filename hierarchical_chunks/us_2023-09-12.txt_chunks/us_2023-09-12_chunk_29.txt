Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Victoria Swanson James, a resident of Ypsilanti, Michigan whose life her community is celebrating on her passing.
Her lifelong dedication to her family, church, and community is worthy of remembrance and commendation.
An Ypsilanti native, Victoria earned her Bachelor's in Education from our great Eastern Michigan University.
After earning a Master's in Education as well as a Certificate of School Administration, Victoria served as an educator in the Willow Run and Ann Arbor Public Schools for over a decade.
In 1978, she answered the call to the ministry.
She was later ordained in 1981 at the Metropolitan Memorial Baptist Church, also in Ypsilanti.
Under the leadership of the late Rev. Dr. S.L. Roberson, Victoria served as his First Assistant for over 20 years.
Outgrowing her role as an assistant, Victoria founded the Ekklesia Fellowship Ministries in Ypsilanti in 2000 and assumed the role of Pastor.
In 2004, she founded the ``Women of The Word, Too'' an organization that provides mentoring and an outlet for women clergy throughout Washtenaw County and the surrounding area.
Active in a range of organizations, Pastor James's service areas were quite extensive: member of the Love Ypsi Pastors Network, Washtenaw County Sheriff Council of Clergy, Hope Clinic Board of Directors, Pastoral Advisory Council for the Hope Clinic, former President of the Ypsilanti Gateway Economic Development Board, and former 1st Vice-President of the Ypsilanti Willow Run branch of the NAACP.
Victoria's son, DeVaughn, who has been preaching in her stead, had this to say: ``She loved her city.
Mom believed in the village mindset.
There's a proverb in our community that says `it takes a village to raise a child.'
Mom was confident in the strength and richness of the Ypsilanti village.
That's why she committed her life to uplifting this village.''
