Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Indonesian Community Connect in New Hampshire as they celebrate a decade of promoting Indonesian culture.
This also marks the sixth anniversary of ICC's initiatives as a non-profit organization and the second year of the momentum of the Little Indonesia Project.
The Little Indonesia Project, the first of its kind in our Nation, embodies art, culture, and opportunity, forging connections between Indonesian culture and New Hampshire, directly contributing to the revitalization of the Downtown Somersworth business district.
ICC, a non-profit organization headquartered in New Hampshire, has dedicated itself to showcasing the rich diversity of Indonesian culture while fostering mutual understanding among various cultures and values.
Operating from Somersworth, NH, the ICC team has diligently linked the Indonesian community with the Granite State and its support services.
They have gone the extra mile in assisting the Indonesian community with accessing local resources, including healthcare, education, food, festivals, and much more.
