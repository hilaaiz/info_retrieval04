Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the life service.
Despite being the mother of 8 and Nana of 15, Victoria always had love to spare for her congregation and her community.
We remember her fondly, and her presence will continue to be felt in the Ypsilanti community for years to come.
