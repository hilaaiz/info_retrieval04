Mr. THOMPSON.
Mister Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague Congressman Jared Huffman to honor Gaye Theresa LeBaron in celebration of her outstanding career as a journalist, teacher, author and historian.
Born in the town of Scotia, California, in 1935, 
Mrs. LeBaron moved to Boyes Hots Springs in Sonoma County when she was 14 years old.
She attended Santa Rosa Junior College before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley to pursue a bachelor's degree in English and History.
Her illustrious career as an historian and human-interest columnist at the Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, California, began in 1955 when she became an intern.
During her 65 years with the Press Democrat as a reporter and later columnist, she wrote 8,500 columns, married her late husband John LeBaron and had her 2 children, Suzanne and Tony.
Mrs. LeBaron has since gifted her research notes, correspondence, memoirs, unpublished documents, newspaper clippings and photographs to Sonoma State University.
Students and the public enjoy access to the Gaye LeBaron Collection.
