I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question relating to his constituency.
It is a shame that the Conservative party did not invest in extending those platforms when it was in power for 14 years.
I am very happy to discuss with my colleagues at the Department for Transport how the his constituents can benefit from the extra £120 billion that this Government are putting into capital investment.
