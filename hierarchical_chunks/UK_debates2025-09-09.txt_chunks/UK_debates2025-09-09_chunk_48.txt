I am tempted to say that it is too early to say, as the hon.
Gentleman gave me that get-out clause at the end.
The main thing I want to ensure is that all MPs have the information they need on a secure basis, so that they can provide reassurance to their constituents.
I am sure that there will be all sorts of rumours spreading around, some of which may be very wide of the mark, and I want to ensure that JLR is able to provide information to everybody.
We are going into recess next Tuesday; otherwise, I would have been more than happy to gather MPs to have these discussions in a private setting.
It is probably best if we see how we go on Friday.
I do not think that half an hour will suffice for a Zoom call with JLR; I will make that point to the chief executive.
