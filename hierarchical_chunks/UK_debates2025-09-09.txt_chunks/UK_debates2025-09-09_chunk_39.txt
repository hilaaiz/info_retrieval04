I welcome the Minister to his new role.
There has been a spate of cyber-attacks on important UK companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, on supermarkets and on the Legal Aid Agency.
What are the Government doing to restore public and, just as importantly, international trust in the UK’s cyber-security networks?
Do the Government think that the attacks have come from overseas?
