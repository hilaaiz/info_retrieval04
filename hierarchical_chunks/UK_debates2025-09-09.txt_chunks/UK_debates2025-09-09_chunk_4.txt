Over the summer, Heathrow finally published its proposals for a third runway.
It is very clear that a lot of supporting road and rail infrastructure will be needed if that expansion goes ahead.
Could the Chancellor outline to the House what estimates her Department has made of the amount of public investment that will be needed?
Heathrow execs have been clear that they are not going to fully fund it themselves.
This Government back a third runway at Heathrow.
We are a country that is open to global trade and investment—we have done three trade deals with countries around the world and have secured £120 billion of inward investment.
Heathrow Airport Ltd and others have now put forward a bid to build the third runway, and have been very clear that they will be investing in the infrastructure to make that possible.
I welcome investment into Britain, and I hope that parties all across the House will do the same.
If the Chancellor is looking for some quick-win infrastructure projects that will unlock economic growth, I recommend taking a look at a passing loop on the South Fylde line, which would better connect trains to employment and education sites through more reliable services.
It would also act as a boost for the tourism industry on the Fylde coast; people across Lancashire—maybe from other great towns such as Chorley—like to visit Lytham St Annes and the Fylde coast, and would be able to do so on half-hourly rail services.
Will the Chancellor take a look at that fantastic opportunity to boost economic growth in Lancashire and the Fylde?
I have huge respect for the hon.
Gentleman, and no one in this House would want to do anything to upset Mr Speaker.
I am very happy to look at investment opportunities in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency and right across Lancashire, including just up the coast in Blackpool, where we put in significant investment at the spending review earlier this year to build the housing and infrastructure our country desperately needs.
