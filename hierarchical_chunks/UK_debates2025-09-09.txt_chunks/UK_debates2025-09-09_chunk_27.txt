I also welcome my hon.
Friend to her new role.
Small businesses in Burnley, Padiham and Brierfield are the lifeblood of our community, providing jobs and livelihoods to our people.
Growing manufacturers and exporters such as the brilliant Barnes Aerospace in Burnley are doing an excellent job at taking Britain   across the world.
Will the Economic Secretary set out what the Government are doing to support small and medium-sized business, particularly our manufacturers, with access to finance?
My hon.
Friend raises an important issue, and it is very good to hear him championing businesses in his constituency.
The Government published the small business strategy in July, which sets out how we will make the UK the best place to start and grow a business and puts SMEs at the heart of our growth mission.
That includes tackling the barriers that SMEs face when accessing finance.
That is why the Government are committed to increasing the total financial capacity of the British Business Bank to £25.6 billion and introducing a new business growth service, which will make it easier and quicker for businesses across the UK to get the help, support and advice that they need to grow and thrive.
I warmly welcome the new Economic Secretary to her role.
Over the summer I looked at issues around liquidity in the London Stock Exchange and the deterioration that has happened.
Given that only 15% of share trades attract stamp duty and much more trading is conducted in a dark environment, will the new Economic Secretary meet with me to hear my concerns and the concerns of those in the City so that we can move forward in a positive direction?
I pay tribute to the right hon.
Member’s work in this area, and I would be more than happy to meet with him to discuss those concerns.
