I laid out in my initial answer some of the things that the Government are already engaged in, such as the NCSC, which has had involvement with Jaguar Land Rover since last Wednesday.
There are really good online aids that can help many companies work through how they can protect themselves better.
Some of those things are relatively simple, but some are more complex; it depends on the size of the organisation.
As I said, we have consulted on ransomware.
As we have said previously, paying the criminals does not get us out of the hole; they are not to be trusted, and people should be extremely cautious.
We do not recommend people paying ransoms in any circumstances.
It does not solve the problem, and actually adds to the business model of the criminals, whom we want behind bars.
