The Minister detailed that about 350 reliefs have been assessed, but my understanding is that more than 1,200 tax reliefs are on the books, amounting to hundreds of billions of foregone revenue for the Treasury.
Given that the Treasury examined the spending of all Departments in detail over the summer, I wondered whether it was considering applying the same level of scrutiny to itself.
It is worth noting that some 800 of the 1,200 reliefs the hon.
Member mentions ensure that the tax system operates as intended by defining the scope of tax correctly and that it operates fairly and simply.
I am sorry to disappoint the hon.
Member, but I will not be able to comment specifically on any changes that we may or may not make to tax reliefs—any decisions will, of course, be announced at the Budget, which is not today.
What steps she is taking to reform the financial services sector.
Our financial services growth and competitiveness strategy sets out the Government’s 10-year plan for the sector, making clear our ambition that, by 2035, the UK will be the global location of choice for financial services firms to invest, grow and sell their services throughout the UK and to the world.
To support this ambition, the Government announced the Leeds reforms, which are the most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in a decade.
The reforms will turbocharge growth, put more money in the pockets of working people and create more good, skilled jobs right across the country.
