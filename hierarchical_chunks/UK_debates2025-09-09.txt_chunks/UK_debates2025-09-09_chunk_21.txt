I thank my hon.
Friend for his support of what we are seeking to achieve through the better futures fund.
He is absolutely right that the fund will be designed to ensure that the money goes where it is most needed and where it will have the biggest impact—principles  I think we can all agree on.
As I mentioned earlier, DCMS will be working extensively with other Departments, local partners and others to design the scheme and as it gets established.
