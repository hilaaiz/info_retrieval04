I thank my hon.
Friend for everything that he is doing to champion Ilford South and to bring more investment into his local community.
It is great to have Labour councils working with a Labour Government to bring investment to local communities through housing and, crucially, through infrastructure—the schools and the doctors’ surgeries—that go alongside that new housing, so that we build not just homes but communities.
