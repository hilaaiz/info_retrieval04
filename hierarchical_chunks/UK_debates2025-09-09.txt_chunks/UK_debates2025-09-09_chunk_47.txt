I welcome the Minister to his role, and thank him for recognising the anxiety of the staff in the supply chain.
Jaguar Land Rover is a huge employer in my constituency, not least because I have the factory in Elmdon, which employs thousands, and there could be an effect on tens of thousands, through its supply chain.
Many of my constituents will be really anxious, not least because there is a lack of information at the moment.
I echo the comments of  the right hon.
Member for Liverpool Garston (Maria Eagle)  about briefings for MPs.
Can the Minister reassure my constituents that this Government will give the NCSC all the resources it needs to pursue the perpetrators?
I am more than happy to work with him on that.
Given the reports of losses being made every day, have there been any requests for financial support?
Is he talking to Chancellor about anything like that, or is it too early to say?
