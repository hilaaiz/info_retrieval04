I welcome my right hon.
Friend’s commitment to the hope of decent homes.
In my constituency, children and families are leaving in droves and schools are closing because of a lack of properly affordable housing.
She knows, as I do, that whatever we do in planning, without the skills that we need to build those homes, there will be a block there.
Is she working with the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who now has the skills brief, to ensure that we are investing in those skills and super-turbocharging the people who can help to build those homes?
