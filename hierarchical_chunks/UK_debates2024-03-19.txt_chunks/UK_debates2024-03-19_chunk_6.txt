I thank my hon.
Friend.
It was a pleasure, as always, to meet him in his constituency on Friday, where we discussed this matter and many others.
The Government will launch a consultation in due course on how to end this unfairness by administering the HICBC on a household rather than an individual basis.
Doing so would require significant reform of the tax system, as our tax infrastructure does not currently have a mechanism to consider household income, but the Government plan to end the unfairness for single-earner families in the child benefit system by administering the HICBC on a household rather than an individual basis by April 2026.
