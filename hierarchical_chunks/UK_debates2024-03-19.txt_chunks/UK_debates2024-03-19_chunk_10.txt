I welcome the recent tax cuts.
We need to ensure that those who work hard and do the right thing are rewarded in their old age.
Can the Treasury please stop allocating funds to France, which is clearly not stopping the boats, stop extortionate amounts being spent on hotels for illegal migrants, and reduce the foreign aid budget?
Maybe then we can give even more to our pensioners.
