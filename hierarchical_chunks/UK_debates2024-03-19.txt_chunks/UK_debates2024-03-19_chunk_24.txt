I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his questions and comments, which I will try to deal with more or less sequentially.
First, he asked me about the reports of famine.
The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report is clear: it says that famine is a very real scenario.
We are doing everything we can to try to head that off, as I set out in my response to the urgent question.
In addition to famine, there is also  the danger of disease, the lack of health services, and the acute danger from the lack of clean water and effective sanitation.
We are doing everything we can to head off the appalling circumstances that the right hon.
Gentleman set out.
