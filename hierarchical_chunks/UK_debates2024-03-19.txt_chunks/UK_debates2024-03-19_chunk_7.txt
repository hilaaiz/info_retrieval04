I thank the Minister for that.
Child benefit income is an integral part of how families make their money last through the whole week.
If there are any changes that will reduce it in any way, is it the Minister’s intention to ensure that those who have questions, difficulties or concerns have their concerns and wishes taken on board?
It is really important that those facing financial changes can cope with the changes to come.
