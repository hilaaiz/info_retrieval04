Does the Chancellor accept that he has caused a great deal of anxiety and further distrust among those who have been infected and affected by the contaminated   blood scandal by not making any provision in his Budget for compensation, although the recommendations for compensation were made to the Government last April?
I gently say to the right hon.
Lady that I stand by every word I said when I gave evidence, twice, to the infected blood inquiry.
The Government have an absolute moral responsibility, not just to pay the compensation owed, but to pay it as speedily as possible.
I would like to join the Economic Secretary to the Treasury and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Southend West (Anna Firth)  in discussing the closure of banks.
Barclays bank, in particular, is both shameful and shameless in this regard.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that we need full transparency on the decisions made by Link and the Financial Conduct Authority?
Something we learned yesterday that may be of interest to those in Chorley, Mr Speaker, is that the criteria take into consideration only the town plus areas within a 1 km circumference.
That is not how the rural economy works.
Will the Economic Secretary work with me to ensure that the criteria take into account the wider economy?
My right hon.
Friend is another good example of a Member who is an excellent champion for her constituents, on this issue and so many others.
As for her specific point, it is right for the industry to work out how it will increase provision and adapt the criteria for rural areas, but I will work with her to ensure that the banking hubs are rolled out in an equitable way, to rural as well as more urban areas.
