I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
First, it is important to note her consistent championing of this issue for her constituents, for which she deserves huge commendation.
To her precise question, it is important that industry, not the Government, makes decisions about bank branches or banking hubs, but she has made her case very ably.
I urge her to work with Cash Access UK and LINK to ensure that she has the best chance of securing one of those new 225 banking hubs, as outlined by the industry, in her constituency.
