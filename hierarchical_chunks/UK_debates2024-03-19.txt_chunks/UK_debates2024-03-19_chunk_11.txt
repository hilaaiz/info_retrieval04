My hon.
Friend will be well aware that Government Members are implementing measures to tackle the very problems she outlines while turning the corner in the economy and doing everything we can to put more money back in people’s pockets, whether workers or pensioners.
What assessment he has made of the potential merits of reintroducing tax-free shopping for international visitors.
As set out at the spring Budget, we are considering the findings of the Office for Budget Responsibility’s review of the original costing of the withdrawal of tax-free shopping, alongside industry representations and broader data.
The Government welcome further submissions from stakeholders in response to the OBR’s findings as we keep all taxes under review.
Last week, the OBR informed the Treasury Committee that it has not assessed the Treasury’s forecast that it would cost £900 million to extend tax-free shopping to EU visitors.
The OBR has also failed to support the Treasury’s assumption that EU visitor behaviour and costs can be extrapolated from assessed non-EU data.
The UK retail industry firmly believes that it will cost as little as £50 million to reintroduce tax-free shopping for tourists.
As we mark English Tourism Week, is it not time that we had a full, independent review of the Treasury’s data on tax-free shopping?
