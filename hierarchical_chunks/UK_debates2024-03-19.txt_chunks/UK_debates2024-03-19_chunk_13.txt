If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on living standards in the UK.
The most recent data suggest that despite a tough couple of years caused by the pandemic and the energy crisis, living standards will return to their pre-covid peak next year: a full two years earlier than originally predicted by the OBR.
They have risen by £1,700 a household in real terms since 2010, and this year’s cut in national insurance will increase living standards by 1%.
In other words, to coin a phrase, now is not the time to go back to square one.
Given that the Prime Minister has been forced to abandon his plans for an election on  2 May  and could soon be facing a leadership challenge, does the Chancellor of the Exchequer believe that his Budget landed well with the public or even his colleagues on the Government Benches?
I say very simply to the hon.
Gentleman, who used to be an hon.
Friend, that the Budget will mean that the UK economy will grow faster than that of France, Germany, Italy or Japan in the next five years.
That is doing the right thing for the country.
I would like to thank the Minister for the opportunity to meet UK Finance yesterday, which told me and other MPs that the industry plans to roll out 225 banking hubs in the next 18 months.
Given that my constituency has lost every single bank branch over the last few years, will the Minister help me to make sure that Leigh-on-Sea, which has 250 retailers, will get one of those 225 banking hubs?
