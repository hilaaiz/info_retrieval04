I thank my hon.
Friend for her comments about my colleague Lord Ahmad, the Minister for the Middle East, which I will pass on to him.
In respect of international humanitarian law, we are going through the necessary legal processes, which are complex, but I can tell her that as soon as we are in a position to update the House on what we have set out clearly before, we will do so.
