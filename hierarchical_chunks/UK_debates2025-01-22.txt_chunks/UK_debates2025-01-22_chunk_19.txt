My right hon.
and learned Friend will understand the importance of farming to the economy of my constituency of Penrith and Solway, and to Cumbria as a whole.
With recent reports of foot and mouth outbreaks in Germany, and concerns being expressed over transmission to the United Kingdom, will the Prime Minister assure the House that all Departments are on high alert and vigilant in monitoring the situation, particularly at places of entry, including airports where meat import controls can be lax?
We must avoid the disaster that this would bring to UK farming.
We will do whatever it takes to protect farmers from the risk posed by foot and mouth.
That is why we acted swiftly to ban imports of cattle, pigs and sheep and their products from Germany, to protect farmers.
We will not hesitate to restrict imports from additional countries if the disease spreads, and we will keep the situation under close and careful review.
