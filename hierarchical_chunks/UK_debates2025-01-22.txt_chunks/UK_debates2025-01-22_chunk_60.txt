I thank my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
It is very apt that he should be making this statement, because during our Defence Committee visit to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland last week, we discussed this very issue.
Clearly, there is greater need for wider availability and capacity for Royal Navy and other maritime capability to meet the rising Russian activity in waters surrounding the UK.
I refer, for example, to the threats to critical undersea infrastructure.
