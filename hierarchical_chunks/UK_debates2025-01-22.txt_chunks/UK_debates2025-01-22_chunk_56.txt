I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement.
I am particularly grateful to him for the greater level of transparency he has chosen to show to the House on the grey zone threat from Russia.
We welcome that transparency, because it is critical for our war readiness as a nation that, as far as we are able and without compromising our national and operational security,  we tell the British public the truth about the serious nature of the Russian threat and what that will inevitably mean for public expenditure on defence.
