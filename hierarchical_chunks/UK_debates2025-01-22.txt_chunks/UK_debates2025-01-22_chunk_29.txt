The Prime Minister recently visited Epsom hospital, where he committed to not just papering over the cracks in the NHS after years of Conservative lies.
However, on Monday, his Government confirmed that St Helier  hospital will be allowed to develop further wounds, and that the hospital will crumble.
St Helier will not survive the delay the Government have announced; people will die, and NHS staff will break.
Will the Prime Minister apologise to my constituents, as they wait years for a new hospital building, and will he visit St Helier with me to witness at first hand the dire situation our residents face?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to raise the concerns of his constituents; I am not surprised they are frustrated and even angry at the lack of delivery under the previous Government.
There was no credible plan—[Interruption.]
Let me read the Infrastructure and Projects Authority’s verdict on what we inherited— That was your decision!
Order.
I expect better from those on the Front Bench, Mr Philp, and I am sure you are going to show better.
He was Liz Truss’s right-hand man, so we wouldn’t expect anything else.
The IPA’s verdict on the previous Government’s plan was that there were “major issues”—[Interruption.]
This is the Conservatives’ record; they should not be chuckling.
The verdict was that there were “major issues” with the definition, schedule, budget, quality and delivery.
It was a fiction—always was.
Alongside other Greater Manchester MPs, I recently met constituents who shared distressing accounts of a spinal surgeon’s malpractice affecting many across the region.
They have formed an injured staff and patient group, but despite a review, they feel that justice has not been served, and the hospital trust is yet to conduct a full patient recall.
Will the Prime Minister arrange a meeting with the group and the relevant Minister to help them to get the justice they deserve?
