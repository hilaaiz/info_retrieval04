May I thank my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for helping to secure £14 million of levelling up funds for the area of Drumchapel in my constituency of Glasgow West?
Does he agree that given the record settlement that the Scottish Government have received from the UK Government, it is about time that they went ahead and sorted out the problems of under-provision and overcrowding in Drumchapel health centre?
My hon.
Friend has been a doughty champion for Drumchapel and was key, at the heart of this Labour Government, to getting that funding across the line.
The health service in Scotland is in crisis, which is only made clearer by the First Minister taking personal control of it.
One in six of our fellow Scots are on NHS waiting lists.
The record settlement of £4.9 billion to end austerity in Scotland needs to be spent on the frontline in places such as Drumchapel health centre.
