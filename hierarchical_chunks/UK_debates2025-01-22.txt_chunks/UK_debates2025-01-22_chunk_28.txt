Expanding London’s airports and building a third runway at Heathrow would be incredibly irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency, flying in the face of the Climate Change Committee’s advice.
The Prime Minister clearly knows that, because he and seven Cabinet colleagues voted against a third runway at Heathrow in 2018.
Will he confirm his position?
I am not going to comment on speculation.
The hon.
Gentleman knows that this Government are committed to growth, to the aviation sector and to our climate obligations.
I am not going to take lectures from those who talk about climate change, but oppose vital renewable infrastructure in their own constituencies.
In Swindon North, we have the Panattoni Park development, which is one of the largest employment developments in Europe and has massive potential for growth.
Will the Prime Minister join me in acknowledging the site for boosting economic growth in not only my region but the country, and will he visit it with me?
Growth is at the heart of our plan for change, which will fund our public services, create good jobs and raise living standards across the country.
My hon.
Friend is right to champion one of the largest brownfield sites in the UK, which could create more than 11,000 jobs on site and add £1.2 billion to the economy.
It underlines the importance of this Government bringing economic stability, creating the national wealth fund and driving up growth.
