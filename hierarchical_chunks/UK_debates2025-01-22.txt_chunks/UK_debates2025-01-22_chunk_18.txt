I thank the hon.
Member for raising an issue of huge concern in his constituency and in all constituencies.
Far too many young people are not receiving the care that they need, so we will provide access to specialist mental health professionals in every school, recruit an additional 8,500 staff to deal with children’s and adult mental health services, and roll out our Young Futures hubs in every community.
