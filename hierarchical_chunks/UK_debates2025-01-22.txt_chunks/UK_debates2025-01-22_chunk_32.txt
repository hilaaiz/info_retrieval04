I thank my hon.
Friend, because the achievements of hard-working staff at Huddersfield royal infirmary prove that we can bring down waiting times through our plans for change.
It is important that we are applying that best practice and innovation across the NHS.
We must do more.
We inherited record waiting lists and we are now bringing them down.
