I thank the shadow Defence Secretary for welcoming the statement and the Government’s greater transparency.
He, like me, has confirmed that he sees Russia as the most critical threat to the UK.
He has been a Defence Minister and he understands, as he acknowledges, the importance of sending the strongest possible signals to our adversaries.
That is the underlying reason for the decision I have taken to make this statement today.
