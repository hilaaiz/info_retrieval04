I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this case.
She and I have met far too many families who have been devastated by this senseless violence.
We are taking urgent action to ban zombie-style knives, and we are regulating the online sale of knives.
It is unacceptable  that these murder weapons can be bought with two clicks.
Technology is there to stop it and we are going to take action.
As for resources, we are putting an additional 13,000 police into neighbourhood roles and allocating £85 million to Bedfordshire Police to keep my hon.
Friend’s constituents safe.
