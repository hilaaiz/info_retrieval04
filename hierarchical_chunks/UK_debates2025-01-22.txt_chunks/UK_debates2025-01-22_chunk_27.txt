I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
Too many buildings are still unsafe, and the speed of delivery has been far too slow.
Our action plan sets out measures to identify buildings at risk and fix them faster.
My message is clear: the funding is there to fix this, and there is no excuse not to deliver for residents.
