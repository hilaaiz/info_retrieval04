May I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s remarks about the ceasefire and the release of hostages?
Let us all pray that the remaining hostages on both sides are released as soon as possible.
Since the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect, Israeli forces have placed the whole of the west bank under strict military inspection as part of the Iron Wall operation.
The Israel Defence Forces have launched a large-scale offensive operation in the city of Jenin, with numerous drone strikes on the infrastructure and a military raid by IDF troops and special forces in the occupied west bank.
At least nine people have been killed by Israeli forces and 40 have been injured, including several healthcare workers.
What urgent steps are the Government taking to protect Palestinians—including healthcare workers—and to prevent atrocities in the west bank, and will the Prime Minister outline the UK’s response to the International Court of Justice’s advisory opinion on Israel’s unlawful occupation?
I am deeply concerned by what is happening in the west bank.
We have raised it a number of times in the various exchanges that we have had, but I am deeply concerned about it, and we are doing everything we can to alleviate the situation.
Tamworth castle, which boasts 1,000 years of history, was recently added to the “Heritage at Risk” register following my campaign about its future.
Despite needing repairs, it provides a unique and valuable learning environment, welcoming both the public and schools to learn about Tamworth’s rich history.
Will the Prime Minister visit Tamworth to see how an 11th-century castle is providing 21st-century learning opportunities while promoting local heritage?
