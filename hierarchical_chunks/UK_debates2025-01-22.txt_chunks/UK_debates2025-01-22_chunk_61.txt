I have two questions for the Secretary of State.
First, what lessons have the Government learned from the Finnish investigation into Eagle S, which was accused  of damaging the undersea infrastructure between Finland and Estonia?
Secondly, what measures are available to the Government to stop vessels from traversing UK waters, to build on the recent insurance checks that were put in place in October?
Is sanctioning vessels our only option?
