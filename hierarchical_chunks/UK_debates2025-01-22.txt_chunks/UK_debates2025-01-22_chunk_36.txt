I thank my hon.
Friend for her kind invitation.
I particularly enjoyed Tamworth’s recent FA Cup heroics against Tottenham, although they did not quite win.
We are committed to protecting our most vulnerable heritage, and I know that Historic England is working closely with Tamworth borough council to preserve this local treasure for future generations.
It is particularly important to continue school visit programmes, supporting our mission to give every child the best opportunities in life.
