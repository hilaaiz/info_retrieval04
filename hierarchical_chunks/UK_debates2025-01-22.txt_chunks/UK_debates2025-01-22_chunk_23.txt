The Prime Minister needs to get out more and speak to schools.
I was at the Harris academy just this month, and what is it saying?
The Bill reverses two decades of progress.
It is imposing Labour’s new curriculum on every school, taxing the education of children with special needs and excluding talented outsiders—the closed shop is back.
This is pure educational vandalism.
Alongside those attacks, Labour is removing single-word Ofsted judgments so that parents cannot see standards slipping.
It is the same old Labour: bad outcomes for all children; excellence for none.
I know what it is like to go to a school that did not care about standards—this is a tragedy in the making.
The key changes in the Bill were not in Labour’s election manifesto.
Is that not because the Prime Minister knew that parents and teachers would reject them?
Parents and teachers know that we introduced academies.
Parents and teachers know that we are driven by standards.
We are committed to standards—they are part of the future—and we will continue to focus on them.
The Leader of the Opposition talks about special needs.
She has got a nerve; I don’t know.
Conservative Members know it: they have asked me at Prime Minister’s  questions about the appalling situation of special needs under their watch.
We are going to fix that mess like we are fixing every other mess.
Parents should feel confident that when their child is sick, they can take them to their local hospital to be treated as soon as possible.
But last year, when my son was having difficulty breathing, like many parents I could not take him to the Alexandra hospital in Redditch, as paediatric services were temporarily closed in 2016 and have never been reinstated.
As part of this Government’s record investment in our NHS, will the Prime Minister meet me to explore ways to enable local integrated care boards to reinstate critical services for growing towns like Redditch?
