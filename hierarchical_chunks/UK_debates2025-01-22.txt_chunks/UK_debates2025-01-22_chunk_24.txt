I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue, which I know he has campaigned on for a very long time.
We are investing a record £25 billion in the NHS as part of our plan for change.
Building an NHS fit for the future means that places like Redditch will see lower waiting lists and services that reflect needs.
While responsibility over service rests with the appropriate NHS commissioner, I will ensure that he gets a meeting with the relevant Minister.
