I thank the Minister for his answers.
The role of the CMA chair is essential in the current economic climate, as we watch how our allies in the USA approach their trading and their deals.
We need a message of strength; we need to relay the fact that we are ready and open for international business.
Does the Minister believe that this interim measure sends that message, and how quickly can we get the right person in place to promote our business standing?
