I agree entirely with the strategic direction that the Prime Minister has set out.
Defence and security must come first, but he does have choices about how he funds that important uplift.
In the last Parliament, he and I voted together against balancing the books on the backs of the poorest people in the world.
Does he still think that vote was right?
I am proud of that vote at the time, and proud of the work that our country has done on development.
This is not a decision that I want to make, and I absolutely want us to get back to more funding on overseas development and increasing those capabilities.
Some of that will be helped if, as we are doing, we get the asylum backlog down and stop using that money to pay for hotels, which is not what it is intended for.
This has been a difficult decision.
The right hon.
Gentleman knows how much I value overseas development and how important it is, but I thought, and think, that the most important thing today is to be clear about the commitment we are making on defence, to spell out the reasons that we are making those decisions, and to set out penny and pound exactly how it will be funded.
I would not come to the House with a plan that was not credible and not costed, because that would be far worse for our country, but I accept the tenor of what he says about the importance of the issue.
