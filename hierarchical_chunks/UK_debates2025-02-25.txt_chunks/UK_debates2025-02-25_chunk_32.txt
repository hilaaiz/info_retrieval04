This weekend marked a grim milestone: it is now three years since Putin’s invasion.
The Conservative party stands resolutely with the people of Ukraine.
Our hearts are with those still caught up in this conflict as we remember the many innocent lives lost.
I will always be proud of the support that the last Conservative Government gave in the run-up to Putin’s invasion, and in the first crucial weeks and months of the war.
We helped prevent Kyiv from falling and we supported Ukraine in regaining territory initially lost to Russia.
But it is also true that, overall, the west has not done enough to support Ukraine.
As has been the case from the outset, it ultimately remains for Ukraine, as a proud and sovereign nation that has sacrificed so much to defend itself and the fundamental freedoms that we all hold dear, to decide its future.
We want this terrible war to end, but Ukraine needs to be at the negotiating table.
Like President Zelenksy, we hope for a lasting, reliable peace, but the west must continue to be intensely robust in the face of Putin’s aggression.
The lesson of the past 20 years is clear: he only comes back for more.
The first duty of every Government is to protect their people.
That means a strong state that stands up for our national interest.
Our foreign policy should seek to support our national interest, which should always come first, so I am very pleased to hear the Prime Minister announce the increase to 2.5% by 2027.
All of us on the Conservative Benches welcome that; we have all wanted to see more spending on defence.
On the inclusion of the intelligence budget, will the Prime Minister confirm whether that means new money for the intelligence services?
Does it mean that there will be new money in the next financial year?
