I welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement.
I personally think it is a start, not a finish—I think we will find that we have to raise defence spending further—but I welcome it none the less, and on behalf of all of this House and my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North West Essex (Mrs Badenoch) , I will support it.
