In my various interactions with key stakeholders in my role as Chair of the Defence Committee, I have begun to realise that there is considerable consternation among our European allies about whether long-established and hard-earned alliances—rather than a short-term transactional approach—can still be relied on to secure lasting peace.
Also, given the proposed reduction in the American presence on our continent, people are looking for leadership.
I feel that this is our time to step forward as a nation and take the lead on defence and security matters on our continent.
Will my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister convey to President Trump and our American allies the anxieties of our European allies and the need to strengthen our transatlantic NATO alliance at this perilous time for Europe, and does he agree that he can be the person to take the lead on defence and security matters in Europe, coalescing with our NATO allies?
Order.
I say gently to the hon.
Gentleman that I know he has a lot to say, but I have a lot of Members to get in, including other party leaders.
I do agree that our alliances are important, and that is why NATO is the bedrock of our approach.
It has been for many, many years and will continue to be.
I do accept that European allies and the UK have to step up and do more.
In our heart of hearts, I think across this House we have known that this moment was coming for the last three years.
We have put that plan before the House, and of course, I will do everything I can to strengthen the alliance and the relationship between the US and the UK.
It is a special relationship.
It is a strong relationship.
I want it to go from strength to strength.
