I thank the Foreign Secretary for all that he is doing.
As in so many conflicts, the discourse about this brutal Sudanese war is being fuelled by external actors with economic and mineral interests in  Sudan, and with interests in wider geopolitical agitation, such as Russia; Egypt, with its support for the Sudanese Armed Forces; and the UAE, with its support for the Rapid Support Forces.
There is also the wider user of mercenaries.
What further steps can the Foreign Secretary take to use our leverage, not least our trading leverage, to ensure that actors are not fuelling this horrendous war and humanitarian crisis?
