I do agree with that.
As the United Kingdom we have always stood up in moments such as this, and we stand up again as the United Kingdom and are proud to do so.
This is an important moment and a juncture after three years of a conflict,  and the whole House will be aware of the potential consequences of decisions in coming weeks.
It is a time for us to pull together.
President Trump says that he wants his legacy to be that of a peacemaker.
In his difficult conversations with the President in a few days’ time, will the Prime Minister remind him that the reason the enforced division of Czechoslovakia before the war was a step on the road to disaster, but the division of Germany at the end of the war did not lead to world war three, was that the western half of Europe at the end of world war two was not demilitarised?
If there is to be a stable Ukraine after any such enforced division, there must be military protection for the unoccupied half of Ukraine.
The right hon.
Gentleman is right to talk about peace.
It is what everybody wants, not least the Ukrainians, but it must be a lasting peace and not a temporary ceasefire.
I agree that that means it needs security guarantees.
The configuration of that needs to be agreed, but the security guarantees must be sufficient to deter any further aggression.
Otherwise it will be a ceasefire, and that would be the worst of outcomes for the whole of Europe.
