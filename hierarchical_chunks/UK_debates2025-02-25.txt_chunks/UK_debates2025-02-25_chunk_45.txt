I warmly welcome the Prime Minister’s statement and this strong commitment to defence spending.
I welcome as well the work being done with the Chancellor and the Defence Secretary on ensuring that we get as much value as we can for each pound spent on delivering capability.
Will the Prime Minister reaffirm his commitment to the parliamentary scrutiny of that spending, including on the most sensitive areas?
Yes, of course; it is extremely important, and my hon.
Friend knows that well.
She is absolutely right to say that we must get value for money.
This is a huge increase in defence spending.
It is very important that it is used on the right capabilities in the right way, and that is why we intend to get a much better grip on the money that will be put in.
