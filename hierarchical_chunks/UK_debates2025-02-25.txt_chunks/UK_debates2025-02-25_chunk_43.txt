We do need to step up and lead in Europe—we have been saying that for a very long time.
All European countries need to do more, and now is the moment to do so, but we need to do that together with the US, because what is needed more than anything is a lasting peace.
A ceasefire that simply gives Putin the chance to regroup and to go again is in nobody’s interest.
A lasting peace means that we must talk about issues such as security guarantees.
We are prepared to play our part, as I have indicated, but I have also indicated that to be a security guarantee, it requires a US backstop—US support for that security guarantee.
That is at the heart of the case I have been making for some time.
As the right hon.
Gentleman knows, of the assets that have been seized already, the interest on those of £3 billion has already been committed to Ukraine, and  we are working with our European allies to see what more can be done in relation to the funding that will be necessary.
Stepping up means stepping up on capability, on co-ordination and on funding, which is what we have done today with this statement.
