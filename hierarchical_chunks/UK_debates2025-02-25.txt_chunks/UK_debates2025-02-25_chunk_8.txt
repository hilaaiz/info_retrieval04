The Minister will be aware that the Chinese have a smart city situated in Mauritius, so what safeguards are in the deal to prevent Chinese installations on Diego Garcia that could compromise our western naval security?
We are absolutely clear that we will retain full control over Diego Garcia, and will have robust provisions to keep adversaries out.
There will be unrestricted access to and use of the base for the UK and the US, a buffer zone around Diego Garcia, a comprehensive mechanism to ensure that no activity in the outer islands threatens base operations and a ban on the presence of any foreign security forces.
I absolutely assure the hon.
Gentleman that the provisions are in place to defend the security of that critical base.
