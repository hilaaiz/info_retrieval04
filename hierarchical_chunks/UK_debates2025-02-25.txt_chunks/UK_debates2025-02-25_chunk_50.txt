I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his support on the question of Ukraine, which is important.
I reassure him that the decision that I have taken today on development aid is not an ideological one.
I absolutely understand its importance—it is a difficult and painful decision, but a necessary one.
He talks about choice.
SNP Members welcomed the biggest settlement since devolution in the Budget, but they voted against it because they could not take a choice.
The right hon.
Gentleman welcomes the increase in defence spending, but he does not want to say how he will fund it.
Grown-up choices about the future of Europe require grown-up decisions and choices, and that is what we have done.
