The Prime Minister is due to go to Washington.
One problem we have there is that they seem to have reached the conclusion that peace is simply the absence of war.
Can he remind the President that a peace without justice, the right to freedom and choice in democracy is not peace, but a partial ceasefire?
He might also remind the President that the last great test we faced united the United Kingdom and America, with Lady Thatcher and Ronald Reagan taking decisions that moved Europe in the right direction.
Can he appeal to the President that, instead of running around making adverse comments, he should link hands with the United Kingdom to persuade the rest of Europe to step up, as we are now stepping up?
