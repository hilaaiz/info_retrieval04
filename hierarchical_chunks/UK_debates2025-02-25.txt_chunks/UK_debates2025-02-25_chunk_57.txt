I thank the Prime Minister for his tireless efforts to bring security to Ukraine, because its security is our security.
Does he agree that that is possible only because we are one United Kingdom, and that that strength, that solidarity, is possible only because our four nations work together?
Does he agree that those who attempt to fragment that Union in these perilous times do us great harm?
