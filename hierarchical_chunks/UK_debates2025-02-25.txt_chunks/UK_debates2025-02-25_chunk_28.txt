I thank my hon.
Friend for his praise and support for the action that the Foreign Secretary has just mentioned.
This was our largest ever sanctions package since the start of Russia’s illegal and barbarous invasion.
We and our G7 allies are absolutely clear on the principle that Russia must pay for the damage that it is causing to Ukraine, and we of course look at third country routes by which support is being given to Russia’s illegal actions in Ukraine.
As part of the package announced yesterday we are taking a number of steps in that regard, including with companies in China.
