We are pleased to hear the announcement that the Government will increase defence spending to 2.5%, but we are still waiting for the strategic defence review to be completed, as without that we are in the dark.
Will the SDR be announced soon, and if not, will the Prime Minister outline how the additional money will be spent?
The SDR is advanced and I will come to the House with it as soon as we can.
I want to make sure that we have properly identified the challenges and capabilities.
Obviously, we have put the funding forward today.
We will do that as soon as we can, and when we do, it will be a credible plan for the House.
