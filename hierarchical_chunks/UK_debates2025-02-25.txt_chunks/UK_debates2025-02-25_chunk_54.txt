I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and for the leadership that he has shown in these uncertain times.
As the Member of Parliament for the home of the British Army, I know that this is hugely welcome news for my constituency and that my community is ready to serve.
What will the Prime Minister do to help to create jobs in the defence sector in my community?
