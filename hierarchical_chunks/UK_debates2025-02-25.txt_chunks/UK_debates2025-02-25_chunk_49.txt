I warmly welcome the Prime Minister’s statement, and particularly his commitment to accelerate the increase in defence spending, although I fear that we may have to visit the 3% target before the next Parliament.
It is very important that we have a whole-society approach to defence.
Will he be bringing forward a strategy to make that happen, particularly around the great need to improve our reservist forces?
It does have to be a whole-society response, which is why I set that out in my statement in the House, and I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for raising it.
Of course it has to be a driver of industrial growth and our industrial strategy.
Aside from a few of Putin’s poodles, who are not in their seats in the Chamber today, we are of course united in our support for the people of Ukraine, and in wishing the Prime Minister well in his discussions with the President of the United States later this week.
But I am afraid that is where the unity ends, because while we support increasing defence spending, we cannot support the populist playbook of cutting foreign aid.
Indeed, that position was shared and agreed with by the Foreign Secretary just a matter of days ago, when he said that it would be a “big strategic mistake” that would allow China to step in.
Why was the Foreign Secretary wrong, and the Prime Minister right?
