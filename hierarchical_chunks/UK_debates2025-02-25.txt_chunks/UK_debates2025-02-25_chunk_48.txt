I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his support.
The point he makes about a lasting peace and what it must be is really important.
This is not just about stopping the fighting; it is about an enduring and lasting peace for Europe and, of course, the sovereignty of Ukraine—the sovereign ability to choose the alliances that Ukrainian people want, to choose their own Government and to choose how they defend themselves in conjunction with others.
It is about the sovereignty of Ukraine, but it is also about the values and freedoms across Europe, including our values and freedoms.
That is why this is such an important moment to ensure that NATO is as strong as it has been in the last 75 years as we go forward, and that the bond between us and the US is as strong as it has ever been.
That has to be part of the case—the argument—and the way in which we have stepped up today and will continue to do so.
