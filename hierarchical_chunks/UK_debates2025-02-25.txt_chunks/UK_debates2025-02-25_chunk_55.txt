I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Given the make-up of her constituency and constituents, they are hardwired for this.
This is an important obligation that we must rise to, but it is also an opportunity to ensure that the jobs that will be generated are British jobs, with British skills, in all our constituencies.
We will endeavour to ensure that that is the case.
