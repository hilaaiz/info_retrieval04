My thoughts continue to be with the hostages held in Gaza and the appalling suffering they and their families are facing.
The world has seen the brutality inflicted by the Iranian-sponsored terrorists, Hamas, who are a major obstacle to bringing about a sustainable and just peace in the middle east.
The Foreign Secretary has previously agreed that there cannot be any future whatsoever for Hamas controlling Gaza.
Can he provide an update on the actions he has undertaken to put an end to Hamas control and ensure we get to the third phase of the ceasefire?
Will he discuss this issue when he goes to America with the Prime Minister to meet the President of the United States?
I can confirm that I discussed this issue with Ron Dermer from the Israeli Government last week.
I discussed this issue with Arab leaders—the so-called Quint—the week before.
In the end, we cannot have a Gaza run by Hamas.
All roads lead back to Hamas.
I think the world has looked with horror at the scenes of armed men wearing bandanas, seeming to glorify murder and hostages who have been held.
Of course, we will act with international colleagues to make sure that Hamas have no role to play in the future of Gaza.
What progress his Department has made on tackling HIV and AIDS globally.
Investments in the Global Fund, Unitaid, UNAIDS—the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS—the World Health Organisation and others have helped to cut new HIV infections by 60% since 1995 and AIDS-related deaths by 69% since 2004.
I was pleased to meet HIV-positive activists in Parliament recently and to be videoed while undertaking a quick and easy HIV test.
Together, we can eradicate HIV/AIDS.
