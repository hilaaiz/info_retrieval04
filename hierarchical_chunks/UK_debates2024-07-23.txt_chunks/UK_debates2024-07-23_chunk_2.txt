I thank  the hon.
Member for Leicester South (Shockat Adam) ; I am sure many of us will find him a very hard act to follow.
I congratulate all the hon.
Members who have made their opening contributions to this Chamber.
I have listened intently and been impressed by their passionate delivery and the personal content they have shared.
