The Secretary of State and the Minister should know that I have campaigned for years to close the dangerous level crossing in Pencoed in my constituency.
No levelling-up funding or transport bid funding has been approved for any of the applications.
Will the Minister please talk to Department for Transport officials to resolve this, rather than allowing DFT officials to keep announcing more and more rail services, which means closing the crossing more by stealth?
That is not acceptable to my constituents.
I worked well with the hon.
Gentleman when I was in the Government Whips Offices and I very much look forward to doing so again.
I will write to him to offer a meeting about that.
Before we proceed to Prime Minister’s questions, many colleagues have asked me to pass on their best wishes to Mr Speaker in his absence.
I am happy to inform the House that, although Mr Speaker has tested positive for covid and therefore cannot be present in the Chamber, he is rapidly getting better.
Just as soon as that little test shows negative, he will be straight back here in his Chair.
