Is the Prime Minister worried that he is projected to be the first Conservative party leader to lose a general election to a fellow Thatcherite?
[Interruption.]
Order.
We really must hear the Prime Minister, and we have a lot of questions to get through.
[Interruption.]
It is not the Prime Minister’s opponents who are giving him trouble.
I say to the hon.
Gentleman that Margaret Thatcher’s view was to cut inflation, then cut taxes and then win an election, and that is very much my plan.
Of course, it is not just in relation to Margaret Thatcher that the Tory and Labour leaders appear to agree; the same is true of the Government’s latest migration policies.
Those of us on these Benches  are not afraid to say that we believe migration is a good thing.
It enriches our communities, it enriches our economy, and it enriches our universities, our schools, our health service and, of course, our care sector.
Why does the Prime Minister think it is acceptable to ask people to come to these shores to care for our family members, while we show complete disregard for theirs?
What has become of this place?
That is completely wrong.
As we have already said, we have a proud track record of welcoming those who are most vulnerable around the world—over half a million over the past few years from Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Hong Kong and elsewhere—and that is what this country will always do.
But at the same time, when it comes to economic migration and other forms, it is absolutely right that we take strong action to curb the levels that we have seen, because they are simply far too high and place unsustainable pressure on our public services.
I make no apology for saying that or, indeed, for saying that it is important that those who come here contribute to our public services.
