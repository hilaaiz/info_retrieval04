“honest, act with integrity and...not compromise or abuse their position”, and “Police officers have a responsibility to give appropriate cooperation during investigations, inquiries and formal proceedings, participating openly and professionally in line with the expectations of a police officer when identified as a witness.”
Those standards are in the regulations.
Their breach would provide a powerful case, as the hon.
Gentleman may think, for dismissal or other suitable sanction.
On the hon.
Gentleman’s point about retrospectivity, plainly, if evidence comes to light about behaviour at the time, it can be considered in the normal way.
I hope that he will be encouraged by knowing that the offence of misconduct in a public office is being considered by the Law Commission, with its usual and typical diligence, and we will respond in the new year.
It is reasonable to observe that it has not operated as we might have liked, and is susceptible to reform.
We are giving that very active attention.
On the media and irresponsible coverage, my goodness, the hon.
Gentleman has a point.
I think that there still needs to be a live conversation about whether things have gone far enough.
The delay in the report has been unacceptable, but it is absolutely no fault of my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor.
I thank him for his statement, for its tone, which was characteristically generous-spirited, and for the work that he has done to expedite it.
