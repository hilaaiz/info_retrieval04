I welcome the hon.
Lady to her role and thank her for her tribute to Baroness Kinnock and to Allan Rogers.
Glenys Kinnock was an inspiration to our Labour movement, to her many friends and colleagues around the world, but most of all to her family.
As the Kinnock family grieve, we send them our love and deepest sympathy.
