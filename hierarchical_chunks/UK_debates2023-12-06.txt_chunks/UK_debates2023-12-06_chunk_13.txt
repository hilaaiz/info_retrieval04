Thank you for your generosity, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I, too, pay tribute to my very good friends in the Kinnock family after the loss of Glenys, who was a dear friend to all of us, and note the sad death of the former Member for Rhondda.
I ask the Secretary of State— Order.
Let the Minister respond to the question.
The UK Government are committed to building a strong rail infrastructure network across Wales, which will improve connectivity and drive economic growth.
My constituents want the parkway station to be built at St Mellons.
That will require important work on the south Wales main line for relief lines.
Will the Minister meet me and colleagues, with the rail Minister—the Minister of State, Department for Transport,  the hon.
Member for Bexhill and Battle (Huw Merriman) —to ensure that this important national investment is made, so that the station can go ahead?
I will be delighted to meet the hon.
Gentleman to discuss that and the investment that the UK Government are already putting into rail infrastructure in Wales.
