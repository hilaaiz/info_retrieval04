I welcome you to your place, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I know that the whole House wishes Mr Speaker a speedy recovery.
Before I answer my hon.
Friend’s question, I also know that the whole House will want to join me in offering our condolences to the family and friends of Alistair Darling, Glenys Kinnock and Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.
They each made an enormous contribution to public life and will be deeply missed.
