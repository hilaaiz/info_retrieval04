I thank the hon.
Lady for her question and I shall ensure her suggestion is heard by the Secretary of State.
She will know about the financial support that we have given households, as well as recent measures in the autumn statement, that mean over £100 billion in support has been provided.
On average, low- income households have received £2,500 a year to enable them to cope with higher energy bills.
Through her auspices, her constituents could make use of a number of insulation schemes, including those in the private and public sectors.
I will ask the Department to ensure she is aware of all those schemes.
