This weekend marks small business Saturday, and I look forward to visiting our wonderful Christmas market in Bath, which brings in £50 million for the local area.
Anyone who has not been to Bath at Christmas should please come.
It is absolutely magical.
I am pleased that footfall in Bath is above pre-pandemic levels.
However, many UK businesses are struggling to recover.
This year has seen the most company insolvencies since 2009, and the autumn statement offered no energy support for businesses.
Can we have a ministerial statement on what the Government will do to stop businesses closing this winter?
