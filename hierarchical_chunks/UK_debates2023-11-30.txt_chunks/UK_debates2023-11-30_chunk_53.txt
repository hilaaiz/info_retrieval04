As we continue to celebrate Disability History Month, may I raise again the lack of any disabled lift at Chalkwell station in my constituency?
It is an absolute disgrace.
It is the main station giving access to our beaches, and with 40 steep steps it is completely inaccessible to anyone with a disability or with a pushchair.
I have raised this matter in the House five times now.
This year I have been promised twice that it will be sorted out.
Given that rail companies have a duty under the Equality Act 2010, itself a consolidating Act, to make reasonable adjustments, please may we have a debate in Government time on when the provisions will be enforced in a timely manner?
