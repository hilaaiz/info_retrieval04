I thank my hon.
Friend for his question and his work in this area, in which he has great expertise.

Friend  the Member for Cheadle (Mary Robinson)  yesterday to discuss this very matter.
She has set out some key proposals in this area.
We are currently undertaking a review of whistleblowing, and we hope to report to the House very shortly.
