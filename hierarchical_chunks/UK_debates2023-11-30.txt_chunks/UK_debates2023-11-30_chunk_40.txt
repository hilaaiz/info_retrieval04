I thank my hon.
Friend for all he is doing in the wake of these tragic incidents.
I will make sure the Home Secretary has heard his concerns about the action that his local police may or may not be taking.
This kind of antisocial behaviour causes misery for many people, which is why, through our antisocial behaviour action plan, we have committed £160 million to help local authorities make high streets, footpaths and so on much safer for their communities.
The police have powers to deal with these situations, and we expect them to be used.
