I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s approval of that Bill.
He will know that we are still committed to the other measures that were in our manifesto.
We will just be doing them in other ways, such as fulfilling our commitment on primates through secondary legislation.
He will not be surprised to hear me say that further business will be announced in the usual way, but it is good to know that he will be supporting the Government on these measures.
