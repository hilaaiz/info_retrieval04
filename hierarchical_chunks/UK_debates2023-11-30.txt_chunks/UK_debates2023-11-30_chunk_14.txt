I welcome the Minister back to the Department for Business and Trade, and I look forward to helping him hopefully to do better this time around.
According to the International Monetary Fund, over the past decade British food and drink exports, including from SMEs, rose by just 3%, which was the lowest growth of any G7 country.
The US, Canada, Italy and Japan all saw their exports grow by between 30% and 95%.
Government Ministers will not negotiate a veterinary agreement with the EU, which would help, they have cut funding for trade missions, and now the Secretary of State has cut funding to go to trade shows too.
Why will Ministers not share our ambitions for Britain to have the fastest export growth rate of any G7 country?
