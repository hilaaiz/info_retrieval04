I am excited by the prospect of the deal with the Gulf Cooperation Council, with which the Secretary of State is very much engaged, and I am looking forward to being re-engaged with it.
It is a huge opportunity for us, as the latest figures show that total trade between the UK and the Gulf is worth more than £60 billion.
We are looking forward to moving the negotiation forward and getting a very good deal for the UK.
