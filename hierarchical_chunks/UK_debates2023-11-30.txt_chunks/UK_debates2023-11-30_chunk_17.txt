I disagree.
The Competition and Markets Authority is not only the dog that does not bark, but the dog that does not bite.
We see multinational corporations and investment funds of such a size that they have more power than a sovereign Government.
When will the Government give the CMA the powers and authority needed to tackle the corporate monopolies and cartels that have so much sway over our lives?
The hon.
Member raises an important matter.
That is why the Government are legislating in this space, through the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill, which gives the CMA huge new powers, particularly over some of our largest online platforms—platforms that have what we describe as strategic market status.
This is world-leading legislation that will tackle many of the examples of detriment that he will be aware of and that he raises in his question today.
What steps she is taking to maintain access to high street postal services.
The Government protect the post office branch network by setting access criteria and minimum service levels to be provided by branches across the country.
More post offices have opened this year than have closed.
The network is as large today as it has been for five years, with around 11,700 branches open, above the 11,500 target that we set for the Post Office.
