I thank my hon.
Friend for his warm welcome for the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Bill.
I will certainly ensure that the Home Secretary is aware of his concerns with regard to that police force.
He will know that the next Foreign Office questions are on  12 December , but I will certainly ensure that both the Foreign Secretary and his lead Minister in the Commons are aware of his concerns about that terrible attack.
