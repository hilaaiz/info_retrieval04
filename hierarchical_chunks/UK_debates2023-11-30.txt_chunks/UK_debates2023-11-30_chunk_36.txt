I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his early question this week.
I think that would be an excellent topic for a Backbench Business debate.
Many Members were agreeing with him as he outlined the issues.
I know that one of the problems is that the guiding community does not feel that it was properly consulted in advance of the decision being taken, and I know that many right hon.
and hon.
Members have written to the board to question it.
I think an airing on the Floor of the House or in Westminster Hall would be welcomed.
