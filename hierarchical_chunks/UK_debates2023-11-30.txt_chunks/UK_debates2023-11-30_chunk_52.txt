I thank the hon.
Gentleman and all hon.
Members who joined that march or showed solidarity to the Jewish community on that day.
We must all continue to do that when the headlines disappear when the situation is resolved, as I hope it will be soon.
I met with the Jewish Leadership Council yesterday to look at what more we can do.
As well as showing support to the Jewish community, we need to show support to other faith communities who want to do the right thing, stand in solidarity together, and continue to work at strengthening ties.
We must support individuals who reach out to other faith groups in their communities, and ensure that they do not face intimidation.
