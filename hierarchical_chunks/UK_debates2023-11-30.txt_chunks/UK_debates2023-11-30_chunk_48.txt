I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important point on a subject close to her heart.
She will know that since we left the EU there have been good opportunities for our fishing communities.
In one instance, a fishing port not far away from her has seen its annual sales go from £40 million to £70 million.
This should be a success story and, of course, what benefits the fishing community benefits hospitality, leisure, retail and many other things.
She will know that there will be an opportunity to raise this matter with the Secretary of State on  7 December  and I urge her to do so.
