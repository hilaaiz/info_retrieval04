I thank the hon.
Lady for the advert for small business Saturday; I am sure that all Members of this House will be involved in it, celebrating the incredible entrepreneurial organisations and individuals in their constituencies.
A number of measures were set out in the autumn statement to help our high streets and, in particular, the hospitality, retail and leisure sectors.
We recognise that they are the backbone of this economy and they are often the focal point for many other services and social interactions in our communities.
They should be treasured and I hope that everyone does that this Saturday.
