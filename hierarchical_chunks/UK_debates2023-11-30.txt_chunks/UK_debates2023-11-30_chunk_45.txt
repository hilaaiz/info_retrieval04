The Government Chief Whip is a Minister but, by convention, does not make statements from the Dispatch Box.
So will the Leader of the House please give confirmation on accusations made by the GB News presenter who also has a side hustle as the hon.
Member for Ashfield about being effectively offered a bribe in his role as a Member of Parliament?
I know this was reported to the Government Chief Whip, but have they reported that allegation to the police for proper investigation?
