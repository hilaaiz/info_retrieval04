I welcome my right hon.
Friend back to his post.
I pay tribute to him and to the Secretary of State for the international trade deals that they have struck during their period in office.
The UK has strategic relationships with a number of Gulf nations.
What progress is being made on a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council?
If it is more challenging to strike a deal across all nations, what bilateral trade agreements can we explore in order to exploit the opportunity for those nations to invest significantly in the UK?
