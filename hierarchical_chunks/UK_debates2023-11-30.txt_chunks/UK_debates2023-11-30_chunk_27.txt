I thank my hon.
Friend for all her work to champion that brilliant local community initiative.
We expect to be able to inform applicants to the third round of the community ownership fund by the end of December.
She will know that Levelling Up, Housing and Communities questions are on Monday, where she may wish to make the case again.
