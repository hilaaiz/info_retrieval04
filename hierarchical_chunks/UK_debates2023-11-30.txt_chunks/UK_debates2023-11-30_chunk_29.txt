I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the Backbench Business debates for  Thursday 7 December .
Let me give her early notice that if we are awarded time on  Thursday 14 December ,  the Committee will intend to schedule debates on knife crime and the potential merger of Vodafone and Three.
Is the Leader of the House considering giving the Backbench Business Committee any time in the week beginning  Monday 18 December ?
If she is, we would love to know as soon as possible so that we can allocate debates and let Members know.
I am glad to say that the Committee was re-established this week and is up and running, but we already have a backlog of debates, with 13 on our waiting list.
It is good that we have plenty of business to come.
