The Secretary of State was asked— What assessment she has made of the potential impact of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership on small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK.
The CPTPP is one of the major benefits of Brexit.
It has the potential to deliver billions of pounds to our economy and benefits small businesses across the UK.
The deal delivers lower tariffs, reduced red tape, and cutting-edge digital provisions that directly support small businesses to trade more.
It has an SME chapter committing all countries to make the agreement accessible for SMEs.
I know that will be welcome news for my hon.
Friend ahead of Small Business Saturday.
