Hello from the year 2023!
My name is Jake Ellzey, and I currently serve as the Congressman for Corsicana for the 118th Congress.
I am honored to represent this great city and to help celebrate the 175th birthday.
Corsicana was founded in 1848, and in the 175 years since its founding, so much has changed, but the one thing that has always remained is the good people who call this town their home.
Now, I can't tell you much about what happened in Corsicana in 1848, but I can give you a little insight into what it looks like today in 2023.
Corsicana is a small town in Navarro County with 26,000 folks and a beautiful courthouse right in the middle.
It's home to great restaurants like The Across the Street Diner and Old Mexican Inn.
The community has thriving businesses, like Collins Street Bakery, Oil City Iron Works, and Gilfillan's Hardware.
The people here are proud to support the Corsicana Tigers and the Navarro College Bulldogs.
In 2023, life is pretty good in Corsicana and Navarro County.
It's a community that works together.
It's a community that worships together.
It's a community that prays together.
I am sure much has probably happened since 2023 for y'all, but I know one thing that hasn't changed is our pride for the state of Texas and the great town.
The community of Corsicana has always been strong, and I have no doubt that that has held true through the years.
As y'all celebrate this day, reflect on the strength of this city and our Nation.
I don't know what is happening in the country, but I know there is nothing our nation and the people of Texas cannot handle.
I am proud to be the 
Representative for Corsicana in 2023, and I send well wishes to all of the Corsicana residents past, present, and future.
God Bless Corsicana and God Bless the United States.
