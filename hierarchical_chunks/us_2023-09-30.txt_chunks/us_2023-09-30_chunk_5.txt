Mr. SMITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Coach Marty Hauck, of Rolla High School in Missouri, on being awarded the 2023 USA Wresting Greco-Roman Developmental Coach of the Year Award.
As coach of both men's and women's Rolla High School wrestling teams.
His successes extend beyond the high school level as he's been named world championship coach three times by Team USA and remains the coach of the USA U-17 world championship team.
Coach Hauck continues to have remarkable success with Rolla High School's wrestling team.
The school boasts 48 state qualifiers, 29 state placers.
and 4 champions under his leadership.
This impressive record is a testament to Coach Hauck's talent, passion, and commitment to inspiring each one of his student-athletes to reach their full potential.
Leadership is not just something you do but is a defining characteristic in people.
I take great pride in recognizing Coach Hauck's exceptional contributions to the sport of wrestling.
both within the community of Rolla and on the world stage.
His achievements serve as an inspiration to aspiring athletes and coaches alike of what it means to be a leader.
On behalf of the entire Eighth Congressional District, we thank Coach Hauck for his dedicated service.
