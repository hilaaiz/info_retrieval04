I feel as if I am almost taking my life in my hands, but I do want to commend the Minister for one small piece of good news in this round, which is in relation to the development of marine renewables.
The success of the auction for tidal stream development illustrates what would be possible for wave power if it were to be given the same opportunity in AR6.
But for tidal stream, does the Minister agree that what is now needed is the 1 GW target for deployment?
Will he work with me and other people in the House with an interest in this and the marine renewables sector itself to deliver that ahead of AR6?
May I pay tribute to the right hon.
Gentleman?
I met him in his constituency when I visited the European Marine Energy Centre and saw for myself some of the projects in the water.
I am personally determined to ensure that tidal stream continues to grow.
We maintain our global leadership, with a very high percentage UK supply chain as a further positive to it.
He tempts me to get ahead of myself on policy, but I cannot do that.
However, what we are doing and what our dedicated pot this year did is further strengthen that so that we can get in a position where that might be a realistic policy position to take.
Even with a higher price, offshore wind would help to slash bills.
When the Minister saw the Irish Government recognise inflation, up the price and proceed to a successful auction, what discussions did he have with the industry and with Treasury colleagues about the price to be set?
