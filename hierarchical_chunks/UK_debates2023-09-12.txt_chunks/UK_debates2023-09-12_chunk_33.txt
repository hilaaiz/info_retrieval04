I thank my hon.
Friend, who has been such a consistent champion not only for the power of renewables to meet our environmental challenges but for the economic benefits that come from them.
He is absolutely right that the nature of the CfD system is that it learns from the previous auction round, which is the most real data of all, and uses that learning to inform the next round.
That is why I am confident that, just as we had a success with 3.7 GW on Friday, AR6 promises to be more successful still.
