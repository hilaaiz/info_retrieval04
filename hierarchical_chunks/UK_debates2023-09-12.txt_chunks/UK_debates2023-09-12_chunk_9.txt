The Minister’s answer is very interesting because, let’s face it, our prisons have been run down for 13 years.
Many are so old that they were built before RAAC—reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete—was even a twinkle in somebody’s bank account.
If we read the inspection reports, as I have, it is a list of woes.
They are draughty, damp, infested, terribly overcrowded and woefully understaffed—hardly likely to enable rehabilitation.
It is our communities that endure the consequences, with at least 37% of prison leavers reoffending within 18 months.
It is simply not good enough, is it?
We continue to upgrade the prison estate.
As I say, we are investing in 20,000 new places—the biggest expansion in the secure estate since the Victorian era.
At the same time, we have been taking out some of our most overcrowded and unsuitable prisons.
In the last financial year, we took out 1,900 places, and we are investing £168 million in custodial maintenance for 2023-24 and 2024-25.
The hon.
Lady mentioned reoffending.
There is no good level of reoffending but zero, but I am pleased to be able to report good progress on reoffending, which has been coming down as a result of more ex-offenders getting into employment, fewer of them being homeless and more being able to get suitable, good treatment for addiction.
