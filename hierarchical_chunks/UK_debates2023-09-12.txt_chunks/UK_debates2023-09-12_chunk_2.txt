The Secretary of State was asked— What recent assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the probation service.
Probation professionals perform a critical and invaluable role for our society.
We are injecting an additional £155 million a year to recruit more staff, reduce case loads and continue to deliver better community supervision of offenders.
We are seeing improvements in performance as that investment beds in, but there is more to do and I continue to monitor things closely.
