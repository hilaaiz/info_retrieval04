I thank the Minister for his engagement with this process, particularly with the new technology of floating offshore wind.
Three floating offshore wind projects were due to bid in allocation round 5 but none did, due to the low administrative strike price.
As chair of the all-party parliamentary group for the Celtic sea, I have repeatedly been told that these projects are part of our future energy supply.
Can he outline what steps he is taking to ensure that these projects will float in allocation round 6 and to give confidence to developers in the region?
