In light of the disappointing results of the CfD AR5 auction and given that I am always trying to be constructive in my contributions in this House, will Government revisit the exclusion of Northern Ireland renewable projects from the scheme, especially in light of the significant increase in onshore wind and tidal stream projects supported by the AR5?
Northern Ireland is perfectly positioned for onshore wind and tidal stream to make a major contribution to energy security and net zero from AR6 and beyond.
Will the Minister commit to enable Northern Ireland to be part of AR6?
I suggest that it is the hon.
Gentleman and his colleagues who need to commit to facilitating that in Northern Ireland.
Energy is devolved and it is up  to them to get the devolved Assembly up and running.
If they get devolved government going in Northern Ireland, they will unleash these opportunities.
It is not for this Department, which is not responsible for energy in Northern Ireland.
That completes the urgent question.
On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
St Leonard’s in my constituency is one of the schools affected by reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.
Last week, we received a ministerial statement from the Secretary of State for Education, but, this week, despite RAAC still being an issue, we have heard nothing from the Secretary of State or a Minister.
The issue may be yesterday’s news to some, but it is a very real issue for my constituents, many of whom have written to me to express their anger and anxiety about this avoidable crisis.
May I please seek your guidance, Mr Speaker, as to how we can implore the Secretary of State to come back to the House this week—preferably tomorrow when it is well attended— and update us on what her Department is doing?
