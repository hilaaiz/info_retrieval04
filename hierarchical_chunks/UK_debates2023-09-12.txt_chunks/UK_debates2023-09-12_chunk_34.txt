I congratulate the Minister on turning complacency and chutzpah into a new art form.
The ineptitude of Tory Ministers means that this latest CfD round saw the smallest auction return since 2015—a failing that was entirely avoidable.
How will he ensure that the UK delivers the 35 GW of new offshore wind capacity that is needed in just six years?
Why did Ministers yet again fail to heed the warnings from industry and experts in advance?
We have to set the parameters based on the best information we have.
As I say, one reason for moving to an annual round is to allow us quickly to learn the lessons of each round.
We did not get the wind on this occasion, which I regret, and we will put the real-world prices and learnings from that into the next round.
That is the system we have, because we are always trying to make sure that we get the parameters right so that we balance the need to generate additional green energy with the cost to the taxpayer.
Understandably, given their carelessness with the public finances and with consumers, the Opposition do not seem to care about that.
My job is to balance it, ensuring that we get the generation, and we have 77 GW in the pipeline.
We are in position and on track to meet our ambitions, which lead Europe—not that we would know that to listen to the hon.
Lady.
