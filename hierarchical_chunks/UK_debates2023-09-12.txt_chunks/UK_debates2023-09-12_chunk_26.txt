I thank my hon.
Friend, who is an absolute champion of floating wind and the economic opportunities it offers for her area and the rest of the  UK.
I was delighted to speak to her last week and meet her yesterday, and I pay tribute to her efforts.
We have the largest floating wind pipeline in the world, based on confirmed seabed exclusivity arrangements.
We have around 25 GW already identified, including through the ScotWind leasing round and innovation and targeted oil and gas—INTOG—processes.
As she, as a great champion, knows, the Crown Estate is moving forward with its leasing round 5 for up to 4 GW of capacity in the Celtic sea this year.
We have been the world leader on floating energy and we are going to stay the world leader.
Thanks to the efforts of my hon.
Friend, I know that we will have support across the House.
