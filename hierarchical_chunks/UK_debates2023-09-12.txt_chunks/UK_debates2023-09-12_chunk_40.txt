I saw in the newspapers yesterday that astronomers have discovered a water-covered planet in a far away galaxy.
I have to disappoint these excited scientists that, from his answers today, the Minister appears to have got there before them.
[Interruption.]
On another planet, yes.
Seriously though, this setback to the Erebus project in south-west Wales is deeply disappointing.
It was the first of its kind in Wales and was supposed to pave the way to a developing industry.
I hope the Minister can reassure me that he is taking steps to make sure that, in AR6, projects such as Erebus are enabled to compete successfully and to lead the way for this industry in Wales.
