I thank the Minister for including geothermal projects in allocation round 5, as that is very welcome.
However, I echo everything my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Devon (Selaine Saxby)  says about the Celtic sea projects.
What will we do differently in round 6?
What advice would he give to those in the supply chains, specifically ports, that are trying to submit applications for the FLOWMIS—floating offshore wind manufacturing investment scheme—funding?
What conversations has he had about grid capacity, to ensure that all of this eventually runs smoothly?
