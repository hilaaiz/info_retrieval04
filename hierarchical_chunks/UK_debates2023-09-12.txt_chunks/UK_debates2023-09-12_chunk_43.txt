I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, which is a good one.
Obviously, we did look at whether intervention, given that prices continue to change after they are set, was the right thing to do.
We think that the CfD mechanism—the way that it is operated—is sound and that the best thing to do is to allow that to pass for the year.
One reason for having the annual auction was  precisely to allow us quickly to adjust, and, as I say, as soon as November, we will be setting the parameters for the next year.
