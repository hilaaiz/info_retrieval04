Last November, the Government paid up to £700 million to China General Nuclear Corporation to buy out China’s state-owned nuclear power enterprise from Sizewell C, and we spent the best part of 2022 freeing ourselves from our reliance on Russian oil and gas.
Given the failure of this Government to sell offshore wind projects in the latest round, can the Minister please comment on how energy independence from authoritarian states was served by this inability to run an auction?
We are now running these auctions every year, and every year, we will be seeking to get the generation that we require at the lowest possible cost to the consumer.
I make no apology for doing that.
The fact that we have the most successful system, not only in Europe, but globally, is something that should be applauded and recognised.
The Windsor report last month provides a sobering analysis about the scale of new electricity transmission infrastructure required to serve increased renewable generation and consumer demand in a very short space of time.
However, as the report finds, there is considerable resistance locally to pylon development, as we are finding out in my constituency.
Competence for such development is with the Welsh Government, but will the Minister pull together a working group of Ministers from across the UK and experts to consider the Windsor report, and in particular the advantages of cable ploughing technology, which would underground those cables at a comparable cost to overhead pylons without the visual damage?
