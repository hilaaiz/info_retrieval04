I thank the Minister very much for that response.
It has been reported that the proportion of Northern Ireland’s total jail population who hail from outside the United Kingdom and Ireland is disproportionately high—the figures indicate that it is between 7% and 9% per year.
Has the Minister had an opportunity to assess that with the Department of Justice back home?
