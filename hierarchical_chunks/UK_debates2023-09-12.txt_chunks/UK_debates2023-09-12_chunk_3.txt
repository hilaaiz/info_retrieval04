I thank the Minister for that answer, but he will know that Napo, GMB and Unison all say that the probation service is facing soaring workloads.
Employees are battling under the pressure and sickness rates are high.
With many workers off sick, the impact on public safety will be massive.
Something must be done.
Stepping outside the politics of this, will he commit to working constructively with unions and other agencies to bring about a strategy that will address this critical area of probation?
