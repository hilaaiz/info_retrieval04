Mr. DAVIS.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I wish to pay my deepest respects to Dr. Iris Shannon--a nurse, educator and administrator.
I met and got to know Iris Shannon in the late 1960s when I began to work in healthcare, first at the Dr. Martin King Health Center, the Westside Health Planning Organization and Mile Square Health Center.
I knew Iris as a competent, involved nurse, as Director of Nursing at Mile Square, as Director of Nursing at Rush Medical Center and as a Nursing Professor at Rush Medical School.
The late 1960s and early 1970s were very serious health interest years and health activity due to the civil rights activity, changes in health law and the leadership levels of government and Iris was what I call an activist.
There were meetings about health all over the place and practically all of the time.
Iris was often present at many of these meetings, sharing her knowledge, her expertise and her wisdom.
Iris worked with nurse groups, administrative groups, community groups, women
