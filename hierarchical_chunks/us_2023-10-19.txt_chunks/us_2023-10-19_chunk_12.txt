great-nieces, and great-nephews; and, his many friends, some of whom David considered like family.
I pray for all of his loved ones during this difficult time.
David was a good Republican and a good Christian.
He loved his family and friends deeply and lived his last days to the fullest, despite his diagnosis.
I, and many others, will greatly miss him.
