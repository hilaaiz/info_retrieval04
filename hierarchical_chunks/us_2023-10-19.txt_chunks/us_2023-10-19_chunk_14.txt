Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, St. Louis and I rise to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church in Missouri's First District.
The Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church has been a spiritual beacon in the St. Louis community.
Under the leadership of Reverend Reginald D. Rogers, Sr., the church has provided meals for those in need and organized health fairs for residents in the surrounding neighborhoods.
The church has also been an avid supporter of Annie Malone Children and Family Services.
I am thankful for their work and commitment to community service, including partnering with Beyond Me Outreach, which sits under the North City Community Development Corporation.
I wish the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church success in their future endeavors, including their goal of constructing an educational facility to promote literacy among youth in the First District.
St. Louis honors the Lite of Jericho Missionary Baptist Church on a blessed 90 years of service and worship.
