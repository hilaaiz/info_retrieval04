groups, black power group and the list goes on.
If it was about health and health care needs, Iris was there.
Iris was an organizer, a joiner, a promoter, a practitioner, a scholar, a teacher, a mentor and a role model, not loud, but a leader who became President of the American Public Health Association.
Iris made her mark during what I call ``movement time'', a period when Black Americans were greatly moving out of the shadows of society.
As I mentioned earlier, Dr. Shannon was not loud, but she was proud and as black as the ace of spades, if you know what I mean.
Iris possessed Black pride, expressed Black principles, stood up for Black people and exuded Black excellence.
Iris was a caring and wonderful nurse, a great scholar, teacher and administrator, a visionary leader and an amazing friend.
I am so glad to have known and worked with her.
Dr. Iris Shannon was a role model to so many and will be missed by the multitudes, but her legacy of service shall endure.
