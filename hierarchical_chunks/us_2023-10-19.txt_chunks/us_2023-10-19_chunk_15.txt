Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I'm honored to recognize Living Spring Harrisburg Church, a parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, as it celebrates 20 years of Christian ministry on November 4, 2023.
The Living Spring congregation was founded on November 2, 2003, under the distinguished leadership of Senior Pastor Tunde Oyelowo and his wife, Pastor Yinka Oyelowo.
The Church, over the past two decades, has inspired faith, community service, and spiritual enlightenment.
Its incredible growth from 8 to 500 members now represents 33 nations and a unique array of lingual and ethnic communities throughout South Central Pennsylvania.
The Church's vision of transforming lives, empowering people, and impacting communities is carried out through its 60,000 square foot, state-of-the-art International Center, accompanied by 8 flourishing local churches that extend to Lancaster, Lebanon, York, and Carlisle.
The Church's reach, impact, and inspiration of unity and communal growth is yet another sign of God's enduring faithfulness and blessings.
