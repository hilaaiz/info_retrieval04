Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to honor the career of Bluefield University President Dr. David Olive, who is set to retire at the conclusion of the 2023-2024 school year.
Dr. Olive has over 25 years of experience in higher education, serving as university president since 2007.
During his time as president, Dr. Olive oversaw the introduction of both master's degree programs, online degree programs, and a RN-BSN program.
He has also overseen the expansion of residential housing and the Science Center on campus.
Prior to serving as university president, Dr. Olive served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Adult Programs at Pfeiffer University.
He has also held various positions at CarsonNewman University, Tennessee Tech University, and The University of Tennessee.
During his career, he has chaired the Council of Independent Colleges of Virginia, the Appalachian College Association, the International Association of Baptist Colleges & Universities.
He served on the NAIA Council of Presidents, on the board of directors for the Appalachian Athletic Conference and the Virginia College Fund.
He is also an ordained minister in the Southern Baptist faith.
While he transitions to full retirement, Dr. Olive has made a commitment that he will find ways to continue to serve others.
Congratulations on an incredible career to Dr. Olive.
He has left a lasting mark on Bluefield University and the many students he has met, taught, and mentored throughout the years.
Besides serving others, I hope that he gets to spend sufficient time in retirement with his wife Kathryn and children, Kayla and Will.
