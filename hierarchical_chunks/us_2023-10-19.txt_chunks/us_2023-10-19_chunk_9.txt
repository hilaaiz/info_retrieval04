Mr. Smarr began his career in 1999 in the Pittsburgh Field Office with subsequent assignments in the Houston Field Office and the Presidential Protective Division in Washington, D.C.
In addition to providing protection to our nation's leaders and investigating threats against the President, 
Mr. Smarr managed high-profile transnational fraud investigations involving the targeting of U.S. financial infrastructure and private industry victims.
During his time as the Senior Executive for the North Texas District, SAIC Smarr led all operations involving executive protection and criminal investigations with offices in Dallas, Lubbock, Tyler and Waco.
Before assuming his role in the Dallas Field Office, 
Mr. Smarr led as the Deputy SAIC in Houston, TX, where he oversaw the Secret Service's investigative and protective portfolio covering all southeast Texas and the country of Mexico.
SAIC Smarr has dedicated his life to the integrated mission and responsibilities of the United States Secret Service and fulfilled his role with honor.
I thank SAIC Smarr for all he had done to protect and serve our great Nation.
I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement.
