Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize The Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival hosted by the Ismaili Council for the Midwestern United States.
The Ismaili Arts Festival will be held at the Copernicus Center in Chicago, Illinois on Sunday, October 22, 2023.
The Ismaili Arts Festival stands as a testament to the profound impact of the arts, serving as a platform for Ismaili artists to share their unique visions and creations with our community.
This festival celebrates creativity, and promotes dialogue, diversity and understanding among residents of Illinois and visitors.
These events elevate and illustrate the pluralistic values that are held by residents of Illinois and make Illinois a more vibrant and stronger community.
This year, the Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival will bring together over 200 Ismaili artists showcasing their artistic expression in the categories of performing arts, film festival and art gallery.
The theme for this year's festival is ``care,'' in which the artists will explore their personal interconnectivity with care for the environment, care for one's heritage, and strengthening one's identity.
I am proud of the Ismaili Council for Midwestern United States and the Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival organizers, Ismaili Artists and Ismaili Volunteers who dedicate their time, knowledge, and passion to promote the arts.
On behalf of the residents of the 9th District of the State of Illinois, I proudly recognize the impact of the Ismaili Arts Festival and its contributions to the State of Illinois' arts and cultural stage and celebrate this showcase of Illinois' diversity and commitment to inclusion.
