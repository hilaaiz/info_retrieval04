Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, on behalf of the 10th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I'm honored and humbled to recognize Living Spring Harrisburg Church and 2 decades of success.
Living Spring's cultivation of moral values, charitable activity, and community faith is truly the epitome of God's work, and I wish its community continued great health, happiness, prosperity, and success for many years to come.
