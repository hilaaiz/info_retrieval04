Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Major Aaron Reep's distinguished service as a Marine Corps House Liaison Officer from January 2024 to December 2025.
Following his exemplary service as a Department of Defense Legislative Fellow in my office, Major Reep continued his dedication to our Nation by serving as a legislative liaison in the Marine Corps House Liaison Office.
In this critical role bridging the Marine Corps and Congress, Aaron has demonstrated exceptional leadership and strategic acumen.
During his tenure, Major Reep led 22 Congressional delegations to 33 countries and 6 states, facilitating vital strategic engagements and oversight of our national security priorities.
Through these delegations, he ensured Members of Congress gained firsthand understanding of Marine Corps operations, readiness challenges, and the strategic environment facing our forces worldwide.
Aaron enhanced the Marine Corps' special relationship with Congress through direct engagement with 65 Members of Congress and 78 Congressional staff, including House Leadership and committee staff.
His expertise in defense policy and Marine Corps operations proved invaluable in educating lawmakers on critical issues affecting our Marines and their families.
Major Reep's work has been instrumental in advancing Marine Corps modernization priorities, particularly Force Design 2030 initiatives and the development of Stand-in Forces capabilities essential for deterring aggression in the Indo-Pacific.
His efforts directly supported Congressional oversight of amphibious warship requirements, Landing Ship Medium development, and the Marine Corps' transformation for distributed maritime operations.
Throughout his service, Aaron has exemplified the Marine Corps values of honor, courage, and commitment.
His ability to translate complex military requirements into actionable legislative priorities has strengthened the bond between Congress and our Marines, ensuring our warfighters receive the resources and support they need to defend our Nation.
I thank Major Reep for his continued dedication to Virginia's 1st District and our Nation.
His service as a Marine Corps House Liaison has been marked by professionalism, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our national defense.
