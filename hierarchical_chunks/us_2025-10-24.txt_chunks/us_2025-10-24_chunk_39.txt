Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Douglas M. Mancino, an esteemed attorney, civic leader, and philanthropist whose distinguished career and lifelong dedication to public service enriched countless institutions and communities across the nation.
Mr. Mancino passed away unexpectedly on September 10, 2025, leaving behind a profound legacy of excellence, compassion, and integrity.
For more than four decades, Doug Mancino stood as one of the nation's foremost authorities on health care and tax-exempt organization law.
A partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, he counseled hospitals, universities, foundations, and nonprofit organizations on complex tax, financial, and regulatory matters.
Mr. Mancino reorganized the Children's Burn Foundation in 1995 and served for 20 years as its Chairman of the Board.
He also served as Commissioner, El Pueblo de Los Angeles Monument Authority and as a member at the Board of Directors for the Irvine Health Foundation.
His work strengthened the charitable and health care institutions that form the backbone of our society, ensuring they could better serve the public good.
