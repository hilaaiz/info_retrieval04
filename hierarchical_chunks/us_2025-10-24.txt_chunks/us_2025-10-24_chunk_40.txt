Mr. Mancino's leadership in the legal community was both vast and consequential.
He served as President of the American Health Lawyers Association, Chair of the American Bar Association's Exempt Organizations Committee, and Vice-Chair of Publications for the ABA Tax Section.
He was a Fellow of the American College of Tax Counsel and served on the Editorial Advisory Board of Taxation.
A prolific author, he wrote or co-authored five books and more than ninety articles that advanced understanding of nonprofit and health care law nationwide.
Beyond his professional accomplishments, Doug was a devoted husband to his wife, Carol, of 52 years, and was known as ``Uncle Spice'' to his many nieces and nephews.
He was admired not only for his brilliance but for his kindness.
He was a mentor to many, a trusted colleague, and a friend whose moral compass never wavered.
His passing is a loss not only to the legal and nonprofit communities but to all who were privileged to know him.
