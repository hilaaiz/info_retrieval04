Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Alize Johnson as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Alize has served her community of Solano County in several meaningful capacities.
Despite losing her mother at a young age, she turned her pain into purpose and has dedicated her life to uplifting others through service, advocacy, and leadership.
Her impactful service began by advocating for other youth in the community, as a Youth Community Organizer with CCISCO and as a student representative on the West Contra Costa Unified School District's LCAP Committee.
However, this was only the beginning of her work, making her a champion in advocacy for equity in education.
Alize continued to open doors for inner-city youth as a recruiter for ONYX Scholars, where she assisted in providing access to HBCUs and career opportunities.
She has transformed personal adversity into community empowerment, emboldening those she works with to do the same, primarily by leading by example.
Her work with Keyz 2 Future and Motivated 2 Help Others(M2HO) exemplifies this exceptional leadership, as she mentors youth affected by gun violence and helps those in need.
Alize's resilience has also taken her beyond the scope of her local work, as she has amplified issues of youth empowerment, environmental justice, and gun safety laws through various platforms, including Miss California USA 2024, Delegate for Miss Earth 2025, and as part of the Everytown National Training Team.
Alize is a dedicated member of the community, an ardent supporter of youth opportunities, and her collective work makes Solano County a better place for everyone.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Alize Johnson for her positive contributions to our community.
