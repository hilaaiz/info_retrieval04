Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of the Honorable James M. ``Jim'' Holland, who faithfully served the people of Chesterfield County's Dale District for nearly two decades before his passing on October 14, 2025.
I had the honor of working closely with Jim and witnessing firsthand his deep love for and unwavering dedication to his constituents.
His kindness, humility, and steadfast commitment left a lasting impression on everyone who knew him, and his influence will be felt for generations to come.
Born in Gates County, North Carolina, in 1951, Jim Holland served honorably in the U.S. Army's 18th Airborne Corps before earning degrees in accounting and business administration from Fayetteville State University and North Carolina Central University.
A certified public accountant, he built a successful practice and later taught accounting for 24 years at Virginia Commonwealth University, inspiring generations empowerment.
Elected in 2008, Supervisor Holland was the longest-serving member of the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, chairing the Board in 2014, 2021, and 2024.
Known for his calm and collaborative leadership, he guided the county through the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, championing strong schools, fiscal responsibility, and community investment.
His dedication led to major improvements in local infrastructure and the renaming of the Beulah Recreation Center in his honor in 2025.
Beyond his contributions in local government, he represented Chesterfield on numerous regional and state boards and was appointed by multiple Virginia governors for his expertise and judgment.
Deeply rooted in his faith and community, he served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at First Baptist Church Centralia and received the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Service Leadership Award earlier this year.
Jim Holland is survived by his wife of 52 years, Judith, and their children, Jessica and James, Chesterfield County and the Commonwealth legacy will endure in the community he helped build.
