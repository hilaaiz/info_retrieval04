Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly remarkable American, 
Mr. Roger Carpenter of Oak Harbor, Ohio, who just celebrated an extraordinary milestone: seventy-five years of service as Scoutmaster of Troop 316.
Seventy-five years, that's three-quarters of a century of guiding, teaching, and uplifting generations of young people.
Shaping their character, their sense of service, and their love for community.
Few can say they have given so much of themselves, for so long, to a single purpose.
But Roger Carpenter can.
And he has done so with a humble heart, steadfast faith, and a pair of calloused hands that never stop building, fixing, or helping.
At 97 years young, Roger remains active with his troop, recently repairing the very log splitter used to make the Scouts' famous apple butter.
This tradition has warmed both hearts and bellies at the Oak Harbor Apple Festival for decades.
This festival, itself a celebration of community spirit, fittingly chose this year to honor Roger for his life of selfless service.
He is believed to be the longest-serving Scoutmaster in our nation's history.
But beyond the record books, his impact is written in the lives of the hundreds, more likely perhaps thousands, of young men he has mentored.
Many of them have gone on to serve their country, their neighbors, and their families with the same quiet strength they learned under his guidance.
During this year's festival, we presented Roger with a flag flown over our United States Capitol as a symbol of the deep gratitude we hold for his unwavering devotion to the values that Scouting and citizenship share: duty, honor, leadership, and service.
As we constantly reflect on what it means to build a strong America, we must look to people like Roger Carpenter.
Those who invest in others, who give without seeking recognition, and who, year after year, live the ideals they teach.
His life is a testament to what one dedicated citizen can do to shape the moral fabric of a community and a nation.
So today, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the people of Northwest Ohio, I extend our deepest congratulations and gratitude to Scoutmaster Roger Carpenter for 75 years of remarkable leadership, for his enduring spirit, and for reminding us all that service to others is the truest form of patriotism.
I thank Roger for being a living example of the Scout Oath and Law and for inspiring us all to leave this world a little better than we found it.
