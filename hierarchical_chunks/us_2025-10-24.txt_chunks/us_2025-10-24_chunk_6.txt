Mr. WEBER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a true Texas treasure, 200 years of the Port.
It is an honor to mark this historic milestone and to recognize the men and women, past and present, whose hard work, grit, and vision have made this port what it is today.
I especially want to thank Rodger Rees and the Port's leadership for their stewardship of this vital gateway to the Gulf.
