The Minister seems to be on the verge of acknowledging that, as the last virgin steel production in the UK, Scunthorpe is critical national infrastructure and that the Government will nationalise it, if necessary.
Can she commit to the House that virgin steel production in the UK is critical national infrastructure and that, if necessary, she will indeed nationalise it to maintain this critical resource for UK defence?
I am afraid I have to disappoint the right hon.
Member, as I am not on the verge of anything.
I repeat what I said, because it is the right thing to do: we will continue to negotiate with British Steel, mindful of the workers and the insecurity of the consultation they are currently undergoing.
We will ensure that we do the right thing through our plan for steel and our response to British Steel, and I cannot say any more than that at this point.
