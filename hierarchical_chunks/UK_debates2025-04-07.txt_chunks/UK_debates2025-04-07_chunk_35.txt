My hon.
Friend is right, and we will do that.
The offer that was put to British Steel and which was refused included conditions to do exactly that, as well as including a number of other things around jobs, as we would expect.
It is very important that any deal using British taxpayers’ money is done in a way that we know is within the law and is a good use of taxpayers’ money.
I am very mindful of that, and I am constantly mindful of the insecurity that people who work at British Steel will feel, as well as the need for all of us to try to work as hard as we can to ensure that we get a good outcome for those people.
