The Prime Minister keeps saying that the world has changed, and that we are witnessing the end of globalisation.
I cannot say that I totally agree, but if that is the Government’s position, surely they have no choice but to intervene to support domestic production.
The alternative could see us locked out of reliable, consistently priced sources of steel.
The Government have stepped in to help car manufacturing in recent days, so will the Minister now redouble her efforts to reach a deal with British Steel?
Steel production is just one of the industries closing due to our high energy prices, which are 50% higher than our competitors in France and Germany and 400% higher than in the USA.
Other manufacturers such as CF Fertilisers on Teesside and Ineos at Grangemouth have closed their doors or are in the process of doing so.
Will the Minister press with the Chancellor the case for permanently lower industrial energy prices?
