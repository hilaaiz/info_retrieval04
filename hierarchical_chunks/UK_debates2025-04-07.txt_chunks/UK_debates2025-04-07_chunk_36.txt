I thank the hon.
Lady for keeping an open mind about what to do to save the remnants of our steel industry.
Does she not agree that it is vital that we maintain a strategic capability to make steel?
Is it not unconscionable that we are building British warships with imported steel?
I recognise that the situation represents the cumulative failings of Governments over many decades, but it is now time utterly to change our policy.
That includes the energy policy, which has prioritised things other than price in relation to our energy-intensive industries.
I am glad to hear that the Government have some answer to that, but to build up a strategic capability for wartime, which is what we now need to tool up for in this country, we need a wholesale change in energy policy.
I hope that she will look for common cause between the two Front-Bench teams, because this should be done on a consensus basis.
We do not need to tear chunks out of one another for the mistakes we have all made in the past.
