I thank the Minister for her comments.
While it is welcome that work is being done through DWP and so on to support potential redundant workers, the reality is that Jingye is not involved in meaningful negotiations.
The Government have been critical of it in previous responses to my questions.
It is very obvious that Jingye has cancelled the raw material orders that are essential to keep the furnaces going; those orders were due in mid-May.
When I was at the steelworks on Friday, I was told that unless another order for iron ore pellets could be placed this week, it would be too late.
