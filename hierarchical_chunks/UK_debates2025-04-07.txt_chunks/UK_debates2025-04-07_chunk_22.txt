Jingye is very much talking to us.
As I said, I met Jingye with the Secretary of State and others on Friday, and we hope to do so again this week.
Our priority is respecting the workers, safeguarding jobs and retaining steelmaking.
We have been clear in our belief that the best way forward is for Scunthorpe and British Steel to continue as a commercially-run business with private investment and with the Government acting in support, but I can tell the hon.
Gentleman that no options are off the table.
I was concerned to read about the cancellation of shipments of essential coking coal and so on for Scunthorpe.
The Business and Trade Committee heard from British Steel and Tata about some of their needs.
The Minister will be aware that an area where we have failed as a country over the last six years or so is not having an industrial strategy, so I make clear to her once more the absolute urgency for us to establish a steel plan to set out the UK’s needs and ensure that we have resilience across our industries and for our economy.
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right, and we talked about exactly that at the Business and Trade Committee.
This country has seen a significant decline in steel manufacturing over the last decade, and we want to turn that around.
Long before we got into government, we committed to a plan for steel, which represents a £2.5 billion investment in UK steelmaking.
As we speak, there is a roundtable at JCB in Stafford on the plan for steel, on this occasion discussing trade barriers—I was due to be chairing but came back to be in the Chamber.
We have been having a series of roundtables to gather evidence and pull the facts and figures together so that we can put the right investment in place.
