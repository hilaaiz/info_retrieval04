As we build new homes, it is important that we make sure that existing homes are as safe as they can be.
I recently met representatives of a leading fire safety business in my constituency, who told me of the unacceptably long delays that it faces from the Building Safety Regulator.
Will the Minister meet me and my local business to discuss those delays, and how we can tackle them?
My hon.
Friend raises an important issue.
The newly established Building Safety Regulator is crucial to upholding building safety standards, but I acknowledge that its operation is causing delays in handling applications for some building projects.
She will be aware that in February, the Government allocated £2 million to the BSR to accelerate the processing of applications.
We are working closely with the regulator to support the plan for improved delivery, and we will continue to keep its performance under review.
