I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question; we had a very productive discussion about the issue that he highlights.
I think he acknowledges  some of the bad outcomes that we have seen from the previous Government’s expansion of permitted development rights since 2013.
We are keeping the matter under review, and I am more than happy to have another conversation with him as we further consider policy in this area.
