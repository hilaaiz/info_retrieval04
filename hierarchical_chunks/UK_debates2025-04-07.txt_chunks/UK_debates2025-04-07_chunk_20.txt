The Minister was somewhat reluctant to go down the nationalisation route when I raised the matter a couple of weeks ago.
However, the majority opinion in the area and among leading politicians is that nationalisation on a temporary basis is the only solution to keep the furnaces burning come the middle of next month.
Can the Minister therefore confirm that it is something the Government are actively considering?
It would provide an opportunity to rebuild the industry, hopefully secure new private sector involvement and convince the customers—most notably Network Rail, which gets 95% of its rail track from the Scunthorpe works—that supply will continue.
I have come round to the view that nationalisation on a temporary basis is, in this instance, the only way.
It will secure the jobs and secure a future for steel production in Scunthorpe.
I urge the Minister not to rule it out, and indeed to commit to it.
