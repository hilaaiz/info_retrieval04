I thank my hon.
Friend for all he does to support private renters in his constituency.
I am saddened but, in all honesty, not shocked by the cases he raises.
Such experiences are still far too common in both the social sector and the private rented sector.
In particular, we know the health risk posed by damp  and mould.
That is one reason we have chosen to sequence the implementation of Awaab’s law in the way we have, as it will allow us to apply the protections to damp and mould earlier than would otherwise have been the case.
