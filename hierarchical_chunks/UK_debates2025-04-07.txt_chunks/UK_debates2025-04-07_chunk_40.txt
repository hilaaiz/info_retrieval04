I thank the Minister for her comments.
Given the vital importance of this industry, on which I believe the whole House agrees, does she recognise that it would be a siren to those who, on a national scale, would be less than trustworthy, if we were unable to produce virgin steel ourselves?
Given the undoubted national security risk, does she agree that, despite no options being off the table, one outcome that is absolutely off the table is closure?
If so, why not just commit to protecting and saving these jobs?
