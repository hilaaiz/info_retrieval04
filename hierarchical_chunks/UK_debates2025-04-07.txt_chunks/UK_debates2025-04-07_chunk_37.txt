I agree with the hon.
Member’s premise that we need to ensure that we have steel production in the UK, although there is some nuance around some of this.
High-quality steel is being made, as we speak, for  defence purposes by electric arc furnaces.
That is perfectly possible; we melt scrap and add about 20% of primary steel.
For some things, depending on what we are making—I know too much about the steel industry now—we do not need any primary steel.
We are conducting a review of primary steel, which will be finished shortly.
Again, neither Tata nor British Steel is a critical supplier to defence programmes at the moment, but we need that steel production, as I said before, so that we can build whatever we might need in the future.
Of course, we will work cross-party; if that is his offer, it is very gladly taken.
