Mr. Zavada has devoted hundreds of hours to maintaining the Memorial.
He mows the grass, clears snow in winter, salts the walkways, replaces worn flags, and commissions plaques for newly fallen heroes.
Beyond upkeep, he has become a steward of memory--sharing the stories behind each cross and ensuring that every name is remembered with dignity.
Each spring, local elementary school students visit the Memorial, where 
Mr. Zavada teaches them about the service and sacrifice represented there.
Through his words and care, young people learn the deep cost of freedom and the value of honoring those who gave everything.
Local businesses support his work anonymously, providing funds for flagpole upgrades, flowers, and supplies.
The Carmel VFW also contributes to maintenance and expenses, helping preserve this hallowed ground.
On behalf of Indiana's 5th District, I thank Corporal Dennis Zavada for his honorable service in Vietnam, his continued care for the Fallen Hoosier Heroes Memorial, and his lasting contributions to the community and the country.
