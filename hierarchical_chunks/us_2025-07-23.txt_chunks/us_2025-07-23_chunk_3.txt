Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mrs. Rosemary Margo Enrico of Dallas, Texas, who peacefully passed away on May 6, 2025.
Rosemary was born on September 28, 1944, in Chisholm, Minnesota, to Andrew and Rose Margo.
She graduated from Marquette University in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in marketing.
For 48 years, she was married to her childhood sweetheart, Roger Anthony Enrico, and they raised a large family with many children.
Rosemary was a devout Catholic, schoolteacher, and generous philanthropist.
Along with Roger, they founded the nonprofit Roger and Rosemary Enrico Foundation to support Catholic initiatives and provide life-changing scholarships to many economically disadvantaged students in North Texas.
In her free time, Rosemary was passionate about the arts and was an avid traveler.
She enjoyed spending time with her family and traveling around the world with Roger.
I am deeply saddened to hear of Rosemary's passing, as she brought compassion, kindness, and warmth with her presence wherever she went.
The incredible impact she has made on our community will be remembered and felt for many years to come.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of Rosemary's life and contributions to North Texas.
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.
