Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise with a heavy heart, but a grateful spirit, to honor the life of my friend, Commissioner Carrol Eugene Franklin, who passed away peacefully in Hilliard, Florida, at the young age of 76.
Born in Booneville, Mississippi, Carrol lived a life shaped by hard work, deep faith, and a quiet but profound dedication to others.
He was a proud combat veteran who served in the U.S. Army's 9th Infantry Division during the Vietnam War.
That same courage and resolve stayed with him throughout his life, whether it was in service to his country, in business, or in leadership with the Nassau County Ocean Highway & Port Authority.
Carrol was a man who showed up--not just when it was easy, but when it was needed.
He believed in faith, integrity, and perseverance.
He loved his family dearly.
And for 42 years, he stood side by side with his beloved wife, Judy, raising their sons, Garrett and Greg, and cherishing their granddaughter, Diana Del.
To his church family at First Baptist of Boulougne, his brothers and sister, and his many friends, nieces, nephews, and neighbors who knew him--Carrol was the kind of man whose legacy is etched not in headlines, but in the lives he lifted.
