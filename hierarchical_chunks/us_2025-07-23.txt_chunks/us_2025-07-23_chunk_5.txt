Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life.
Alan Barry Carr of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, who peacefully passed away on June 8, 2025.
Alan was born on January 17, 1937, to James and Olive Carr.
He attended the University of Maryland and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute for his bachelor's degree and master's degree.
Alan later earned his Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics at Oklahoma State University.
For many years, he worked as a congressional researcher for the Department of Agriculture and the Library.
Afterwards, Alan taught Economics at Texas A&M University and spent some time teaching in Armenia.
In addition to his passion for teaching, Alan enjoyed hunting, gardening, taking care of his dogs, and telling good stories to those around him.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of Alan's wonderful life and legacy.
He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and all who knew him.
