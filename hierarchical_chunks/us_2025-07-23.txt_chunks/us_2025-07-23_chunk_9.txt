(Ret.), a proud United States Marine, Vietnam veteran, and the devoted parent of a U.S. military veteran.
Mr. Zavada has served his country not only in uniform, but also through his unwavering dedication to preserving the Fallen Hoosier Heroes Memorial in Westfield, Indiana.
Since 2009, 
Mr. Zavada has volunteered his time and labor to care for this living tribute to 210 Indiana service members, who lost their lives in the wars following September 11.
The Memorial was founded by fellow Vietnam Veteran Command Sergeant Major Donald E. Peed, who initially placed white crosses on his property to honor the fallen.
What began as a few simple crosses grew each year, becoming a powerful community landmark.
The first cross honored Marine Sergeant Jeanette Winters, the first woman killed in combat during Operation Enduring Freedom.
The most recent cross honors Marine Corporal Humberto Sanchez, who was killed outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan during the 2021 withdrawal.
