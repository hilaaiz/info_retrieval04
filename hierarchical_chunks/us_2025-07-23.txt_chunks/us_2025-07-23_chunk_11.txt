Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Barbara Nemko, Ph.D., on the occasion of her retirement after 28 years as Napa County Superintendent of Schools and a lifetime of service to education.
Dr. Nemko was born in the Bronx, New York, where her journey in education began.
She earned her Bachelor of Arts and Master's degrees from Queens College, and started her career as a second-grade teacher in New York City.
Her academic work continued at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned her Ph.D. in Reading and Evaluation of School Programs in 1981, a milestone that also began her love affair with California.
After joining the Napa County Office of Education in 1991, Dr. Nemko was appointed as the Napa County Superintendent of Schools in 1997, and later elected to the position in 1998.
Dr. Nemko held this role for an unprecedented 28 years.
At the time of her retirement, Dr. Nemko was the longest-serving county superintendent in office in our state.
Her tenure transformed Napa County's education system, establishing the Office of Education as a regional leader in early learning, special education, career technical education, mental health services, and professional development for educators.
Dr. Nemko was known for her forward-thinking leadership, particularly in advancing educational technology.
She was an early advocate for closing the digital divide, securing technology and internet access for thousands of students in Napa County.
She pioneered programs like the Superintendent's Fund to provide children with eyeglasses, orthotics, and other critical needs not covered by existing budgets.
Her leadership has extended beyond the classroom.
Dr. Nemko served on the Community Corrections Board and Juvenile Justice Committee for her entire tenure as Superintendent, completed Leadership Napa Valley in 1999, and later joined its Board.
She also served as President of the Rotary Club of Napa from 2013 to 2014.
In recognition of her advocacy, she was named Woman of the Year for the 7th Assembly District by the California Legislature in 2009, received the Public Policy Advocate Award from the International Society for Technology in Education in 2014, and earned the Platinum Disk Award from Computer Using Educators in 2019.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Dr. Nemko is deeply committed to her family
