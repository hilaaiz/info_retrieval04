Mr. BELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the Honorable William Lacy Clay, Sr. ``We have no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, just permanent interests.''
Our country lost a trailblazer.
Congressman Clay passed away after a lifetime of service that reshaped St. Louis and our Nation.
Already a civil rights icon before he was elected, he didn't come to Washington to play politics.
He came to fight for working people, Black families, union members, and those too often left out and unheard.
He carried their voices into this chamber and made sure they echoed.
Bill Clay was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.
I--and so many others--would not be here without the doors he opened and the example he set.
I'm holding his son, my friend and predecessor Lacy Clay, the entire Clay family, and the St. Louis community in my prayers.
