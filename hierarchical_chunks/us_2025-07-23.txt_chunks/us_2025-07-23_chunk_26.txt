Mr. Vitale was a dedicated civic leader in Moon Township.
He was a dedicated public servant, serving on the Moon Township Board of Supervisors for nearly 18 years, holding the positions of Chairman or Vice Chairman for 11 of those years.
And he was committed to his community, representing the township on the Board of Directors of the South Hills Area Council of Governments for 15 years.
Public service was in Jim Vitales' bones.
In Western Pennsylvania, a life like his--devoted to his family and community--shows exactly who we are.
Humble, proud, and always ready to do our part: Jim embodied the very best of Western Pennsylvania values: hard work, service, and dedication.
I am holding Jim's wife, Luanne Vitale, his family, and his entire community in my heart as we celebrate his life and mourn his passing.
