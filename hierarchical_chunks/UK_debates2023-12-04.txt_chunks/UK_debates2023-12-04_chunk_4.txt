The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support economic growth in Yorkshire and the north.
For our part, we wish Mr Speaker all the very best, and we hope that he enjoys a speedy recovery—but it is wonderful to have you in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker.
I also welcome  the hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton (Jim McMahon)  back to the Front Bench.
I know that he, too, was unwell recently, so it is great to see him in his place and looking so well.
We are taking considerable steps to boost economic growth in Yorkshire and the north, including the creation of two investment zones in south and west Yorkshire and, of course, the extension of devolution to the whole of the historic county.
I am sure the whole House wants to see Mr Speaker back and well again very soon.
