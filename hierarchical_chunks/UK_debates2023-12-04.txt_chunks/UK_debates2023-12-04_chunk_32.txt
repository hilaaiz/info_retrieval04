I welcome the Government’s support for the extension of the humanitarian pauses, so that more aid can get into Gaza and more lives can be saved.
May I ask the Minister about post-conflict governance in Gaza?
Fatah are not Hamas, and Hamas are not Fatah, clearly—by definition.
Fatah are marginally better in the eyes of some Palestinians, but when they have gone to the ballot box, the Palestinians have not voted for Fatah; they have voted for others.
I notice that there have been a lot of high-level diplomatic visits to the senior leadership of Fatah.
May I encourage  the Government to perhaps look more widely at who might form the Government of Gaza in the future, so that the UK does not repeat the mistakes of the past and Fatah do not return to office only to be thrown out years later and perhaps replaced by a new Hamas?
