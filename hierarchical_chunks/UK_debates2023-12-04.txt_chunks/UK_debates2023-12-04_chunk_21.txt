I thank the Minister for his answer, and I welcome him to his place.
He will know that the cyber-attack in October 2021 was not detected until August 2022, and the commission admitted that it had failed a cyber security test in the same year.
What work is the Minister doing with the Security Minister to ensure that the defending democracy taskforce has a remit with the Electoral Commission?
I agree with the Minister, as should all Members of this House, that we should have free and fair elections without intervention from other states, so what work is he doing to ensure the general election next year is protected from any hostile states?
