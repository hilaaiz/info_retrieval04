In the festive spirit, I extend my sympathies to the Secretary of State, who seems to spend his time haunted by the ghost of Christmas past.
In 2019, a Tory Prime Minister promised to ban no-fault evictions.
Since then, households have been put at risk of homelessness because of a section 21 notice nearly 78,000 times.
In 2017, the fifth predecessor of the Secretary of State pledged action to end the medieval practice of leasehold, but just last year another 207,000 homeowners became stuck in that expensive nightmare.
All the while, the Secretary of State has been beavering away drawing up what can only be described as Alice in Wonderland legislation: a Bill to ban no-fault evictions that will not ban no-fault evictions, and a Bill to ban leasehold that will not ban leasehold.
Is he too scared to stand up to his Back Benchers, or has he truly fallen down the rabbit hole?
I should remind the right hon.
Lady that I am not the Secretary of State.
Let me also remind her that the Renters (Reform) Bill is the biggest change to the private rented sector in 30 years—longer than I have been alive.
We have to ensure that we get this right both for tenants and for the 2.4 million landlords in this country.
She may be willing to brush aside the concerns of landlords and turn her back on what are often small businesses.
We are not.
We will deliver a Bill that protects renters and ensures a fair system for landlords.
What funding he plans to provide to local authorities in Essex in the 2024-25 financial year.
The Government will bring forward our proposals for the 2024-25 local government finance settlement in the usual way, towards the end of the calendar year, but I pledge that it will be before the House rises.
We will set out our proposals for the 2024-25 financial year and then invite views in our formal consultation.
