I thank the Minister for his response, but I say respectfully that I do not find it satisfactory.
I declare an interest as a proudly active Somerset councillor.
Councils provide essential services, such as adults’ and children’s social care, yet increasing costs in social care, alongside inflation, mean that many councils around the country are struggling to provide adequate care.
I must warn him that, without action, lives will be foreshortened.
The cost of providing services is higher in rural areas than urban areas, yet rural residents will receive 13% less per head in social care support.
Will he reassure me that the forthcoming fair funding review will address the unequal way rural councils are funded?
