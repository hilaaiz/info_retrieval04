I welcome the responses the Minister is giving, but I want to hear the Foreign Secretary’s response.
On  16 November , we had a harrowing session with the humanitarian organisations on the ground in Gaza.
We wrote to the Foreign Secretary, but have not had a reply.
We have not had a reply either about when he will come in front of our Committee.
With such a horrific and fast-moving situation in Israel and Gaza, when can this House expect to hear from the Foreign Secretary?
