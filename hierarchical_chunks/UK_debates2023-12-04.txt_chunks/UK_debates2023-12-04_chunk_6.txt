I thank the Secretary of State for his robust answer to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) .
Does he agree that the sight this weekend of bereaved family members from both the Muslim and Jewish communities joining together in a combined rally against Islamophobia and antisemitism was an inspiring sight that we should all hold in our hearts and honour?
Does that not serve as a lesson to those people from one community or the other who preached hatred against others who are in fact innocent victims?
