The Secretary of State moved with admirable speed after the death of Awaab Ishak to ensure that social landlords honour their obligations to tenants in terms of mould and safety, but those in private rented accommodation do not have that protection.
Can the Minister tell the House, and the world, why private tenants are put at risk in that way?
I am grateful to the hon.
Gentleman for the work that he did following the tragic and unnecessary death of Awaab Ishak.
We have tabled an amendment to the Renters (Reform) Bill to expand the decent homes standard to the private rented sector for the first time.
I look forward to working with him to ensure that the Bill is in as good a state as it can be when it leaves this House.
The Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee has been taking evidence about local government finances.
In the past two years, expenditure on homelessness and temporary accommodation has increased by 50%.
The reality is that section 21 notices are a prime driver of that.
The Renters (Reform) Bill will abolish section 21, but the Government have not yet announced a timetable for the legislation’s implementation or the abolition.
The Government have said that we need court reform.
I completely agree, but how was that helped by the Chancellor’s announcing in the autumn statement a freeze of the budget of the Ministry of Justice for the whole of the next Parliament?
I can confirm to the Chair of the Select Committee that I met the relevant Minister in the Ministry of Justice just this morning to discuss that point.
We are working at pace to ensure that the courts are ready for the biggest change in the private rented sector in over 30 years.
The hon.
Gentleman talked about local government funding.
We are conducting a new burdens assessment for local government to ensure that any additional burdens that are placed on local government are funded properly.
