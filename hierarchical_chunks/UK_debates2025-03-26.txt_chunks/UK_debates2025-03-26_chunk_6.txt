Significant concerns were raised in the recent Westminster Hall debate on the implementation of the Online Safety Act 2023.
Will the Minister take urgent steps to better categorise online platforms, to better protect women and girls online?
I can assure the hon.
Member that, whatever the size of the organisation and whatever category that organisation or platform is in, the onus is on them.
The legal duty to remove illegal content and to act with the new powers that will be coming in later this year remains intact, and they must act.
I expect Ofcom to use those powers as assertively as necessary to make sure that people are protected in our country.
