The problems faced by Heathrow earlier in the week have highlighted again that since the closure of Manston airport in Kent, the south-east lacks a major diversion facility.
Although such a facility would not, of course, have compensated for the closure of Heathrow, which is a major hub airport, does the Prime Minister agree that the reopening of Manston, planned for October 2028, will be a significant contribution to the resilience of aviation in the south-east?
The right hon.
Gentleman is right to raise the concern about the situation at Heathrow and I think everybody is very concerned by what happened last week.
There are clearly questions that need to be answered on a number of fronts in relation to what happened, and an investigation is ongoing.
I will not announce particular parts of our policy and strategy here, at this stage.
In my constituency of North Ayrshire and Arran, the SNP ferry fiasco is having a devastating social and economic impact on Ardrossan and the Isle of Arran.
As well as a CalMac ferry being built that does not fit into the existing harbour, the Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that the disrupted ferries cost the Isle of Arran £170,000 of lost revenue per day.
Does the Prime Minister agree that the SNP Government need to find a rapid solution to swiftly address this serious situation?
