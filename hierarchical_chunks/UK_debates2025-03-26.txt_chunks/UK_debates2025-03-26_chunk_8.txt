I thank the Minister for his candour and honesty.
He is one of the most effective, experienced and able Ministers in the Government.
Having paid those compliments, can I encourage him to visit Shropshire, where there are still too many notspots?
Perhaps one of the reasons is that this country has only four mobile network operators.
Is it not time that we had more competition?
Finally, is the shared rural network agreement likely to hit its targets by the end of this year?
