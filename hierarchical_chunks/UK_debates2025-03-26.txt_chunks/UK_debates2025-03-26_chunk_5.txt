I thank my hon.
Friend in particular for the work she is doing on behalf of her Select Committee.
I am also grateful for the national debate that has been sparked by the programme “Adolescence”.
It is incredibly important that we act in these areas.
The powers that came in last week to take down illegal content, but also the powers that are coming in later this year in June, will mean that all those publishing content must make sure it is age-appropriate.
That will be a step forward.
I am watching the impact of these new powers closely, and I will act accordingly if they are not strong enough.
