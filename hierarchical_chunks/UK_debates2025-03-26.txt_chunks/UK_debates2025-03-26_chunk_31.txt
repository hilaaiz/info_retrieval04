At the last Budget, the right hon.
Lady said that she would bring stability to the public finances, but this statement, more appropriately referred to as an emergency Budget, has brought her to a cold—[Interruption.]
Order.
Rightly, I wanted to hear the Chancellor, and I now want to hear the shadow Chancellor.
[Interruption.]
I do not need any help.
This emergency Budget has brought the right hon.
Lady to a cold hard reckoning.
She has become fond recently of talking about the world having changed, and indeed it has.
This country was growing at the fastest rate in the G7 only about a year ago.
Just as the OECD, the Bank of England and other forecasters—including, we learn today, the OBR—have stated, growth has been halved for this year.
It has been cut in two as a consequence of the decisions and the choices that the right hon.
Lady has made on her watch.
Inflation was down to 2%—bang on target—under a Conservative Government on the very day of the last general election.
We are now told that this year we will be running at twice the level as was forecast under us in 2024.
That will mean prices bearing down on households and on businesses right across the country, because of her choices.
The OBR also says that unemployment will be rising this year, next year and the year after.
In fact, across the forecast period it will not decline at all.
So much for the right hon.
Lady’s back to work plans.
We have already seen what it means when it comes to controlling borrowing under this Chancellor.
She has come forward now with a plan to squeeze spending later on in the forecast period, and she has of course told the OBR that these are the elements of spending restraint to which she will stick, but what do the markets think?
Given her track record, and the fact that she has failed to control spending and borrowing to date, what does the right hon.
Lady think the markets will make of her latest promises?
