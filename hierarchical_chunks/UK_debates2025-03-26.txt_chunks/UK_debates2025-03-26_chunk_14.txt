The Secretary of State has today referred to space and AI as key drivers of growth.
Closer to home, in my constituency and across the country, our creative industries are huge drivers of growth, but there is a battle with AI.
If our creators’ content is taken and they are not recompensed, that will damage the economy, too.
Is he talking to those industries and to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to ensure that our creative content creators are protected?
I can assure my hon.
Friend that I am speaking to both sectors, and I am determined that both sectors will get fit for the future as we face the opportunities and challenges.
We are lucky as a country to have the second largest creative arts sector and the third largest AI market in the world.
This is both a benefit and an opportunity for our country, and this Government will navigate any challenges it poses so that both sectors are fit to exploit the opportunities they have and for commercial gain into the future.
