The Minister can see that the whole House has filled up out of concern at the atrocious mobile phone signal in Godalming and Cranleigh high streets and in Bramley, Shamley Green and Peaslake.
Now that spring is in the air, will he visit Cranleigh to see for himself just what a problem this is?
Well, I was in Pizza Express in Godalming only a couple of weeks ago, and the mobile signal was absolutely shocking.
I could not find my way to Busbridge village hall.
I am not sure whether it is the MP or the Telecoms Minister who is rubbish—[Hon.
Members: “Oh!”].
In which case, we will move on to Prime Minister’s questions.
