I thank my hon.
Friend for fighting SNP incompetence on behalf of her constituents.
Yet again, the SNP is failing island communities.
Hospital appointments are being missed and livelihoods destroyed.
Scotland has a proud history of shipbuilding and engineering.
The SNP should be supporting Scottish workers and focusing on delivering for our communities.
