I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this issue.
The courage of these campaigners, after simply appalling cases, is astounding and I find it humbling.
I am pleased that the Minister for Victims my hon.
Friend  the Member for Pontypridd (Alex Davies-Jones)  will be meeting the group—today, I think—and I look forward to meeting them in future, because we must prioritise victims and make sure that sentences punish offenders and protect the public.
I thank him for raising that really important set of cases.
