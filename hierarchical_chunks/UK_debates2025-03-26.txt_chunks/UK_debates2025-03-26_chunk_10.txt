I welcome the national conversation taking place about how we protect children online.
The Online Safety Act 2023 requires all regulated user-to-user  and search services to comply with the illegal content and child safety rules.
The illegal content duties came into effect last week, and I am closely monitoring the impact of these duties on online safety.
