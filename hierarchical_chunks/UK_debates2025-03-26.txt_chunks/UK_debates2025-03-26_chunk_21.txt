The Prime Minister is not answering the question about discipline in schools, because he does not care about discipline in schools.
Everything he does is ideological, and his decisions are costing schools so much.
The national insurance hike means that every state school in the country has to pay more for teachers.
The Education Secretary promised to compensate schools in full for the jobs tax.
Why has it not happened?
It was Labour that introduced academies and pushed up standards.
This is not ideological.
I am a parent of two teenage children, both of whom go to a state school, so I am invested in this, and it matters hugely to me.
There is nothing ideological about it.
That is why we are driving up standards, as we always have done.
