I thank the Government Front Benchers for bringing forward the Bill and prioritising children so early in the life of this Labour Government.
It feels like unfinished business.
The last Labour Government did so much to improve the lot of children and young people; we are just picking up where they left off.
I look forward to seeing the Bill progress, and to the future of all our children being so much brighter.
