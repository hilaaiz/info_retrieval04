I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
I was pleased that the first increased payments to mineworkers’ pension scheme members were made at the end of November.
I understand the strong feelings on the British coal staff superannuation  scheme, which is why the Minister for industry met the trustees last year.
We will work with the coal staff trustees to consider their proposals once the new mineworkers’ pension scheme arrangements have been agreed.
