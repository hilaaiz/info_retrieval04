Happy new year, Mr Speaker.
I join others in offering my personal condolences to the Prime Minister on the loss of his brother.
May I take this opportunity to express my sadness at the passing of a much-loved member of the Liberal Democrat family, Baroness Jenny Randerson?
Fixing the care crisis is urgent for the millions of elderly and disabled people who are not getting the care they need, for the millions of family carers who are making huge sacrifices to fill the gap, and for the NHS, when over 12,000 people are stuck in hospital beds and cannot get out of hospital because the care is not there for them.
The Prime Minister is right to say that we need a cross-party approach, but as Sir Andrew Dilnot has said today, that need not take three years.
Will the Prime Minister please speed up that work so that 2025 is the year we finally rise to the challenge of fixing care?
