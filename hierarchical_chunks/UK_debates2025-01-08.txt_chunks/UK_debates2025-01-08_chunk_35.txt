I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that important and challenging case.
Community pharmacists like Dipak play a vital role in our health service.
As she knows, the Department of Health and Social Care sets drug tariff prices and regularly assesses what pharmacies are reimbursed to ensure that overall they are paid fairly.
If the hon.
Lady is prepared to share the details further with me, I will have a review carried out by the team of the case she has raised.
