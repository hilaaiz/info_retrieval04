My hon.
Friend raises a very important issue.
Violence against women and girls, abuse and child sexual exploitation are sickening, and many victims have been let down for a very long time by warped ideas about community relations and the protection of institutions.
He raises the question of inquiries.
There have been a number of inquiries, both national and local, including one covering Oldham.
Reasonable people can agree or disagree on whether a further inquiry is necessary.
This morning, I met some of the victims and survivors of this scandal.
They were clear with me that they want action now, not the delay of a further inquiry.
The Jay inquiry, the last national inquiry, was seven years.
A further inquiry would take us to 2031.
Action is what is required.
But whatever anyone’s view on whether a further inquiry is needed, what I find shocking is that anyone in this House would vote down the children’s wellbeing Bill this afternoon, with vital protections for the most vulnerable in our society.
I urge the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw her wrecking amendment.
