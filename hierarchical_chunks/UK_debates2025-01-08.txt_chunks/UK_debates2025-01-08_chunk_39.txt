I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this matter.
We are committed to building those 1.5 million homes, which includes 4,500 new homes every year in Cornwall.
I do recognise the point that the hon.
Member makes, which is that excessive concentrations of short-term lets and second homes in places such as Cornwall can impact the availability and affordability of homes.
That is why we will enable councils to charge a premium on the council tax bills of second homes, abolish the furnished home lettings regime and introduce a registration scheme for short-term lets.
I am happy to make sure that he and his Cornish colleagues get the meeting that they want with the Housing Minister to discuss that further.
