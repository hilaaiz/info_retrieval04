I can indeed commit to that.
The Government see the embrace of proven technologies and innovation as fundamental to the future survival of the NHS.
I was incredibly happy to see that last autumn, the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust began enrolling patients in a global-first trial of completely personalised cancer vaccines, as part of a £1 billion investment negotiated by my Department.
That shows the way forward and how co-operation between Departments will deliver for patients and public service users across the country.
Early diagnosis saves lives.
Randox in my constituency runs a number of NHS health checks from the Isle of Wight through to Lanarkshire.
Will the Secretary of State encourage greater use of those checks, and will he visit Randox with me to see how we can further advance that technology?
I confirm that I have been working with the Health Secretary—indeed, we recently visited St Tommy’s across the road from here to see how new technology is being used in diagnostics.
It is increasing the number of scans and improving the quality of those scans to diagnose disease early and prevent it from having the worst outcome.
That is being rolled out across the country, and I am working closely with the Health Secretary to ensure that such innovations are put to good use for the country.
