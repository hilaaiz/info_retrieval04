This Government are committed to using the criminal justice system to tackle violence against women and girls, but when an abuser can use a child custody battle to continue their abuse, as has happened in the case of  one of my constituents, it is clear that we need to raise the issue in the civil courts too.
Will the Prime Minister please look at ending the absurd assumption that a domestic abuser’s involvement in a child’s live is advantageous to their welfare?
Yes, absolutely.
My hon.
Friend is right; family courts must never be a tool that domestic abusers can use to continue their appalling abuse.
That is why we are expanding the number of new pathfinder courts to provide dedicated support to survivors and protect the welfare of children.
We are reviewing the presumption of parental involvement and will set out our position in due course.
I will make sure that he meets the relevant Minister to discuss this further.
May I associate myself with the remarks of the Liberal Democrat leader and others today?
I wish a happy new year to everyone, but 2025 is already proving a challenge for many of my constituents—pensioners, families, small businesses, the hospitality industry, GPs and social care providers, as others have said.
They know that the SNP has failed to deliver for Scotland.
They hear the Prime Minister when he says that the Conservatives left the economy in a mess, and they know that Governments have to make difficult decisions.
But what they are asking me is: when will this Government do something positive for them to overcome the negative impacts that they are facing from the Budget?
