I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this question.
Businesses in his constituency have been badly let down by the deal made by the last Government.
We are resetting and strengthening that relationship, on the economy, energy and security, to deliver the growth we need.
I know this is an issue of considerable frustration to his constituents.
The decision in question is ultimately for Eurostar, but we are keen to see international services reinstated to Ashford as soon as possible and I will be happy for the Rail Minister to update him on the latest discussions.
