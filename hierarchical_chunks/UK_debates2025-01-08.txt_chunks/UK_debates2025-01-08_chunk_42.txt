The hon.
Lady raises the failure of the SNP and the legacy of the Tories.
I am proud that this Labour Government delivered the largest budget settlement for Scotland since devolution.
That means, in answer to her question, that 100,000 workers in Scotland benefit from the increases to the national minimum and living wages each year.
An estimated 3.2 million people in Scotland will benefit from the extension of the 5p cut in fuel duty, which of course comes on top of the £125 million to set up Great British Energy in Aberdeen.
It reinforces the point that the SNP has the powers but has a terrible record, and the Tories left a terrible legacy.
We are getting on with delivering for Scotland.
Last year, this Labour Government delivered justice for members of the mineworkers’ pension scheme, and 45,000 members of the similar British coal staff superannuation scheme are keen to see their £2.3 billion investment reserve returned to them, which could boost coalfield communities such as mine in Cannock Chase.
Will the Prime Minister meet retired miners, trustees and coalfield MPs to discuss what can be done for BCSSS members up and down the country?
