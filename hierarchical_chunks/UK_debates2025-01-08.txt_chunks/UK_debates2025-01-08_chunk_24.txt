I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
We all owe an extraordinary debt of thanks to those who serve.
By reacquiring over 36,000 service family homes, including 1,700 in her constituency, we can rapidly transform substandard accommodation.
The deal we have done also saves the taxpayer around  £230 million per year in rent and follows the largest pay rise for the armed forces in over 20 years.
There is, of course, still work to do, but this is a major step forward.
