I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that.
Antisemitism is completely abhorrent and has no place whatsoever in our society.
I recently met Jewish community leaders in Downing Street to discuss what further we can do to combat antisemitism, and that includes allocating £54 million for the Community Security Trust to continue its vital work, committing to building a new Holocaust memorial and learning centre and providing at least £2.2 million to continue the funding for Lessons from Auschwitz.
I look forward to working with others on those important proposals.
