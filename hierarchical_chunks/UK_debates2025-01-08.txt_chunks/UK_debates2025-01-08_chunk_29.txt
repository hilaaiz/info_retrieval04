I welcome the efforts this Labour Government have made to reset our relationship with the European Union and to seek  to remove unnecessary trade barriers.
The trading links between the UK and mainland Europe are of particular importance to my constituency, so will the Prime Minister support my efforts, and those of other Kent colleagues, to restore an international train service to Ashford International station to help economic growth in my constituency, Kent and the wider south-east?
