I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this important issue and thank him for his condolences.
Yes, we do need to get this right.
I want a cross-party consensus on the issue and I invite him to work with us, as I know he will.
It is important and he is right to say that we need some action now.
We have taken immediate action by providing £3.7 billion of additional funding in the Budget for social care and another £86 million to allow 7,800 more disabled and elderly people to live more independent lives, and we have increased the carer’s allowance.
We have set this up in stages, so we can act and improve as we go along, while making sure we have consensus for the bigger changes that may be proposed in the review.
I invite him and Members from across the House to work with us, so we can get this right and ensure what we put in place endures beyond just a few years.
