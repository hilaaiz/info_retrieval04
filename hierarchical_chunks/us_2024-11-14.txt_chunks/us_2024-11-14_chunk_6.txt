Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this past month, it was my honor to attend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor for an incredible young man, James Scalice.
James has learned an incredible amount through the merit badge program earning 41 total badges in subjects such as Life Skills, Business, and Science.
Within his troop, this young man has developed leadership skills through elected positions and has learned the value to his church and community.
He has displayed his love for God by earning two religious emblems including ``Pope Pius the twelfth'' from the Catholic Diocese.
With a deep love for his country and great respect for veterans, James decided to help out the American Legion Post 28 in Absecon, South Jersey for his Eagle Scout project.
