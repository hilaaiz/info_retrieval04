Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize the Father Tolton softball team for their remarkable achievement of clinching the Class 4 championship.
Their 24-10 season record and 5-0 shutout victory over Belton in the title game, is the culmination of all the work they put in and the great amount of talent on this team.
It is worth noting that this state championship is the second in Father Tolton's program history.
Their last softball state championship came in 2020.
This championship serves as an example of the upward trajectory of where the program is headed.
I extend my sincerest congratulations to the Father Tolton softball team, coaches, and its supporters.
Winning a championship is a collective effort that takes an all-hands-on deck approach.
The community recognizes and highly values their dedication and passion for softball.
