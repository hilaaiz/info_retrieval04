giving back to his community.
Tony gave years of his life to his country by serving in the United States Army during World War II being in the 11th Airborne Division where he was involved in several combat missions.
In his time of service, he bravely assisted in a daring prison raid in Los Banos, Philippines, which resulted in freeing nearly 3,000 American prisoners from the horrific treatment from the enemy's military.
The operation took place on February 23, 1945, when prisoners were lined up to be executed before the 11th Airborne division made their attack and liberated the thousands of allied prisoners of war and civilians.
Tony was shown homage for his service to his country on his 100th birthday on April 19th of this year when 100 flags were placed in his yard from Americans and Filipinos thanking him for his service.
Since the end of War World II, Tony has continued to be an outstanding member of society and has fathered a beautiful family that have added to their father's legacy.
I wish Tony a happy birthday
and I wish him 100 more extraordinary years.
God bless Tony Bocelle and God bless the United States.
