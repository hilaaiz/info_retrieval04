Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Jason Anderson for his 20 years of impactful service as Economic Development Director for the City.
In this role, Anderson worked with Illinois businesses and others in the Rochelle community to attract increased economic investment and improve public infrastructure in Rochelle.
Anderson graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in Business Administration.
Before becoming the Economic Development Director, Anderson served in many roles, including Northern Illinois Regional Director for former U.S. 
Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
Through Anderson's tenure, the City of Rochelle saw robust improvement in their economy and infrastructure.
Since 2005, there has been $1.3 billion in capital investments made by businesses and 2,200 jobs created in Rochelle.
Highlights of this economic growth include investment projects from companies like Wheatland Tube and the CHS Ethanol plant as well as the construction of the Rochelle Business Technology Park.
Additionally, the City of Rochelle has received over $125 million in funding for infrastructure over the past two decades.
Anderson's work as Economic Development Director focused specifically on infrastructure modernization of the railroad and airport.
In Anderson's 10 years overseeing Rochelle's airport it received almost $11 million in funding and the Rochelle railroad's yearly revenue quadrupled under Anderson's vision.
Jason Anderson's tireless work has left a lifelong impact on the Rochelle community and the state.
His commitment to our community is truly inspiring and I congratulate Jason on 20 years of service to Rochelle and wish him the best in all future endeavors.
