Brenda was a friend to many who were blessed by the bond of her friendship.
She was frank and honest in her friendship--sharing not just what you might want to hear but what she felt you needed to hear.
On a personal note, I will forever cherish the wise counsel and sage advice Brenda gave me over the last 32 years.
It was at her kitchen table with Brenda and several friends, poring over maps and pages of data, and in fervent prayer, that I resolved to run for Congress in 1992.
As she did for me, Brenda touched so many lives in so many ways and because she did, the world is a better place.
