Mr. JORDAN.
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio and across the country in paying tribute to our friend, former Congressman David L. Hobson, who died on October 6.
Dave was one of the Buckeye State's most respected public servants.
He worked on behalf of the people of the Seventh Congressional District for 18 years--and served in the State Senate for eight years prior to that.
He took great pride in solving problems great and small on behalf A longtime member of the Appropriations Committee and a Military Construction cardinal, Dave was a champion of our state's military installations of all types, ensuring that they were in the best position possible to contribute to our national defense.
Dave was himself a proud Ohio Air National Guard veteran, serving during the Berlin Wall crisis.
In recognition of his service in and out of uniform, in 2022 he was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame--a high honor accorded to no more than 20 Ohioans each year.
