Mr. SABLAN.
Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing the Court Improvement Equity Act which authorizes grants to improve child welfare services in Guam, American Samoa, and my district, the Northern Mariana Islands.
As it stands, courts located in the Pacific territories are the only entities that do not receive support from the Court Improvement Program (CIP) under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act.
In all other territories and states, the CIP provides a grant to the highest court adoption proceedings.
Every child, regardless of where they grow up in our country, has the right to a safe, secure, and nurturing family.
My bill would enshrine this right by extending the same base grant currently available everywhere else to our islands.
The gentleman from Guam, 
Mr. Moylan, is an original cosponsor of the bill.
I urge my colleagues to support this vital bipartisan legislation.
