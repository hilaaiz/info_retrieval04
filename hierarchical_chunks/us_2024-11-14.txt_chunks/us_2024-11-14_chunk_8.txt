Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW)
Willie Barraza Post 9173 for their 75th anniversary.
The Willie Barraza Post has been an important service organization to assist our veteran community, their families, and the wider El Paso community.
The Post was founded in 1949 and named after Willie Barraza, who was an Army Sergeant from Smeltertown who went Missing in Action during World War II.
Smeltertown was located in El Paso, Texas, and housed workers of the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO).
Willie Barraza Post 9173 is the second oldest post in El Paso with veteran members from the Korean, Vietnam, and Global War on Terrorism.
The Willie Barraza Post is chartered with 34 World War II service members and currently has 148 members serving our border city and our military base.
Their members are active participants in supporting our community.
They help raise funds for local churches and scholarship opportunities for students.
They also serve in recognizing veterans through participation in our district's annual Independence Day and Veterans Day parades.
Today, I want to thank the Willie Barraza Post for their service to the country and our community.
I join them in celebrating their 75th Anniversary and commend them for their consistent presence in El Paso.
I look forward to the continued work that they do in the coming years and decades.
