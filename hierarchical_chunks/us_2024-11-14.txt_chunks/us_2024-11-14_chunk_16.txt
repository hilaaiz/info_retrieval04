Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of attending a masterful Eagle Scout Court of Honor for Raylen Weaver from Mullica Hill, South Jersey.
Raylen has been involved in boy scouts for seven years since he was a rising fifth grader as a Webelos Scout and now in the tenth grade he has already achieved the rank.
He has held multiple leadership positions which includes the Den Chief, Scribe, Patrol Leader and earning his way up to the position of Senior Patrol Leader.
On his climb up to Senior Patrol Leader, he spent 59 nights camping, hiked 84 miles, and logged 76 hours of service to better his community before he is accredited with completing 130 more hours to complete his Eagle Scout project.
For his project, he decided to create the Little Way Children's Garden to benefit the Mary Mother of Mercy Church in Glassboro, South Jersey.
This garden is a beautiful prayer area defined by edge stones with concrete and wood benches complete with statues.
Therese, Mary, and St. Joesph in a perfect display to benefit children of the church and parishioners.
Raylen is also an avid runner and biker participating in a Duathlon and the 100mile MS ride City to Shore.
He plans to attend the Naval Academy or West Point to serve his county and continue to improve himself.
I have all faith that Raylen will make his country proud and continue to make his local community proud.
God bless Raylen Weaver and God bless the United States.
