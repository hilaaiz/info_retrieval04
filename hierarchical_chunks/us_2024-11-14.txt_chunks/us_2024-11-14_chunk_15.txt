Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the great school of Pineland Learning Center in Vineland, South Jersey, which has been of incredible mentorship for children in South Jersey for over four decades.
Since its founding in 1980 by the late Fred Eccleston, the school has been an outstanding outlet for students that have struggled in the traditional learning environment by providing alternative learning techniques to fit their needs.
Many times, the students that come to PLC have been dealt hands in life that most adults can't even imagine and because of this they have not been able to find their full potential in a typical school setting.
With the dedicated staff that Pineland has to offer, the kids are provided with a safe, structured, and consistent learning environment where they can discover their gifts and see all the possibilities life has to offer.
The staff gains the children's trust by committing themselves to learning who the student is by understanding the student's personality as well as quirks and triggers that cause outbursts.
This allows the kids to learn who they are by being allowed to be themselves in a culture that feels just like a family.
PLC goes beyond academics by also providing the students with work-based learning for jobs that the local community has to offer, and college fairs where many of the kids can attend universities throughout the country.
It is my great honor to commend the Pineland Learning Center on many years of great service to the youth of South Jersey and I look forward to many more years of improving their lives.
God bless Pineland Learning Center and God bless the United States.
