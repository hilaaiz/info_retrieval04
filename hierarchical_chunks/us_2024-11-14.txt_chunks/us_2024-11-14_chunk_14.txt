Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the people of Georgia and beyond in celebrating the extraordinary life of Brenda Davis Murrell and in extending our deepest condolences to her family, friends, sorors, and all who mourn her loss.
Moreover, I pray that we will all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
