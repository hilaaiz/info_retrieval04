hostilities in Gaza.
And as more recent congressional oversight efforts make clear, these efforts are part of concerted attack on civil society that is targeted at more than just groups involved in the campus protests regarding Gaza.
The executive branch could use this authority to target its political opponents and use the fear of crippling legal fees, the stigma of the designation, and donors fleeing controversy to stifle dissent and chill speech and advocacy.
And while the broadest applications of this authority may not ultimately hold up in court, the potential reputational and financial cost of fending off an investigation and litigating a wrongful designation could functionally mean the end of a targeted nonprofit before it ever has its day in court.
The lack of guardrails creates the potential for future administrations to weaponize these powers against groups on both ends of the ideological spectrum.
Even if they may never be designated as ``terrorist-supporting,'' let alone charged with a crime, nonprofits will curtail their activities as a precaution in order to avoid stigmatizing and financially devastating punishments.
That is why we strongly urge you to oppose the inclusion of H.R. 6408 in H.R. 9495.
