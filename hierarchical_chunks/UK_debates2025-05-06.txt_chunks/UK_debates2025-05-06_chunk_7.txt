I thank the Minister for his response, and I welcome all the work that he and the Secretary of State are doing in rebuilding our NHS.
However, we know that there is a capacity crisis within eye healthcare.
NHS ophthalmology continues to be the busiest and largest outpatient service.
That is essentially what is leading to many people not getting seen soon enough, which is resulting in many of them losing their sight unnecessarily.
What we need is a joined-up healthcare plan.
Will the Minister ensure that eye healthcare will be part of the Government’s wider 10-year health plan?
