Taking medicines on time is important, especially for those with conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy.
Dr Acheson, an A&E consultant who has time-critical  medicines for his own Parkinson’s disease, understands that well.
He has been running a quality improvement programme to ensure that time-critical medicines are given on time in A&E.
Will the Secretary of State lend that project his support and commit to reviewing how time-critical medicines are delivered on wards?
