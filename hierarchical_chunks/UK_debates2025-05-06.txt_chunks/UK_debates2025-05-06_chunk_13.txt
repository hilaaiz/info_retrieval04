The Secretary of State claims to support change, yet delays to NHS reorganisation, including to the promised abolition of NHS England, suggest otherwise.
Is it not the truth, as he outlined in his Guardian article, that he is bogging the system down in a slow, top-heavy restructuring, while resorting to tax rises, instead of delivering the decentralised, locally delivered, value-for-money healthcare that our constituents deserve?
A lot of words and not a lot of sense.
We are reforming the NHS and, as a result of these changes, redirecting hundreds of millions of pounds to the frontline.
What was the Conservative party’s response to the abolition?
The shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,  the hon.
Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Alex Burghart) , said it could be a “great thing”, but it “could be a total disaster”.
Will they let us know when they have made their mind up?
The Lansley reforms were implemented top down by the Conservatives.
The idea that the NHS could ever be truly independent, when it is there to serve us—the taxpayer and the general public!
Does the Secretary of State agree that it is absolutely the right decision to move funding away from the centre to the frontline to prioritise patients in the NHS’s work?
My hon.
Friend has huge experience in this area, and she is absolutely right.
What we saw under the Conservatives was bloated bureaucracy—layer upon layer of checkers, when we need more doers.
That is why frontline staff, patients and provider leaders all welcome the changes that we are making, so that we can invest more into our frontline.
