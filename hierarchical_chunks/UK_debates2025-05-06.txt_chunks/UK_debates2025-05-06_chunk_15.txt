The Health Service Journal reports that officials have acknowledged that the first draft of a high-level plan for merging NHS England and DHSC has been delayed.
When we ask any written question about the merger, the standard answer seems to be: “Ministers and senior Department officials will work with the new transformation team at the top of NHS England, led by Sir Jim Mackey, to determine the structure and requirements needed to support the creation of a new centre for health and care.”
Even when we ask a question specifically about the size of the transformation team, the answer is virtually identical.
The Government either wilfully decide not to answer, or simply do not know.
As with so many things, the Government go for the headline-grabbing announcement and talk the talk on reform, without having done the actual work to deliver it.
My question to the Secretary of State is simple: when will that first high-level plan for the merger, with a full assessment of costs and savings, be published?
Honestly, the right hon.
Member had his chance—he was the Minister who took forward the last reform Act, under the Conservative Government.
He failed in that task, and now he turns up without a shred of remorse or a shred of humility, attacking this Government for cleaning up the mess that the Conservatives left behind.
They are not a party of government—they are not even a party of opposition any more.
They are a total irrelevance.
What steps his Department is taking to implement neighbourhood health centres.
We are committed to fixing the front door of the NHS, including by delivering the primary care infrastructure required to enable a neighbourhood health service.
We have already taken steps to improve primary care infrastructure, including by providing £100 million of capital funding to upgrade GP buildings.
We will set out how we will move to a neighbourhood health service in our upcoming 10-year plan, following the spending review.
