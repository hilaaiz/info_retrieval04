I thank the shadow Minister for her constructive question.
I would be delighted to hear more about that initiative.
She is absolutely right about timely access to medicines, and through a combination of service reform and the modernisation of technology, we can assist clinicians and patients to help them to manage their medication and ensure that people get timely access to medicines.
