The Minister will be aware that a number of Iranian citizens in this country still have relatives in Iran, and it is not beyond the wit of the Iranian Government to use that pressure on them.
In requiring the citizens of Iran in this country to report to our Government if they are in any way  connected to the Iranian Government, has he taken measures to protect them from exposing their family to the pressure that the Iranian Government may put on them?
My hon.
Friend raises a very important point, and I can give him the assurances he seeks.
The Government have been very carefully considering the matter of transnational repression.
The Home Secretary and I will have more to say in the near future, but I can give him absolute assurance that we have been thinking carefully about these matters and take them incredibly seriously.
