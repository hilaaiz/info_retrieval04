I thank the hon.
Member for her extremely constructive contribution.
That is exactly why at the heart of our plans for reform and modernisation, we are placing such an emphasis on digital and technological transformation.
We have such rich data about the experiences of our patients, but we are not using it effectively enough.
If we use the information more effectively and efficiently, we can spot and identify risk much more proactively, and ensure that people get timely access to urgent care and treatment when they need it.
