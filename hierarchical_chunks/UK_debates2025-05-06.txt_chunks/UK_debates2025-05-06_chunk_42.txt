Over recent years Members have been called to this Chamber to discuss plots to commit acts of terror on Britain’s streets at the hands of the Iranian regime—but consecutive Governments are yet to proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation.
In opposition, the now Foreign Secretary said: “The IRGC is behaving like a terrorist organisation and must now be proscribed as such.”
Earlier this year I asked the Minister precisely this question: does he not agree that now is surely the time?
In his earlier remarks, he mentioned the review that has concluded.
If now is not the time for proscription, when should the House expect a further update?
The Liberal Democrats have welcomed previous sanctions against those linked to the Iranian regime.
However, I urge the Government to go a step further and look closely at whether those individuals and others with links to the regime have assets here in the UK.
Will the Minister commit to carrying out an audit, so that we know where those assets are, enabling the Government to freeze them as appropriate?
The Minister is right to reference the long-standing pattern by the Iranian intelligence service of targeting people of the Jewish faith and of Israeli nationality.
Could he update the House on any conversations he has had with the UK Jewish community leadership, specifically the Community Security Trust, about threats here in the UK?
