I thank the Minister for her answer.
Workington suffers from some really poor health outcomes and has an incredibly fragmented health system.
I have worked with local leaders in my constituency to pull together a plan for a new neighbourhood health centre called the Workington health zone, based around multidisciplinary teams, clear goals, less bureaucracy and much greater access for patients.
Does the Minister agree that this is exactly the kind of reform that we need to enable through the forthcoming 10-year plan?
