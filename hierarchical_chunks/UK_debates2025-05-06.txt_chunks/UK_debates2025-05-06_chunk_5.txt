I thank the Secretary of State for his announcement this morning regarding GP services.
One way that pressure is eased in our GP services is through charities such as Compassion in Action, which provides  non-clinical, whole-person care in my constituency.
It receives GP referrals from across Leigh and aligns with the Government’s aim to shift care from hospitals to communities.
Will the Minister join me in thanking the staff and the founder, Pam Gilligan, and agree to come for a tour of the facilities and to see at first hand the impact that they have?
