I welcome today’s announcement of new money for GPs’ surgeries, but GPs in my constituency tell me that they cannot get capital out of the integrated care board and that the Valuation Office Agency consistently undervalues the cost of rents, making future building impossible.
Will the Secretary of State agree to meet me, and GPs from my constituency, in order to understand the problem better?
