I thank the hon.
Lady for, as is always the case, the very sensible and reasonable way in which she has phrased her questions.
I am always available to discuss these matters in more detail should she wish to do so.
To her question on proscription, I hope she will acknowledge the response I gave to the shadow Minister a few moments ago.
