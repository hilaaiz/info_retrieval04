I thank the Secretary of State for that change, making the process no longer cross-party.
The Government have said that the changes will not be implemented fully until 2036.
Only this week, the Health and Social Care Committee released its new report on social care and the huge cost of inaction.
The report called for new actions that could be taken now, such as the publishing of annual assessments of unmet care needs for adults, and annual estimates of how much delayed discharges cost the NHS.
Will the Secretary of State commit to those two today?
