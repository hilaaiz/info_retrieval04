With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on the series of national security-related arrests that took place on  Saturday 3 May .
Protecting our national security is the first duty of Government, and it is a testament to our world-leading law enforcement and intelligence services that, through their tireless commitment, so many plots against the UK have been thwarted.
I pay tribute to them again today for the work that they have done not just this weekend, but in recent weeks and months, on these important operations.
