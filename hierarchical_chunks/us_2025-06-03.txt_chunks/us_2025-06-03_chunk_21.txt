communism inside and beyond Laos.
In one of the most devastating and traumatic wars in our nation's history, the Hmong people bravely fought side by side with U.S. troops resulting in 35,000 SGU casualties.
Following the Paris Peace Accords, all U.S. military personnel exited Southeast Asia in 1973, but General Vang Pao and the SGU remained.
Laos was then split into three factions, but after the city of Long Cheng fell in 1975, the communist-backed Pathet Lao seized power and retaliated against the CIA-sponsored soldiers and their families.
This forced an estimated 20,000 Hmong to flee to Thailand to avoid persecution before relocating to the United States.
This marked the first wave of the Hmong Exodus, in which over 100,000 Hmong emigrated to the U.S. between 1975 and 1997.
They settled primarily in California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
Today, the Hmong population in the United States is approximately 345,000.
The City of Fresno has the second-largest Hmong population in the country, behind only Minneapolis, with roughly 35,000 people living in the region.
To recognize their cultural, social, political, and economic contributions to the city, Mayor Jerry Dyer proclaimed May 14th as Hmong American Day in Fresno.
This day commemorates the anniversary of the final airlift that brought Hmong veterans and their families to the U.S.
It also serves a reminder to celebrate generations of Hmong Americans and their contributions in business, education, government, healthcare, and public safety.
Fresno also has the distinction of hosting the largest Hmong New Year celebration in the country, attracting over 100,000 visitors each year.
In the 115th Congress, I introduced the Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act to secure burial rights in national cemeteries for SGU veterans.
It was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 and serves as a symbol of grateful Nation for the service and loyalty of the SGU soldiers and their families.
