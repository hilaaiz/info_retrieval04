Ms. Miller oversaw the operations of Vine Transit, which serves over 600,000 passengers annually and connects Napa County to Vallejo Ferry, Amtrak, and BART.
During the 2017 Tubbs Fire, Vine Transit worked with emergency services to evacuate residents and visitors while maintaining limited bus service, earning NVTA and its partners the Bay Area Metro (Grand) Award from the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2019.
The agency later provided similar emergency response efforts during the 2020 Glass Fire.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Vine Transit also played a critical role by delivering meals to shelters and isolation sites, transporting high-risk individuals to quarantine facilities, assisting emergency staff, and ensuring access to testing and vaccination sites for those without transportation.
