Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary milestone--the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University's long-standing partnership with the Krakow University of Economics in Poland.
For five decades, these two institutions have stood as a shining example of the power and promise of international collaboration in higher education, and I could not be prouder of the great work they have achieved together.
