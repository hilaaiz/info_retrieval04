Ms. Miller is retiring, ending her 30 year career in transportation and leaving behind a lasting impact on our Napa County community and the broader Bay Area.
Born and raised in the Bay Area, 
Ms. Miller earned a Bachelor of Arts in U.S. and International Studies from the University of Washington and a Master's in Public Administration, Urban Studies, and Transportation from San Francisco State University.
