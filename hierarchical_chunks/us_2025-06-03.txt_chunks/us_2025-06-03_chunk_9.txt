Ms. Miller's leadership at NVTA has resulted in significant improvements to our Napa County's transportation infrastructure.
She led the passage of Measure U, a sales tax expected to generate $1.2 billion over 30 years for local streets and road projects.
Under her direction, NVTA completed the $56 million Soscol Junction Interchange, reducing traffic congestion and improving mobility.
She also played a key role in expanding the Napa Valley Vine Trail, securing funding, and guiding its construction from Napa to Yountville and from Calistoga to St. Helena.
