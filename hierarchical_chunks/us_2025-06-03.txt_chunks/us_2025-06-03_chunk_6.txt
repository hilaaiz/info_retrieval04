Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize International House Davis (I-House) as the organization celebrates 40 years of service.
Since its founding, I-House has helped make our Davis community a more welcoming and inclusive place by building cultural understanding and supporting international residents.
I-House was originally established in 1981 to connect International students attending UC Davis to our greater Davis community.
In 1984, the organization opened its permanent location at 10 College Park, which has since become a central space for cultural exchange, language learning, and public programming in our area.
What began as a small, volunteer-led effort has grown into a well-established nonprofit reaching thousands of people each year.
Each year, over 250 international residents participate in I-House's English language programs.
In addition, more than 2,500 individuals take part in the organization's cultural events and community programs.
These include music and dance classes, parenting groups, public speaking workshops, and the I-House World Tour, a program that features cultural traditions from around the world and partners with local organizations to deepen community ties.
After the COVID-19 pandemic, I-House reevaluated its operation norms, and decided to begin work on expanding its programming and reaching a broader cross-section of our Davis community.
The organization has since strengthened its support for immigrants, refugees, and newcomers by launching new English language offerings and volunteer-driven initiatives.
It has also added more community-led cultural programming, including classes in Persian drumming, French and Peruvian dance, and other areas that reflect the diversity of its participants.
Throughout its four decades of work, I-House Davis has remained committed to the values of community, curiosity, collaboration, culture, and belonging.
These principles are reflected in the organization's day-to-day efforts to promote civic engagement, foster cross-cultural understanding, and support individuals as they navigate life in a new place.
Whether through language instruction, cultural exchange, or shared community space, I-House has created opportunities for people from many different backgrounds to learn from one another and feel connected.
As part of its 40th anniversary, I-House has launched a community storytelling project titled ``40 Years of Stories,'' highlighting the organization's history and its continued importance to the region.
Under the leadership of Executive Director Shelly Gilbride and a dedicated staff and board, I-House Davis remains a trusted and active presence in the Davis community.
