GVSU is a pillar of our community.
Year after year, their commitment to academic excellence and innovation has led generations of students to reach their full potential.
With a dedication to fostering global understanding, GVSU has always known the importance of offering students opportunities that extend beyond our borders, and they have worked tirelessly to connect their students with experiences that broaden their global understanding.
This is why their partnership with the Krakow University of Economics is so meaningful--a true testament to their mission.
This partnership began in 1975, at a time when the United States and Poland shared more differences than they did similarities.
Still, they came together with a mission to educate, building a strong connection based on mutual respect and a shared goal of helping students grow through global learning.
Over the course of 50 years, their partnership has helped foster not only academic excellence, but cultural exchange and understanding between our two nations.
As our world becomes more interconnected than ever, this partnership continues to serve as a shining example of what can be achieved when we come together to learn and grow from each other.
On behalf of Michigan's Third Congressional District, congratulations to those at both Grand Valley State University and the Krakow University of Economics who have maintained this collaboration over the years.
This partnership has touched the lives of countless students, faculty, and communities across the globe.
Today and every day, we thank both institutions for their lasting impact on the communities they serve.
