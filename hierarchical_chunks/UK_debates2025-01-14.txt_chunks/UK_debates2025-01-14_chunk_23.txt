I thank my hon.
Friend for welcoming me and for his commitment and that of the Department to work with the nascent Syrian Government as they seek to protect and respect religious minorities.
However, I am sure that he is aware that over Christmas there were attacks by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham fighters on the Christian-majority town of Maaloula, and some reports of attacks on Alawite communities.
What more can he and his Department do to work with the Syrian  Government as they seek to build a society in which all religious communities can take part without fear of religious persecution?
