I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for mentioning the extreme need to act on what is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.
The UK has doubled its aid to Sudan.
We have sought to use the UN Security Council, as I mentioned.
We ensured through the Foreign Secretary that there was a Sudan session with G7 and Arab Quint Foreign Ministers, and the UK special representative to Sudan has visited Sudan; that occurred in December for the first time since the conflict.
