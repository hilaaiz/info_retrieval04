The word that was missing from the shadow Justice Secretary’s question just now was “sorry”.
A National Audit Office report said of the then Conservative Treasury’s investment in prison maintenance and security that “capital budget allocations for prisons have been well below the level needed.”
Who was a Treasury Minister at that time?
None other than the shadow Justice Secretary.
Today’s report is the latest chapter in a catalogue of Tory prison failures that scuppered their mission to reduce reoffending, and therefore let down victims of crime.
Will the Minister tell us about a new approach to better empower governors with the investment and the autonomy needed to properly invest in prison maintenance and security?
What investment will he make in prison officer recruitment through programmes such as Unlocked Graduates, which are critical to help drive security in our prisons?
The hon.
Member is right about the failures missing in the shadow Minister’s question.
He is also right to ask what the Government are doing to support prison officers and prison governors.
We are investing in that, and we will announce a new programme for training and developing new governors very shortly.
