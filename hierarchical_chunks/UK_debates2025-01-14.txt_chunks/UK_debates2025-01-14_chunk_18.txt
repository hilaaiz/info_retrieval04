I recognise that the hon.
Member has asked questions about proscribing the IRGC a number of times in this Chamber, and I can assure him that we are working urgently on measures to take the necessary action to deter the Iranian state from posing a threat to this country and the region.
We will continue to update the House in due course.
With the re-election of President Trump in the US, we are likely to see a return to his policy of maximum pressure to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
What is the Secretary of State’s view on that approach?
Will the Government support our allies in the United States of America?

It is regrettably true that Iran’s nuclear programme has never been more advanced, and it threatens international peace and security.
We remain determined that Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon, and we remain committed to a diplomatic solution to achieve that.

In the light of that, what steps are the Government taking to get additional medical supplies to Gaza for both Palestinians and Israeli hostages in desperate humanitarian situations?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for raising this incredibly important issue.
In December, I saw for myself in Jordan how medical aid had been blocked from entering Gaza.
As I have said before, the   position that the UK Government have articulated at every possible juncture is that restrictions on lifesaving aid must end.
The UK continues to provide core healthcare relief items, and has provided 76,000 wound care kits, 1.3 million items of medicine, and critical funding for UK-Med to run its field hospitals in Gaza.
