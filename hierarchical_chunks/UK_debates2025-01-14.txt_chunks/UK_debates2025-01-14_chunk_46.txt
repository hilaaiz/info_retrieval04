I thank the Minister for his answers today, and for his clear commitment to making changes that will make a difference.
In Northern Ireland prisons, contraband has been a difficult issue to get on top of.
Given the news today that drones are being so successfully used in the UK, there is obvious cause for concern that their use may become more prevalent.
How will the Minister ensure that the steps taken apply equally across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that any additional funding that is required will be allocated?
