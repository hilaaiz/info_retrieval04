The Minister will no doubt be pleased that the Justice Committee has just announced an inquiry into drugs in prisons, with an emphasis on the use of drones by  organised crime gangs to supply inmates.
What makes it easy for drones to access prisons is the appalling state of prison maintenance.
There is a £1.8 billion backlog, which did not accrue in the past six months.
The shadow Secretary of State’s surprise is, in itself, surprising.
What is the timetable for repairing the problems in prisons and getting to grips with that maintenance backlog?
My hon.
Friend is completely right that the prison maintenance programme that we inherited was in a state.
That is why the Chancellor announced in the Budget a £500 million boost to the prison maintenance budget over the next couple of years.
That is important.
He is right also to say that we need to grip this, which is why the Prisons Minister in the other place has visited Manchester and is regularly updated on the situation there.
