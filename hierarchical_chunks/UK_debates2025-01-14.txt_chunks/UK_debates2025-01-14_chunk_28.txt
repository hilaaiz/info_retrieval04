Can the Foreign Secretary explain why he is surrendering the Chagos Islands and front-loading payments to the Government of Mauritius to lease back a base at Diego Garcia at a cost of £9 billion to UK taxpayers?
If that is such a good deal, why is he so secretive about it?
I know that the shadow Foreign Secretary is new to the job, but I remind her that her Government did 10 rounds of negotiations on this issue and we picked it up, and that the White House, the State Department and the Pentagon believe that it is a good deal, as do the Indian Government.
Following the Foreign Secretary’s meetings in Saudi Arabia and with the new Foreign Minister of Syria over the weekend, what conditions did he stipulate for the removal of sanctions in Syria, and in what kind of timeframe?
The right hon.
Lady raises an important issue.
We will judge the new Syrian Government by their actions, not their words.
We are, alongside allies, reviewing sanctions at the moment.
I will not comment in detail on that, but we are clear that we want to see an inclusive Government who prosper.
We have been pleased with what we have seen so far, but as has already been mentioned, some of what we have seen on the ground has not been good.
We will judge them by their actions, not their words, and we will not go faster than she would expect us to.
To follow up on the previous question, I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the event that I hosted for the Syrian diaspora yesterday.
He will know that they are very keen to support their homeland to rebuild.
Will Ministers look at ways to change the sanctions to ensure that ordinary citizens can send back remittances to help rebuild crumbling public services?
