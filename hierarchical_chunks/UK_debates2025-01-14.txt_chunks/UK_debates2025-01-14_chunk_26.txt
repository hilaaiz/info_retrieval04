My hon.
Friend will be pleased that we announced a £38.5 million resilience, adaption and inclusion programme so that Nepal could deal with disaster risk.
That follows £58.5 million for climate-smart development over an eight-year programme.
Our relationship with Nepal, particularly on the climate issue, is essential and very important.
