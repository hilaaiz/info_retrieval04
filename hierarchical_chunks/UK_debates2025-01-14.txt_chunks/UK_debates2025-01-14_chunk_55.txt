Let us be blunt: the Budget has not worked.
The Chancellor says that the Government’s No. 1 mission is growth, but to date there are no signs that the Government are going to deliver it.
The national insurance contributions rise is self-defeating.
It undermines growth—it does not unleash it—and it piles pressure on to struggling small businesses and high streets.
Nor does it raise anything like the sums of money for the NHS that the Government initially suggested it would.
Now we have this much-lauded visit to China, which the Government themselves say is only worth £600 million to the UK over the next five  years.
That is equivalent to just five and a half hours of NHS spending a year—27.5 hours over the five-year period.
All growth is welcome, but this really is small beer.
What are we to make of the Chancellor’s pledge to improve existing channels with China?
It is nothing short of warm words and mixed messages.
The Chancellor should not have gone to China unless there was a commitment that Jimmy Lai was going to be released.
