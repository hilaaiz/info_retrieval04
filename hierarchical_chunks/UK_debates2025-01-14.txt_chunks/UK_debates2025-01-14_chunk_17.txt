I thank the Minister for that answer.
Clearly, we all hope that there will be a deal to release the hostages held illegally in Gaza.
Given that Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, the proxies of Iran, are on the brink of defeat, the risk to the region now is that Iran takes direct action.
As we want to see the end of the despotic regime that brutalises the people of Iran, now is the time for sanctions and the proscription of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps once and for all.
Will the Minister take the necessary action to bring that regime to its knees, so that democracy can be restored to Iran?
