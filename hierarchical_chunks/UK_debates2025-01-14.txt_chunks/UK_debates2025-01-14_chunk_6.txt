The NATO alliance stands at the cornerstone of our defence and has been essential to the security of the free world.
Given the importance of the Indo-Pacific security alliance, strengthening co-operation and dialogue with key allies in the region has been paramount, and our military base on Diego Garcia is a vital British-American strategic asset.
However, Ministers have failed to give answers to questions about its future, or about the costs involved in the proposed treaty with Mauritius.
Will the Minister give one straight answer?
Will he make a commitment to the House to wait until President Trump is in office and has had time to discuss this deal with the new Administration before finalising any agreement with Mauritius—yes or no?
The shadow Minister is right about the importance of security in the Indo-Pacific.
Indeed, when we see North Korean troops fighting in Russia and Ukraine, when we see Iranian missiles being used and when we see military companies elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region supplying Russia, it is crucial that we see global security as one.
As you know, Mr Speaker, I have answered many questions about the matter to which the hon.
Gentleman has referred.
Our deal secures the future security of the base on Diego Garcia, and it has support across the US Administration and across the United States national security apparatus.
We will come forward with details in due course.
