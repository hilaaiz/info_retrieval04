I thank the Chair of the Select Committee for that question.
I set out this Government’s fiscal rules at the Budget in October: we will pay for day-to-day spending through tax receipts, and we will get debt down as a share of the economy.
We remain committed to those fiscal rules and will meet them at all times.
