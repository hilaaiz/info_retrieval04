I thank my hon.
Friend for the question and for his long-standing work on Syria issues.
I was very glad to join him and so many inspiring members of Syrian civil society who are keen to make a contribution.
We will do what we can to enable the new Syria to be a success and to enable Syrian civil society here and across the world to play their full role in that.
