I welcome the fact that the Minister says that the UK Government want to continue working with Georgia—that is quite right—but is he aware that Jim O’Brien, the senior US State Department official, said yesterday that the relationship between the US and Georgia could be at risk and reviewed, and that financial and travel restrictions could be imposed?
Is it not the case that all that could be avoided if the Georgian Government dropped the foreign agents law, or at least amended it significantly?
