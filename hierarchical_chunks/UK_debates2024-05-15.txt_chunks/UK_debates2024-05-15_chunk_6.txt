I thank my right hon.
Friend for her point and for her work in this area.
We are delivering on the Buckland review, and all ministerial Departments are signing up to Disability Confident, progressing to Disability Confident leader status and having evidence independently validated on that work.
Arm’s length bodies are also signing up to Disability Confident, and we are working with parent Departments to encourage more of them to do the same.
One in 10 senior civil servants declare themselves to be disabled, and since 2013 the proportion of civil servants with a disability has increased to 16.8%.
