Research shows that one in 10 women with menopausal symptoms have left work due to a lack of support.
In some cases, this will have been due to discrimination.
Women experiencing menopause know that this is because of their age and sex, but the law does not protect them on that combined basis.
Why not?
The Equality Act 2010 already protects women on the basis of sex, age and disability.
It is this Government who are changing the experience of menopause by rolling out women’s health hubs in every integrated care board across England, so that women can access menopause support.
We also have our hormone replacement therapy prepayment certificate, which is available for just under £20 a year for women to get all their HRT prescriptions.
Over half a million women in England have bought one of those certificates.
