I thank the hon.
Lady for raising the case.
As she knows, the Department for Education has provided extensive support and funding to all those schools that have RAAC, which in the end was less than 1% of all schools that could have been affected.
More generally, there is the very significant amount we are investing in school rebuilding and maintenance.
I am sure the Education Secretary will have heard her concerns and will write to her in due course.
