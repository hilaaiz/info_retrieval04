I thank my hon.
Friend for rightly championing the views of his constituents on this important topic.
Network operators must follow legal obligations when deploying their networks and Ofcom can, in fact, investigate reports of failure to follow those obligations.
I know that the Minister for Data and Digital Infrastructure, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Julia Lopez) , met representatives of the sector and Ofcom recently to raise concerns about reports of poor pole siting and asked operators to share infrastructure, and I will ask her specifically to give my hon.
Friend a more detailed update.
