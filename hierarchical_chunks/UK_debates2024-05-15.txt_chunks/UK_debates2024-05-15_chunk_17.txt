I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
There are various reasons why women and men should be able to access single-sex spaces, and public toilets are no exception.
We are updating building regulations so that toilets in non-domestic buildings offer safety, privacy and dignity for all people who use them.
There is often confusion between gender-neutral toilets and unisex toilets.
We support unisex toilets, but through these new building regulations we are trying to get rid of toilets and bathrooms where men and women share the same space.
