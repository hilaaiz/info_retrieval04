I congratulate  the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)  on securing this important urgent question.
The brutalisation of peaceful, ordinary Georgians and the hospitalisation of opposition leader David Katsarava are utterly shameful.
Can the Minister assure us that he will protest directly to the Georgian Government and call in the ambassador regarding the abuses of the public that we are seeing on our screens daily?
On Ukraine, the fall of Avdiivka at the start of this year was the shameful result of allied inaction on getting Ukraine what it needed.
That falls on us.
We cannot now see the same take place in Kharkiv, which is under assault for the reasons set out already in this discussion.
Can the Minister please assure us that sufficient ammunition is reaching the frontline now and update us on what we are doing to procure sufficient artillery shells?
Ukraine, as ever, needs us to give it enough to win and not just to survive.
We of course express our concerns about the direction of travel with regard to protest in Georgia.
I know that the Foreign Office has made representations to the ambassador here and will continue to keep a watching brief on that issue.
My hon.
Friend asks about Kharkiv.
Of course, ammunition supply is a central component of our effort, both politically and in terms of what we are gifting and sourcing.
We have given over 300,000 units of ammunition.
However, we acknowledge that we must all, in the coalition of friendly western nations, mobilise to a far greater degree.
That is why we think that initiatives coming from the Czech side and across all European and NATO partners are important.
We must strain every sinew to ensure that the flow continues.
