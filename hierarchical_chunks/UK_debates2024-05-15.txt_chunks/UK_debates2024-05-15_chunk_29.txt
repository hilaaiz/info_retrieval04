When adult rape cases take two years, on average, to complete, it is no wonder that 62% of all rape survivors drop out of the process.
Given that just 2.5% of rapes recorded last year resulted in a charge and fewer still will end in conviction, it is no wonder that the Victims’ Commissioner, Rape Crisis and others have argued that rape has been effectively decriminalised in this country.
Is the Prime Minister not ashamed that, because of his Government’s failings, victims and survivors are being put through a living hell in our criminal justice system?
While it is right that the hon.
Lady raises this incredibly important topic, I completely disagree with her characterisation of how this Government have treated it.
It is actually this Government who previously introduced the rape review action plan, which is now showing significant improvements in how we treat rape, end to end, through the criminal justice system.
Violence against women and girls is now a strategic policing requirement for the first time ever.
We have rolled out Operation Soteria, so that police forces have the expertise that they need.
We have actually quadrupled funding for victim support, with more independent domestic sexual violence advisers.
There is new 24/7 support for victims.
We have ended the digital strip search and provided pre-trial cross-examination.
All of that has meant improvement to the process, and we have seen an increase in the average sentence for rape by a third since Labour was last in office—and by the way, Mr Speaker, we did that using a power that the hon.
Lady’s party voted against.
(Urgent Question): To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on Russia’s aggression relating to Ukraine and the situation in Georgia.
We are on day 811 of Putin’s so-called special military operation—an operation that was supposed to last for three days—and he has failed in all of his objectives.
The conflict is, of course, evolving and challenging.
Russia’s newly formed northern grouping of forces has attacked Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, taking control of several villages.
By opening up an additional axis of attack, Russia is almost certainly attempting to divert Ukrainian resources away from other parts of the frontline and to threaten Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine.
We will not be diverted from our commitment to providing Ukraine with the support that it needs to prevail—because Ukraine will prevail.
In April, the Prime Minister announced our largest-ever and most comprehensive package of equipment from the United Kingdom, including equipment relating to long-range strike, air defence, artillery, reconnaissance, protected mobility, development of Ukraine’s navy, airfield enablement, and munitions to support the introduction of the F-16.
