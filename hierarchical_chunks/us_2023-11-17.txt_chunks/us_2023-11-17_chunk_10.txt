Mrs. Lipman's tireless efforts to serve her district earned her induction into the New Jersey's ``Women's Hall of Fame'' in 1998.
Today, her legacy is supported throughout the area.
There is the Wynona Lipman Ethnic Studies Center at Kean University, the Wynona Lipman Chairholder at the Center for American Women in Politics and Rutgers University, the Wynona Lipman Child Advocacy Center (known as Wynona's House) for abused children in Newark, and the future Wynona Lipman Courthouse in Essex County.
Next week, there will be an exhibit titled ``Stronger than Steel: The Wynona Lipman Story'' at the New Jersey Historical Society.
