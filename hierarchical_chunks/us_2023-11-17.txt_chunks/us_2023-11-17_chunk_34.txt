Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Porterville Elks Lodge on their 100-year anniversary and thank them for their significant contributions to the Porterville community.
The Porterville Elks Lodge was established in 1923 on Porterville's Main Street.
For more than a century, the lodge has served as a meeting place for residents of the community and the home of the Porterville Elks Lodge Club.
The club's unwavering commitment to public service and the Porterville community has guided its mission since the lodge's founding.
Today, the club has 149 members, all of whom dedicate their time to giving back to and investing in the local community.
The club is passionate about the well-being of Porterville's residents and focuses many of their efforts on helping children and veterans Last year, the club raised more than $32,000 for the Purple Pig Major Project--the second-largest contribution from the California delegation the medical treatments and therapies they need to thrive.
Through their affiliation with the Elks National Foundation, the Porterville Elks Lodge Club has also awarded students throughout the community with scholarships to support their academic goals and connected veterans and servicemembers with rehabilitation services.
During the recent flooding in California, the Porterville Elks Lodge Club worked with the Central California Family Crisis Center and Parenting Network to donate jackets, baby formula, and other items to residents in need.
Their efforts were critical in helping families in my district recover from the devastating storms.
The club's longstanding history of service is ingrained in the fabric of the Porterville community.
