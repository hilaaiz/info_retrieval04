Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, November 19, 2023 marks the one year anniversary of a violent attack in Colorado Springs killing five people and injuring 22 others.
I would like to once again extend my prayers of peace and healing for the families and victims.
During the incident, two heroes took action that night to prevent further harm and should be honored for their heroic acts.
Richard Fierro and Thomas James stepped up at their own peril to save lives and protect others.
The two heroes worked together to stop the gunman and remove the firearm from him, 
Mr. James even incurred injuries when a bullet was fired into his abdomen.
Because of the decisive, quick, and selfless action of these two men, more lives were not taken by the attacker.
This is the true spirit of selflessness and duty that we are privileged to experience so commonly in Colorado Springs.
Information Technician 2nd
Class Thomas James was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest non-combat decoration the Navy can award for heroism.
Richard Fierro, a retired Army Major, received the Lifesaving Military Hero of The Year Award from the American Red Cross.
May we all remember their actions to save the lives of others and thank them for their service to our Nation and community on the anniversary of this terrible event.
