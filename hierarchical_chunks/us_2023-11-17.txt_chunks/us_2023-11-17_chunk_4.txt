H.R. 5894 prohibits funding to Planned Parenthood, eliminates funding for Title X Family Planning, and makes a $35 million cut to the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant.
Supporting our children and families is the bare minimum of what our government should do for its people.
This bill fails at every level to do so.
Instead of reevaluating their extreme funding bills and working together with Democrats to create legislation that will improve American lives, House Republicans are distracted by their own chaos and are intent on placating the most extreme in their caucus.
For these reasons and more, I must oppose H.R. 5894 and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
