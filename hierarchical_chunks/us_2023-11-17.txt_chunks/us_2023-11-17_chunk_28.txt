to train and educate the next generation of musicians, 830 school districts, including Kiski Area School District, were recognized for the outstanding efforts of their teachers, administrators, parents, and students.
According to NAMM, over 3 million children did not have access to proper music education in 2019.
Every student deserves a chance to learn and develop their artistic capabilities, and Kiski Area School District's continuous efforts undoubtedly help our children in Southwest Pennsylvania.
