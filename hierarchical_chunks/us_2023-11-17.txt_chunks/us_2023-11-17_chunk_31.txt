Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mount Pleasant Area School District for being recognized by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM) Foundation as one of the best communities for music education in 2023.
The NAMM Foundation celebrates schools and school districts by recognizing their ability to train and educate the next generation of musicians.
830 school districts, including Mount Pleasant Area School District, were recognized for the outstanding efforts of their teachers, administrators, parents, and students.
According to NAMM, over 3 million children did not have access to proper music education in 2019.
Every student deserves a chance to learn and develop their artistic capabilities, and Mount Pleasant Area School District's continuous efforts undoubtedly help our children in Southwest Pennsylvania.
