Mr. PAYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a great trailblazer from my district, Wynona Lipman, on what would have been her 100th birthday.
Born in 1923, 
Mrs. Lipman was the first AfricanAmerican woman to be elected to the New Jersey State Senate when she won her seat in 1971.
She served the 29th Legislative District for 27 years, the Senate's longest-serving member at the time of her death in 1999.
Before she was a political trailblazer, 
Mrs. Lipman was a teacher.
She taught French at Morehouse College and tutored a famous civil rights advocate, Martin Luther King, Jr.
She left that position to pursue a Ph.D. degree at Columbia University.
During her time at Columbia, 
Mrs. Lipman earned a Fulbright fellowship to study at the Sorbonne in Paris for two years.
When she returned, 
Mrs. Lipman finished her Ph.D. degree and eventually moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where she became an associate professor at Essex County College.
In Montclair, 
Mrs. Lipman became active in local politics.
In 1968, she won her first election to become an Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholder, where she became President of the Board in 1971.
Then Mrs. Lipman ran for the New Jersey State Senate and defeated Republican
