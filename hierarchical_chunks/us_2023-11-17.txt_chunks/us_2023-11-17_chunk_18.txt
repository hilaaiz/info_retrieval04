Mr. VASQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tierra del Sol Housing Corporation and commemorate their 50th anniversary.
Tierra del Sol has proudly been serving the needs of low-income families in my district since 1973 and has promoted economic and social empowerment through homeownership programs, employment training, and access to financial resources.
Their work has helped ensure financial security for New Mexican families and build stable communities where all can thrive.
Throughout their 50 years of service, Tierra del Sol has instituted various programs to assist rural New Mexicans.
From rural farm rental housing to supportive housing for the elderly to major subdivision developments, Tierra del Sol Housing Corporation has tirelessly worked towards their mission.
In recent years, Tierra del Sol has led the construction of singlefamily housing under their self-help housing program.
That recent construction has allowed community members access to affordable housing and energy-efficient living, putting New Mexico well on the road to becoming a leader in clean energy practices.
As we look to the future, I am confident that Tierra del Sol will continue to find innovative ways to reach out to New Mexicans, while promoting the health of our State more broadly.
On behalf of the great people of New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, I thank Tierra del Sol for their service to the people of New Mexico and congratulate them on celebrating 50 years of service.
Their work has made our community stronger, safer, and more prosperous, and I am excited to see what they accomplish for generations to come.
