faithful community that stands as a testament to the Orthodox tradition's rich history and enduring presence in America.
Their commitment to faith, service, and fellowship reflects the very values His All-Holiness has championed throughout his ministry.
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District of Virginia, I welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington and extend deep gratitude for his lifelong dedication to promoting peace, unity, and justice in our world.
