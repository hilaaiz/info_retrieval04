community a nourishing environment with personal and professional support.
The goals of the UASC Tryzub align with preserving history, culture, tradition, and Ukrainian sport (specifically professional soccer).
Their home-base in Horsham township continues to be a center where the community comes together.
Some notable achievements of the UASC Tryzub include in 1856 the Club's Majors' Division soccer team reached the national championship game for the coveted US Amateur Cup.
A year later the UASC Tryzub organized a professional soccer franchise; the Philadelphia Ukrainian Nationals, which generated many professional championships onto the City.
These achievements, along with many others, brought a downpour of glory and attention to Philadelphia from the international soccer world.
Today, 56 teams and 800 athletes, known as the ``Ukie Nation'' proudly wear blue and yellow and play under the Philadelphia Ukrainian Nationals Banner.
Travel and club teams, including all skill levels, are offered for boys and girls all year round.
The UASC Tryzub is not only notable for their achievements, but for giving back to the community.
The players develop and improve not only their soccer skills but their personal goals as well.
Through scholarships, volunteering, and community efforts to preserve Ukrainian heritage and bring awareness to those in need, the Tryzub continues to support and grow the Ukrainian American community.
In times of need, their service is a testament to the belief that an individual's dedication can ripple through the lives of many, sparking change, fostering resilience, and inspiring hope.
Today, we honor the UASC Tryzub not just for their remarkable deeds but for fostering an incredible community.
