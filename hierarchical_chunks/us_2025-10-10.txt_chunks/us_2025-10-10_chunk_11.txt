Mr. Speaker, I commend the Christian Embassy for 50 years of steadfast service to our leaders and our Nation, but mainly Christian Embassy's service to the Lord Jesus Christ.
As we mark this milestone, we give thanks for the countless lives touched by this ministry and for its continuing mission to honor God and serve those who serve others.
