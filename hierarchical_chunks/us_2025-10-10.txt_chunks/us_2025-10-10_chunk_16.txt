Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Special Olympics Virginia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run as they celebrate 40 years developmental disabilities.
For four decades, Special Olympics Virginia has provided year-round sports training and competition to thousands of athletes, empowering them to achieve their personal best while fostering inclusion, respect, and community engagement.
Through these programs, athletes not only develop athletic skills but also gain confidence, leadership abilities, and lifelong friendships.
The Law Enforcement Torch Run exemplifies the incredible partnership between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.
Officers across Virginia have carried the Flame of Hope, raising awareness and vital funds to support Special Olympics programs.
This collaboration has helped break down barriers, build trust, and promote understanding for individuals with disabilities.
As we celebrate this milestone, we recognize the dedication of athletes, coaches, volunteers, and law enforcement officers whose commitment has transformed the lives of countless Virginians.
The legacy of Special Olympics Virginia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run is one of inclusion, compassion, and unwavering support for every athlete's potential.
I congratulate the Special Olympics Virginia and the Law Enforcement Torch Run on 40 years of service and in celebrating their continued impact on communities throughout our Commonwealth.
