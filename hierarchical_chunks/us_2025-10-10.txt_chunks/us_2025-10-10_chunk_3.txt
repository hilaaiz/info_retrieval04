Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colorado Legal Services on its 100th anniversary and to honor its enduring commitment to justice for all Coloradans.
Founded as the Legal Aid Society of Denver in February 1925, Colorado Legal Services has been a lifeline for low-income individuals and seniors in every county across our state--providing free, high-quality civil legal assistance to those who need it most.
As a former trial attorney, I understand how critical legal representation can be when everything is at stake.
Whether it's helping someone keep their home, secure child support, access health care, or find safety from abuse, Colorado Legal Services delivers life-changing support that strengthens families and communities across our state.
Their work extends far beyond the courtroom--offering clients the stability, emotional support, and community resources they need to move forward.
In August of this year alone, Colorado Legal Services opened nearly a thousand new cases to help Coloradans facing housing insecurity, domestic violence, and other urgent challenges.
That's the kind of quiet, vital work that keeps our communities strong and resilient.
I want to congratulate Colorado Legal Services on a century of unwavering service and express my deepest gratitude to its staff, volunteers, and supporters for their tireless dedication to equal justice under the law.
