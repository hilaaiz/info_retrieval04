Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Franklin County's 150th Anniversary.
We stand on the proud shoulder of 150 years of history, celebrating the founding of Franklin County in 1875.
Franklin County is a vibrant and resilient community, rich with heritage and heart.
Named for Benjamin C. Franklin, the first judicial officer of the Republic of Texas, the county has always stood for justice, independence, and perseverance.
From early state settlers to the citizens of today, Franklin County has been shaped by hard work, strong values, and deep roots.
With scenic lakes, thriving agriculture, and local legends, Franklin County is a lot more than a pinpoint on a map.
It is a community worth celebrating.
The many days I have spent in Franklin County have been filled with incredible people who lead with service and compassion, and world-famous, East Texas hospitality.
The county has balanced tradition and growth, by strengthening the community and promoting new economic development.
As we honor the past, we look forward to a future filled with promise.
Here's to the next 150 years.
May it continue to grow, inspire and shine as a beacon.
It is an honor to represent this community in Washington.
God Bless Franklin County.
