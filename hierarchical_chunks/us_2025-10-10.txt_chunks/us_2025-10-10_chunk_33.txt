Mr. Speaker, their actions remind us that progress is not forged in grand gestures but in the cumulative power of selfless acts.
They embody the timeless American values of resilience, generosity, and compassion, showing us that the future is built by those who care deeply, act decisively, and give without hesitation.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional District, I extend my appreciation and recognition to the UASC Tryzub for their extraordinary service of 75 years.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the UASC Tryzub's 75th anniversary, which will inspire generations to come.
May their example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to make our communities, country, and world a better place.
