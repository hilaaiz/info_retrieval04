Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shineforth, formerly known as UMFS, on the occasion of its 125th anniversary of service to children, families, and communities across Virginia.
Founded in 1900 as the Virginia Conference Orphanage, the organization has evolved over the past century to meet the changing needs of vulnerable children and families.
From its earliest days, providing care and shelter for orphans, to its transformation into United Methodist Family Services, and now as Shineforth, the organization has remained steadfast in its mission: to create a world where all children can belong and thrive.
Over the past 125 years, Shineforth has pioneered innovative services for children in foster care, those with special education needs, and youth facing behavioral health challenges.
Its programs, including foster care and adoption services, residential treatment, communitybased support, and the Charterhouse School, have become a model of compassion, resilience, and evidence-based care.
What has not changed is Shineforth's unwavering belief in the worth and dignity of every child.
Generations of families in Virginia have been strengthened because of the care, advocacy, and vision provided by this organization and its dedicated staff, volunteers, and supporters.
As Shineforth celebrates this remarkable milestone, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 125 years of transformative service.
May the next century of Shineforth's work continue to light the way forward for children and families in Virginia and beyond.
