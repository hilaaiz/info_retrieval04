Mr. WALBERG.
Mr. Speaker, it is my special privilege to recognize Dave Welihan of Jackson as the Veteran of the Month for October and honor him for his distinguished service to our great Nation.
Dave courageously served in the U.S. Army from 1971 through 1974 and has been honorably awarded the National Defense Service Medal.
Since returning home, Dave has dedicated his life to serving the veteran community and ensuring they have the resources and support they deserve.
He was formerly a Veteran Service Officer in Jackson, where he helped those who have worn the uniform resolve their local, state, and federal benefit issues to ensure that they receive the benefits they have so rightfully earned.
He also served as a commander of the American Legion Richard F. Smith Post 29 and worked as the Director of the Jackson County Veterans Affairs Office.
While with the Jackson County VA, Dave helped coordinate the burial of five unclaimed veterans so that they could be honored and properly laid to rest, exemplifying his compassion for others.
Dave and his wife even selflessly donated the flags used for the burial.
Dave's unwavering service, tireless commitment, and leadership have made a tangible difference.
Through his many roles and daily actions, he has uplifted and advocated for his fellow veterans, serving as a guide, mentor, and friend.
His legacy will not only live on in the hearts of those he has helped but also in the strong community he has helped build.
May others know of my high regard for Dave, as well as my deep gratitude for his lasting contributions to the county we love.
