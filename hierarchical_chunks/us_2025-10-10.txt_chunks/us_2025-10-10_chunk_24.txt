Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join the Bensalem Township School District, the People of the 1st Congressional District of Pennsylvania, and the United States Marine Corps in congratulating Master Sergeant Shawn Worthen on this outstanding achievement.
His dedication to his students and to the ideals of service and leadership brings great credit to himself, his school, and our Nation.
