Mr. Pieratt was a loyal supporter of the University.
He served on many boards and community organizations across Kentucky where his leadership was widely respected.
He and his wife Patsy had three daughters, Nicole, Noel, and Nalise, and eight grandchildren.
In a life filled with great accomplishments, he was most proud of his family.
A patriotic American, a respected community leader, a family man, and a true friend to many, he touched countless lives.
I am honored to call Brigadier General Bruce Pieratt my friend and to lift up his life before the House.
