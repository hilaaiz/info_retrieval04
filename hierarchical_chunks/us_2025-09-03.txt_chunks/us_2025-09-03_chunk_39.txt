Mr. Barajas lives in South Park with his wife, Leticia Barajas, and is the proud father of four children, Xochitl, Analilia, Graciela, and Salvador Jr., all graduates of California universities.
I am proud to honor Salvador Barajas as the 52nd Congressional District Constituent of the Month for August 2025.
His work has inspired our community and will empower generations to come.
