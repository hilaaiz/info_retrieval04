Mr. Murray has optimistically taken on incredibly challenging issues ranging from fostering opportunities for young talent to promoting infrastructure, internet access, healthcare, and housing developments.
Outside his work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development, Murray has served on the St. Lawrence County Planning Board for over 12 years, recently as the chairman, and is active in his local fire department, serving as an interior firefighter and as a member of the rescue squad.
His commitment to serving his community outside of his professional life demonstrates his remarkable and genuine dedication to improving New York's rural communities.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, I would like to thank and honor Brian Murray for his efforts to enhance the quality of life for members of New York's rural communities.
His dedication to public service is truly admirable and has made a lasting impact that will continue to benefit New Yorkers for years to come.
