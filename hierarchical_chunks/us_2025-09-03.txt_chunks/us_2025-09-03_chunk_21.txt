Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Robert and Linda McNeill on the occasion of their 25th wedding anniversary.
It is with great pleasure and excitement that I share this wonderful news.
Robert, a man of integrity, loyalty, and strength, has devoted his life to family and loved ones.
Linda, a kind and graceful soul, treasures her family values and cherishes every moment with those dearest to her.
Fate brought Robert and his beautiful wife, Linda, together at the Curwood festival in Owosso, Michigan.
In a serendipitous moment, as he picked her up, their eyes locked, and their lifelong love began.
Robert and Linda's story reached a cherished milestone on September 23, 2000, when they were united in marriage.
Since then, they have raised three sons together and have continued to grow not just as individuals, but also as partners in life.
Love and marriage represent the joining of two hearts and lives, built on a foundation of trust, respect, and shared dreams.
Robert and Linda embody the promise to stand together through life's joys and challenges, growing stronger as individuals and as partners.
Their love story is a testament to the beauty of finding someone who not only inspires you but also walks beside you every step of the way.
