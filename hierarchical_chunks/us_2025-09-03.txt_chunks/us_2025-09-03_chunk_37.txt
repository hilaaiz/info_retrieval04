Mr. Barajas first became involved with Chicano Park in 1973.
Since then, he has been a driving force in the creation, restoration, and preservation of its murals, negotiating with Caltrans to protect the park's cultural heritage.
Accordingly, he served as the Lead Artist for the Historical Mural Restoration Project.
