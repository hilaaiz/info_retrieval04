Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the East Jordan Area Chamber of Commerce for its continued leadership in hosting the 2025 Portside Art Fair, one of Northern Michigan's most prestigious and long-standing artistic traditions.
Founded in August 1962, the Portside Art Fair was the vision of a dedicated group of East Jordan residents who believed their community was the ideal setting for local artists to share their work with the public.
What began with just 30 participants has now grown to its full capacity of 75, reflecting not only the fair's increasing popularity but also the vibrant creativity it continues to inspire.
Held along the beautiful shores of Lake Charlevoix, the Portside Art Fair honors the deep connection between our region's natural beauty and the inspiration it provides to artists.
It showcases the work of established and emerging artists from East Jordan and throughout Northern Michigan.
Each year, a qualified judge in the visual arts carefully selects standout pieces to be honored with inclusion in the prestigious Cygred Riley Gallery at Elm Point.
The standards for recognition at the Portside Art Fair are high, and the quality of submissions reflects the extraordinary talent of our local artists.
The fair serves as a powerful reminder of the important role that the arts play in strengthening our communities, inspiring future generations, and celebrating the unique character of Northern Michigan.
