I thank my right hon.
Friend for his answer, which is reassuring news, because Skelton Primary is a very good school but it is in need of a comprehensive rebuild.
The headteacher, Mrs Walker, worked through last summer in the expectation that the rebuild could begin as soon as this Easter, but that has not happened, because the builders came back saying that more money was required.
Will my right hon.
Friend assure me that that date of the end of the summer is now fixed?
Will it be possible for me to meet the civil service team in charge to discuss this with them further?
