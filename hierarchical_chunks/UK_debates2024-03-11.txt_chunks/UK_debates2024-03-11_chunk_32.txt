I thank the Minister for his answers to the questions posed to him.
There can be no doubt that the Government must do more to increase defence spending, given that a large portion of our defence budget has rightly been spent on assisting Ukraine.
However, we must ensure that other issues are not left behind.
Unfortunately, there was no mention in last week’s Budget of an additional funding increase for our armed forces.
Will the Minister increase our defence budget, so that we can ensure that our actions speak louder than words, and so that promises are kept, and our armed forces can keep us safe?
