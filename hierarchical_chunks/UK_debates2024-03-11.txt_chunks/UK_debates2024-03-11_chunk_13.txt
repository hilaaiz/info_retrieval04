High-quality early years education can be transformational for children with special educational needs, helping to ensure that they are identified and supported at the most important time for their development, but last year fewer than one in five local authorities in England reported having enough childcare places for disabled children.
That is a shameful failure.
Is the Minister confident that families with a disabled child will be able to access the childcare to which they are entitled from April?
We are doing two things in this regard.
First, we are reviewing the special educational needs inclusion fund as we roll out the new entitlements to ensure that it is working appropriately.
Secondly, we have provided a contractor.
Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide places for all children, including those with special educational needs, and the contractor will work with local authorities to ensure that is done.
If she will issue statutory guidance on teaching economic education in schools as part of the PSHE curriculum.
It is essential that young people are equipped to make important financial decisions later in life.
My hon.
Friend will recall our curriculum reforms, and the national curriculum for mathematics and secondary citizenship equips pupils with the essential knowledge, understanding and practical skills needed to manage their money.
