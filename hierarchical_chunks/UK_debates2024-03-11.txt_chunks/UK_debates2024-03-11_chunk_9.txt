I absolutely agree that tutoring is important in multiple contexts.
In particular, in the years since the pandemic it has played an essential part.
I will add that tutoring by undergraduates can help to introduce a wider range of people to the potential of a career in teaching.
I want tutoring to continue.
As my hon.
Friend rightly mentions, part of the function of the pupil premium is to make such interventions and it can be spent on them.
A teacher in Frome recently reached out and told me that too few pupils are successful in their education, health and care plan applications.
Without a plan and the accompanying support for children’s life chances, they are diminished.
Can the Minister reassure my constituents that the Government’s plans to reform the EHCP will still ensure that children receive care that is personalised to their needs and not a one-size-fits-all approach to cut costs?
I absolutely and wholeheartedly agree with the hon.
Lady on the central importance of that support and how vital it is to have it.
There are, of course, many more EHCPs than there were statements under the old system, with more children receiving  support.
She will understand that I cannot comment on the individual case she mentions, but I will mention the special educational needs and disabilities and alternative provision improvement plan that we have in place.
