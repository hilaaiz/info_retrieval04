I thank my hon.
Friend for his support at the recent parliamentary apprenticeship fair.
Importantly, our apprenticeship programme is future focused.
It includes a new battery manufacturing technician apprenticeship, which will benefit electric buses, and others including charging point installation and electric vehicle maintenance.
Whether through T-levels, higher technical qualifications or apprenticeships, there are more training opportunities in industries of the future than ever before, in everything from AI to net zero.
