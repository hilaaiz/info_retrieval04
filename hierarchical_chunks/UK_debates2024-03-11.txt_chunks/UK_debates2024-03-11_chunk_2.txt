I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for his question.
Arthur Balfour was a great man and identified the need for a homeland for British Jews.
That is why antisemites do not like him and are slashing his picture.
I and the Secretary of State are spending a lot of time with Jewish student groups.
I have been to Leeds University to spend time with Jewish students, because the chaplain there was attacked, and we are working with Universities UK.
We have announced a £7 million package to give to Jewish student groups, including the University Jewish Chaplaincy, to try to stop antisemitism on campus.
We are also developing a quality seal that we will ask universities to adopt, so that they deal properly with antisemitic incidents.
Last week, I and the Secretary of State had a meeting with the Office for Students, to make clear to the regulator that antisemitism across our universities is not acceptable.
