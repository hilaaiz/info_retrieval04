The Secretary of State was asked— What steps her Department is taking to help increase the number of occupations for which apprenticeships are available.
What steps her Department is taking to help increase the number of occupations for which apprenticeships are available.
I join you in your comments, Mr Speaker.
My thoughts are with the family of Tommy McAvoy.
Thanks to this Conservative Government, nearly 70% of all occupations are accessible via an apprenticeship.
That is a far greater reach than countries admired for their technical education such as Germany and Switzerland.
I am sure that many Members joined the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and more than 60 ministerial colleagues out and about during National Apprenticeship Week.
I was delighted to join Harry, Chloe and other EDF Energy apprentices off the coast of Blyth, as well as apprentices who are launching exciting careers at J.P. Morgan in the City.
Apprenticeships are the route to a successful career, no matter where apprentices live or what they want to do.
