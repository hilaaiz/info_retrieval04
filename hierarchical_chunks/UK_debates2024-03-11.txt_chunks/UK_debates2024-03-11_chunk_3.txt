Before we proceed to questions, I regret to inform the House of the death of former Member Lord McAvoy.
Tommy represented his home town of Rutherglen from 1987 until he received his peerage in 2010.
He was a highly respected colleague and the longest serving Government Whip of recent times, with more than 13 years of service.
He will be sadly missed.
The thoughts of the whole House are with his family and friends.
