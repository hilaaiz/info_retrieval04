The Minister will be aware that private equity firms have been causing great damage in other parts of the education sector, such as children’s homes and special schools, but we are now starting to see this in childcare.
Oakley Capital has acquired Lilliput nursery in Hersham and Elmbridge, and has hiked up prices by a staggering 25%; that is an additional £365 per child per month, which parents simply cannot afford.
Does he agree that it is quite wrong for private equity firms to be making these eye-watering profits on the backs of hard-working parents?
What is he going to do to stop this happening?
The hon.
Lady is right to raise the issue of profiteering that we have seen in some areas of children’s care and social care.
We will be setting out some steps that we will be taking on that shortly.
I do not know the specifics of the case she has just referenced, but, again, if she writes to me, I will be happy to look at it.
What progress her Department has made on rebuilding Skelton Primary School in Cleveland.
Skelton Primary School was announced in the second round of the school rebuilding programme in July 2021.
It is the second school in a batch being delivered by the contractor  Tilbury Douglas.
We therefore expect construction work on this complete new build to begin in late summer and complete next year.
