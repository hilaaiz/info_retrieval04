The Secretary of State loves plans.
What is her plan to reinvigorate and change the course of Ofsted?
I was delighted to attend the Association of School and College Leaders conference alongside Sir Martyn Oliver, who announced the Big Listen, which is part of making sure that we get the cultural reforms required.
I am concerned by reports that some teachers and headteachers feel that they are not listened to or are treated in a dismissive or rude manner.
I hope everybody will engage fully with the Big Listen, because I think we need to make sure that Ofsted is respectful, and treats our service, and our teachers and headteachers, with respect.
At Cambridge University, a barbaric vandal wearing a £1,000 Mulberry backpack was so full of hate for Jews that she felt Lord Balfour’s letter of 1917 gave her the moral superiority to destroy a valuable and historic painting of him.
This shines a light on the pernicious atmosphere faced by Jewish students at universities across the country, with calls for “Zionists off our campus” now shamefully normalised, and “Zionists” really meaning Jews.
What steps does my right hon.
Friend propose to take to convey to university heads that they have a legal and a moral obligation to stamp out antisemitism?
