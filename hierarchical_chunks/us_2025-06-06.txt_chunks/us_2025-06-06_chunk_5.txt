Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Michelle and Dan King for their dedicated ministry and unwavering commitment to serving the Vicksburg community through New Beginnings Ministry of Vicksburg Training and Equipping Center.
Since assuming leadership of the church in 2014, Michelle and Dan King have worked tirelessly to fulfill their mission of training and equipping followers of Christ, ensuring they are prepared for outreach and service.
Their approach extends beyond the pulpit--they seek to empower individuals with the knowledge, faith, and tools needed to carry God's message into the world.
Michelle King not only ministers within the church but also serves as a hospice chaplain, providing comfort and spiritual guidance to those facing life's most challenging moments.
She further extends her ministry through a weekly Facebook Live lunchtime sermon, offering encouragement and faith-based teachings to a broader audience.
In addition to their spiritual work, the Kings have made a tangible impact in the community through God's Storehouse, a food distribution ministry that provides essential nourishment to families in need.
Their dedication to service has brought hope and relief to many, reinforcing the foundational Christian principles of compassion and generosity.
Michelle's journey of faith is a testament to the transformative power of belief and perseverance.
Though not raised in the church, she found her calling later in life and has since committed herself fully to guiding others on their own spiritual paths.
