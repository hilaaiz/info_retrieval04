Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Greg Murphy, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of North America's largest steel producer and recycler, Nucor Corporation.
Tomorrow, June 7, 2025, Greg will retire from Nucor after serving the past decade as head of the company's legal department and overseeing Nucor's public affairs, communications, and environmental functions.
A native of Western New York, Greg spent his career in Charlotte after receiving his undergraduate degree from Canisius College and law degree from the University.
Greg had the honor of clerking for one of North Carolina's most well-known federal judges, the Honorable James McMillan, followed by a quarter century practicing law with Moore & Van Allen, where Greg led the Litigation Practice Group and served on the Executive Committee.
Greg's success would not have been possible without the love and support of his wife, Marcy, and their children, Sean and Alexandra.
In addition to enjoying time with family, golf will play a prominent role in Greg's retirement.
He is not only an avid golfer, but Greg was also once named the Southern Piedmont Conference Golf Coach of the Year, another accomplishment showing his dedication to the things he loves.
