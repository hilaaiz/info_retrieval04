Mr. Speaker, Gerald ``Jerry'' Danforth's life was defined by service, leadership, and love.
He exemplified the highest ideals of his people and of this Nation.
His legacy will endure in the lives he touched, the institutions he shaped, and the Nation he served so faithfully.
I offer my deepest condolences to his family, his community, and the entire Oneida nation.
May his memory be a blessing.
