Mr. MESSMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 200th anniversary of the Log Inn, a Gibson County landmark located on the outskirts of Haubstadt, just north of Evansville, Indiana.
This great restaurant put down its roots in 1825, and bore witness to Indiana's early growth, first as a trading post and a stagecoach stop between Evansville and Vincennes.
On its bicentenary, the Log Inn is vaunted for hosting not just the Hoosier patrons that make up our community, but also importantly, Amenca's 16th Commander in Chief, President Abraham Lincoln.
Furthermore, it once served as a stop on the Underground Railroad and is recognized as the oldest restaurant in Indiana.
Today, this monumental testament to the incredible history of our community serves Hoosier families daily as they enjoy both the great history of the Log Inn, and the delicious food it provides.
I celebrate the Log Inn for all its contnbutions to Indiana's 8th Congressional District, and I look forward to its continued success.
