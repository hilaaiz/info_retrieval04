Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Joseph Calabrigo as he retires from the Town.
Joe has served Danville residents for decades, starting with the Town of Danville in 1985.
He has served in many positions for the town, including Chief of Planning, Transportation Director, Administrative Services Director and Assistant Town Manager.
He was appointed as Town Manager in 1993, being only the third person to hold this title since the town's inception.
Throughout his tenure, Joe has worked tirelessly to foster a vibrant community in the Town of Danville and has diligently served the town's residents.
Joe oversaw the development of all three of Danville's General Plans and both Master Plans.
He has worked with every councilmember ever elected in the town and worked alongside seven police chiefs.
Additionally, Joe's leadership was critical as he guided the town through three recessions and a global pandemic while still maintaining a balanced budget.
Joe has continually demonstrated his steadfast commitment to service and his community.
Joe is a consummate professional and his work has helped to shape Danville into the beautiful community it is today.
His time as Town Manager is marked by his dedication and years of expertise as the longest tenured city or town manager in the Tri-Valley.
His leadership and collaboration have galvanized the respect of many and have left an indelible impact on his neighbors and peers.
Please join me in congratulating Joseph Calabrigo on his welldeserved retirement after decades of devoted service to the Town of Danville.
