Overlord.
In 1944, Jake arrived on the shores of Omaha Beach carrying 74 pounds of gear and narrowly surviving what was at the time the largest amphibious operation in history.
He avoided gunfire and landmines, fighting the German Nazi forces and helping to liberate France from Nazi control.
Throughout his time in service, Jake bravely endured six battles, including the infamous Battle of the Bulge.
The heroism and courage demonstrated by Jake and others were critical in defeating the Nazis and putting an end to the war.
More recently, Jake Larson earned the nickname of ``Papa Jake'' from his online presence as a storyteller on TikTok and Instagram.
Online, Papa Jake shares details of his time in the U.S. Army, teaching audiences about our nation's history and reminding us of the sacrifices that have been made to protect our freedom.
Jake has amassed over 1.3 million followers on social media and his stories have touched countless lives.
As we commemorate the 81st anniversary of D-Day, I'd like to extend my gratitude and respect to Jake for his extraordinary bravery.
Please join me in recognizing ``Papa'' Jake Larson for his dedicated service to our country.
