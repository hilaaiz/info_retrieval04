Mr. Speaker, please join me today as we remember the victims of road traffic collisions and their families.
In honoring the lives ended too soon, we face the profound losses of the communities they left behind and a responsibility to do everything in our power to ensure these tragedies become rarities.
We must protect the lives of all road users, and I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do that.
