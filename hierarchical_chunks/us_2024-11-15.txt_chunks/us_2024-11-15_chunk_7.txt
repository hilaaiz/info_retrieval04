Mr. Gelman is also a trailblazer for girls' sports in our community.
In 1986, recognizing a void in opportunities for female athletes, he founded the Bison Girls Hockey Program, the first of its kind in Western New York.
His efforts opened doors for countless young women to compete in hockey at the highest levels.
Today, we celebrate Warren B. Gelman, and his induction to the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall.
His contributions to Western New York's sports community, particularly his efforts to elevate the visibility and opportunities for women in athletics, have had a lasting and profound impact on the region.
Mr. Gelman's legacy of service, leadership, and dedication will continue to inspire generations of athletes, coaches, and community leaders for years to come.
