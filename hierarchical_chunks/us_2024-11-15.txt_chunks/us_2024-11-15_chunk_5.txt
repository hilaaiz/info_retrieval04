Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Warren B. Gelman's induction into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame--a fitting tribute to his lifetime of service, leadership, and dedication to the athletic community.
Mr. Gelman's life is a testament to the power of passion, hard work, and a commitment to others.
As one of the founding members of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame, Warren has been integral to the organization's growth and success since its inception in 1991.
As chair of the Nominating Committee for the Hall of Fame, Warren helped shape its structure, bringing together a group of passionate volunteers who sought to honor the legion's greatest athletes and sports figures.
His tireless work over the years has contributed to the Hall of Fame's enduring legacy.
