Ms. MALLIOTAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Mr. Philip Christopher, a leader and steadfast advocate for freedom and justice for the Cypriot people.
For over 50 years, 
Mr. Christopher has championed the cause of Cyprus, dedicating his life to the struggle for the reunification of Cyprus, the rights of the Cypriot people, and the broader Hellenic community.
