Mr. Speaker, this week the House will consider two bills that aim to fix problems within Social Security law, H.R. 82 and H.R. 5342.
I rise in support of H.R. 82, the Social Security Fairness Act.
This legislation takes a necessary and long-overdue step forward in improving Social Security and ensuring that retirees across America have access to their hard-earned benefits.
H.R. 82 has strong bipartisan support--the most of any bill during this session of Congress--and there's good reason for that.
This bill repeals the Government Pension Offset (GPO) and the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP), two provisions of Social Security law that reduce and, in some cases, fully cancel out Social Security benefits for Civil Services Retirement system recipients and other public sector employees who have worked in state and local government.
The GPO and WEP create financial hardship for America's retired teachers, police officers, postal workers, firefighters, and other public employees and their families who have spent their careers in public service.
H.R. 82 bill passed the House by a vote of 327-75, with one Member voting present.
I oppose H.R. 5342, the Equal Treatment of Public Service Act, an alternative bill proposed to address shortcomings within Social Security law.

Social Security is the nation's number one anti-poverty program for the elderly and for
