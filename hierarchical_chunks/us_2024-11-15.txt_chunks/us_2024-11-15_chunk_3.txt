Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the Erie County Medical Center's Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine as they commemorate a decade of service to the public.
Established in 2014, the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine was created as a state-of-the-art medical resource dedicated to the occupational and environmental health field.
Over the past decade, the Center has steadfastly fulfilled its mission to provide high-quality healthcare services for all in the Western New York legion.
With a commitment to preventing work-related illnesses and injuries, the Center has become an invaluable asset to our community, ensuring that workers receive the comprehensive care they deserve.
The Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine team has diligently served thousands of patients, addressing a wide range of health issues related to the workplace.
The Center offers an array of clinical services tailored to meet the needs of our dynamic Western New York workforce.
The inclusion of social work and wellness programs is often reflected in their holistic approach to health, recognizing that well-being extends beyond mere medical treatment.
The impact of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine reaches far beyond individual patients.
By managing the broad spectrum of diseases associated with workplace exposures, they contribute to a healthier workforce and a stronger community.
Each patient treated, each injury prevented, and each illness managed helps to uphold the fabric of our community and ensures that all who contribute to our local economy can do so with the assurance of care and support.
Today, as we look back on the past ten years, let us also look forward with hope and determination.
The need for occupational and environmental health services is as critical as ever.
Congratulations to the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine as they continue to innovate, adapt, and expand our services to meet the everevolving needs of our community.
