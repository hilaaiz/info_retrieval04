Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sunday, November 17th as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims.
Each year, the third Sunday in November, the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is a chance to commemorate the millions of lives lost or injured due to road accidents.
On this day we also pay tribute to emergency responders and medical professionals who answer the calls and face the trauma of road death and injury daily.
According to the Association for Safe International Road Travel, an estimated 1.35 million people around the world die in road crashes each year.
This is a crisis that continues day in and day out in all countries of the world.
Affecting primarily our most vulnerable communities and our youth.
Therefore, during the new Decade of Action 2021-2030 the World Day will have the important role of helping to achieve the 50 percent road casualty reduction target.
