Mr. BURLISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of John Errante of Springfield, Missouri, who recently passed away after a three-year battle with cancer.
He was 41 years old.
John was an amazing individual.
He was self-taught and a member of Mensa.
As his long-time friend, Beau, said of him, ``He was routinely the smartest man in the room, in a room filled with smart people.
He had a way of seeing to the core of a problem, and embracing and implementing solutions no one else would have considered, much less tried.''
John loved the arts and was a composer and a concert pianist.
As a teenager, he became involved in politics and attended the Leadership Institute here in Washington, DC.
While there, our homeland was attacked on September 11th, which had a profound effect on John.
This led him to join the U.S. Army where he served in Army Psychological Operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.
After leaving the military, John moved to Springfield where he graduated from Missouri State University on the President's List, the university's highest honor reserved for those who receive a 4.0 grade point average or higher.
He again became involved in politics, serving as the communications director for his friend Bill's gubernatorial campaign.
Ultimately, he became employed as a marketing specialist with MediaCom.
John's life was defined by service... to his country, to his neighbors, to his family and friends.
He was taken from us too soon and will be greatly missed by his father, Steven Errante, his mother, Arla Collins and a host of friends who loved him.
It is my great honor to recognize this remarkable individual, and I am praying for peace, comfort and good memories for his family.
