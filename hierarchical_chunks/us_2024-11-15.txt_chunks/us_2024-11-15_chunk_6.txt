Mr. Gelman's contributions to Buffalo extend far beyond his work with the Hall.
A former three-sport athlete, Warren excelled in soccer, hockey, and baseball before continuing his athletic journey at Yale University.
There, he captained both the undefeated 1963-1964 freshman hockey team and the 1966-1967 varsity hockey team, which earned a ranking as the 5th best team in the East.
