Mr. Christopher is the founder and President of the Pancyprian Association of America and the International Coordinating Committee ``Justice for Cyprus'' (PSEKA).
Through these organizations, he has tirelessly promoted Cypriot sovereignty and human rights, advocating on behalf of Cyprus and Hellenic issues with passion and dedication.
As a refugee, who was forced to flee his beautiful homeland of Kyrenia, Cyprus following the illegal occupation of the island nation by the Turkish military in 1974, no one is more passionate and dedicated to these issues than he is.
His efforts have left a lasting impact, as he has worked to ensure that the voice of the Greek Cypriot community is heard in the halls of Congress and across the United States.
Philip Christopher's contributions have not gone unrecognized.
He has received numerous honors, including the Republic of Cyprus Medal of Honor, the title of Honorary Mayor of Kyrenia, and honorary citizenships from multiple Cypriot communities.
He was also the first Greek Cypriot to receive the prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor in the United States.
In 2024, he served as Parade General Chairman of the NYC Greek Independence Day Parade.
These awards and recognition are a testament to his exemplary commitment to his community and his invaluable role as a bridge between Cypriot and American interests.
Beyond his advocacy, 
Mr. Christopher has demonstrated significant achievements as an executive in the telecommunications industry and as a board member of various respected organizations.
His dedication to excellence in both his professional and community endeavors is an inspiration.
Today, I commend Philip Christopher for his enduring dedication to Cyprus and the Hellenic community and express gratitude for his tireless efforts to further the cause of justice and freedom.
His legacy stands as a beacon of leadership and commitment that strengthens the bonds between Cyprus and the United States.
