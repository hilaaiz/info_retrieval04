I thank my parents for their support throughout the years.
I thank my husband and three kids for their support and their leafleting prowess throughout my campaign.
Most importantly, I thank my constituents for placing their trust in me.
I am committed to repaying their trust with service, dedication and determination to make Epsom and Ewell a better place for everyone.
