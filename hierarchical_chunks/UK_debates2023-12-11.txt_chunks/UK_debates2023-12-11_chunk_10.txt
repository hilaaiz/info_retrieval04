I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question.
That is exactly why we are developing a new NPQ for SENCOs, which will launch in autumn 2024, and are inputting into the standards for teacher training to ensure that everybody has an understanding of how best to support children.
There are now a lot of children with special educational needs, and we all need to know how to support them better.
