It is great to see you, Mr Speaker.
As well as contributing to Britain’s world-leading research, the financial contribution of international students is vital to UK universities, particularly at a time of rising cost pressures and real-terms fee value erosion.
Any sudden changes in the number of international students coming to the UK obviously puts the higher education sector at risk.
The Minister speaks of his pride, but I would like to stress the point and ensure that he puts this on record.
Can he absolutely give his assurance to the House that the Government remain robust in their ambition to continue to attract 600,000 international students a year, as laid out in the international education strategy?
