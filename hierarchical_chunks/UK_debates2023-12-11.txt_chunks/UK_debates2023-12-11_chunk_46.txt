The Minister talks up the UK’s arms export licences, but Amnesty International has identified a particular loophole in those licences: the 2002 incorporation guidelines allow UK components to be sent to third destinations for onward export to Israel.
Can he give me any assurances that, unlike in 2009 and 2014, that is not happening right now?
I have set out the fact that Britain has the toughest export licences and regulations anywhere in the world.
Of course, if the hon.
Lady has any evidence of those licences being infracted in some way, she should bring it to the attention of the authorities.
