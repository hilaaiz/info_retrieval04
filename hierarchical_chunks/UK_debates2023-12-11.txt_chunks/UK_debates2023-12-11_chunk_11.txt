From my citywide consultation of parents of children with SEND, it came to light that the particularly harsh and punitive disciplinary processes being exercised in schools  are having a very harmful effect on many of those children.
Will the Secretary of State or the Schools Minister meet me to discuss a particular multi-academy trust in my constituency where those processes are having a very negative impact on young people?
I am very happy to confirm that the Minister for children and families will be happy to meet the hon.
Lady.
Will the Secretary of State join me in thanking Julie Nixon, head of the Spectrum of Light charity in Rossendale and Darwen, for the work she did on Saturday by bringing together parents from across Lancashire and Rossendale and Darwen on a Zoom call?
Those parents were exactly the same as me, in that they all had an autistic child, and I was appalled to hear from them about the time they are having to wait to see an educational psychologist.
Will the Secretary of State agree to write to Lancashire County Council to find out what the heck is going on with those parents whose children are missing school and are unable to access an education, health and care plan?
I am very happy to work with my right hon.
Friend to improve things in Lancashire.
Spectrum of Light sounds like it is doing an amazing job—there are many people who are looking to better support our children with special educational needs.
Of course, we recognise that we need to improve aspects, which is why we published an improvement plan in March this year.
