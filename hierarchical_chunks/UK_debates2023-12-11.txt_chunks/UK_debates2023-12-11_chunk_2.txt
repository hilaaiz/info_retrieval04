I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
I am absolutely committed to the target of 600,000.
As I said in response to the previous question, we have surpassed that, with well over 680,000 students.
As I say, they are of benefit to our universities and our economy, and they are a very important source of income for all our higher education institutions.
