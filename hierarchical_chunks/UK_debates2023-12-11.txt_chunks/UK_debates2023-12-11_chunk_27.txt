This Conservative Government will fund a new school to replace the flood-prone Tipton St John Primary School, which has had to close three times this year and had another near miss last week due to intense heavy rainfall.
It is vital that spades are in the ground next year for the new school.
Will she meet me to discuss this urgent matter further?
Our school rebuilding programme is transforming 500 schools across England, and I am delighted that Tipton St John Primary School is one of them.
The school is currently in a flood zone and was impacted by the recent storms.
We are working actively with the diocese of Exeter and Devon local authority to identify suitable sites for the school.
I am happy to agree to meet my hon.
Friend very soon.
