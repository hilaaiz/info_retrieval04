If there is to be hope for a peaceful solution in the Israel-Gaza conflict, the input of Palestinian academics will be crucial, but many have already lost of their lives.
Could the Minister make a statement about representations that he has made to Cabinet colleagues about introducing an emergency humanitarian visa for academics in Gaza?
I will write to the hon.
Lady about that.
Parental choice is crucial, is it not?
To that end, when will wave 16 of the free school programme open?
My right hon.
Friend and constituency neighbour has been a long-time champion on this matter, and I know his local work well.
There are 701 free schools open, and a further 140-plus are in the pipeline.
There is a current round of applications for consideration of special and alternative provision free schools, but further capital would be a matter for future spending reviews.
The independent review of relationships, sex and health education in schools submitted its recommendations to the Secretary of State back in September.
When will those recommendations be made public?
If they are not to be made public, why not?
As the hon.
Gentleman knows, we are conducting a review of RSHE guidance.
These are important and sensitive topics and it is important to get them right.
He will not have long to wait to see the results.
