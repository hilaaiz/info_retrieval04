Thank you, Sir.
It is good to see you back safe and well in the Chair.
As this is the nearest I am ever going to get to it—No. 10, please!
[Laughter.]
What steps her Department is taking to improve access to special needs education.
I wondered what was happening there, Mr Speaker.
As part of our £2.6 billion investment to reform the SEND and AP system, we have announced 41 new special free schools, with a further 37 in the pipeline.
We have also set out plans for new national standards to make clear the support that should be available in mainstream settings for children with special educational needs.
When did the vacancy come at No. 10?
Can I take this opportunity quickly to thank the Secretary of State, her junior Ministers and officials for all the help for the schools affected by RAAC—reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete—in my constituency?
Turning to SEN, demand in Essex far outstrips supply.
The Secretary of State will know that just prior to the summer recess, I launched a campaign for a new SEN school in south Essex.
I am delighted to tell her that we have a trust that is seriously interested, we may have a site and we may even have some money.
On that basis, could I meet her or one of her junior Ministers—early in the new year, please—to update her on where we have got to and to ask for help to make this dream a reality?
I congratulate my right hon.
Friend on his campaign, with which we are very familiar in the Department; we would be delighted to meet him.
Where local authorities do feel there is a need, they can open a new special school through the free school presumption route, which I would be happy to discuss with him further.
