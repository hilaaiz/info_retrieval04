I thank the hon.
Lady.
We are keen that schools are as inclusive as they say they will be when it comes to children with special educational needs.
We have nine change programme partnerships to try to make sure that the system works a lot better.
The money is given to local authorities, and we should already be seeing an improvement, but I would be happy to discuss it further with her.
