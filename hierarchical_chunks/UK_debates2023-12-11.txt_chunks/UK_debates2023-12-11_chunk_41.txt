The Prime Minister has repeatedly expressed his unequivocal support for Israel’s right to defend itself.
May I urge the Government to maintain that position, to stay the course and to ensure that we continue to give Israel our strong support?
My right hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
We have made it clear that Israel has every right to defend itself, but that it must abide by international humanitarian law and the laws of war.
It is “wrong and illegal to target civilians…international law is very clear that there mustn’t be the targeting of civilians”.
Those are not my words, but the words of the new Foreign Secretary, and then Prime Minister, during the 2014 war in Gaza.
Given that over 10,000 Palestinian children alone have been killed, can the Minister confirm whether the Foreign Secretary, and therefore this Conservative Government, still believes that Israel’s targeting of civilians is wrong and illegal?
What steps is he taking to hold the Israeli Government to account?
Again, I recognise the integrity with which the hon.
Gentleman speaks.
I can tell him that, no, the Israeli Government never target civilians, but they are pursuing a strategy of degrading and eliminating the appalling perpetrators and the military machine that wrought the terrible disaster that took place on  7 October , which I remind him was a pogrom.
More Jewish people were killed on that day than on any single day since the holocaust in 1945.
Even if the Foreign Secretary were at the Dispatch Box today, I doubt if he would do a better job than my right hon.
Friend.
Can he say whether the Government have made any estimate of the number of Hamas fighters who have been killed?
We seem to get very precise estimates of the number of civilians who have been killed but, clearly, a large number of Hamas fighters are engaged in opposing Israeli forces on the ground.
Are any other people, other than Hamas fighters, resisting Israeli forces on the ground?
