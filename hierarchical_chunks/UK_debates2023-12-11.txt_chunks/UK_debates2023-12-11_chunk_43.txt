Words now fail to describe the despondency felt by those of us who stand for peace.
When I say “us” I do not just mean those of Palestinian descent; I also mean people in Israel who have fought for peace over many years.
The only way to have a lasting peace—a peace without fear—is to have two states, so I will repeat the question that I put last time: what are this Government doing?
Later today, I will table a Bill to recognise Palestine.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss it?
How do we prevent this from happening ever again?
I will, of course, be very pleased to meet the hon.
Lady.
We have previously discussed the contents of the Bill in another situation, but I will be very pleased to meet her.
We are developing proposals.
The hon.
Lady specifically asks what we are doing and, obviously, we are trying to lift people’s eyes to the political track that will, at some point, be possible.
We are looking in detail at developing proposals for support for the Palestinian Authority to build up the sinews of statehood, in pursuit of the established policy of both the major political parties in this House that there should be a two-state solution, with Israel living behind secure borders and Palestine as a free and independent state.
