I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his questions.
I recognise the enormous authority that Lord Cameron holds in these matters and the right hon.
Gentleman’s request that he should be available in the House.
I will do my best to satisfy him on the questions that he has asked.
As he knows, Lord Cameron is keen to engage with the House of Commons in every possible way.
