The Secretary of State has been clear that this Labour Government will build a new partnership with the Welsh Government based on co-operation, respect and delivery.
Will she say how the Government will give meaning to the manifesto commitment to strengthen devolution?
The previous Conservative Government ran roughshod over the devolution settlement, including by legislating in devolved areas without consent on numerous occasions.
This Government will respect the devolution settlement and work in partnership with all devolved Governments.
We will honour our manifesto  commitment to do that by strengthening the Sewel convention, including a new memorandum of understanding between our Governments, ensuring that the petty squabbles of the past are confined to history and we can focus on delivering for the people of Wales.
