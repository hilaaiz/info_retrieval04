As the Chancellor said last week, we were left a toxic legacy by the previous Government, including rivers filled with polluted waste.
Will the Prime Minister put the River Wye into special measures by designating it a water protection zone, and will he meet me and the excellent cross-border Wye Catchment Partnership to deliver its plan to clean up the Wye?
The River Wye is one of our most important and iconic rivers, and we are working closely with the Welsh Government on that pressing issue.
The destruction of our waterways should never have been allowed.
That is why we have launched a water commission to attract investment and speed up infrastructure delivery, and why we have introduced legislation to enable tougher penalties and severe fines to crack down on polluters.
I will ensure that my hon.
Friend gets a meeting with the relevant Minister.
