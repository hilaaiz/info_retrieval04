As Leader of His Majesty’s Opposition, I will be taking a different approach to the last Opposition, by being a constructive Opposition, so I would like to start by congratulating President-elect Trump on his impressive victory this morning.
The Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary met him in September.
Did the Foreign Secretary take that opportunity to apologise for making derogatory and scatological references, including “Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath.
He is also a profound threat to the international order”?
If he did not apologise, will the Prime Minister do so now, on his behalf?
There will be many issues on which the Leader of the Opposition and I disagree, but there will be issues that unite this House, on national security and Ukraine.
I look forward to working closely with her on that.
I will provide her with the information that she needs to discharge her duties.
That is the right thing for the country and it is far more important than party politics.
The Foreign Secretary and I did meet President-elect Trump, just a few weeks ago, for dinner,  for about a couple of hours.
We discussed a number of issues of global significance.
It was a very constructive exercise.
