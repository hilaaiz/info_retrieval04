As a good lawyer, the Prime Minister will want to listen to the evidence, so if evidence mounts from experts and organisations such as the National Farmers Union that smaller family farms of average size—250 acres—will be severely impacted by the tax changes, will he, in a spirit of compromise, listen to that evidence, keep an open mind and perhaps be prepared to raise the threshold in order to preserve our family farms?
We are listening to farmers, and the Environment Secretary and Treasury Ministers met with the NFU on Monday.
We have taken a fair and balanced approach: the vast, vast majority of farms will not be affected.
What I will also say is that having grown up in a rural community, I know that rural communities also need an NHS that is back on its feet, schools that their children can go to and homes that their families can afford to live in, but we will continue to talk to the NFU and others.
This week, the Leader of the Opposition told us that any outrage at suitcases full of wine and karaoke machines in Downing Street while people across the country were told to stay at home was all “overblown”.
For the people and businesses in my constituency who followed the rules—many of us at great personal cost—this is an insult.
Will the Prime Minister join me in ensuring that we as a country learn the lessons from covid, and that the Conservatives as a party learn the lessons of their behaviour too?
Across the country, people made enormous sacrifices during covid.
They missed weddings, births and deaths—really important moments in their and their families’ lives.
In doing so, they saved the lives of people they will probably never meet.
That was a collective effort, and unfortunately the party opposite, who set the rules, did not follow them themselves.
It was a betrayal of those who did, and I think the Leader of the Opposition was wrong to describe the public anger and upset as “overblown”.
I am sure she will want to clarify that at the first opportunity.
