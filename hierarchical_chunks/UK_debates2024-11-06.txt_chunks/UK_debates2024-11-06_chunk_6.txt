Thank you, Mr Speaker.
At the outset, as I come to the Dispatch Box for the first time in this role for Wales questions, may I please pay tribute to my former private secretary in the Wales Office, Debbie John, who was taken at a tender age due to pancreatic cancer?
She and her family are in my thoughts today as I take up this role.
She is much missed and very fondly remembered.
The right hon.
Lady clearly needs to acknowledge to the House that the deal for Tata steel recently re-announced by her UK Government is identical to the one negotiated by my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North West Essex (Mrs Badenoch) , who is now Leader of the Opposition.
