In my first week as Welsh Secretary, I discovered that the £80 million promised by the previous Conservative Government for the transition board was part of the £22 billion of unfunded promises they had made.
That shocking dereliction of duty threatened to leave workers and businesses high and dry without the support they needed.
I have therefore made it my mission to fight tooth and nail for that money on behalf of our steel communities, and I would not have left them unsupported.
I am pleased to be able to confirm that under this Labour Government the transition board is fully funded, and we are getting on with the delivery.
