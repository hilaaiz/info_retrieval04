The Secretary of State has said that economic growth is her No. 1 priority.
Can the Minister say how the Budget’s confirmation of the investment zones will help contribute to that aim?
The Budget includes a total of £320 million and a commitment for the investment zones in Cardiff and Newport and in Wrexham and Flintshire.
This is a crucial part of our work with the Welsh Government to provide a rocket boost for sectoral strengths such as the creative industries, the life sciences and advanced manufacturing, including our world-leading compound semiconductor cluster.
There is great potential for creating new jobs in wind energy and sea energy in Wales.
We in Northern Ireland, and in Belfast in particular, have the engineering skills to provide the turbines for that energy production.
Everyone would gain: Wales would get the jobs, and Northern Ireland would get the jobs as well.
This Government are absolutely committed to economic growth across all parts of the United Kingdom.
