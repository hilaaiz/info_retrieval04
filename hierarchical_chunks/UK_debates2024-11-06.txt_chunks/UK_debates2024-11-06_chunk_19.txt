Both Governments are working collaboratively to make the NHS fit for the future.
We provided a £1.75 billion boost for the Welsh Government to spend on public services such as the NHS, and the Welsh Government have just announced £28 million to cut NHS waiting times.
Both Governments are sharing best practice and will consider more cross-border arrangements where capacity allows.
The Welsh Government’s ministerial advisory group on NHS performance and productivity has been established to support improvements and bring down long waiting lists.
