Welsh universities will benefit from record levels of investment in research and development, which will be worth over £20 billion next year.
The Budget confirmed £160 million of funding for the Wrexham and Flintshire investment  zone, which was chosen due to the presence of world-renowned research institutions such as Wrexham University and Bangor University.
We say the phrase “no farmers, no food” so often, but never has there been a need for such emphasis as in the wake of the autumn Budget.

This Government continue to provide significant tax relief for farmers.
For example, farming parents are able to pass up to £3 million to their children free of tax.

The vast majority of farms will be unaffected by the changes in the Budget and will continue not to pay inheritance tax.

I continue to collaborate with ministerial colleagues in both Governments, with the aim of driving down waiting lists.
