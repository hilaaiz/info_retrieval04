The Secretary of State, while in opposition, warned that the New Zealand trade deal would push Welsh farmers into bankruptcy and noted that Australian meat was produced at a far lower standard than in Wales.
I agree.
My constituents want high-quality Welsh lamb, beef and chicken.
Will the Minister therefore push her colleagues in the Department for Business and Trade to review the Australia and New Zealand trade agreement and get it right for our farming communities?
The hon.
Member will know as well as I do that the new Leader of the Opposition is the one who sold our farmers down the river, negotiating deals with places such as Australia and leaving our farmers open to increasing quotas on imported meat.
I assure him that this Government are committed to promoting robust standards, nationally and internationally, to protect consumer interests and to ensure that consumers have confidence in the food that they buy.
We will consider the full range of tools at our disposal to uphold the UK’s commitment to high standards.
That includes using our influence in the World Trade Organisation and other multilateral bodies to argue for better and fairer trading rules.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help create new jobs in Wales.
Our mission to kick-start economic growth will deliver good jobs and growth in Wales.
Just last month, our international investment summit secured over £63 billion in private investment into the UK.
Since July, we have secured over £1 billion of investment into north Wales, creating and sustaining 400 well-paid jobs in manufacturing.
