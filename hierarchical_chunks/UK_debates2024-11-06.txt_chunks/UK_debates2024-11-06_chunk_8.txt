I think the hon.
Lady needs to read the deal reached by the Government.
The £1.25 billion transformation project at Port Talbot will deliver a state-of-the-art electric furnace, the contract for which has just been signed.
In just under 10 weeks, without providing any additional funding beyond the £500 million previously announced, we delivered a better deal that secures the immediate future of Port Talbot and lays the foundations for future investment, as well as enhanced protections for the workforce in Port Talbot, Llanwern, Trostre and Shotton.
I am delighted that the right hon.
Lady has read the deal that we wrote, but the facts are simple: despite the protesting, this is the same deal that was previously negotiated by the last Conservative Government, involving the same amount of money to build the electric arc furnace and the same cash for the transition board.
It is ludicrous for her or others to continue to claim that no support was in place and that it somehow appeared when she found it down the back of the sofa.
She is fully aware that the cash had been sitting there the whole time.
Perhaps an apology is needed for that, and for claiming that Port Talbot supplies the defence industry with materials.
If an apology is due, it is to the people of Port Talbot for promising £80 million for a transition board that operated for nine months under the previous Secretary of State for Wales, and delivered not a single penny to the people of Port Talbot, and now we know why: the £80 million did not exist.
