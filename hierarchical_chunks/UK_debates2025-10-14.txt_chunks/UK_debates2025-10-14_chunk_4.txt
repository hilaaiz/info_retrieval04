I thank the Minister for that answer.
In my constituency, several planning applications are pending, and one has already been granted in the villages of Wilsden and Cullingworth for battery storage and onshore wind in the wider area.
Can the Minister explain how constituents with clean energy infrastructure in their area can benefit from both cheaper bills and community funding?
