I welcome the Minister to her new position and thank her for her answer.
I know how much she will want the new carbon budget delivery plan to reflect the scale of ambition required while ensuring that the poorest are not asked to pay the price, and also to signal that it is an absolute priority across Government.
Can she assure us that the new plan will not just be slipped out, but will be launched properly and, crucially, with the Prime Minister?
