The Secretary of State is trying to conflate two emissions trading schemes.
He does not want to talk about the carbon tax on electricity, because he has increased it by 70% since the start of the year, pushing up everybody’s bills in the process.
He is making electricity more expensive at the same time as taxing, banning and bribing people into electric cars and electric home heating—that is totally backwards.
He is the worst enemy of a decarbonisation agenda in this country.
Our cheap power plan would instantly cut electricity bills by 20%.
The Secretary of State could do so tomorrow; what is he waiting for?
Dear, oh dear.
I will be honest: I think it is sad what has happened to the right hon.
Lady.
When she was in government for a time, she was the great eco-champion.
At COP26, she was telling people, “Follow Claire’s lead—be a great eco-champion.”
Now, she has suddenly discovered that she is the anti-net zero warrior.
All it does is show how desperate the Conservatives are, and the more desperate they become, the more irrelevant they become.
Air pollution increases the risk of developing conditions including asthma and lung cancer, and has been linked to thousands of deaths.
In London, hard work by our mayor Sadiq Khan has seen the level of nitrogen dioxide fall to within legal limits for the first time since regulations were introduced.
In my constituency, we want to know that the Government are committed to working hard to end that link between air pollution and deaths, so can the Secretary of State set out what steps he is taking to deliver that?
My hon.
Friend makes a really important point, and not only about what the mayor has done and the effects it has had on the health of Londoners.
There is a wider point here, which is too often overlooked, about what the shift to renewables and away from fossil fuels can do to help save lives and tackle air pollution.
