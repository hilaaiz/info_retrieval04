I welcome the Minister to her place—it is good to see her among the line of men on the Treasury Bench.
I have just finished chairing a meeting of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee.
One issue that we discussed was decent home standards.
Emissions from homes is another key area that we need to bear down on, given the Government’s priority of improving minimum energy performance certificate standards by 2030.
I appreciate that the Minister has been in post for only a few weeks, but what discussions has she had with colleagues in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to ensure that the private rented sector database will contain information on EPC ratings, so that all our residents can live in warm, secure and safe homes?
