The Minister and I come from one of the most energy-rich parts of Europe, yet its consumers have among the highest energy bills in Europe.
That drives up fuel poverty and hits the cost of living crisis.
He will be aware of that.
Labour promised to bring down bills by £300; they will have gone up by about the same amount.
Does the Minister understand why people are so frustrated with the Government?
Like the hon.
Member, I understand people’s frustration when they look at their energy bills each month.
[Interruption.]
That promise stands.
That is why we are taking concerted action through the warm home discount, which is providing 2.7 million households with support this winter, and the warm homes plan, which we will roll out this year.
Economic growth is a key driver for all our constituents.
What is the Government’s estimate of the number of jobs that will be created in the UK by 2030?
Is it true to say that it will be triple the number in the old economy?
Hundreds of thousands of jobs will come from the clean power revolution.
That is why it is so important that we push ahead with it and do not adopt the tactics of the Conservative party, or their friends on the Back Benches.
We need to push ahead with clean power in order to unlock those hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country.
