I thank my hon.
Friend for his comments on my liberation from the Government Whips Office.
I know that he is a champion for his constituents in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and I am always happy to meet to discuss these important issues.
He will know, as I do, that with wholesale gas costs 77% higher than before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we must get people off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel prices and on to clean home-grown power.
