Nearly 3 million households in the UK live in fuel poverty.
At the same time, a recent report from the Common Wealth think-tank told us that energy company profits average about a quarter of everybody’s bills.
In the last few years, £70 billion has been paid to shareholders, instead of being reinvested or used to help tackle fuel poverty.
Will the Minister commit to tackling those energy company profits by taxing them fairly and reinvesting the money in the urgent work that is needed—for example, through the warm homes plan—to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty in our country?
The cost of energy has to come down, and one of my jobs as Minister for energy consumers is driving down the cost of bills, but we must also remember that the Government introduced a windfall tax on the oil and gas companies, and we have the price cap on energy, which caps the profits of energy companies.
We will continue to take that action.
Despite the oil price being at a six-month low this week, energy prices remain stubbornly high.
Given the onset of winter, what further steps will the Minister and his Department take by way of a warm home scheme?
We are taking action through the warm home discount, which is being provided to an extra 2.7 million households across the country, and the warm homes plan, which we will roll out before the end of the year.
What assessment he has made of the potential impact of trends in the level of energy prices on economic growth.
High and volatile energy prices are bad for growth, take money out of consumers’ pockets and make our businesses less competitive.
Through our mission to achieve clean power by 2030, we are taking the country off the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel prices and have set a route to home-grown cheap and greener energy.
