I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, and Ella for her interest in and enthusiasm for this incredibly important issue.
Deforestation is a terrible thing for the planet, but it is also terrible for the people who are affected—the indigenous people who live in the forest.
Nature-based solutions and solutions that put indigenous people at the centre make a huge difference.
This is a COP in the forest, and I think the Brazilian presidency deserves congratulations on that emphasis.
It is developing a number of initiatives, including the so-called TFFF—the tropical forest forever facility—to finance the prevention of deforestation, and we are working with it on that.
