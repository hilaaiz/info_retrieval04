I welcome the new Ministers to the Front Bench.
On the first day of recess, away from scrutiny, the Labour party published the prices for its allocation round 7 of the renewables auction.
Labour used to say that renewables were nine times cheaper, but the prices that the Secretary of State has said he is willing to pay are 40% higher than the current cost of electricity—they are the highest prices in a decade—and he has extended the contract length to 20 years.
Those are not just the prices that we will be paying; they are the prices that our children will be paying.
Will the Minister explain how locking us into higher prices for longer will cut bills by £300?
