I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s question.
Part of the answer here is that the economics have changed, so getting private finance into developing countries can make a massive difference.
The “Baku to Belém road map” is being produced as part of the COP process—it is a $1.3 trillion road map—and most of that is about private finance.
We can see across the world the effect of private finance in developing countries.
In Pakistan, for example, solar has gone from playing almost no part in its electricity system to being the top part of that system in only three or four years, because it is in Pakistan’s economic interests.
That is what we are seeing across the world.
We need the private and public sectors to play their role.
