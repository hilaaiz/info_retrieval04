Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
On behalf of the Conservative party, I would like to add my voice to the tributes paid today to Lord Campbell.
I had the pleasure of meeting Sir Ming Campbell, as he was then, just once—backstage before “Any Questions?”—and he was very courteous, very curious and very earnest.
We all know how well respected he was across this House, not least because of the efforts he made to work cross-party, especially on international matters.
He was a man with a clear sense of right and wrong, committed to doing the right thing even when it was difficult or unpopular, so I very much hope that his legacy of careful thought, integrity and public service endures.
On behalf of myself and my party, I extend heartfelt condolences to Sir Ming’s family, his party and all those who knew him and loved him.
Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
For those of us on all sides who were here during the debate on the Iraq  war, I want to thank Ming for the legal advice that he provided and the way that he addressed that debate, because he did so without seeking any party advantage.
He simply set out the legal principles on which he was making his decision, and he did so with compassion and with the recognition of the moral duty that we all had.
Many of us agreed with him and voted with him, and many did not, but everybody respected his judgment as a result.
I believe he was a model MP, always speaking and voting on the basis of his conscience and the interests of his constituency and the country overall.
He will be greatly missed, but I think his lesson will remain with many of us throughout our own parliamentary careers.
