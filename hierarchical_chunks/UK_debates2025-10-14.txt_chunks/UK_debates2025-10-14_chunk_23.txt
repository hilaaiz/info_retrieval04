I thank my hon.
Friend for repeatedly raising these issues in the House—I know that climate change is of huge concern to her and her constituents.
I am proud that Britain has led the way with our independent Committee on Climate Change,  established under the Climate Change Act 2008, which has worked effectively for nearly two decades, under leadership from Labour and the Conservatives—I sincerely hope that we can re-establish that consensus.
We are grateful to the Committee for its scientific recommendations to the Department.
Obviously, it is for the Department now to consider them, and we will report back on our decisions at the end of the month.
