I welcome the Minister to his place.
Talking about industry, the Lindsey oil refinery in Lincolnshire is in receivership and is currently being sold, but thousands and thousands  of jobs are at risk and the workers there are desperately concerned that the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the official receiver are not running a proper process, frustrating potential bidders for the whole site.
Will the Minister, in his new job, commit to helping ensure that the whole site is sold to a successful bidder?
