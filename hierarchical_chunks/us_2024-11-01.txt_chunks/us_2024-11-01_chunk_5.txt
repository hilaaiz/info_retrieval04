Mr. Speaker, LISC Houston's legacy reminds us that when we come together, we can build something lasting.
It's a vision that speaks to the best of who we are--a belief in the power of community, in lifting each other up, and in making sure that everyone has a fair shot at a better future.
I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating LISC's important milestone and their tremendous impact.
