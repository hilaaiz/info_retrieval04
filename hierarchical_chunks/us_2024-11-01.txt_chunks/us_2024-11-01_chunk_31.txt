Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding constituent from my district, Anthony ``Tony'' Vendetti.
Tony is guided by a sense to better his community and has always demonstrated his ability to overcome complex challenges and situations.
As an accomplished scout from BSA Troop 82, Tony is no stranger to giving back to our community.
He has contributed to several service projects, such as Adopt a Highway, Scouting For Food, and Wreaths Across America.
He also continues to volunteer alongside his father at Harvest Ministries food pantry.
Tony is also a member of Neshaminy High School's Football Team as a defensive tackle and is a proud electrical engineering student at Bucks County Technical High School.
After his graduation in 2025, Tony plans to join the United States Marine Corps while continuing his education to earn a degree in electrical engineering.
We are all incredibly proud for the positive impact Anthony has on our community and wish him the best of luck in his bright future ahead.
