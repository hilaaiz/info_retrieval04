LISC has helped thousands in our area find good-paying jobs, start businesses, and build brighter futures.
When it comes to affordable housing, they haven't just built homes; they've built foundations-- places where families feel rooted, children feel safe, and communities can grow and thrive.
LISC stands alone in the Houston region as the organization that tackles every facet of affordable housing--from providing training and developing new housing to preserving existing homes, expanding access to homeownership, and leading post-disaster recovery efforts.
And LISC Houston's work is far from finished.
As they look to the future, they're setting their sights on new challenges--focusing on digital literacy, place-based development, economic mobility, and climate resilience.
They're supporting small businesses, including childcare providers, and empowering emerging housing developers.
They're creating pathways to homeownership, lifting up families, and transforming communities with every project.
