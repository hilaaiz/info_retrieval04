Mr. ESPAILLAT.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate the life, legacy, and work of Clementine Pugh, a dear and distinguished friend of my predecessor, The Honorable Charles B. Rangel.
As a strong believer in the power of knowledge, she demonstrated the importance of learning and expanding educational opportunities for women and African Americans throughout our great Nation.
On June 20, 2015, at Harlem's historic Riverside Church, family and community gathered to memorialize Clementine's life and contributions to opening our minds to the importance of culture, honesty, and knowledge.
On April 11, 1925, Clementine was born to Alberta and Otho High in Raleigh, North Carolina.
She attended Shaw University, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree.
She began her career as a psychiatric social worker, moving on to becoming a public school teacher and, eventually, a professor at Hunter and Lehman Colleges of the City University.
After 20 years of service at Lehman College, she was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus.
She earned a Master of Social Work degree in 1949 from New York's Columbia University and a Doctorate in Education from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1982.
For her teachings, she was awarded the prestigious title of Professor Emeritus.
Clementine vividly strived for honesty and understanding.
She made it her duty to present others with the awareness she obtained.
Her tireless effort to engage, enjoy, and educate people touched the hearts of every person she met.
A woman ahead of her time, Clementine Pugh tackled the many realms of ``isms'' including racism, sexism and classism.
Her life was devoted to acknowledging and improving how these systems affect African American people.
With her remarkable resilience, my predecessor, The Honorable Charles B. Rangel, is proud to have called Clementine and her husband, G. Douglas Pugh, dear and very special friends.
I know that Clementine's legacy will live on for many years to come.
