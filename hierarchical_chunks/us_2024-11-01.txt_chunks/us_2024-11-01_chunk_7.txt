Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th Anniversary of Loaves & Fishes Community Services, one of the largest food pantries in Illinois.
Founded in 1984 by a group of compassionate members.
Raphael Catholic Church, this organization began as a small food pantry in a church closet, serving just eight families.
Today, 40 years later, Loaves & Fishes provides assistance to over 10,000 individuals each week, including residents of DuPage, Kane, Kendall, and Will Counties.
The success of Loaves & Fishes can be attributed to the collaboration of its dedicated staff and more than 1,000 volunteers, who range from teenagers to seniors nearing 90 years old.
Their commitment has been instrumental in ensuring the prosperity of countless families.
The extensive volunteer hours contributed over the years have allowed Loaves & Fishes to scale its operations, enabling efficient and costeffective service at facilities such as the Frank J. Rus & Donald S. Toy Food Market & Resource Center.
Over the years, Loaves & Fishes has expanded its mission beyond addressing food insecurity to include programs that promote selfsufficiency.
These initiatives include offering emergency assistance for rent and utilities, help with public benefits, vehicle donations, Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA), employment readiness support, and the Moving Up program--a 20-session intensive course designed to help clients identify and overcome barriers to progress.
