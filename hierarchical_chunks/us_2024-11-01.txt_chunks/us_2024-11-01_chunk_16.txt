Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege and honor to recognize Mr. Giuseppe Anoia as he approaches his 90th birthday this November.
Born November 19, 1934, 
Mr. Anoia has been a constituent of Maryland's First Congressional District since he immigrated to the United States from Italy in 1961.
He received a degree in civil engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1970 and worked for Baltimore City for 17 years until his retirement in 2000.
Mr. Anoia has been happily married to Phillis, nee D'Adamo, for over 32 years.
It is a distinct privilege to recognize 
Mr. Anoia on his upcoming 90th birthday and celebrate this wonderful milestone.
On behalf of Maryland's First Congressional District, I wish 
Mr. Anoia a very happy birthday.
