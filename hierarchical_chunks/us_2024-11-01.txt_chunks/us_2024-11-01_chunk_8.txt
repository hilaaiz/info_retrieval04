Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have Loaves & Fishes Community Services in my district, actively working to alleviate hunger and support our community.
I invite my colleagues to join me in expressing gratitude to Mike Havala, the current President and CEO of Loaves & Fishes, along with all the dedicated members of this organization.
May it continue to be a beacon of service for many years to come.
