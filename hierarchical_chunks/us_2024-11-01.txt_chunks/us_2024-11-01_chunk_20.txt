Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a distinguished marine, successful businessman, philanthropist, and cherished family man, Gary Lee Bruno.
Born on August 11, 1946, in Morgantown, West Virginia, Gary's life unfolded as an inspiring tapestry of service, resilience, and unwavering commitment.
At the age of 8, Gary and his family planted roots in Fresno, California, where he navigated the vibrant complexities of a large Italian family as the middle child of five boys.
His academic journey, led him to Central High School and later to Fresno State University, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in political science.
Concurrently, Gary embraced a profound sense of duty, joining the Marine Corps while in college, earning his commission as an officer in July 1966.
Gary's steadfast commitment to service saw him proudly serving as a U.S. marine for nearly four years, including a tour in Vietnam as an artillery officer.
His valor and dedication earned him accolades such as the Navy Commendation Medal (V for Valor), Combat Action Ribbon, and numerous other commendations.
Retiring from the Marine Corps Reserve as a lieutenant colonel in 1986, Gary carried the pride of his military service throughout his life.
While in the reserves, Gary served as the Headquarters and Support Commanding Officer and was well respected by fellow marines for his honorable leadership.
Returning to Fresno in 1972 with his wife and baby daughter, Cynthia, Gary, as a father, reveled in coaching his daughters' cross-country teams, participating in family activities, and instilling a love for adventure and shared experiences.
In 1978, he founded G.L. Bruno Associates, Inc., focusing on real estate development and medical facility construction, making significant contributions to healthcare accessibility in the Central Valley.
Beyond his business endeavors, Gary was driven by a core belief in giving back.
In 1996, he established the G.L. Bruno Family Foundation, channeling over $2 million to support socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, with a particular emphasis on matters concerning women and children.
Gary lived life with fervor, finding joy in flying his airplane, playing golf, and savoring a good martini.
His dignified demeanor, witty jokes, and a ready handkerchief became hallmarks of his presence.
Even in the face of a courageous battle with Parkinson's disease, Gary's sense of humor endured.
Gary leaves behind a legacy of passion and generosity.
Survived by his daughters, Cynthia Bruno Rafferty and Aimee Bogna, their families, and loyal dog Bailey, Gary's impact extends to his ex-wives, brothers, nieces, nephews, and cherished friends.
In commemorating Gary Lee Bruno, we honor a life that blended duty, enterprise, and compassion--a life that will forever inspire those who knew him.
