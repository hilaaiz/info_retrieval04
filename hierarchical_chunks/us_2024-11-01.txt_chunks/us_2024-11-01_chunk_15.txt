Mrs. STEEL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Los Angeles Dodgers for bringing home their eighth World Series title.
I am especially proud of first baseman Freddie Freeman, a California-45 native from Fountain Valley, for representing Orange County so well on the national stage and bringing home the World Series MVP award.
Freddie has shown remarkable perseverance in overcoming personal and professional trials, and this tremendous accomplishment is a testament to his work ethic and drive to succeed.
A true Orange County hero, Freddie and this Dodgers team have excelled at the highest level and added to the rich baseball tradition and can not wait to see more championships in the years to come.
