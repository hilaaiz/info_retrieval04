Mr. Speaker, it is through the work of people like Chief Mettin that our communities thrive, and our Nation grows stronger.
His actions remind us that progress is not forged in grand gestures, but in the cumulative power of selfless acts.
He embodies the timeless American values of resilience, generosity and compassion, showing us that the future is built by those who care deeply, act decisively, and give without hesitation.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Mettin for his extraordinary service.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this exceptional individual, whose leadership and spirit of service will inspire generations to come.
May his example remind us of the boundless potential within each of us to make our communities, country, and world a better place.
