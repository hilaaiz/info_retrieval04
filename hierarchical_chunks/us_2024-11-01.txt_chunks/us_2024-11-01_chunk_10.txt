Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN) Established in the District of Columbia as the Central American Refugee Center, CARECEN is celebrating its 43rd anniversary this month.
CARECEN was founded in 1981 to provide legal assistance to Central American refugees.
Today, in addition to providing such assistance, CARECEN provides several services to D.C.'s Latino community, including citizenship classes, tenant organizing and legal services.
CARECEN also advocates for refugees and immigrants from Central America on the federal level.
Since the 1990s, CARECEN has advocated for granting Temporary Protected Status for nationals from Latin American countries.
I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing CARECEN for its contributions to D.C. and D.C.'s Latino community over the last 43 years.
