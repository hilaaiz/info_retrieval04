Mr. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the majority of Americans who feel as I do, I commend the Isreali Defense Forces (IDF) for ridding the world of one of its most wretched war criminals, Yahya Sinwar.
As the mastermind of October 7th, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, Sinwar orchestrated the murder, maiming, mutilation, rape, torture, and abduction of Israelis as well as Americans.
The IDF's triumph over Sinwar's reign of terror sends a resounding message to the rest of the world.
The fate of the Middle East no longer belongs to the antisemitic wars of the past.
It belongs to the Abrahamic peace of the future, a peace forged in the crucible of Israel's formidable fighting force.
The heroes of the IDF have shown Israel to be one of the few liberal democracies willing to fight for liberal democracy and one of the few Western nations willing to fight for Western civilization.
May God Bless the IDF.
Am Yisrael Chai (The People of Israel Live).
