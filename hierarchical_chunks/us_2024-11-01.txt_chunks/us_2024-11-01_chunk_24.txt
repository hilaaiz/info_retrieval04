Abdur-Rahim was credited with turning KSU's program into a recordbreaking success.
But it is not his incredible professional accomplishments that made him the great man he was.
He was a servant leader with genuine care for those around him.
He transformed not only records but also the hearts and minds of entire communities.
Coach Abdur-Rahim was immediately embraced by the USF family.
When USF Vice President for Athletics Michael Kelly described Coach's impact on the team and university, Kelly said, ``he connected this whole community.
`` Around campus, Coach was known for picking up students' coffee tabs, personally greeting camped-out fans in front of the Yuengling Center, and dancing with the school band after home game wins.
His spirit and joy were felt by the entire student body.
To his players, he was so much more.
At the press conference following the team's historic first regular season conference championship, Coach Abdur-Rahim said, ``It's just great to see growth in young people, man, when they start to see themselves as more than just basketball players, when they start to see themselves as men.''
Following last year's historic season, Coach was unanimously voted American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year.
Yet, he felt an individual accolade was unfitting.
Coach changed the trophy engraving from ``Coach of the Year'' to ``Staff of the Year.''
In all he did, Coach Abdur-Rahim found a way to serve those around him.
Above all else, Coach Abdur-Rahim loved his family.
He is survived by his wife, Arianne, and their three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin.
His legacy will live on through his family and all who had the privilege of sharing time with him on the basketball court.
Coach Abdur-Rahim used to say: ``No record is going to tell you what impact you have on people around you.''
The impact Coach had on the USF community is immeasurable, and his optimism, devotion and servant leadership will continue to inspire us all.
