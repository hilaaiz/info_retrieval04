Ms. TOKUDA.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to recognize Speaker Scott Saiki of the Hawaii State House of Representatives, a distinguished legislator and this year's recipient of the Achievement in Advocacy award from the Healthcare Association.
Throughout his 20 years in the Hawaii State Legislature, Speaker Saiki has championed access to care, especially for the underserved and most vulnerable in Hawaii.
His commitment to care included support for innovative ideas to grow our healthcare workforce, training local talent for critical positions.
Never one to shy away from difficult issues, he also led efforts to give our families the power to make some As Speaker of the Hawaii House of Representatives, he also helped lead Hawaii through a global pandemic.
His work was instrumental in protecting residents by setting up vaccination sites, testing, and metrics for the eventual reopening of our State.
His leadership, including in spearheading the House Select Committee on COVID-19 Economic and Financial Preparedness, ensured our State could successfully make it through a worldwide public health emergency.
Speaker Saiki's unflagging dedication and commitment to others is an inspiration to many, and I am pleased to join the Healthcare Association of Hawaii in celebrating his many accomplishments.
Congratulations and mahalo to Speaker Saiki for all his contributions to the people and the State.
