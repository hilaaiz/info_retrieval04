Ms. TITUS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 100th birthday of Sara Denton, a close friend and trailblazer in Nevada politics.
Sara Pittard Denton was born on November 12, 1924, in Paducah, Kentucky.
In 1943, during her first year in college at Southern Illinois University, the U.S. Army Signal Corps, the forerunner to Military Intelligence, recruited her to work as a ``Code Girl'' in Washington, D.C. at the height of World War II.
There she met Ralph Denton, a young U.S. Army lieutenant from Caliente, Nevada, who was attending law school under the patronage of U.S. 
Senator Pat McCarran.
They married in 1949 and after Ralph's graduation, the newlyweds moved to Nevada where for 75 years Sara volunteered in numerous state and national political campaigns while also rearing their three children: renown author Sally, Dr. Scott Denton, and Judge Mark Denton.
Following her participation in U.S. 
Senator Howard Cannon's successful 1976 campaign, Sara was hired as his Administrative Assistant, her first and only paid position in Nevada politics.
In recent decades, Sara has been instrumental in other Nevada campaigns, including presidential candidates Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris.
In addition to her political work, Sara has been involved in numerous community and charitable organizations, including the 1964 founding of Boulder City's Art in the Park, the largest juried art festival in the Southwest with proceeds going towards the Boulder City Hospital Foundation.
The State of Nevada has benefitted tremendously from her work.
She is greatly respected, highly admired, and deeply loved by so many.
I join my fellow Nevadans in wishing her a Happy One-Hundredth Birthday.
