Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Clinton McCracken has dedicated much of his life to teaching and advocating for teachers and LGBTQ+ students.
In 2022, Clinton was named National Teacher of the Year by MSA.
He has been a teacher for 24 years and is honored to serve as the president of the Orange County Classroom Teachers Association--the teacher's union for the eighth-largest school district in the country.
In 2004, Clinton and his [now] husband, Mike Palmateer, along with three other same-sex couples, sought marriage licenses at the Orange County courthouse.
After being denied, they held a public commitment ceremony in downtown Orlando to bring attention to the injustice of marriage inequality.
In 2011, Clinton mobilized the community to lobby the school board to add ``sexual orientation and gender identity/ expression'' to the nondiscrimination policy and add domestic partner benefits.
In 2019, Clinton lobbied the board to designate October as LGBTQ+ Awareness/History Month.
Clinton has received numerous awards for his teaching and advocacy in education, including Equality Florida's Voice for Equality Award, the FEA Human and Civil Rights Award, and the ASN Emerging Leader Award.
In 2021, Clinton was recognized by the Orlando Sentinel as one of ``10 people who make Orlando a better place to live.''
He has been interviewed by CNN, NPR, TIME, The Guardian, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, and numerous local news affiliates.
Clinton serves on the AFT Teachers Program and Policy Council, AFT LGBTQ+ Task Force, FEA Government Relations Committee, and Human and Civil Rights Committee.
Clinton graduated from Truman State in 1996 with a BFA in art.
He began teaching art in 2001 for OCPS and received an MA in art education from the University.
During his free time, Clinton loves drawing with oil pastels and spending time with his best friend and husband, Mike.
