Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Barbara Akoro as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Ms. Akoro leads her life with resilience and compassion.
After the tragic loss of her children's father, she raised her two children with remarkable strength and determination.
In addition to her family responsibilities, 
Ms. Akoro has achieved significant academic milestones, earning degrees in chemistry and forensic chemistry, and she will soon complete her doctorate in public health.
She has worked as a laboratory scientist and caregiver and has interned with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent, focusing on climate change as a public health environmental specialist.
Driven by her passion for helping others, 
Ms. Akoro co-founded TishZeeLCC, a home care agency dedicated to ensuring individuals can live healthy lives.
As a member of Rivertown Community Church in Antioch, her faith and values guide her purpose.
Ms. Akoro's commitment to making a meaningful difference is truly an inspiration to our community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, I am proud to recognize Barbara Akoro for her invaluable contributions to our community.
