Mr. Speaker, through academic scholarships and community contributions, the Napa County Hispanic Network has spent an impactful 40 years striving to cultivate the next generation of Latino community leaders in Napa County.
This invaluable mission is central to the health and preservation of our community, as well as the prosperity of our children.
For the terrific work the network has done, we honor them here today.
