Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Napa County Hispanic Network for the occasion of their 40th anniversary.
As the oldest Latino nonprofit organization in Napa County, the Napa County Hispanic Network seeks to develop the Napa County Latino community through political and economic empowerment, pursuit of education, and social advocacy.
The network was established in 1983 by a group of local professionals seeing a gap in access to services for the Spanish-speaking community.
In addition to emphasizing collaboration, voluntary civil service, and the value of cultural heritage for Latino communities, the network raises critical funds for Napa County students in their pursuit of higher education.
With a mission of closing the opportunity gap for Napa County's Latino students financial needs, the Napa County Hispanic Network has worked tirelessly to increase access to financial support and scholarship services for graduating high school students in our district.
Since its founding, the network has distributed over $500,000 of academic scholarships to more than 700 Napa County students, with the organization increasing their annual impact each year.
Higher education in the United States has always been heralded as the road to career success and fulfillment for our children.
By providing students from our county with scholarship funds that empower that pathway, the network has performed an incredible service to our community.
In 2024, the Napa County Hispanic Network awarded $41,000 in the form of $1,000 to $2,500 scholarships through seven different programs, the largest contributions for a single year to date.
As college costs have risen over the years, the network has increased its level of support to help parents navigate the growing financial challenges of sending their children to college and university.
The impact of assisting children's journeys through education will benefit students and their families for generations to come.
