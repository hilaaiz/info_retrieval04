Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 8th annual Chinese American Culture and Arts Festival for Detroit China Day.
This year also marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.-China relations, a time to recognize the cultural and economic contributions of Chinese Americans to Michigan.
Detroit China Day, which allows the community to experience the richness of Chinese culture and to build stronger ties with members of our community, is worthy of commendation.
Michigan's 6th Congressional District is home to one of the largest concentrations of Chinese Americans in the Midwest.
In these challenging times, when our Nation faces divisions that may seem insurmountable, it is essential to embrace and celebrate our diversity.
This festival is a testament to the power of unity among different cultures through showcasing Chinese performances, fashion shows, live paintings, food and tea tastings, and more.
By sharing and educating our fellow community members on our stories, traditions, and art, we can bridge divides and cultivate understanding to strengthen the bonds that connect us all.
This year marks the 45th anniversary of the normalization of U.S.- China relations and provides a fitting opportunity to reflect on the contributions of Chinese Americans to our community, state, and Nation.
Their entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, and hard work have been pivotal in driving economic growth and fostering a thriving business environment.
Chinese American professionals and entrepreneurs have left an indelible mark on our economic landscape, demonstrating resilience, creativity, and leadership.
