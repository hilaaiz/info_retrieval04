Mr. Sova is a generous local leader who has dedicated his life to making his fellow community members feel accepted.
For the past 54 years, Gerry has worked to ensure that Captain Keno's could accommodate anyone who wanted a safe space to eat, drink, and simply feel welcome.
Over the years, 
Mr. Sova has fed thousands of local firefighters, nonprofit groups, and customers during special holiday meals-- regardless of whether they could afford to pay or not.
With Captain Keno's set to permanently close at the end of August, it is my honor to recognize Gerry for his selfless dedication to giving back to others.
He is an inspiring member of our community whose work and commitment over the past five decades is truly admirable, and I'm proud to honor Gerry Sova as my July 2024 Constituent of the Month.
