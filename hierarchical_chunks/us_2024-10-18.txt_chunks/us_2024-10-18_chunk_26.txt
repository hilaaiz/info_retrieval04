As Vice Treasurer and Violet Richardson Scholarship Chair for the Soroptimist of El Cerrito, she skillfully manages financial responsibilities while championing educational opportunities for young women.
Ms. Olivas' dedication extends to her service as Secretary of the West County Forum and as a board member for the Bay Area Girls Club and the California Association.
At the Contra Costa Association of Realtors, she serves as a Trustee for the Scholarship Foundation, where she has significantly increased both the number of applications and the diversity of recipients.
As Vice Chair of the Local Government Relations Committee, she advocates for policies that best support our community's needs.
Beyond these roles, 
Ms. Olivas is an active participant in various local committees, including the Richmond Rotary and the Galileo Club of Richmond, where she spearheads fundraising initiatives to support local projects.
