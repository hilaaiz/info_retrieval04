Mr. Speaker, the Calistoga Library has evolved from small beginnings into a beloved institution deserving of our recognition for its 100 years of service to all whom love to learn.
Over the decades, the building and organization has become a staple of our town.
Years of quality service to our community have embedded the library as a core aspect of the town.
Without it, Calistoga would not be the same.
As such, it is fitting and proper that it be honored on this terrific anniversary as we look forward to the next 100 years of meaningful education and civil service.
