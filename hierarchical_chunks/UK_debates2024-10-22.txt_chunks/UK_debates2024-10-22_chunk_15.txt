I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
My right hon.
and learned Friend the Prime Minister met the President of the European Commission on  2 October , and agreed to strengthen the relationship between the EU and the UK and to hold regular UK-EU summits.
The Foreign Secretary attended the EU Foreign Affairs Council  on  14 October  in Luxembourg, and he and the High Representative agreed to advance discussions towards a new UK-EU security partnership.
I have had many meetings bilaterally, and indeed as part of processes alongside EU colleagues, on issues from Moldova to the western Balkans in recent weeks.
