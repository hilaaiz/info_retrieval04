I welcome the statement, but the BBC reports that the money will be paid not in one go but in tranches over time.
We have the Budget next week.
Will the Secretary of State assure us that, given that the money is what accountants would call an “exceptional item”, it will in no way be included in the overall defence budget next week, or attempt to bolster or bump that up?
There are rumours of cuts, so will the right hon.
Gentleman assure us that the money is a one-off that will be treated completely differently in the Red Book?
