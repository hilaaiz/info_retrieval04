I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
I offer my condolences and those of Opposition Members   to the family and friends of Corporal Christopher Gill, who we understand tragically lost his life during a training exercise recently.
We understand that he served his country for 13 years, including in Afghanistan, and more recently volunteered to train Ukrainian soldiers in the UK.
