I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
Culture, Media and Sport Ministers are responsible for Government policy on touring artists, with support from colleagues across Government.
The Government provide support for artists via the music export growth scheme, funded by the Department for Business and Trade and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the international showcase fund, funded by the DBT.
We are engaging with the EU and member states to explore how best to improve arrangements for touring in Europe without a return to free movement.
