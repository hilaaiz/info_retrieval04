I thank the Secretary of State for his statement, its content and for advance sight of it.
The additional funding for Ukraine is very welcome, but it is what matériel they turn the funding into that will have the effect on the battlefield that we wish to see.
With the shell production of European partners still well short of a million units per year, will the Secretary of State indicate how UK shell production has grown, either in numeric or percentage terms?
If he cannot share that with the House, will he give us an assurance that it is increasing?
