He will know that over the 973 days the UK Government have changed fundamentally the way in which we go about procuring what is required.
British industry has responded magnificently to that.
It has been able to respond more quickly, innovate more rapidly and devise what it can produce to meet the needs that Ukraine says it has on the frontline.
The UK Government’s task is to be the middle man to ensure that that can happen at greater volume and speed.

Gentleman was listening to my statement, but I made it clear that this is a critical period in the conflict.
Ukraine is under  huge pressure, especially on the eastern front, but it is fighting, conducting a counter-offensive and putting Putin under pressure.
The only conclusion that the 32 nations drew from the discussions in Brussels, confirmed by the G7 nations in Naples, was that now is the moment when Ukraine’s allies must step up our support, put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to withstand the Russian onslaught and put pressure on Putin—a military, economic and diplomatic response.
