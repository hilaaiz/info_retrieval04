We can get that into the hands of Ukrainians as soon as it is available for that purpose.
I announced the new contract to produce short-range air defence missiles, the LMMs—lightweight multirole missiles—in the UK.
The initial contract is for 650 and they will be in the hands of Ukrainians from the beginning of next year.
We hope to step that up during the course of 2025.
Where other nations are ready to make available the weaponry that Ukrainians need, the established arrangements for getting it into the hands of Ukrainians are in place.
It is a question not of how, but of how quickly.
The delicious irony of the interest on Kremlin kleptocrats’ ill-gotten gains being used to fund the resistance against Russian aggression will not be lost on Members across the House.
I welcome what the Defence Secretary has said in its entirety.
He will know better than any of us the crucial importance of the NATO alliance machinery in assisting Ukrainian resistance.
Given that one recent former American President and one current French President have both made disobliging remarks about the NATO alliance in the fairly recent past, will the Secretary of State reassure us that at least President Macron is now fully on board with the alliance and France’s important contribution to it?
I will indeed.
At no point during the two days of NATO Defence Ministers’ talks was there any indication of the sort of views that the right hon.
Gentleman suggests that some in America may hold, or that President Macron might have previously expressed.
Indeed, in the good bilateral meeting that I had with the French Minister for the Armed Forces, Sébastien Lecornu, it was clear that the French commitment to supporting Ukraine is as strong as the UK’s.
I am glad to say that the determination of the French to work more closely with us on security and defence is equally strong.
