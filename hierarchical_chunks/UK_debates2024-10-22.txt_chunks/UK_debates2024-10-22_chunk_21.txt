UNIFIL and UN Security Council resolution 1701 plainly have not prevented the construction of tunnels and forward attack positions by Iranian proxies south of the Litani river.
What discussions will the Foreign Secretary be having with the United Nations to ensure that something is put in place to replace 1701, to strengthen the role of UNIFIL and prevent aggressive action by Hezbollah and its fellow travellers?
The first thing we have to do is get Hezbollah back north of the Litani river, consistent with 1701.
We should not move away from 1701 until we have made progress under it.
I recognise the force of what the right hon.
Gentleman says about the concerns about Hezbollah’s presence close to the Israeli border, in breach of UN Security Council resolutions.
I condemn the attacks, including the missile strikes that have been happening since  8 October , and all the other violence that Lebanese Hezbollah has been responsible for.
It is proscribed under UK law and we hold no truck with it, but the way to get Hezbollah away from the border  is 1701, and that is what we have to stick to.
Finn Pugh, who is eight years old and is one of my constituents, wrote to me.
He said: “Lebanon is a wonderful place.
It does not deserve this.
I would like the Government to protect the people of Lebanon and give them supplies like food and water.”
What reassurances can the Minister give Finn?
