I can absolutely assure the hon.
Member that it is increasing.
I have already spoken about the production of short-range air defence missiles—the LMMs—which is increasing to meet what the Ukrainians need.
The Ukrainians are clear that air defence systems and long-range drones are the things that matter most to their defence and to their ability to put Russia properly under pressure.
I warmly welcome today’s announcement of an additional £2.2 billion in financial support for Ukraine, generated by frozen Russian assets.
Will my right hon.
Friend say a little more about the concerning development of North Korean soldiers supporting Russia’s war of aggression on European soil, and how that underlines the importance of us using every tool in our box to support Ukraine’s efforts?
I regret to say to my hon.
Friend that I am not in a position to give the House any more details about that.
Suffice it to say, we are watching and monitoring this extremely closely.
We and the House have detected a growing co-operation between North Korea and Russia, and between Iran and Russia, at least over the past 12 months.
It is a sign not of strength but weakness on Putin’s part, but it introduces a dangerous new development, both for Ukraine and for wider European security.
