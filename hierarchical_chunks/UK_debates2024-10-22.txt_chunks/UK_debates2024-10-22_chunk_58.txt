The principle behind this funding is that we put it in the hands of the Ukrainians.
The Ukrainians are in the best position—and must be in the position—to decide how best to use it.
We have said that they can use it entirely on military support if they choose to do so; the support that they choose to procure with it will be a matter for them, in discussion with us.
Is the Defence Secretary able to share with us any conversations that the Foreign Secretary had while in China about China’s engagement in this situation, and particularly its willingness to bring to bear the influence that it undoubtedly has on both Russia and North Korea?
Happily, I can indeed.
The Foreign Secretary was in China on 18 and  19 October .
He met his counterpart, the Foreign Minister, and talked about the areas on which our countries may disagree, including on Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.
He also raised the UK’s concerns over China’s supply of equipment to Russia and to Russia’s military industrial complex.
I, too, very much welcome today’s statement from my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State.
It provides evidence not just of warm words, but of real practical support for our ally in its desperate hour of need.
But this country cannot do this on its own.
Can he update the House on any discussions that he or his ministerial colleagues have had with our friends in the rest of the G7 on combating Putin through economic measures?
I can indeed do so.
I came away from the G7 meeting in Naples and from the meeting of NATO Defence Ministers in Brussels reinforced in my view that there is a determination not just to stand with Ukraine now, but to do so for as long as it takes.
I will send my hon.
Friend a copy of the communiqué from both meetings.
I think he will be encouraged, as I was, by the degree of unanimity and determination not to allow Putin to believe that, if he holds out, the west will give up.
