I thank the shadow Minister for her points.
We absolutely condemn what North Korea is reported to have been doing.
She will have seen in our response to the Iranian transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia that we acted strongly, swiftly and firmly.
We are closely monitoring what Russia is providing to the DPRK in return for its provision of arms and military personnel.
We are deeply concerned about the potential for further transfers, including of ballistic missile-related technology.
That would obviously jeopardise peace and stability not only in Ukraine, but across the world, and we condemn it absolutely.
