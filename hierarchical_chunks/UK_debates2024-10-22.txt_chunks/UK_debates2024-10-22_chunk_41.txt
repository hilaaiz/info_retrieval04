I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement.
Liberal Democrats welcome the new measures announced today to use the profits of frozen assets for Ukraine.
That £2 billion will be of immense value to our Ukrainian allies as they seek to repel Putin’s illegal invasion, not least following the alarming news that 1,500 North Korean troops are currently being trained in Russia to fight in Ukraine, but we must go further, faster.
Russia must not and cannot succeed.
