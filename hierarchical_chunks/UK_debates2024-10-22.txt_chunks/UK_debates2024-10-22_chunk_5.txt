I thank my right hon.
Friend for all that she has done so far on this issue.
My constituents, including Damon and Annie, are extremely concerned that every day things are only getting worse.
The UN says that all essential supplies for survival are running out.
Given the abject conditions in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly non-existent is unconscionable.
A year on from the start of the conflict, we are still debating restrictions on the flow of aid by Israeli authorities.
What more can my right hon.
Friend do to ensure that people who are dying from hunger, thirst and lack of medical care receive the attention they need?
