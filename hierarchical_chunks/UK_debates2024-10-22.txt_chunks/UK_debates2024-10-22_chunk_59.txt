I welcome the announcement of the acceleration loan scheme.
I also welcome the timing; the British Government are  not simply waiting to see the outcome of the US presidential election, as some other Governments are doing.
Will the Defence Secretary repeat the assurance he gave in the House last week that, regardless of US policy, military aid to Ukraine from European NATO nations will not decrease next year?
