I thank my hon.
Friend for her important question.
We are absolutely clear that attacks by the IDF on UNIFIL bases must stop, and they must stop immediately.
We have called on Israel to that effect.
We have called on all parties to uphold their obligations in ensuring the safety and security of UNIFIL personnel.
I am sure that many in this House will be looking each day at the reports from UNIFIL on the situation there.
As I have said in answer to previous questions, only a political solution consistent with UN Security Council resolution 1701 can restore stability and security.
We continue to raise these matters with the Israelis at every level, and I will continue to do so this week.
