I thank the Minister for that response.
Legal immigration is very important, and people should have that opportunity if they have been persecuted or there are human rights issues, but   economic migrants have to be stopped in their countries.
France also has a very clear part to play, and we sometimes feel that it has not done so as strongly as it should have done.
Has the Minister had an opportunity to speak to her French counterpart to ensure that France plays its part in stopping the economic migrants coming across the channel?
