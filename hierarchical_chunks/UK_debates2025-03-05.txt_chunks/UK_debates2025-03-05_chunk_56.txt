My hon.
Friend is right to make that point about digitisation and efficiency.
Following the first phase of the spending review, I have funded ongoing work to improve digitisation of all our court processes, because, as my hon.
Friend has said, we need to move away from our current paper-based and paper-heavy systems.
Part 2 of Sir Brian Leveson’s work, which will produce a report in the autumn, will involve looking at cross-system efficiency as well.
My hon.
Friend is right about the need to increase productivity and efficiency, because that will be the final part of the puzzle if we are to sort out the backlog.
