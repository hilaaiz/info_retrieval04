I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his remarks and I pay tribute to him for his bravery in his own personal life, as he has sought justice for the crimes committed against him.
His journey reflects that of too many people across our country.
I have constituents whose cases are trapped in the Crown court backlog, so I hear regularly of the impact that it is having, and I am alive to the human cost.
That is why, at every available opportunity, I have sought to make progress in increasing funding and allocation in-year and have made this record settlement for the next year.
Of course, I know that we need to go further and do more.
The work of Sir Brian Leveson is crucial because we know that without reform, no matter how much the Crown court sits, that backlog will still rise.
I hope that when that review reports, I can count on support for reform from across the House.
I hope that all those who want to see the Crown court backlog come down will want that reform.
We have ringfenced funding for victims of rape and serious sexual offences, as well as domestic abuse.
We will shortly set out our victims Bill, which will include further measures to strengthen the victims code.
