The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 5 March.
Tomorrow marks 13 years since six young British soldiers were on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive, tragically killing them all.
Sergeant Nigel Coupe was 33, Corporal Jake Hartley was 20, Private Anthony Frampton was 20, Private Daniel Wade was 20, Private Daniel Wilford was 21, and Private Christopher Kershaw was just 19, a teenager.
Tomorrow also marks the 18th anniversary of the death of Benjamin Reddy, a 22-year-old serving with 42 Commando Royal Marines, who was killed in Helmand Province in 2007.
These men fought and died for their country—our country.
Across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies.
Many more were wounded.
We will never forget their bravery and their sacrifice.
I know that the whole House will join with me in remembering them and all those who serve our country.
[Hon.
Members: “Hear, hear.”
