I thank the Prime Minister for his comments on that.
He will know that it is not just the security situation that worries people; they are also concerned about trade wars and the economic impact of tariffs such as those levelled on Canada and Mexico yesterday.
The best way to avoid America putting tariffs  on Britain is to reach agreement on a trade deal.
Following the Prime Minister’s trip to Washington, have talks on a UK-US trade deal begun?
