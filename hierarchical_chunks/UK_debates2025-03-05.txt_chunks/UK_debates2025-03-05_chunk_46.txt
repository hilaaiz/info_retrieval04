I congratulate the Lord Chancellor on the figures that she has announced and on starting to get to grips with her baleful inheritance.
However, there is a long way to go.
The Lady Chief Justice told the Lords Constitution Committee last week that she was pressing for Crown courts to sit to capacity.
Does the 110,000 figure represent capacity?
If not, what is capacity?
Given that the backlog is 73,000 cases and rising, will the Lord Chancellor guarantee sitting days up to capacity for the whole of the coming year?
In her statement, she rightly promised investment in the family and civil courts to bring those jurisdictions to, or close to, maximum capacity.
Will she make the same commitment for the Crown court?
My hon.
Friend will know that there is a difference between system capacity and maximum judicial capacity.
He is right that the Lady Chief Justice has said that the maximum judicial capacity is 113,000 sitting days in the Crown court.
We are funding 110,000 sitting days there, because in my role as Lord Chancellor, I must be mindful of managing the wider system capacity—the availability not just of judges to sit in the Crown court but of the lawyers, prosecutors, legal aid and defence barristers that underpin the rest of the system.
I am confident that the 110,000 sitting days represent the system capacity, and that is being delivered.
