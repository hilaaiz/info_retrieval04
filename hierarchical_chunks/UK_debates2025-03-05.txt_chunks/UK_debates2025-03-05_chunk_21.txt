I thank the Prime Minister for that answer.
All of us in this House know that the British armed forces are a huge source of pride to our country.
They put themselves in harm’s way to defend our values.
As the Opposition, we support efforts to resolve the conflict, but we cannot write a blank cheque.
If British peacekeeping troops in Ukraine were attacked—whether directly or via proxies—we could be drawn into conflict with Russia.
Can the Prime Minister reassure all those who are concerned about the UK being drawn into war?
