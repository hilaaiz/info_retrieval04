I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the cross-party support for the Prime Minister’s actions on Ukraine and, indeed, defence.
Scotland needs all its political leaders to stand up proudly for our defence  industry.
Scotland has led the UK in defence, and has been home to its nuclear deterrent since the 1960s.
I recently hosted a defence industry roundtable to discuss sector priorities and opportunities, and, as part of our Brand Scotland programme, I have discussed those in Norway and south-east Asia.
I welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement of new SME spending targets for defence, which will boost access to UK defence investment, unlocking new jobs in the process.
