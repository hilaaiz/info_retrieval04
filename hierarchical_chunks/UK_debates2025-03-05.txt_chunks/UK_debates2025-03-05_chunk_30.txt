By cosying up to Putin, Trump is making Europe less safe.
We all recognise the need for Europe to adapt.
Germany is changing its fiscal rules to boost investment in defence and infrastructure and creating a €500 billion fund to strengthen its future.
Will the Prime Minister please consider a similar approach, focusing on strategic investment rather than imposing further hardship on the poorest through cuts to welfare and international aid?
As the right hon.
Lady knows, it is important that, if we are to increase defence spending as we are, and to have that fully costed and fully funded, we need to put that plan before the House, which is what I did last week.
She talks about fiscal rules and funding, but I have to say that it was highly regrettable that Plaid Cymru voted against £1.6 billion to fund public services in Wales.
She needs to explain how that helps her constituents and the people of Wales.
This year marks 40 years since the Swann report exposed systemic racism and discrimination in the education system.
Regrettably, none of its recommendations was recommended.
One of the most damning injustices in the report was the misclassification of mainly black children as educationally subnormal, as identified in Steve McQueen’s BBC documentary.
Given the historic nature of this and the impact it had on so many, will  the Prime Minister consider a public inquiry to  provide justice and recompense for those who have been affected?
