Yesterday I visited Kingston’s Army Reserve centre and met members of the Royal Army Medical Service who had served bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan, so I associate myself with the Prime Minister’s initial remarks.
On Monday the Prime Minister rightly said that a minerals deal only was not a sufficient security guarantee for Ukraine.
The Trump Administration has since said that a minerals deal is the only guarantee on the table, and President Trump has removed military aid from Ukraine and said that the British cannot share American intelligence with Kyiv.
Both those decisions mean that more brave Ukrainians will die, while further emboldening Vladimir Putin.
Will the Prime Minister tell the House whether he still believes that President Trump is a reliable ally?
If Ukraine does not get a sufficient security guarantee from the White House, what is the Prime Minister’s plan B?
We work very closely with the United States on defence, security and intelligence, as we have done for many, many years; we are intertwined, and of course they are a reliable ally.
We are operating on that basis day in, day out across the world, as the right hon.
Gentleman knows.
In relation to the situation as it develops, obviously our only focus is on a lasting peace in Ukraine.
There are many moving parts and there are many discussions to be had.
What I am doing is staying focused on what I think is the single most important outcome: a lasting peace in Ukraine, which is good for Ukraine and for Europe and, of course, essential for the United Kingdom.
