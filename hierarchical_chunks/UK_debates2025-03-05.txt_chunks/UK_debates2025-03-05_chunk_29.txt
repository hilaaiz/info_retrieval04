I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this familiar topic.
We inherited a SEND system that failed to meet the needs of children and families.
That is why we are investing £1 billion in SEND,  alongside £740 million for councils to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools and to ensure that special schools can cater for children with the most complex needs.
We are working closely with partners in Devon to deliver an accelerated progress plan and we have deployed SEND advisers to offer support to the local authority.
