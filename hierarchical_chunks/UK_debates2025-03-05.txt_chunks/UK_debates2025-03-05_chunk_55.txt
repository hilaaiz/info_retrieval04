I welcome the Lord Chancellor’s announcement of additional sitting days.
The Justice Committee has been looking into the court backlog issue, and we have also been hearing about the ongoing need for the digitisation of court and wider criminal justice processes.
We need to replace the creaking paper-based system, which is contributing to the delays.
Will the Lord Chancellor continue to support drives for successful digitisation of those processes, and will she also join me in congratulating the Conservative party on marking International Women’s Day in such style?
