The hon.
Gentleman asked about targets and timelines—forgive me, the shadow Justice Secretary also raised that point.
I have committed to once-in-a-generation reform of our Crown courts.
Once Sir Brian Leveson’s review has reported and the Government have made decisions on the recommendations that they will take forward and have legislation ready, we will be able to set out the impact of future legislation to bring down that Crown court backlog.
I am absolutely flabbergasted by some of the things that the shadow Justice Secretary,  the right hon.
Member for Newark (Robert Jenrick)  said today.
I assure him that this backlog has not materialised just over the last eight months.
I can say that as a Crown prosecutor who worked throughout the 14 years of the last Government and saw the waiting lists go up and up, despite the best efforts of the hard-working staff throughout the criminal justice service.
Will the Lord Chancellor confirm that the measures that she has announced will finally allow victims, including those in my constituency, to have some confidence that there is finally a Government who will tackle this issue?
“Flabbergasted” is one way of describing it, and it is probably the only one that you will find to be in order, Mr Speaker, so I shall refrain  from using other language.
My hon.
Friend is a former prosecutor, so she knows whereof she speaks, and I pay tribute to her for the work that she did in her former profession.
The message should go out loud and clear to her constituents, and to people up and down the country, that this Government are acting to deal with the Crown courts backlog.
We have a plan.
We have increased funding, and we are considering the reform that is needed, and has been ducked by too many others, to get the system sorted out once and for all.
I refer the House to my registered voluntary interests.
