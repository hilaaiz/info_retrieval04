I thank my hon.
Friend, who is doing a fantastic job for her constituents.
The Employment Rights Bill is the biggest upgrade to workers’ rights in a generation and will benefit more than 10 million workers in every corner of the country.
It will tackle low pay, poor conditions and poor job security that hold our country back.
It is pro-worker, pro-business and pro-growth.
