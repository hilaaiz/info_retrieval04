The Prime Minister is quite right, and we on the Opposition side of the House agree with him.
The objective for his visit to Washington was to get that US security guarantee for Ukraine, and I commend his efforts in that very difficult task.
None the less, on Monday the United States withdrew military aid for Ukraine.
Can he update the House on the steps he is taking to persuade America that it is also in its national interest to provide a security guarantee?
I am pleased to inform the House that on Thursday of last week we did discuss security guarantees.
The President made absolutely clear his commitment to article 5 of NATO, made absolutely clear that he would have our backs because of the relationship between our parties, and agreed that our teams would sit down together to talk through security guarantees.
I have spoken to him, I think, three times since then on the telephone, because it is vitally important that we work with the US, with Europe and with Ukraine and ensure that if there is a deal, it has proper security guarantees in place.
I know that the Prime Minister is unable to comment on specific intelligence matters, and I am certainly not asking him to do that.
However, there are concerning reports that the United States has instructed Britain to suspend intelligence sharing with Ukraine, and there are other reports that Five Eyes itself may be at risk.
We need to ensure that America does not disengage.
There are some in the House who argue that Europe should go it alone, but does he agree with me that without this country’s greatest ally, any peace agreement would place a terrible burden on Britain and our taxpayers?
I agree wholeheartedly.
That is why, as in the debate we had just two days ago, I have always been clear that we need to ensure that the US, the UK, Europe and Ukraine are working together, but we must not choose between the US and Europe; we never have historically, and we are not going to do so now.
