I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this case.
Her constituents deserve the highest standard of care.
The Conservatives left the NHS in dire straits.
We are investing £26 billion and our reform plan will cut waiting lists.
I am really pleased to say that waiting lists are down and we have delivered over 2 million extra appointments to get the NHS back on its feet.
