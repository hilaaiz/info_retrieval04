Tens of thousands of victims and survivors waiting for their day in court is one of the darkest legacies of the last Conservative Government.
I feel that sincerely because, under that Conservative Government, I was one of those victims.
After two decades of agonising over whether to report my own victimhood as a child, I waited two years for my own opportunity to seek justice in the Crown court.
That is years of your heart racing whenever you get a phone call from an unknown number.
Is it the court?
Is  it the Crown Prosecution Service?
There are years of anxiety that your perpetrator will retaliate, and years of your life excruciatingly on hold.
Many victims today are being forced to sit with all this for far longer than I did.
The Liberal Democrats and I personally welcome the Justice Secretary’s announcement.
However, we all know that a huge backlog will remain, which means that victims and survivors will continue to be let down.
At a time when victims and survivors need more support during these agonising waits, Government funding cuts and national insurance contribution increases are putting services such as Safeline and Victim Support at risk.
Will the Lord Chancellor outline her year by year targets for reducing this backlog, and will she increase, not cut, support for charities to ensure that victims and survivors get the support that they need and deserve?
