I thank the Minister for her response, but more importantly I thank  the hon.
Member for Edinburgh South West (Dr Arthur)  for setting the scene.
He has clearly explained the importance of having children, and the importance of their having opportunities.
With those opportunities in mind, has the Minister had a chance to discuss with the equivalent Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly how we can better help our children in Northern Ireland, as she wishes to do in Scotland?
