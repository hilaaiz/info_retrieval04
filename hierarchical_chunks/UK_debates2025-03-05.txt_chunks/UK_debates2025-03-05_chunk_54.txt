It is getting worse.
It has got worse, because of the Conservative party.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that, as well as focusing on the measures that she has already proposed, we should continue to focus on reducing crime in the first place, and pursue our policies for tackling youth crime, knife crime and violence against women and girls?
My hon.
Friend is right.
In order to deal with all the problems in the criminal justice system relating to policing, prosecutors and the situation in the Crown courts, we need a system-wide approach.
That means taking action on the crimes that affect neighbourhoods up and down the country, which is why the Home Secretary’s recent Crime and Policing Bill is such a landmark piece of legislation.
We must all play our part, because the criminal justice system has been left in a truly terrible state by the last Administration, and this Government are getting on with the job of sorting it out.
This announcement is small beer, is it not?
The extra £92 million offered for criminal legal aid is exceeded twentyfold by the subsidies given to offshore wind, which amounted to £1.9 billion last year alone.
Why do the Government  have such perverse priorities, and when will they put the criminal justice system above the interests of offshore wind operators?
We are talking about the highest ever funded allocation in the Crown courts, and 110,000 sitting days, which is a record.
The hon.
Gentleman says that is small beer; I wonder whether he had been imbibing something before getting to his feet.
