The Prime Minister knows that we all support him in that effort, but may I take him back to President Trump’s reliability?
Four British women have accused Andrew Tate of rape and human trafficking.
British police have issued arrest warrants.
The Tates have tried to escape justice, first to Romania and now to the United States.
I am delighted that Florida has, thankfully, opened a criminal investigation.
Does the Prime Minister agree that people who are wanted by British police for such appalling crimes should stand trial in our country?
Given his assessment that President Trump really is a reliable ally, will his Government request an urgent extradition of the Tate brothers?
This is a live issue, as the right hon.
Gentleman will appreciate, and therefore I will tread carefully.
The principle is absolutely clear: justice must be done in all cases, including in this case.
But I will not go into the details because this is a live case, as he knows.
I am supporting many parents in Exeter who are struggling to get the support they need for their children within the special educational needs and disabilities system run by Devon county council.
One parent told me that their child was excelling, but after undergoing major surgery she needed additional support to get back into a mainstream school setting.
That has not been possible due to the disarray of the SEND system in Devon and that child is now missing out.
I welcome the new money going to the system.
Will the Prime Minister provide an update on Government work that will also reform the SEND system, to ensure that every child in Exeter has the best start in life?
