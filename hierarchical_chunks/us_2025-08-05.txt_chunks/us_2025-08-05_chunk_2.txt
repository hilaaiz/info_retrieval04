Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of my constituent, Elgin Vines, who turned 90 years old on May 19, 2025.
Through the segregation of the Jim Crow South, on stages big and small across the world, Mr Vines' career as a bassist continues to be a bridge in the jazz community--connecting worlds, hearts, and histories.
Born on May 19, 1935, in Suffolk, Virginia, at a time when the odds were not in his favor, 
Mr. Vines charted a course that was uniquely his own.
As a student at Norfolk State University with a Biology/Medical Technology major, 
Mr. Vines paid his tuition and fees with gigs along the Virginia Beach ``strip,'' before graduating as an ASCP-certified medical technologist.
During that time, he was also a member of the house trio on the daily ``Morty Nevins Television Show'' for three years.
In his eight-year stint as a bassist for the touring group ``The New Direction,'' 
Mr. Vines was a guest on national programs like The Tonight Show.
He has also played alongside giants like Frank Sinatra Sr. and Jr., the Mills Brothers, and toured on the same circuits as Ella Fitzgerald and Elvis Presley.
What 
Mr. Vines remembers most is not the glitz of the spotlight, but the dignity of people who, like him, believed music could tear down walls.
