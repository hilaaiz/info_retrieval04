Ms. DAVIDS.
Mr Speaker, I rise today to honor Deputy Elijah Ming, who gave his life to serving his community.
Deputy Ming began serving with the Wyandotte County Sheriff's Office on October 13, 2016.
In his nine years with the Office, he worked in the Detention Center for six years, spent two years on Patrol, and spent one year in Court Transport.
He was truly everything good you would want in both a law enforcement officer and in a friend.
He was always willing to step in for voluntary overtime and to lend a helping hand.
Deputy Ming's work with the department ensured the safety and wellbeing of Wyandotte County residents.
Our community mourns the loss of Deputy Ming and will miss the bright, positive attitude he brought to the Office.
He was a true patriot and a shining example of courage and dedication.
