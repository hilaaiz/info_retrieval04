Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors in Tampa Bay and the citizens of Florida, I am proud to honor Mary Bryan for her service to the City Tampa Bay.
It is hard-working and selfless public servants like Mary that make Tampa the welcoming and generous place it is today.
Our community is eternally grateful for Mary's immense contributions.
