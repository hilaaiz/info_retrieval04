Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, on the 14th day of October 1959, a meeting was held far from Earth, and it was said, ``It's time for a warrior to be born on Earth.''
This was the birth of Ronald W. Harvey, also known as Ronnie.
He was born and grew up in Harvey, Illinois, where he attended Thornton High School and studied at the Metropolitan State University.
He enjoyed baseball during his high school years.
Later, Ronnie married the love of his life, a dedicated community leader, Mrs. Roxie Harvey.
Ronnie worked for the U.S. Postal Service for over 30 years and retired.
During his tenure at the post office, he played in the post office basketball league and had a fierce 3-point shot.
He and his friend, Speech, secretly started a prayer circle named the Brothers of the Circle.
The group was so effective and grew so large that they had to move the meeting to a bowling alley.
Post retirement, Ronnie worked as a truck driver for Lucky Duck Express and Dynasty Trucking.
He was later ordained and served as Pastor of the Real Love Christian Center in Illinois.
He served as a mentor and went on several mission trips to help improve the lives of others.
He rendered his service and passion by feeding the homeless and listening to and encouraging others in Jesus Christ.
Whether it was in Illinois, Honduras, or Florida, Ronnie's impact will continue to be felt as his legacy will live on through his beloved wife, Roxie, and his seven children.
