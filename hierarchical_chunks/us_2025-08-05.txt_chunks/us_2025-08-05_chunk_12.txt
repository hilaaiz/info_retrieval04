Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere gratitude to Julie's husband, John, for sharing his amazing wife with Team Simpson for all these years.
And I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and honoring Julie Tensen for her decades of outstanding public service to the people of Idaho and this great Nation.
