The Secretary of State was asked— What discussions she has had with the Scottish Government on the potential merits of devolving the power to introduce a Scottish visa scheme.
The hon.
Gentleman has raised this issue on a number of occasions.
He will be aware that we are not introducing a Scottish visa scheme or devolving control of immigration policy, and this has been made clear to the Scottish Government.
Instead, we must together address the underlying causes of skills shortages and overseas recruitment in different parts of the UK, which this Government are doing.
