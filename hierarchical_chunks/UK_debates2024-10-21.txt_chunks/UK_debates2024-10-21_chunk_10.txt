I welcome the points the hon.
Member makes.
To tackle shoplifting, we need to ensure that strong enough laws and policing partnerships are in place, and that we do prevention and follow-up work with young people.
As she may know, we are setting up a new Young Futures programme, which is all about the greater work we need to do to prevent young people being drawn into crime in the first place.
I encourage her to tell us more details about her local work to tackle this issue.
