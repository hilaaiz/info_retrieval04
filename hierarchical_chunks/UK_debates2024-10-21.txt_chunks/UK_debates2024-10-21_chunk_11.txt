The last Conservative Government stood with our brave police officers and emergency service workers.
We introduced tougher sentences for those who assaulted them and the Elizabeth medal to recognise those who lost their lives in the line of duty, and we were looking to recognise those who were discharged from service as a result of injuries on the frontline.
Will the Secretary of State continue that work?
Will she meet with me and former policeman Tom Curry, who has been leading an excellent campaign on this important issue?
I have long been a strong supporter of the Elizabeth medal.
I pay tribute to Bryn Hughes and others for their work campaigning for recognition for police officers and other emergency workers who have been lost in the line of duty, and who have given so much to support other people and keep others safe.
I have attended the police bravery awards every year for  the last 14 years, exactly because it is so important to support brave officers.
I am absolutely determined to ensure that we not only continue with that work, but go further to support brave officers who put their lives at risk.
I am very happy to continue cross-party working on this issue.
