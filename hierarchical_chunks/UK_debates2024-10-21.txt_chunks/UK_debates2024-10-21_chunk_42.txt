I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his comments and questions.
He has always taken a keen interest in the overseas territories, and St Helena in particular.
I am surprised that he is perplexed, because he and his fellow Ministers were grappling with these very decisions and issues in the last Government.
We are providing pragmatic and practical solutions to respond to the situation that we inherited.
There is no comparison with the Rwanda scheme.
He will have just heard the Home Secretary say that spending £700 million of taxpayers’ money resulted in four volunteers for that scheme.
This is a mutually beneficial win-win agreement between the United Kingdom and one of our overseas territories.
I have set out the cost very clearly: £6.65 million for the contingency arrangement, and then the costs for anyone who does arrive.
Let me reiterate, however, that no migrants have arrived on BIOT since 2022.
This is a contingency arrangement that is absolutely necessary, but of course we hope that no one will choose to take such a dangerous route.
