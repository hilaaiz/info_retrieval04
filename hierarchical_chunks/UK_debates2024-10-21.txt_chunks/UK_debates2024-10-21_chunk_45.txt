The hon.
Gentleman mentions existing migrants on the island.
They are not included in this arrangement, and we continue to work at pace to find long-term, durable solutions.
I will not go into the details; that would be inappropriate, given the legal complexities around the small group of individuals who are there.
On his point about the media coverage of alleged hacks, those are subject to an ongoing police investigation in Mauritius, so I do not want to comment, but my understanding is that the allegations are historical, rather than related to the recent negotiation period.
I really welcome the statement, and the clarity that has come with it.
Who will ultimately be responsible for people when they find themselves in St Helena?
