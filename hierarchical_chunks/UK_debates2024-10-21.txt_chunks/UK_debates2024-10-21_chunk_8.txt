I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Ealing Southall (Deirdre Costigan)  for the leadership she is showing in her community.
The point she raises is partly about increasing neighbourhood police numbers, which is part of this Labour Government’s plan.
It is also about ensuring that we have partnerships between the police and local communities, rather than communities feeling that they have to do this alone.
Such partnerships between the police and communities are at the heart of the British model of policing by consent, which is what we need to restore and rebuild after the damage that has been done.
