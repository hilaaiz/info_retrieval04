I thank the Home Secretary for that reply on knife crime.
I welcome the Government’s commitment in the Young Futures programme to preventing young people from being drawn into crime.
A number of gang-associated girls are drawn into crime, and although rape and sexual exploitation is such a traumatising experience, many of those young girls do not see themselves as victims.
Fantastic organisations such as Abianda and Milk Honey Bees work to support women.
Will the Department consider providing tailored support for young women through the Young Futures programme?
