I thank you, Mr Speaker, for making time for Back Benchers in the questions today.
I rise to raise the issue of car theft in my constituency.
Many hundreds of residents have had their cars stolen, and the police do not have the capacity to follow up.
Next year, I am hosting a car theft summit in Chipping Barnet, and I invite the Minister to attend with me.
