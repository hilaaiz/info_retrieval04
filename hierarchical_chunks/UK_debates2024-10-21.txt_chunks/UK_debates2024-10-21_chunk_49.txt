Does the Minister agree that the UK’s new agreement with Mauritius will close a potentially dangerous illegal migrant route?
My hon.
Friend is right:
BIOT is not a suitable place for migrants to be present.
There is no permanent population and there are not the necessary education and health facilities.
That is why we needed to put in place that part of our agreement with Mauritius: to ensure that during the interim, contingency period, were any migrants to arrive—as I said, none have arrived since 2022—they could go to a place where there were hospitals, education, and an economy and a community to support them.
We thank St Helena for its help in this matter.
