I thank the Minister for her tiresome and repetitive response.
She will know that Scotland has a whole range of demographic and population difficulties that need to be urgently addressed, with every sector from social care to hospitality, including business leaders, calling out for drastic action.
Even her Scottish Labour colleagues are beginning to understand the enormity of this task.
Today we find that Labour’s grotesque two-child benefit cap is now having an impact on Scotland’s birth rate.
Instead of slapping down her Scottish colleagues and rejecting this idea out of hand, why does she not work with us just to see if it might actually work?
