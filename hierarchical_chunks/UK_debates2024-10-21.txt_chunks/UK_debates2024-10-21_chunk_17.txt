Despite town and city councils in Cornwall employing street rangers and antisocial behaviour officers and having ShopWatch radios funded from their precept or business improvement districts, shop managers still struggle with shoplifting and ASB.
The record under our Conservative PCC on answering and responding to 101 calls is poor, and those crimes are chronically under-reported.
Shop workers feel powerless and there is a desperate need for more neighbourhood police.
Can the Minister explain how trust in police and the rule of law will be restored to retail staff and shop managers?
As the Home Secretary laid out, extra neighbourhood policing is important not just because we need more police on our streets, but because when our constituents—shop workers and those who own businesses—call the police, if they get no response confidence drops.
The neighbourhood police that there will be across the country, including in Cornwall, will help with confidence, not just with crime.
