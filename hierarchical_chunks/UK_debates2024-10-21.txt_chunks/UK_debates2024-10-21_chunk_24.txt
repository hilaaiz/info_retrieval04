I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue and bringing her concerns—concerns that I share—to the attention of the House.
We regularly monitor and review the situation in countries of origin, working closely with the Foreign Office, and our resulting country policy and information notes are published on the gov.uk website.
Should we assess that the troubling new law to which my hon.
Friend refers, or any other changes, fundamentally affect the justification for Georgia’s designation, we will seek to remove it from the list, using the correct parliamentary process.
