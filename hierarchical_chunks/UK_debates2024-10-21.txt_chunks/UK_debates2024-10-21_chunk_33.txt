Does the Home Secretary share my deep concerns about two-tier justice, given that some people who say some bad, stupid things on social media can be arrested, charged and jailed within a matter of weeks, but some people who brutally and violently assault police officers have not even been charged many months later?
The hon.
Member will know that in this country we have operational independence for the police, and independence for the Crown Prosecution  Service and the courts.
I strongly support police officers, who have faced cases of the most disgraceful violence and attacks.
It is important that we support our police in the face of those attacks and ensure that they have the whole community behind them.
The Home Secretary may be aware of the data that the Internet Watch Foundation released last week on the increasing amount of AI-generated child sexual abuse content available to everyone on the internet, finding that it has increased in the last six months alone.
That is clearly illegal, so what are the UK Government doing to stamp down on that horrific crime?
Let me make it clear that the new Government intend very swiftly to set up new taskforces to ensure that across Departments—in this case, with our counterparts in the Department for Science, Innovation  and Technology—we do everything we can to end the scourge of online child abuse, and child abuse not online.
