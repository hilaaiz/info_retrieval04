I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his questions.
As I said, the Foreign Secretary answered questions about the agreement with Mauritius on BIOT earlier, but the hon.
Gentleman asks for further details of the arrangement with St Helena.
Under the arrangement, if any migrants arrive on BIOT in the future, they will be transferred to St Helena.
They will remain free to depart, and to return to their country of origin, but they will not be able to stay on BIOT.
St Helena would take responsibility for accommodating those individuals and, if appropriate, processing asylum claims.
