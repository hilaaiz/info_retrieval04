I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question; I know he takes a very keen interest in this matter.
We have discussed the overseas territories on  many occasions, and he knows how seriously I take their democracy and autonomy.
That is why it is important to reiterate to the House that this agreement was freely entered into by the Government of St Helena.
They have publicly welcomed it profusely and explained why it is beneficial.
Obviously, they are responsible for their internal processes within St Helena.
We will continue to work with the Government of St Helena, their representatives and, indeed, their Attorney General as we move forward with the agreement.
If I may, I will come back to the hon.
Gentleman on the point he raises about Tristan da Cunha and Ascension, but the agreement is primarily about St Helena because of the facilities that are available there.
