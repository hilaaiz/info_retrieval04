I thank my hon.
Friend for her interest in St Helena, which has been long-standing.
I understand that she visited the island recently, and I welcome her ongoing engagement with the people and the Government there.
We have made it clear that we would support the transfer of anyone who did arrive, but let me reiterate that no one has actually arrived on BIOT since 2022.
This is a contingency measure only, and, of course, it is not a safe place for people to attempt to go to.
This is about closing that route and ensuring that if anyone did make that attempt, they could go to a safe place and be properly supported.
The St Helena Government have made clear how they would accommodate and integrate people in that community.
