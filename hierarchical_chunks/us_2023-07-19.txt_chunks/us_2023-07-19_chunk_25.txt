Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Hempfield Township of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania on the 250th anniversary Since 1773, Hempfield Township has grown into 1 of the largest municipalities in Pennsylvania.
Currently, it is home to over 40,000 people and is the largest municipality in Westmoreland County.
While Hempfield Township is an important hub for business and industry, the township never forgot its rich agricultural heritage.
Hailing from southeastern Pennsylvania, its early settlers were largely area, Hempfield grew and is now home to several manufacturing facilities, institutes of higher education, and recreational businesses that are important to southwestern Pennsylvania's economy.
Above all, the township's people exemplify the values of good citizenship and devotion to their community.
