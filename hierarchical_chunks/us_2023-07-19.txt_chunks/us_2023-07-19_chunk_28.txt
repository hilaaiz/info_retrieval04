Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in the celebration many volunteer firefighters who keep this community safe.
It takes bravery, courage, and skill to run toward a fire while others are moving to safety.
It is because of these brave men and women that Depew families can sleep at night assured that a strong, capable, and welltrained force is at the ready to help in their time of need.
Since 1894, the volunteer corps of the Depew Fire Department has grown to become the largest volunteer fire department in Erie County and 1 of the largest in New York State, with over 115 active members serving 5 Hose Companies and 1 Hook and Ladder Company spread across the village: Hose Company No. 1 Aetna Hose Company Cayuga Hose Company No. 3 Central Hose Company No. 4 West End Hose Company No. 6
Hook and Ladder Company No. 1 This is a close-knit community with deep ties to Depew, and with generations of firefighters stretching back over a century of service.
I thank Chief John Gauthier, for his leadership, and to the many generations of Depew Fire Department volunteers present and represented at the 2023 Depew Founders Day Celebration.
Their service and sacrifice are greatly appreciated, and I wish them all safety and success as they continue to serve this great community.
I am honored to join in the celebration of Depew Founders' Day, and to recognize the dedication and courage of the Depew Fire Department here from the Halls.
