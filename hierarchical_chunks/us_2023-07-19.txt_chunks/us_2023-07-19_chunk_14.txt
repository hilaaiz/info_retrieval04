Mr. Robbins and the U.S. merchant mariners of World War II who played crucial roles in the country's war effort were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2020, the highest honor Congress can bestow on civilians.
It was an honor to present the medal to Mr, Robbins then, and it is an honor to recognize him here again today.
