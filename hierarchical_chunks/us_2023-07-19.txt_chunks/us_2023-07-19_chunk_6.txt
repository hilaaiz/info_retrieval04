Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and offer my thanks to Carlos Graupera, of Lancaster, for his 50 years of service and leadership.
Mr. Graupera retired this year as the Chief Executive Officer of the Spanish American Civic Association (SACA), an organization he founded in 1973 to serve Lancaster's growing Latino community.
In 1961, 
Mr. Graupera emigrated to the United States with his family from Cuba.
He would attend Saint Joseph's College and work in community development, before founding SACA and beginning his tenure as the organization's first CEO.
In 50 years, SACA has grown substantially to support and improve the lives of Lancaster County residents.
SACA operates a senior center, behavior and health services, a community radio station called Radio Centro, supports economic development through SACA Development, and operates a network of workforce development training programs called Tec Centro.
I've been fortunate to see the good work that they do first-hand.
