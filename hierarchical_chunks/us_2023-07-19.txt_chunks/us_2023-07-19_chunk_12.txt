Mr. PANETTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mr. Michael Robbins for his bravery and service as a U.S. merchant mariner during World War II.
Serving from July of 1943 to May of 1946, 
Mr. Robbins sailed with the U.S. Merchant Marine aboard the SS Olney, the SS Pendleton, the SS O. Henry, and the SS Hoke Smith.
During World War II, nearly 250,000 civilian merchant mariners were activated to serve as part of the U.S. military and to delivered troops and supplies by ship to foreign countries engulfed in the war.
They faced treacherous conditions along their routes.
Between 1939 and 1945, 9,521 U.S. merchant mariners gave their lives--a higher proportion than those killed than in any military branch--in defense of our nation.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt called their mission the most difficult and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken.
Hailing from Atlantic City, New Jersey, 
Mr. Robbins enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine at only 15 years old.
He began his wartime efforts as an ordinary seaman, chipping away rust and old paint from the ship.
While aboard SS O. Henry and transporting supplies in the Mediterranean Sea, his convoy was attacked by air.
Mr. Robbins, still a teenager, acted to defend his ship by delivering 20mm ammunition to the ship's crew.
Mr. Robbins would go on to serve in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theaters.
