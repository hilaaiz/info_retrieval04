The American Legion proudly recognizes the contributions veterans have made to our country and shares their stories about their time in service.
Post 1288 is an active participant in various activities including ``Gifts to the Yanks Who Gave'', Poppy Days, Veterans in The Classroom, Blue Star Service Banners, among many others.
These services provide invaluable support to veterans and the local youth while unifying the community behind the cause of public service.
