Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Christopher Raker who passed away at the age of 78 on July 5, 2023.
Christopher was a longtime resident of Mill Valley and beloved member of the community.
Born in San Francisco to John and Elda Jane Raker, Christopher, nicknamed Chris, lived in the Palace Hotel where his grandfather was a general manager.
The family later moved to Concord, Massachusetts and Chris enrolled at Columbia University before joining the Navy and serving as a lieutenant during the Vietnam War.
After his military service Chris earned a master's degrees in English Literature from the University of Virginia, and a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University.
He settled in Mill Valley, California in 1975.
In 1989, Chris opened Raker Architects in Mill Valley.
The firm contributed to key modernizations in Southern Marin, including the Corinthian Yacht Club, Mill Valley Lumber Yard, and most notably, Mill Valley Miller Avenue Precise Plan, which resulted in the development of a pedestrian-friendly reconfiguration
