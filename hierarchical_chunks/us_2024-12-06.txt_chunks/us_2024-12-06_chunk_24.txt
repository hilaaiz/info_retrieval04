Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Technical Sergeant (TSgt) Lacey McCuean on her retirement from the United States Air Force.
TSgt McCuean enlisted into the Air National Guard on March 15, 2023, with the 171st Air Refueling Wing with a Personnel AFSC.
She quickly distinguished herself through exceptional dedication and service, taking it upon herself to initiate and revamp ten Squadron file plans and earning an outstanding score during staff-assisted visits.
TSgt McCuean completed 30 promotion packages--no mean feat, and true commitment to developing her peers.
Then transitioning to the 193rd Special Operations Wing, TSgt McCuean played a pivotal role in enhancing mission readiness by enlisting 55 new Airmen, briefing over 1,000 individuals on Air National Guard opportunities, and mentoring future leaders through the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps.
She was a key figure during Operation Allies Welcome, serving in a senior leadership role, and streamlining inprocessing operations that reduced reception time by 25 percent for three lodging compounds for over 16,500 refugees, and chaired the Commander's support staff for a 200-member squadron.
In addition to exemplary service, TSgt McCuean volunteered at local food banks aiding over 1,000 at-risk families, while balancing her academics, maintaining a 3.5 GPA, and earning a dual Bachelor's degree in business and non-profit leadership.
TSgt McCuean is known by her peers for her remarkable energy, demeanor, confidence, leadership skills, and contagious morale.
