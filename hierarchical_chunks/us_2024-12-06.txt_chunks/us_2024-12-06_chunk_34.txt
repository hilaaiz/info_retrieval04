Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a longstanding employer in Eastover, South Carolina.
The Sylvamo Eastover Mill is celebrating 40 years of operation, and I join them in marking this significant occasion.
Sylvamo operates some of the most technologically advanced paper mills in the world and is driven by the promise of paper to educate, communicate, and entertain.
The Eastover Mill is the largest, lowestcost producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America and the fourth-largest manufacturing employer in Richland County, South Carolina.
Iconic paper brands like Hammermill, HP, and Williamsburg are all produced at the Eastover Mill, along with a variety of paper products that are staples of American businesses and homes.
Sylvamo's Eastover Mill proudly employs 800 men and women and supports over 5,000 additional jobs in related industries in surrounding communities.
Additionally, through its Community Council, the Mill has demonstrated a longterm commitment to listening to and addressing community concerns.
Over the last few years, Sylvamo has provided several hundred thousand dollars to local nonprofits like Transitions Homeless Services, Harvest Hope Food Bank, and the local United Way.
