Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 30th Annual Anaheim Tree Lighting Festival, which will bring our community together this Sunday, December 8, 2024.
The festival rings in the holidays with a very special tree-lighting celebration on the steps of Anaheim City Hall in Downtown Anaheim.
For the past 30 years, the Annual Anaheim Tree Lighting Festival has provided holiday fun to everyone in our community--and it is one of my hometown's favorite annual celebrations.
The City of Anaheim worked together with many community partners to create this event, including Children Dental Fun Zone, Credit Union of Southern California, Home Comfort USA, Knorr, Land Care, Taqueritos, The Frida Cinema, Zambos, and the Orange County District Attorney's Office.
This year, the Anaheim Tree Lighting Festival includes entertainment and food, a Holiday Village, the Candy Canine Costume Contest, a visit with Santa & 
Mrs. Claus, a brief performance of The Nutcracker by the Anaheim Ballet Company, and the Tree Lighting Ceremony in front.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Anaheim Tree Lighting Festival, which for 30 years has brought joy and festive spirits to help greet the holiday season.
