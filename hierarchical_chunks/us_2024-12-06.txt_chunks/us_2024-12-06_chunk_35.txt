community cleanup days, Reading Is Fundamental book giveaways with local schools, the Lunch Buddies School Program, and holiday events with the Eastover Senior Resources Group.
In honor of Eastover's 40th anniversary, Sylvamo has also pledged an additional $40,000 donation to local organizations, including Webber Elementary, Richland County Library, Mother DeVeaux Adult Day Care, and Harvest Hope Food Bank.
The Eastover Mill and Sylvamo are also committed to the long-term health of our forests and ecosystems.
They partner with Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI)- certified suppliers to ensure that the fiber used in their paper products is harvested from responsibly managed forests in surrounding areas.
The Mill also proudly produces over 90 percent of its energy inhouse from renewable, carbon-neutral biomass residuals.
As part of its 2030 Sustainability Goals, Sylvamo is committed to increasing workforce diversity by achieving 30 percent women's representation, 35 percent women in leadership, and 25 percent minority representation in North American salaried positions alongside specific regional targets.
