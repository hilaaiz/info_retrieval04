Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in congratulating Sylvamo's Eastover Mill on its 40th Anniversary.
The Eastover Mill is a shining example of the future of American manufacturing--producing the paper we rely on responsibly and sustainably, supporting family-wage jobs, and contributing to the Eastover and Richland County communities.
I wish Sylvamo continued prosperity and success in the years to come.
