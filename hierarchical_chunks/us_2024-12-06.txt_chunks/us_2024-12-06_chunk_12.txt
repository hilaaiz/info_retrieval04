Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of General Chris Donahue and congratulate him on his promotion to four-star General as he relinquishes his long and distinguished command of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Liberty.
A proud West Point graduate, General Donahue has dedicated his life to serving this country.
Starting off as a Ranger, General Donahue has deployed over 20 times throughout his career.
His deployments took him to active combat zones including in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.
General Donahue has served in numerous leadership positions including Director of Operations for Joint Special Operations Command, the Commandant at the Infantry School in Ft. Benning, and most recently as Commanding General of the XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Liberty.
During his time at Fort Liberty General Donahue embodied his motto of ``leaders jump first and eat last'' as he always put the service members under his command first.
General Donahue instituted the Sunset Liberty March, designed to honor veterans, active-duty service members and Gold Star Families.
This incredible initiative brings together members of the community, veteran groups and active-duty service members to remember and commemorate those who have given their lives in defense of this country, as well as their family members.
I am so proud to have worked with this great American and am excited to see him succeed throughout the rest of his honorable career.
Because of his vast leadership experience, and clear dedication to his country, I can think of no one better to be promoted to four-star General.
While Ft. Liberty is sure to miss General Donahue's leadership, we look forward to his continued service to our great Nation as a four-star General.
