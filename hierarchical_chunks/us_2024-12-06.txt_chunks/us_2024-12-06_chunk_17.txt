Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of ``Almanac'', the iconic Twin Cities PBS television show and the longest-running primetime TV program in Minnesota history.
On December 7, 1984, Almanac broadcast its first episode, beaming in-depth coverage of state and federal public affairs into Minnesotans' homes.
Forty years later, the program continues to inform audiences every Friday evening about the latest developments in politics, government, history, culture, sports, and more.
Today, program hosts Eric Eskola and Cathy Wurzer are joined by reporters Mary Lahammer and Kaomi Lee, in addition to local personalities Kevin Kling, Sheletta Brundidge, Tane Danger, Paul Douglas, Larry Fitzgerald, Sr., and others.
Under the guidance of producer Kari Kennedy and a variety of expert guests and public figures, this team uses their deep knowledge of our state to provide analysis, entertain, and inform viewers about the issues shaping Minnesotans' lives.
Throughout its 40 years, Almanac has played a special role in Minnesota politics as a source of in-depth reporting, thoughtful analysis, and even music and humor.
This Friday night TV staple has enhanced our state by fostering respectful discussion across party lines and informing viewers in every corner.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in celebrating the 40th Anniversary of Almanac, a trusted and reliable pillar of journalism in Minnesota, broadcast on Twin Cities Public Television and livestreamed via the PBS App every Friday night at 7:00 p.m. Central.
