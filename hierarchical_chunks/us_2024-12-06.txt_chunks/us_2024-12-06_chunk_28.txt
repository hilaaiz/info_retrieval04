Mr. Speaker, I'm honored and privileged to recognize the Chambers Hill Fire Company on the auspicious occasion of their 70th Anniversary.
On behalf of a grateful 10th District of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the United States of America, their service sets the standard by which we all should be judged.
