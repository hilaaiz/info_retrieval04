Mr. CROW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of the 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office of Colorado, led currently by District Attorney John Kellner, and serving Arapahoe, Douglas, Elbert, and Lincoln Counties.
In January 1962, the 18th Judicial District was established.
Initially comprised of Arapahoe and Douglas Counties, Elbert County was added in 1965, followed by Lincoln County in 1969.
The 18th Judicial District, with a geographic size larger than the state of Connecticut, has grown more than any other Colorado judicial district during that time and now has a population exceeding one million people.
Within the next decade, Arapahoe County's population is expected to grow to be the most populous county in the state.
In 2020, the Colorado General Assembly established a new judicial district.
Next year, Douglas, Elbert and Lincoln Counties will form a newly created 23rd Judicial District, while Arapahoe County will be the sole county in the existing 18th Judicial District.
Officials of the 18th Judicial District--prosecutors, victim witness specialists, support staff, and law enforcement officers--work hard every day to pursue justice, advocate for victims and support our community.
As a Member of Congress, I look forward to continuing to work with our local law enforcement officials to promote public safety.
