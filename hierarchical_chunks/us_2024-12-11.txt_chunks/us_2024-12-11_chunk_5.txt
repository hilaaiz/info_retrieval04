Mr. Jack Nance, Executive Director of the Carolinas Golf Association (CGA) after 32 years of dedicated service in this role.
Jack is a proud North Carolina native, he was born and raised in Clinton, North Carolina and attended high school and college in our great state.
Jack is an avid golfer and has been a huge fan of the sport ever since his college days where he played golf at Wake Forrest and even served as the assistant coach for the golf team following his graduation.
Throughout his tenure at the CGA, Jack has seen the organization grow to over 700 affiliated clubs that represent over 200,000 members.
We will always appreciate the dedication Jack has shown to ensuring that golfers in the Carolinas have a great sporting experience and North Carolina maintains its reputation of the best state for golf.
Jack has worked for the CGA since 1984 and has served as a rules official, communications point of contact and a course rater, before finally serving as Executive Director, a position he has held since 1992.
Jack even qualified for the 1980 US Amateur as a player.
Nobody knows our courses quite like Jack and we will certainly miss his unique perspective.
We know Jack is looking forward to being able to spend more time with his wife DeAnn and his two daughters Caroline and Liza.
While we are sad to see Jack go, we wish him and his family the best as he begins this new and exciting chapter in his life.
