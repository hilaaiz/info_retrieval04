Mr. LOPEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Wellington High School football team for making it to the Colorado 2A State Championship game in only their third season with a record of 10-3.
The town of roughly 12,000 residents last had a High School between 1926 and 1964.
Wellington Middle-High School opened in August of 2022, choosing to honor the previous school's colors and mascot, the Eagles.
The combination of the players' determination and their coaches' admirable leadership throughout their playoff run culminated into a remarkable season.
They are great examples of the extraordinary potential of the young people.
I thank the players for setting an example that will serve as an inspiration for future generations of high school athletes.
They should all be extremely proud of what they have accomplished and know that this is just a precursor for the many great achievements each of them will have in their lifetimes.
