Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the Bishop McDevitt Crusaders on their incredible State Football Championship victory on December 6, 2024.
The Crusaders prevailed in hard-fought overtime against the Roman Catholic Cahillites at Cumberland Valley's Chapman Field.
Crusaders' head coach Jeff Weachter and Quarterback Stone Saunders--bolstered by the Team's incredible endurance, discipline, focus, and skill--led the Team to their monumental victory.
After the Crusaders were leading 14-3 at halftime, the Cahillites rallied to take the lead by 31-28 with just under 6 minutes left in the fourth quarter.
The Crusaders then tied the game with a field goal before making a critical defensive stop and sending the game into overtime.
After halting the Cahillites' offense one last time, the Crusaders found their way again into field goal position, where Kicker Aidan Grella solidified the Crusaders' championship--their second in only three years.
