Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor forty years of the Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club.
Their civic and community engagement has been a force in south Texas for decades, and I cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the future.
Founded in 1984, the Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club has kept a keen focus on the healthcare of the community.
And that focus has produced incredible results.
The club's first major initiative, helping Rotary International eradicate polio, raised more than 100 percent of their chapter goal.
They then raised $125,000 to establish aerobic exercise courts on several school campuses across the district.
Laredo Daybreak Rotary Club also put on annual screenings for glaucoma and assisted with Shots Across Texas.

They are also involved in international health projects like building a clinic in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico.
I applaud them for it.
I also want to take note of perhaps one of their greatest accomplishments.
