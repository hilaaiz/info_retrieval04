Representatives as she departs to begin her new role as a Contra Costa County Supervisor.
Shanelle has lived in and served the East Bay of California her whole life.
After graduating from California State University East Bay, Shanelle worked for Contra Costa County and joined then-Congressman George Miller's staff, working diligently on behalf of district residents for more than ten years.
When Congressman Miller retired, I was thrilled to welcome her onto our office's team.
She has served as my District Director since 2015, helping lead our efforts in the district to provide outstanding service to constituents.
Shanelle has also shown unwavering devotion to her hometown of Pittsburg, California where she resides with her husband, Damon, and their sons Jaden and Ashton.
She has served on Pittsburg City Council since 2018, working tirelessly to foster a strong and diverse community throughout the City.
In this role, she has spearheaded efforts to expand access to affordable housing, improve public transportation, empower Pittsburg's youth, and build a vibrant hub in downtown Pittsburg.
She has been a regional leader, working with a number of key groups and agencies, serving as the Chair of MCE and TransPlan and President of the League.
On top of it all, Shanelle is active with several community groups including the Gateway Rotary Club and Pittsburg Reads initiative.
Shanelle was chosen by the voters to serve as the next Contra Costa County Supervisor for District 5.
While I am sad to see her go from our team, I'm confident that in this role, she will continue to be an effective leader for our County.
It has been a joy to work with Shanelle throughout the years and I'm incredibly grateful for her service.
