Representative Jerry Torr as he prepares to retire from the Statehouse after almost three decades of service.
Rep. Torr's long and distinguished service in the House has made him a legend in Indiana and has earned him the respect of the hundreds of legislators who have served alongside him over the years.
Jerry's contributions to the state of Indiana have been numerous and significant.
Most notably, he was instrumental in making Indiana a right-to-work state and spearheaded the legislation that moved Indiana to daylight saving time.
His work to allow Hoosiers with minor preexisting conditions to be insured illustrates his effectiveness, but also his advocacy and concern for the people of his state.
To those who have followed Indiana politics and government for the past 30 years or so, Jerry has been a fixture.
