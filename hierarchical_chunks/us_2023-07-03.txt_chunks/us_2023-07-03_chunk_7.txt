am proud to have him serving in Florida's First Congressional District.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am privileged to recognize Deputy William Hollingsworth for his unwavering commitment to upholding the values of our local law enforcement agencies.
I thank him for his service and offer my warmest regards and best wishes to him and his family.
