Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Deputy William Hollingsworth for his selfless and heroic acts on Friday, June 16, 2023.
Deputy Hollingsworth was helping stranded drivers amid the rapidly rising water early that Friday morning when he saw a motorist disappear beneath Highway 98.
Deputy Hollingsworth rushed toward the motorist to provide aid without regard for his safety.
He and the motorist were then swept into a flooded storm drain and traveled nearly 100 feet under the four-lane highway.
Despite this traumatic turn of events, Deputy Hollingsworth emerged on the other side, spotted the motorist, and continued to wade toward him to continue his rescue attempt.
His courageous actions cannot be overstated.
I, along with the entire Northwest Florida community, thank Deputy Hollingsworth for his devotion to duty and commitment to excellence.
His valiant actions exemplify the very best of Northwest Florida's law enforcement.
I
