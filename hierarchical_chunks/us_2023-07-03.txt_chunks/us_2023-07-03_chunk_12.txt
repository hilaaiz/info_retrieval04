Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the retirement of Chris Evans, for enriching the Sacramento Area with academic success in the public sector.
We wish 
Mr. Evans prosperity as a founder for Action-Oriented Leaders and look forward to witnessing his future successes as a torchbearer in the Sacramento Area.
I thank all those involved with supporting our youth with the tools they deserve to thrive in life.
Mr. Evans' investment in our community and public service is not unnoticed.
