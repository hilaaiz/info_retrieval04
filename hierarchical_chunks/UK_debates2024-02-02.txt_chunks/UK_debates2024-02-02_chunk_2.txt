I thank my hon.
Friends and the Opposition spokes-person,  the hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) , for their contributions.
We all recognise the importance of regular attendance not only for children’s attainment, but for their wellbeing and development.
There is evidence that some attitudes  to absence have changed since the pandemic, with a somewhat greater propensity among some families to keep a child with a minor illness, such as a cough or a cold, at home, whereas prior to the pandemic they would have gone to school.
It is worth saying that, before covid, great progress had been made on attendance since 2010, and we are committed to getting back to those levels.
They will never be 100%, for obvious reasons—every child will be off school ill at some point, and sadly some children will need to be off for extended periods—but we need to get back to that pre-pandemic level of 95% or above.
