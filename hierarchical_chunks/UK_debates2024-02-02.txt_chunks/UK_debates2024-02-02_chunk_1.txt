Let me first warmly congratulate my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Chelmsford (Vicky Ford)  on her success in the ballot, and on using that success for this purpose.
I am delighted that she has chosen school attendance as the subject of her Bill.
It is a subject that I know is close to her heart, and one that she has championed with aplomb and with impact.
She said towards the end of her remarks that attendance is the key to a child’s future, and I agree.
We have often said that reading is the most fundamental thing in school, because if a child cannot read properly, they cannot access the curriculum and nothing else works, but attendance is even more important.
Whatever our brilliant teachers are doing in schools, if the children are not there, they cannot benefit.
