I thank my hon.
Friend the Member for Tewkesbury for bringing forward the Bill and all right hon.
and hon.
Members for their contributions.
These changes will make a significant, positive impact for people nearing the end of their lives by ensuring that most pension fund members will be able to receive a payment at an earlier stage.
That will give them the financial support they need at a most difficult time for them and their families, as well as help them plan more effectively to get the most out of the finances they are due.
These changes send a message about end of life: that the conversation must be alive and vibrant for us all, so that we do the best we can.
I am pleased to support the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through both Houses.
