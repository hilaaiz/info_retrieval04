When I was informed that I had been successful in the private Member’s Bill ballot, I was a bit like a frightened bunny rabbit in the headlights, but with the help and  guidance of  the hon.
Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris) , I feel confident that I made the right choice by picking joint enterprise as the subject of my private Member’s Bill.
I also thank the Under-Secretary of State for Justice,  the hon.
Member for Newbury (Laura Farris)  for her constructive dialogue in the run-up to this debate.
I congratulate my hon.
Friend on her excellent Bill.
The work by all the people she has mentioned, including Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association, on the Bill has been so important.
The Supreme Court has said that joint enterprise has been wrongly interpreted by criminal trial judges for the past 30 years.
Does she agree that that is terrible?
I do, and I will come to that point later in my speech.
