I thank my hon.
Friend for his intervention.
As I understand it, the assessment is made by a health professional.
What illnesses he or she is entitled to take into account goes beyond the scope of this Bill, and I do not think that I can list those illnesses.
The Bill is about the length of time someone is expected to live.
If he will allow me, I will leave my explanation there.
