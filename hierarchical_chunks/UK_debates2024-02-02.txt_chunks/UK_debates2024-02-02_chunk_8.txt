I thank my hon.
Friend for that.
Yes, I spoke in particular to the Marie Curie charity, which told me of some very sad cases.
It is important to stress that the Bill refers to occasions when the pension fund or its sponsoring company becomes insolvent, so the Bill is narrow in scope.
However, he makes a good point.
The charity gave me a number of examples, and there are many others.
That brings us back to my point that we should look to extend the 12-month provision beyond the Bill to other pension schemes.
The last thing that someone given a terminal illness diagnosis needs is more financial problems.
If there is anything we can do about that, I am happy to take it forward with the Minister and the Government.
I thank my hon.
Friends for their interventions.
