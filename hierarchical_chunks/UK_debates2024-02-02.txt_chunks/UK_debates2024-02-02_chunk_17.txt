I pay tribute to the work of Becky Clarke and Patrick Williams at Manchester Metropolitan University, who went above and beyond to produce research on the costs of joint enterprise and have reminded us of the importance of not losing sight of its devastating social cost.
Their guidance and expertise throughout this process have been invaluable.
I thank Felicity Gerry KC, Professor Matthew Dyson and Nisha Waller from the University of Oxford, who as part of a wider working group organised by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies drew up the simple, common-sense wording of the Bill.
I also thank them for their legal support during the campaign.
Their commitment to righting this wrong turn in the law has helped to bring the campaign as far as it can possibly go through the courts.
Now, together, we have brought it to Parliament.
I hope that today will be another step towards righting this massive wrong.
