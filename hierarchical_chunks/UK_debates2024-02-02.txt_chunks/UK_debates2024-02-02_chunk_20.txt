I thank the cross-party sponsors of my Bill, notably  the hon.
Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill) , the esteemed Chair of the Justice Committee.
His support throughout this process has been invaluable and has demonstrated clearly the potential of the Bill to create cross-party consensus.
