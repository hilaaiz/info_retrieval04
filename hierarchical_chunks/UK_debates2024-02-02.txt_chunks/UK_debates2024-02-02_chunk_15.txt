Finally, I am pleased that the Minister confirmed that the Government intend to ensure that the Bill starts to have an impact as quickly as possible after Royal Assent.
I look forward to working with her and the Government on that basis.
Question put and agreed to.
Bill accordingly read a Second time; to stand committed to a Public Bill Committee ( Standing Order No. 63 ).
Second Reading I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
Before I begin, I pay tribute to the incredible people who have made it possible for us to be here today, challenging the shocking miscarriage of justice that is joint enterprise.
I want to say a massive thanks to Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association families and campaigners both inside and outside prison, some of whom are in the Gallery.
Their perseverance and determination has allowed me to present the Bill.
Since the early days of the campaign back in 2010, they have fought fearlessly and tirelessly against some of the most powerful British institutions for truth and justice to get to where we are today.
They have never given up, and the Bill is a result of their work.
I am so proud to have the privilege of working alongside them and bringing their campaign to Parliament.
