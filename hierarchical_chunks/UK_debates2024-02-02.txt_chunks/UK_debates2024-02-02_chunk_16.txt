I thank the many other people who have supported this campaign and helped to raise awareness of and support for our demands.
My deepest gratitude goes to Jimmy McGovern, the indomitable screenwriter from my home city of Liverpool, Colin McKeown, the talented Northern Irish film maker, their teams and whole cast of the film “Common”, some of whom are in the Gallery.
That film, brought to our screens a decade ago, accurately depicts the injustice of joint enterprise.
Massive thanks to LA Productions for so generously producing a half-hour condensed version for us to show at our event in Parliament this week.
I urge those who have not seen “Common” to watch it—it is more powerful than “Mr Bates vs The Post Office”, and I understand that it will be available shortly.
