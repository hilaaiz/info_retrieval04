I thank the Minister for that response and the shadow Minister for her contribution.
I also thank my right hon.
and hon.
Friends for their speeches and interventions.
They all raised good points, but I think the most important one, made by my hon.
Friend  the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) , was that the Bill takes us in the right direction but should not be the last word on this issue.
We must look at assessing people in terms of illness, because it is not just about time; it is about the diagnosis and the seriousness of those illnesses.
I am pleased that the Minister picked that up.
We must look to extrapolate this principle into other pension payments and schemes, as I mentioned in my speech.
