I thank all hon.
and right hon.
Members for their contributions, and for the sensitive way in which they have approached this matter.
I appreciate the “time-bound” argument that my hon.
Friend the Member for Shipley put forward, but these matters are always a challenge for clinicians.
I agree with him and my hon.
Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central that a better conversation about end of life, and how we treat issues as we move forward into that stage of our life, would be a very good thing for us all.
We should be a lot more discussive about it.
