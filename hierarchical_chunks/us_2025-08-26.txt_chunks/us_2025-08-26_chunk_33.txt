Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record an opinion column from the Odessa American titled ``Campbell: The Nature of Truth,'' published May 1, 2025.
In it, the author reflects on how society grapples with competing claims of truth and encourages readers to return to foundational and verifiable sources--a theme with deep implications for both our civic culture and the way we approach legislation.
I believe this thoughtful reflection is a meaningful reminder of the importance of clarity, honesty, and shared understanding in democratic discourse.
