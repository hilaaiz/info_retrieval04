Mr. BABIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true American hero from Southeast Texas--PFC Kate Louise Pate-Walker.
Kate was part of the legendary Six Triple Eight, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion.
It was the only all-Black, all-female unit deployed overseas during World War II.
Their mission was clear: sort and deliver a massive backlog of mail to nearly seven million U.S. troops.
Morale depended on it.
They were given six months.
They did it in three.
The work of the Six Triple Eight went far beyond mail--it was about dignity, hope, and connection.
For soldiers far from home, a letter meant everything.
Kate and her fellow women knew that, and their determination lifted the spirits of our fighting forces in Europe.
Kate earned multiple military honors for her service, and when the war ended, she returned home to Texas, married, raised a beautiful family, and continued a life of service to her community.
Born in Vidor and raised in Sour Lake, Kate was a trailblazer in uniform and a leader at home.
She lived a life defined by faith, perseverance, and love for family and country.
And now--decades later--the women of the Six Triple Eight have finally received the Congressional Gold Medal.
Though the recognition came late, it is highly deserved.
Their bravery, sacrifice, and determination are part of our Nation's story, and Southeast Texas is proud to claim PFC Kate Pate-Walker as one of our own.
