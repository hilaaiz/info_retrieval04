Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Carroll Lee Ashburn for his community service and civic leadership to the Northern Neck.
The influence Carroll has shown on his community over the years has cemented his legacy as a legendary softball coach, manager, sports broadcaster, and local historian.
Carroll Ashburn served his country in the United States Coast Guard, was a softball coach of the legendary Texaco's Fast Ball Pitch Softball team, managed the girls fast pitch softball team, and started the Girl's Little League Softball program in Kilmarnock at Lancaster's Youth Park.
Mr. Ashburn later became a broadcaster for High School Radio Sports on WKWI Radio, now Bay FM 101.7, where he served as the voice of high school basketball in the Northern Neck for over 25 years.
In 2007, Carroll Ashburn became the President of the Kilmarnock Museum, a position he still holds.
Carroll has promoted and help produce several documentaries highlighting the history of the Northern Neck, including Kilmarnock, Virginia Living History; The Pirates of the Chesapeake Bay; Historic Churches of Virginia's Northern Neck; Rear Admiral Bert Chase--A Dream of Flight, and A Fish Story.
Mr. Ashburn, a born-and-raised Northern Necker, brings a wealth of knowledge about the valuable history of the region.
If one wants to know how the Chesapeake Bay built the Northern Neck or how the Northern Neck built the Chesapeake Bay, go no further than Carroll Lee Ashburn.
Today at 93, Carroll remains busy by hosting trips to Tangier Island from Hummell Field in Topping with his favorite pilot, Davy Nichols, in a 1970 Cessna.
