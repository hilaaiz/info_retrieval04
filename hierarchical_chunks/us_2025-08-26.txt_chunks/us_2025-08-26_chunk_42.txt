Mr. Speaker, as Bernards Township hosts its upcoming First Responders Appreciation Night, I am especially proud to commend Liberty Corner Fire Company for its unwavering commitment and remarkable legacy of more than a century of service to our community.
I invite my colleagues to join me in honoring these extraordinary volunteers, whose dedication to protecting our neighbors is a shining example of community spirit and sacrifice.
