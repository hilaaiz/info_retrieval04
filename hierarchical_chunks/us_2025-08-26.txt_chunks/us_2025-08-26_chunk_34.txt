Truth is ephemeral in the temporal world.
It seems that everyone has his or her own version and whether or not they actually know the truth is open to interpretation and subject to one's own preference or prejudice.
It's a key concept in my business, journalism, where truth is the lynchpin.
We are bound to be truthful to the best of our ability and we are prohibited from writing anything that we know to be false.
We can be fired for doing it.
That's the difference between the Odessa American and publications like the National Enquirer, which publish nothing but stories that they know to be untrue.
That's not to say we never publish falsehoods, but we don't do it deliberately.
It's that we have good reasons like credible sources and reliable references to believe that what we write is true.
In the case of political candidates, if we had to believe everything they say we would never write anything about them.
We're not saying that what they say is true.
We're saying it's true that that is what they said.
We attribute accurately and leave it to the readers to ascribe credibility or not.
