Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Mrs. Tonya Lacey for her 33 years of service in the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia.
A proud graduate of James Monroe High School here in Fredericksburg, Mrs. Lacey's commitment to her local community has been nothing short of inspiring.
Throughout her career, she has demonstrated unwavering dedication to public service, embodying the spirit of community in every role she has held.
Beginning in 1992, 
Mrs. Lacey's journey with the City of Fredericksburg began as a receptionist in the City Manager's Office.
She went on to serve as the Secretary of the Planning Department from 1999 to 2002, and as Secretary to the City Manager from 2002 to 2009.
In her most recent role, she is the first African-American woman to serve as Fredericksburg's Clerk of Council, a groundbreaking achievement that broke barriers and paved the way for future generations.
In her years of service, 
Mrs. Lacey received several professional accolades including her Certified Municipal Clerk (CMC) certification and Master Municipal Clerk (MMC) certification.
Mrs. Lacey repeatedly demonstrated her commitment to excellence in effort and actions when it came to attending 411 City Council meetings and 452 work sessions, and processing and managing 797 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and in documenting the factual record with over 7,617 pages of City Council meeting minutes in the historic record.
As Clerk of Council, 
Mrs. Lacey guided our community by keeping the community informed about the operations performed by the government.
She worked with the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and City Council, keeping official records, responding to citizen inquiries and keeping citizens informed about City Council actions.
She acted as the Freedom of Information Officer (FOIA) and Records Manager for the City of Fredericksburg, which was a vital position in the continuity of transparency and public access.
