Holly Grove Head Start Center.
Through her dedication and love for children, she rose to become a teacher, then head teacher, and eventually center manager.
Even after the closing of Holly Grove, her commitment never wavered.
She continued to serve with excellence at the Goodman Head Start Center until her recent retirement.
More than an educator, 
Mrs. Ross was a life-mentor.
From her handmade brown-paper-bag puppets ``
Mr. Do'' and ``
Mr. Don't,'' to the life lessons she instilled in every classroom, she taught not only ABCs and 123s, but discipline, respect, and purpose.
Her former students have gone on to become teachers, entrepreneurs, ministers, realtors, health professionals, farmers, public servants, and even Head Start managers themselves.
In every one of their stories, her legacy endures.
She holds a national Child Development Associate credential and has received numerous awards throughout her career.
Yet, her greatest reward came from the joy of watching children grow, thrive, and succeed--and from the unwavering support of her late husband, Mr. Albert Ross, her daughters Rose Berry, Lawanda Ross, and Pamela Wiley, and her beloved grandchildren.
Even in retirement, 
Mrs. Ross remains a pillar of the Mt. Olive Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi, where her celebration drew nearly 100 well-wishers--friends, family, and former students who came from as far as the West Coast and Chicago.
The event featured touching tributes, musical performances, and reflections from those whose lives she touched most deeply.
