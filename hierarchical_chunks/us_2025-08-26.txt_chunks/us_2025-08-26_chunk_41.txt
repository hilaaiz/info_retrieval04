Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Liberty Corner Fire Company, an essential part of Bernards Township, Somerset County, for its steadfast and selfless service to our community for 115 years.
Since 1910, the Liberty Corner Fire Company's enduring strength has been built not only on the courage of its members but also on the support of the community it serves.
Comprised of more than 65 volunteers, the Liberty Corner Fire Company is responsible for providing fire and rescue service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to the Liberty Corner section.
Through community fundraising events and donations, residents ensure that these volunteers have the equipment, training, and protective gear needed to continue their mission safely and effectively.
Generations of families in Bernards Township have worn the uniform of Liberty Corner Fire Company, making it both a proud tradition and a vital lifeline.
