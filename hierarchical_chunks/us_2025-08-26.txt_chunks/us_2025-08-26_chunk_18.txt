Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Harriett Burt.
Harriett was born in Alameda, California in 1940.
Throughout her life, Harriett demonstrated her compassion and dedication to service.
She followed in her parents' footsteps, becoming a teacher and educator.
She moved to Martinez, California shortly after college to teach at Martinez Junior High and later taught in Australia before stepping into administrative and consulting roles in the education field.
Her work took her throughout the United States and Canada.
Additionally, Harriett was deeply passionate about serving her community.
She was a journalist for the Martinez News-Gazette and served on the Martinez City Council, the city's planning commission, and the California Public Utilities Commission.
She was an active member of our community, a part of the Boys and Girls Club, the Soroptimist Club, the Martinez Education Association, Kiwanis, the Lyons Club, the American Association of University Women (AAUW), and more.
Additionally, she was the first woman to serve as board president for the Boys and Girls Clubs.
Harriett's leadership in the community has had a profound impact on countless lives and has paved the way for future generations.
Sadly, Harriett recently passed away at the age of 85.
She will be remembered for her indelible impact in Martinez and beyond and for her intellect, warmth, and kindness.
Please join me in recognizing Harriett Burt for her many contributions to our community.
