Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the distinguished career of Tom Torlakson, a dedicated public servant and steadfast advocate for California's students, families and educators.
Tom's career in service began in the classroom.
As a high school science teacher and coach in the Mount Diablo Unified School District, he saw firsthand the transformative power of education.
His early experience in education shaped a lifelong commitment to ensuring that every child could learn, grow, and succeed, regardless of their background or zip code.
Recognizing the broader systemic challenges facing education, Mr. Torlakson entered public office to expand his impact.
He served on the Antioch City Council and the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, where he advocated for stronger schools, safer communities, and greater opportunities for all residents.
His leadership in local government paved the way for his election to the California State Assembly and later the California State Senate, where he continued to be a leading voice on education and public health policy.
During his tenure in the California Legislature, 
Mr. Torlakson authored significant legislation that fundamentally improved the lives of millions.
Among his many accomplishments, he was instrumental in establishing California's system of after-school programs, the largest after-school program system in the nation, providing students with safe, enriching environments after school hours.
He also spearheaded the Quality Education Investment Act (SB 1133), securing billions of dollars in critical funding to support the state's most challenged schools and reduce educational inequities.
In 2011, Tom was elected as California's 27th State Superintendent of Public Instruction, a position he held with honor and distinction until 2019.
As superintendent, he championed initiatives to close the digital divide, address achievements gaps, reduce dropout rates, and promote innovative programs such as the State Seal of Biliteracy, recognizing students who achieved proficiency in multiple languages.
His leadership was key in preserving vital resources for schools and safeguarding educational opportunities for California's six million students, despite the state's budget challenges.
Beyond policy achievements, Tom's tenure was marked by his compassionate nature, which underscored his belief that the future of our communities, our economy, and our democracy depends on how we nurture and educate our young people.
He worked collaboratively with educators, parents, and policymakers to foster a culture of inclusion, innovation, and excellence.
