Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and celebrate the exceptional interns who have devoted their summer to serving the people of California's 20th Congressional District.
From my offices in Washington, D.C., and Bakersfield, California these students have exhibited maturity well beyond their years, offering their time, talents, and energy to support my work in meaningful ways.
Their contributions have been a powerful reminder of the potential and promise embodied by the next generation.
At a time when many young Americans are contemplating their role in civic life, these interns chose to engage directly with purpose and passion.
As all the summer Congressional internships come to a close, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Nikhil Bawa for his contributions to my Washington, D.C. office.
His hard work has been instrumental to my team's efforts, and I am confident that the experiences and lessons he has gained will guide him toward continued success in his future endeavors in public service.
I look forward to seeing where his path leads, and I hope that path includes a continued dedication to serving others.
