Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and remember the life of a dedicated veteran upon his induction into the Ohio Veterans Hall.
Donald James Keehan, who sadly passed away last year, has been inducted posthumously after his years of service and contributions to his community and Ohio.
Donald's leadership both in and out of uniform was exemplary, whether it was through his service to our nation in the Korean War or as founder and CEO of globally recognized Advanced Polymer Coatings.
His work as an entrepreneur in the polymers and resins industry included numerous patents and the development of multiple companies that employed many Ohioans.
It was Donald's philanthropic work with youth and military families that established him as a community leader when it came to support for military families, military transition issues, and the broader Northeast Ohio veterans' community.
He was instrumental in providing housing for wounded warriors with his rental properties in northeast Ohio.
He was also a tremendous mentor to both the professional business community and to the youth of the area.
Passionate about philanthropy, Donald supported education by providing more than one million dollars to St. Edward High School in Lakewood, Ohio, where he served as a trustee, for students to study innovative engineering and entrepreneurship.
He also supported and helped grow Young Men's Chance for Change whose mission is to help inner-city young men achieve better lives and opportunities.
Donald's life also revolved around his family.
He was married to his wife, Arlene, for 63 years.
During that time, they raised six children and became grandparents and then great-grandparents.
