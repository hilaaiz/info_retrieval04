Mr. EMMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a first responder in my district, Tom Fennell.
Tom has been nominated for the American Ambulance Association's Star of Life Award; a prestigious recognition given to those who have made exceptional contributions to the emergency medical services (EMS) community.
Tom's journey into emergency medical services began in his childhood, growing up with ambulances in his garage.
His father owned a local ambulance service, instilling in Tom a deep appreciation for the lifesaving work of EMS providers.
After leaving home, Tom continued to his involvement in EMS, working with a Basic Life Support ambulance service which he helped evolve into an Advanced Life Support service.
Tom's dedication and expertise were evident and he quickly became recognized as a leader in the field.
He went on to serve as a regulator for the State of Minnesota's EMS Section, gaining valuable insights into the challenges faced by ambulance service providers across the state.
Tom has made a profound impact on the emergency medical services community in St. Cloud and across Minnesota.
He is an inspiration to all those who have had the opportunity to work alongside him.
Throughout the years, we have been grateful to see many exceptional Minnesotans honored as American Ambulance Association Star of Life recipients.
America's first female Emergency Medical Technician and Star of Life Recipient, Rose Pelzel, and her fellow Star of Life recipient, Marcia Anderson, were both panelists in our office's Young Women's Leadership Program.
Both women are pioneers in the emergency medical services field, and we were lucky to have them participate.
Congratulations to Tom on joining these impressive ranks, and I thank him for all his work on behalf of EMTs and first responders in Minnesota.
