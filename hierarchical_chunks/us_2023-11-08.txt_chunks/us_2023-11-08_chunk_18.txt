Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible life of 
Mr. William Thomas Chartrand.
His service to our country, commitment to his family, and dedication to the Central Valley community will be felt for generations to come.
My thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
