Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Bishop Donald Hilliard, Jr. on his 40th Pastoral Anniversary.
Dr. Hilliard continues to provide outstanding spiritual leadership to the Perth Amboy, Asbury Park, and Plainfield communities and his service is to be celebrated.
