Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to the life and service.
On behalf of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Ohio, I recognize the devotion and compassion that Donald had for his family, community, and Nation.
I applaud the special acknowledgment that accompanies his induction into the Ohio Veterans Hall.
