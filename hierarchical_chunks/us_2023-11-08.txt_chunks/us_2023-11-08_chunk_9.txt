victory in Missouri's Class 3 Volleyball State Championship.
The team claimed the Class 3 title for the third straight year by beating the Ursuline Bears in a tightly contested match.
After falling behind early, Seniors Gabby Horn and Autumn Bax led the Lady Falcons to an improbable comeback in the final three sets.
The team should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home another state championship to their school and community.
