Mr. CASAR.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize Mt. Zion Baptist Church on the celebration of its 150th anniversary this year.
Founded 1873 in Williamson Creek, this church soon faced its first challenges.
Only 10 years after its founding, a flood destroyed the church building.
Through resilience and faith, the congregation worshipped and held services in their homes while their community rebuilt what was lost.
In 1948, the old walls.
Zion Williamson Creek were transported and reinstalled at their new home in Austin, where it became Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church.
Beginning in 1970, under the leadership of the late Rev. Dr. G. V. Clark, the church experienced a large increase in membership and expanded its facilities on and around East 13th Street.
With a deep commitment to his faith and community, Dr. Clark served the congregants.
Zion for five decades.
Our whole community is greatly indebted to him for a lifetime of service.
For over 150 years, Mt. Zion has been a pillar.
Under the current leadership.
Daryl Horton, Mt. Zion continues a tradition of commitment and service to our community through charity and volunteerism, like housing the elderly, feeding children, and the poor.
As the Congressman for the 35th District.
I am proud to congratulate them on their 150 years of faithful service and dedication to improving the lives of so many in Austin.
