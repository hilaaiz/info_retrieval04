Ms. BOEBERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sergeant First Class William Montgomery, a true American hero who has finally been awarded the Purple Heart for injuries suffered in the line of duty in service to our great country.
The price of freedom is not free, and I am overjoyed that my office can help heroes like Sergeant First Class Montgomery receive the recognition they so richly deserve.
Sergeant First Class Montgomery was born in Tucson, Arizona, and graduated high school in Spring Creek, Nevada.
He enlisted in the U.S. Army as a 19D Cavalry Scout and attended One Station Unit Training in Fort Knox, Kentucky, graduating with honors.
His long and distinguished military career includes deployments in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, where he earned numerous awards and accolades including the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the Valorous Unit Award, and the Iraq Campaign Medal with 3 Stars, reflecting his exceptional service to our country.
He has now earned the Purple Heart, an award reserved only for those who are wounded or killed in service to our nation.
In July of 2015, Sergeant First Class Montgomery was medically discharged from the United States Army and now resides in Colorado's Third District with his six wonderful children: Rain, Porter, Lexington, Izabella, Kai, and Koda.
