year anniversary.
For a century, the Adams Fire Company has served the Town of Wheatfield and Niagara County, providing lifesaving fire protection and EMS services to our community.
In 1924, thirty residents of the Town of Wheatfield came together at the District 3 Schoolhouse with a goal to establish a fire department in Nashville, NY.
Charter members George Tollner, Walter Tollner, William Adams, William Gombert, Albert Beutel, and Benjamin Tollner saw the pressing need for a fire department in their town after their friend Fred Zastrow's barn burned to the ground.
The building of the Adams Fire Company was a true community effort.
William Adams, the fire company's namesake, donated a lot on Niagara Falls Boulevard for the new station; the original building still stands today.
The 30 founding members built the fire station, with material donated from local lumber yards and monetary donations collected from the community fund they established.
Further, the Adams Fire Company has been a cornerstone of the Niagara County community, hosting numerous events for residents.
From field days and dances to pie sales and bingo night fundraisers, the Adams Fire Company has shown its unwavering dedication to serving our community.
In 2023, the Adams Fire Company ran 754 calls, 586 Emergency Medical Service calls, and provided mutual aid 46 times.
Under the steadfast leadership of Fire Chief Donald Lauer, the Adams Fire Company has continued to keep the Town of Wheatfield and Niagara County communities safe and protected.
Please join me in congratulating the Adams Fire Company on their 100th anniversary and thanking them for their incredible service to the Western New York community.
