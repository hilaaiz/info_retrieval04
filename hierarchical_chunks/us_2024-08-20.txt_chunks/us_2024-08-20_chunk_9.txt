Mr. MURPHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and honor a distinguished member of my community, Lillian McClain, who is turning 100 years old next month.
Born on September 5, 1924, in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
Mrs. McClain spent much of her childhood in Clifton Forge, Virginia.
Following her graduation from Clifton Forge High School, she attended Longwood College (now Longwood University) in Farmville, Virginia, for one year.
She left Longwood to contribute to the World War II effort, taking a position with the Army at Fort Bellwood and volunteering at USO clubs in Richmond, Virginia.
During her time at Fort Bellwood, she met and later married John R. McClain, Sr., on April 11, 1945.
After the war, 
Mrs. McClain and John resided briefly in Washington, D.C., where their first son, John, was born.
They soon moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, where their other sons, David and Mark, were welcomed into the family.
Throughout her career, 
Mrs. McClain primarily worked as a bank teller.
Her unwavering dedication to her community extended far beyond her career.
She has been an active member of the Methodist Church throughout her life and has engaged in numerous activities, including volunteering at her sons' events, participating in community theater, and singing with the Sweet Adelines.
