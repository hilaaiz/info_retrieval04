Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the death of the Honorable Sheila Mobley McNeill who recently passed away at 81 years old in the city where she was born, Brunswick, GA.
Sheila served as Navy League's 42nd national president from 2003 to 2005.
She was the first and only female president in the organization's 121-year history.
Additionally, she spent 58 years with the Navy League where she held many distinguished positions before becoming its president.
She earned many awards for her service, including the Secretary of the Navy's Distinguished, Superior and Meritorious Public Service medals, the United States Coast Guard's Distinguished and Meritorious Public Service medals, and many more.
She also served as a Georgia state senator representing district 3 from January 2021 to January 2023.
She was a devoted wife to Arlie McNeill, a Navy veteran who passed in 2023, and is remembered as a loving mother and grandmother.
