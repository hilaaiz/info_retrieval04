Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lindsey Horan of Golden, Colorado for representing the United States in Women's Soccer at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.
Lindsey is a world-class athlete, having won three championship titles since she began her professional career in 2012.
She played a vital role in the United States Women's National Soccer Team (USWNT) winning the Women's 2019 World Cup and earning the bronze medal during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
She returned to the international field as captain of the team during the 2023 World Cup, where she led the team to the knockout stage of the tournament.
Lindsey, along with the rest of the USWNT, has also worked hard to champion equal pay between the men's and women's national soccer teams.
She is a remarkable athlete, and her valuable contributions during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games helped the United States bring home an Olympic gold medal.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional district, it is my honor to congratulate Lindsey Horan for representing Colorado and the United States during the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.
