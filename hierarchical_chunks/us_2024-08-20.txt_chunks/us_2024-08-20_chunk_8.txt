Dr. Reece's appointment as interim dean is only one of her many accomplishments, among being named the PCOM School of Pharmacy Teacher of the Year for Pharmacy Practice in 2019 and Faculty Preceptor of the Year in 2022 and 2023.
In Dr. Reece's new role as interim dean, she will continue to advance the great mission of PCOM's School of Pharmacy throughout the state of Georgia.
I sincerely congratulate Dr. Reece on her accomplishments and share this excitement with the Georgia PCOM community.
