Mrs. McClain has been a witness to significant historical events and has gained great knowledge to share with future generations.
Currently, 
Mrs. McClain resides in New Bern, North Carolina, with her son John and his wife, Dixie.
It is with great respect and admiration that I lead my colleagues in recognizing 
Mrs. McClain for her extraordinary contributions and the remarkable life she has led in service to our Great Nation.
I wish 
Mrs. McClain a very Happy Birthday.
