Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize David Lucas for winning the 2024 Paul Kroegel Refuge Manager of the Year award from the National Wildlife Refuge Association.
The Paul Kroegel Award honors refuge managers who have made significant contributions to the protection and management of national wildlife refuges.
During his time as a manager for the Rocky Flats, Two Ponds, and Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuges, David rehabilitated two formerly hazardous waste sites into thriving animal refuges, oversaw the restoration of 15,000 acres of prairie habitat, and reintroduced the Black-Footed Ferret to one of his refuges.
He also expanded access to his refuges by installing ADA accessible e trails and piers and hiring bilingual rangers.
David's work brought Colorado's public lands closer to home, ensuring that everyone can learn from and enjoy our diverse environment.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional district, it is my honor to congratulate David Lucas on receiving the Refuge Manager of the Year award and thank him for his remarkable work in conserving Colorado's public lands.
