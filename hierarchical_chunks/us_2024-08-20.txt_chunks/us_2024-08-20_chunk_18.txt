Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize European Gourmet of Arvada, Colorado for receiving the Arvada Economic Development Association's 2024 Outstanding Retailer Award.
Each year, this award honors an Arvada business that demonstrates an exceptional contribution to the local economy and commitment to excellence in service.
Since the Bien family founded the business in 1999, they have worked hard to offer a wide variety of traditional Polish and Eastern European treats, such as their sausages, hams, cheeses, bread, pierogies, and sweets.
Today, European Gourmet has earned the reputation as a top destination for Polish and Eastern European cuisine in Colorado, with people from around the state traveling to Arvada to experience their authentic foods and great service.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate European Gourmet on receiving the Outstanding Retailer Award and for their contributions to the Arvada community.
