Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Henriksen Amplifiers of Arvada, Colorado for receiving the Arvada Economic Development Association's 2024 Lloyd J. King Entrepreneurial Spirit Award.
Each year, this award recognizes an Arvada company that demonstrates excellence in entrepreneurial spirit, creative business practices, and economic innovation.
Bud Henriksen founded Henriksen Amplifiers in 2006 with his son Peter when a newly acquired jazz guitar led him to make his own amp.
Since Bud's passing in 2009, Peter Henriksen has carried on his father's legacy while expanding further into other genres of music.
Henriksen's contributions to Arvada extend beyond amplifiers: the business has been committed to investing their time, expertise, and money in local concerts, artists, and community events, such as the annual Rocky Mountain Archtop Guitar Festival in Olde Town Arvada.
Henriksen Amplifiers sets a clear example of how a business can bring more to a community than just their product.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Henriksen Amplifiers for receiving the Lloyd J. King Entrepreneurial Spirit Award and for their contributions to the Arvada community.
