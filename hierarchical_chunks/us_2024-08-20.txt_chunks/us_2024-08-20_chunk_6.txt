Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Chris Poa of Hudson as Ohio 13's Champion of the Week.
Chris has been a Hudson U.S.
Postal worker for 29 years, and recently, his awareness and quick-thinking helped save the life of an elderly woman.
Chris was on his delivery route when he noticed one of the residents he delivers to, a 91-year-old woman, had not picked up her mail in a few days.
Chris often chatted with the resident, and his concern prompted him to call in a wellness check for her.
When EMS arrived, they found that the older woman had fallen in her home and was unable to get up.
Thanks to Chris's attentiveness, EMS was able to take the woman to the hospital for treatment.
Chris was awarded the Hudson EMS Life Saving Award for his actions.
And his selflessness and compassion is a shining example of the spirit that makes our district the Birthplace of Champions--a place where neighbors care for each other and look out for one another.
I thank Chris Poa for his continued dedication to serving our community.
