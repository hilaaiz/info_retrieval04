Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize Lorna Kearney of Akron as Ohio 13's Champion of the Week.
Lorna recently made history at 66 years old when she became the oldest player to play in the American Women's Football League for her team, the Detroit Prowl.
Lorna has always had a love for sports, and her passion for football led to her interest in joining the American Women's Football League.
Unfortunately, the year she was supposed to start playing, she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
However, Lorna fought hard and won her battle with cancer, and this year, she played her first game.
Lorna's dedication is an inspiration, not just to her family and teammates, but to everyone in our community.
Lorna's dedication to tackle adversity on and off the field is a shining example of the spirit that makes Ohio's 13th Congressional District the Birthplace.
I congratulate Lorna Kearney, for making history and demonstrating it's never too late to do the things you love.
