Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Gloria Glover for her remarkable dedication and service as Youth Director at New Green Grove Church of Faith in Greenwood, Mississippi.
For over 20 years, 
Ms. Glover has been a steadfast leader, guiding and inspiring young people in her community through spiritual growth, education, and outreach.
Under her leadership, the youth ministry has flourished, encompassing a praise team, praise dancers, and numerous community service initiatives.
Ms. Glover, alongside her daughter, LaFonda Knox, and youth minister Robert Keyon Beamon, has played an essential role in creating a vibrant and supportive environment where young members can grow in faith and contribute meaningfully to their community.
Bishop Milton Glass, pastor of New Green Grove for 30 years, affirms that the youth ministry's success has been vital to the church's growth and vitality.
Thanks to 
Ms. Glover's tireless efforts, the ministry has grown to welcome new young members every month, many of whom have been baptized and actively participate in church life.
The young people under 
Ms. Glover's guidance have dedicated themselves to serving others.
They have organized and delivered meals to seniors, collected and distributed socks and blankets to nursing home residents, gathered food for the Community Kitchen and disaster victims, and supplied hygiene products to the Delta Correctional Facility.
Their outreach also includes toy drives supporting children during family visits to the prison, reflecting a deep commitment to compassion and community service.
Despite challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and concerns over gun violence, 
Ms. Glover and the youth ministry have persevered, fostering a spirit of resilience and faith.
Her leadership ensures that the church continues to be a beacon of hope and growth, especially for the young people who represent its future.
Today, I commend Gloria Glover for her outstanding commitment to empowering youth, strengthening her church, and serving her community.
Her work exemplifies the profound impact that dedicated individuals can have on shaping lives and nurturing the next generation.
