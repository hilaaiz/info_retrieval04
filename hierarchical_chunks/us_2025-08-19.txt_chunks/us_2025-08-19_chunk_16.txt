Hall of Fame in 2001 and being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999, which she was jointly awarded alongside President Carter.
Rosalynn Carter accomplished so much, for so many, for so long.
She did so with the grace of God as well as the love and support of her devoted husband, their five children, and their twenty-two grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
On a personal note, it has been an honor to know Rosalynn and Jimmy Carter for more than half a century.
I will always cherish their friendship, as well as their sage counsel and advice which has been invaluable to me as I have served in Congress.
