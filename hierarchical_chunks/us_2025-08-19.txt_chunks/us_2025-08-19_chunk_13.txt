Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring the Urban League of NWI and Dr. Vanessa AllenMcCloud on these two notable milestones.
Throughout the years, the dedicated staff and leaders of the Urban League of NWI have worked diligently to expand the opportunities offered to minority groups to promote fair access to a successful future, and they deserve great recognition for their contributions and commitment to communities across Northwest Indiana.
