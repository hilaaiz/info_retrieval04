Mr. LIEU.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the remarkable life and legacy of my friend Marc Saltzberg.
He passed away peacefully on June 27, 2025, surrounded by his loving family following a prolonged battle with cancer.
After his retirement from a successful career in information technology, Marc dedicated himself to political activism.
He became an integral member of local advocacy organizations, tirelessly supporting causes that he was passionate about.
More than just a supporter, Marc sought to create spaces for open and thoughtful civil and political discourse within his community, fostering engagement at the grassroot level in ways that uplifted those around him.
Born in Chicago, Marc's journey took him to Carleton College, where he met his beloved wife, Nancy.
Their shared passion for travel led them to countless adventures as a couple.
In their youth, they hiked in Nepal, explored Turkey, and cycled in France.
In later years, they returned to Turkey with their three children, Jenny, Alex, and Maria, as a testament to their lifelong sense of wonder and curiosity.
Marc's contributions to his community and to the causes he held dear are a true testament to his character.
His commitment to the betterment of society was unwavering, and he and his family were committed to supporting organizations serving communities in need and environmental causes.
Some of these organizations included Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union, Doctors Without Borders, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and many more.
These causes reflected Marc's enduring belief in justice, compassion, and a better future for all.
Marc is survived by his wife Nancy, his children Jenny, Alex, and Maria, and his grandchildren.
May his contributions to serving people in need live on through the people and organizations that he touched throughout his life.
Marc was a proud father, grandfather, and dedicated activist.
His legacy of service and engagement will continue to inspire and guide many after him.
May his memory be a blessing to all who knew him.
