Mr. CARBAJAL.
Mr. Speaker, each year, through the Women of the Year Award, my office extends special recognition to women on the Central Coast who have made a difference in our community.
I would like to recognize one outstanding Women of the Year Award recipient, Lisa Kawamura of Arroyo Grande, California.
For more than 25 years, Lisa has been a dedicated lecturer in the Department of Communication Studies at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
She has taught hundreds of students in public speaking, performance studies, and forensics, leaving a lasting mark as a mentor and role model.
Beyond the classroom, she has served as the longtime advisor to the Nikkei Student Union Club, ensuring that students have a supportive community and opportunities for leadership.
Lisa's leadership extends well beyond the campus.
As President of the Cal Poly Chapter of the California Faculty Association and as Chair of the statewide Committee on Contract Development and Bargaining Strategy, she has been a steadfast advocate for fair pay, equity, and improved working conditions for all California State University faculty.
She also represents her peers on the CFA statewide Board of Directors, amplifying the voices of faculty throughout the CSU system.
Her commitment to equity is evident in her leadership of CalFac's AntiRacism and Social Justice workshops, which she regularly co-leads across California.
As a Japanese-American woman and longtime Central Coast resident, she brings both lived experience and deep empathy to her work, encouraging other women of color to speak up, advocate for themselves, and pursue leadership opportunities.
Lisa's service to the Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi American community is equally significant.
She is a member of the CFA APIDA Caucus and previously served as Chair, working to advance visibility and representation at Cal Poly and across the CSU system.
She is also active with Tsuru for Solidarity, a social justice organization dedicated to supporting immigrant rights and providing healing spaces for those impacted by incarceration--both historically during World War II and in the present day.
Lisa Kawamura is well known for her kindness, availability, and integrity.
She is ``only a phone call away'' for her colleagues and students, and she consistently uplifts others by making sure their voices are heard.
She has become a trusted mentor, dynamic public speaker, and respected leader in the Central Coast community.
I am honored to recognize Lisa Kawamura for her lifelong commitment to education, equity, and justice.
I ask all Members to join me today in honoring an exceptional woman of California's 24th Congressional District, Lisa Kawamura, for her outstanding service to her students, colleagues, and community.
