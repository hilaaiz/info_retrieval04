Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate the Central Cabarrus boy's high school basketball team on winning back-to-back 3A state championships.
In recent years, the Central Cabarrus Vikings have been the dominant force to reckon with in North Carolina boys' basketball.
Local Charlotte news anchor Jim Tritsch described it perfectly when he said, ``there is no defense they cannot breach; there is no level of dominance they can't unlock.''
Led by Coach Jim Baker, the Vikings put up an astounding record of 95-1 over the past three seasons.
The Vikings' most recent win not only earned them a second consecutive championship but raised Central Cabarrus' winning streak to 65 straight games, the longest current winning streak in the country.
Once again, on behalf of the 8th District of North Carolina, congratulations to Coach Baker and Viking Nation on this outstanding achievement.
