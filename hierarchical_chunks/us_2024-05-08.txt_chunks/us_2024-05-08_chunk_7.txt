goes back 50 years to 1974.
Starting out as a special deputy with the Marshall County Sheriff's Department, a Plymouth Police Officer, Investigator with the Marshall County Prosecutor's Office, and Deputy Attorney General for the State.
Dean was appointed to serve the citizens of Marshall County as judge in 1986.
In that time, Judge Colvin has dedicated himself to advancing the principles of justice and ensuring Hoosiers get a fair shake before the law.
The Rule of Law tradition we have inherited helps secure individual liberty and promotes the conditions necessary for human flourishing.
It is incumbent on us to do our part to make sure these principles of justice and Rule of Law precepts are passed seamlessly from one generation to the next.
That mission is one Judge Colvin has embraced wholeheartedly and worked tirelessly to advance throughout his career.
As Judge Colvin's career comes to a close, I am reminded of the saying ``I like to see a man proud of the place in which he lives.
I like to see a man live so that his place will be proud of him.''
I believe this quote applies uniquely well to Judge Colvin.
The Plymouth community and all of Marshall County are unquestionably better off thanks to this good man with a servant's heart.
I am also very happy for him personally in that with his upcoming retirement, Dean will have more time to devote to his three great passions in life in addition to his family: baseball, cars, and cooking.
I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our gratitude to Judge Dean Colvin for his service, and in wishing him a very happy retirement and all the best going forward.
I thank Dean.
