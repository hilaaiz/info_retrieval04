Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Ms. Mia Norton for her invaluable work as a congressional intern serving in my D.C. office.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank her for her hard work and recognize the meaningful contributions she has made to the office and serving the people of Western North Carolina this spring.
Mia is from Clyde, North Carolina, located in NC-11.
She will soon be concluding her sophomore year at American University, where she is studying journalism and political science.
Interns work with congressional staff to serve constituents in my district.
Mia was chosen from a competitive pool of applicants, and she exceeded every expectation.
It was a pleasure to work with Mia, and I am proud to have such an intelligent and ambitious intern representing my office.
Mia exemplified the spirit of public service and represents the best that Western North Carolina has to offer.
Congratulations to Mia on the successful completion of her internship.
