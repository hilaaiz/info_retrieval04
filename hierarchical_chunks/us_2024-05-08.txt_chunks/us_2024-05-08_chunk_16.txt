Mr. Casillas has had a profound impact on countless students, pioneering innovative music programs, including the district's first Mariachi, Jazz, Marching, Concert, and Latin Jazz bands.
As a native of Puerto Rico, Mariachi was not part of his musical heritage, but Casillas made it a priority to learn it because it is part of the culture of many of his students who are native to Mexico.

Additionally, 
Mr. Casillas directed the Tolleson Elementary School marching band in the Fiesta Bowl Parade for three consecutive years.
Mr. Casillas' commitment and talent have garnered numerous accolades and awards, including being named the Tolleson Elementary School District Teacher of the Year in 2015 and nominated for the Life Changer of the Year Award in 2017.
