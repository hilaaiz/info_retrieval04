Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of a milestone in our region's history.
Toledo Public Schools celebrated 175 years of education today.
As the school system notes, ``or 175 years, Toledo Public Schools has been one of the most influential institutions in the history of our city.
The lives of hundreds of thousands of Toledoans have been formed within the walls of their neighborhood schools, leading to each one's mark on the future of our society.
From its inception on May 8, 1849 to present day, TPS remains a progressive, forward-thinking school district.''
The first Toledo Public School Board was convened 175 years ago today.
Only two years later, in 1851, Lagrange School was the first school to open.
Two years after that, on August 15, 1853, the cornerstone was laid for the high school.
When it opened in 1854 it also provided an education for girls, graduating the first young lady in the original Class of 1857.
Leading social change again and again, Toledo Public Schools became integrated in 1871 and opened a school for children with disabilities in 1918.
