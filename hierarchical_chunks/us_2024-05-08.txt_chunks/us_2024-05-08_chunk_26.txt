Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the one-hundred fortieth anniversary of the Doss School in Gillespie County, Texas.
It is the longest continually running school in the State and is located northwest.
Alumni, faculty, and students of the Doss School will gather to celebrate this milestone on May 18, 2024.
Its motto is ``The small school with a big heart.''
School board president Cecil Crenwelge had this to say about the occasion, ``The history behind Doss School is truly remarkable.
As we celebrate the incredible history of the school and its many alumni, we also have an eye to the future that is very bright.''
The original building for Doss School was officially designated a Texas Historic Landmark in 1985.
The first classes at Doss School began in 1884.
Mr. Tom Nixon donated land for the construction of a school building.
Upon completion, students at Squaw Creek and Onion Creek schools merged with Doss and shared the new building.
The school further expanded with a new building in 1927.
I would like to thank the Friends of Doss School for preserving local history and this community treasure.
I wish the students and faculty of Doss School well in the upcoming school year.
