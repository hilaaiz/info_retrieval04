Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to celebrate the welldeserved retirement.
Marc A. Nigliazzo, who has worked tirelessly to serve the communities of Central Texas through his time at Temple College and Texas A&M University-Central Texas.
Nigliazzo's dedication to our home is truly unrivaled.
Throughout his career, Dr. Nigliazzo has touched the lives of all his students.
From his time as president at Temple College to his tenure as the inaugural president at Texas A&M-Central Texas he always went the extra mile to insure a positive impact on his students and the community.
Dr. Nigliazzo has played a vital role in promoting accelerated learning as well as building safe and supportive school communities for our central Texas communities.
His dedication to education and addressing the major challenges that Texas A&M University-Central Texas has faced has brought the school to where it is today.
His great work has not gone unnoticed.
Dr. Nigliazzo was awarded the Leopard Pride for his work with the Temple College athletic program and the Temple College Board of Trustees named the administration building in his honor.
These tributes speak to the justifiably high regard his peers hold him in.
Retirement is to be celebrated and enjoyed.
It is not the end of a career, but rather the beginning of a new adventure.
I commend Dr. Marc A. Nigliazzo for his years of selfless service as well as his commitment to the betterment of higher education.
He is an inspiration to our community, and I wish him only the best in the years ahead.
