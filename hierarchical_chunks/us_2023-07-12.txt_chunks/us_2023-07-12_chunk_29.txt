I have previously mentioned the framework's opposition to acceleration.
It also opposes tracking.
As Conrad points out, the framework uses ``citation misrepresentations'' to promote its ``anti-tracking narrative'' of heterogeneously-grouped classrooms at all levels.''
Homogeneously-grouped classrooms allow teachers to work more effectively without the need to teach students who are at widely different levels.
Students can be evaluated on their achievements in different subjects and placed in accelerated classes only in the subjects where they excel.
This avoids the misplacements inherent in across-the-board multi-subject tracking.
The framework displays an ideological rather than empirical opposition to ability grouping.
