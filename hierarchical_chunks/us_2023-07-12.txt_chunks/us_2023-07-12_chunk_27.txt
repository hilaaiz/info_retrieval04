The framework promotes the idea of students taking mathlite data science courses instead of Algebra II.
Students who take such math-lite courses will be ill-prepared for math and other STEM courses when they get to college.
In his report on an earlier draft of the math framework, Conrad says of the promotion of these data science classes: ``Whatever author is responsible for such a myopic view of mathematics should never again be involved in the setting of public policy guidance on math education.''
