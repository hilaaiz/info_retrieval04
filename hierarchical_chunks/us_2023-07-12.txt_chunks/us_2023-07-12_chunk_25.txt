The revised framework rejects (as did its earlier iterations) the time-honored aim of preparing students to take Algebra I in eighth grade.
Eighth-grade algebra is the policy in high-performing foreign countries whose inhabitants will compete with America's children in the future--and that eighth-grade goal was expressly part of the 1999 and 2006 California math frameworks.
This current framework recommends ninth grade as when almost all students should take Algebra I. Students who plan to go to selective colleges and universities or who plan to major in STEM fields in college need to pass calculus in high school.
Taking algebra in eighth grade allows them to do so.
Education journalist John Fensterwald points out that: To discourage widespread enrollment in eighth-grade algebra, the framework's diagram laying out STEM and non-STEM course pathways omits eighth-grade algebra as an option.
There are possible (but laborious and bureaucratically troublesome) workarounds for STEM-inclined students, like double-booking math classes in one year.
But the system is not friendly to the workarounds, and they are discouraging to students.
As Conrad points out, the framework authors (who are ideologically opposed to acceleration)
had three years to come up with a way to accommodate those who need to take calculus in high school, but they didn't do it.
The recent effort in San Francisco Unified to make all students take Algebra I in ninth grade, was, as Conrad points out, ``a total failure, exacerbating the very inequities it aimed to prevent.''
