Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Erwin Township Historical Society and their newly constructed walking trail and artifact building in Erwin Heritage Park.
Erwin Township Historical Society has played an instrumental role in the preservation of Erwin's culture and history, and I'm confident their newest offerings will continue to have a lasting impact on residents for years to come.
Named as the first grant recipient from the Michigan History Alliance, the Erwin Township Historical Society has been deservingly recognized for their part in protecting and cataloguing Michigan's rich history.
From erecting park benches to the restoration of the East End Schoolhouse to become their museum, the Erwin Township Historical Society has expanded their reach in the community and has become a familiar and trustworthy service for all residents to utilize.
We are blessed to have organizations of this caliber in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, and I am appreciative of their work and service.
On July 1, 2023, the Erwin Township Historical Society will celebrate the completion and dedication of their new walking trail and artifact building in Erwin Heritage Park.
I want to thank all involved in the Erwin Township Historical Society for making these endeavors possible and for facilitating a successful ceremony.
