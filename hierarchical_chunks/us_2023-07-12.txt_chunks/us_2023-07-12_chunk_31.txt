In Chapter 2, the framework pushes teaching methods in math class that emphasize radically egalitarian ``social justice'' goals.
Not only is radical egalitarianism ethically dubious, but math class should be for math, not for political indoctrination.
For example, the current framework contends that mathematics is to be used to ``both understand and impact the world.''
It argues that math teachers should hold the political position that ``mathematics plays a role in the power structures and privileges that exist within our society and can support action and positive change.''
Furthermore, according to this official California framework, teachers should use mathematics politically ``to analyze and discuss issues of fairness and justice.''
In an elementary school classroom, teachers would, for example, have students ``studying counting and comparing to understand fairness'' in the context of current and historical events.
The framework recommends the fringy methods of ``traumainformed pedagogy,'' which encourage students to suggest ``recommendations and taking action.''
Teachers should also, it says, provide ``curricular examples'' that provide students with a mathematical toolkit and mindset ``to identify and combat inequities.''
According to the framework, students are ``to use mathematics to highlight inequities.''
Then they should learn to use mathematics to transform the world--a rather inappropriate task for math class.
