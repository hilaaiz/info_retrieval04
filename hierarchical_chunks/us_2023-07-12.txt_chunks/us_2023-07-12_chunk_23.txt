research quality'' called for by the What Works Clearinghouse?
Conrad says that the framework is invoking neuroscience literature ``in misleading ways'' to promote ``pseudoscientific claims'' about progressive-education math instruction improving pathways in the brain.
The framework wrongly cites a paper to promote the general use of ``invented strategies'' (that is, students devising their own strategies) as a proven approach to learning standard algorithms.
Conrad finds that the framework distorts citations in a way that indicates ``an ideological (rather than evidence-based) opposition to acceleration.''
He points out that ``there is extensive literature with conclusions opposite'' that cited in the framework, ``but these are barely ever mentioned.''
As Wurman and I have written before: State-adopted education programs and recommendations are supposed to be ``research-based.''
This does not just mean an article or 2 in a peer-reviewed journal.
It means there is a consensus or strong evidence of effectiveness in the published research.
If no strong evidence exists, a practice should not be broadly recommended....
If the framework writers had wanted solid evidence, they would have relied on the final report and subgroup reports of the 2008 federal National Mathematics Advisory Panel.
They would have made even more use of the federal Institute of Education Sciences practice guides, which are designed for teachers and curriculum writers.
