Mr. OBERNOLTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Javier M. Sanchez as he completes his term as the 130th President of the San Bernardino County Medical Society.
He began this leadership position representing over 1,700 physicians on June 22, 2022.
Dr. Sanchez is a family medicine physician partner of the Southern California Permanente Medical Group practicing at their Redlands medical offices.
He received his medical degree from the University of lowa Roy J. & Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine in 1996 and completed his residency in family medicine.
Dr. Sanchez has been focused on addressing disparities in medicine and helped develop the Southern California Kaiser Permanente Language Concordance Program which helps match those with limited English proficiency with physicians who are fluent in their first language.
He has been a Clinical Professor of family Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and is currently an Associate Professor of Family Medicine at the University of California Riverside School.
I commend Dr. Sanchez for his service as President of the San Bernardino County Medical Society and remain thankful for the work of all of our medical professionals in California's 23rd District and across the country.
