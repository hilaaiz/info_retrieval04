Housing asylum seekers in hotels—of which there were 6,000 more cases in just the first three months of this Government—is spectacularly expensive.
The Home Secretary’s policy is  to make asylum decisions quickly, so that any costs of the migrants she accepts can be hidden in the welfare system.
The Home Office admits in its impact assessments that it has no idea how much her policy will cost in benefits claims and council housing bills.
Will the Minister commit today to recording and publishing all those costs for migrants whose asylum claims she accepts?
I will take no lessons from the Conservative party, which spent £700 million to send four volunteers to Rwanda and left huge backlogs of more than 90,000 stopped asylum claims—people in hotels, unable to leave because the Conservatives were trying to get their fantasy Rwanda programme off the ground.
