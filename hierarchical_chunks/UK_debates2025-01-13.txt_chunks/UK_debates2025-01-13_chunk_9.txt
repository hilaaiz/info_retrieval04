A focus on neighbourhood policing is welcome; we have seen it in Staffordshire for some time.
Police leaders have said that if they do not have the flexibility to recruit as they need to, there is a risk that police officers will end up having to fill vacancies in specialist areas.
Will the Home Secretary listen to police leaders and give them that flexibility?
The Chair of the Home Affairs Committee makes an important point.
We have said that the neighbourhood policing teams, which we are determined to support, should include police officers and police community support officers, as well as special constables, who too often are underused and underappreciated, in order to recognise the mix of disciplines that we need for the strongest and most effective policing.
Excellent partnership work between Gwent Police, Newport city council and our business improvement district saw crime down by 25% in our city centre at the end of last year, although there is still much to do to improve confidence after neighbourhood policing was slashed under the previous Government.
Does the Home Secretary agree that visibility is key, and will she update us on police numbers in Wales?
My hon.
Friend makes an important point, because this is about visibility, partnership and powers, and she rightly talks about the impact that this kind of work can have.
We want to strengthen the work of police officers across England and Wales by strengthening the powers they have to tackle shoplifting and street theft—snatch theft—which have both increased in recent years.
