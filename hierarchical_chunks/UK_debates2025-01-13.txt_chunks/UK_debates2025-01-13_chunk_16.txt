North Yorkshire is the largest rural county in the country.
Behind the beauty of the villages and hamlets in my constituency of Scarborough and Whitby lies an ugly truth: on average, victims in rural areas are subject to domestic abuse for 25% longer than those in urban areas and are half as likely to report it.
Can the Minister reassure the House that more funding to tackle rural domestic violence is part of the Government’s strategy to halve violence against women and girls?
The strategy to halve violence against women and girls is for every single part of our country.
The Government recognise that victims in rural and remote areas face particular barriers in fleeing abuse and accessing support.
We are already driving forward a range of activities that will support rural victims.
The Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 will require local commissioners to develop joint needs assessments for  victims of domestic abuse, to identify gaps in support.
I encourage all Members to engage with that process when it comes to their local area, and I will happily work with rural MPs in this House to make sure that that is the case.
Palestinian women detained in Israeli prisons face sexual assault, beatings and threats of rape and death, according to United Nations reports.
Given our commitment to tackling violence against women and girls, what discussions is the Minister having with Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office colleagues about the implications of the gender-based violence faced by Palestinians, particularly as Israel continues to deny access to detention sites?
