My hon.
Friend is right to say that the Scottish Government have a significant increase in funding, so they can take action to improve public services.
This Government have made it a mission to halve knife crime over the next decade, including taking action to get dangerous weapons, such as zombie knives and ninja swords, off our streets by preventing the unlawful sale of these lethal blades, particularly to children.
My constituents in Whitley had their Christmas disrupted by an alarming threat of knife crime.
We have seen too many tragedies of this kind in Reading over the last few years, so I wholeheartedly welcome the Government’s mission to halve knife crime.
I have applied for my Earley and Woodley constituency to be a trial location for the new respect orders.
Will the Home Secretary meet me and my constituents to discuss how we can tackle the root problems that cause people, particularly young people, to carry knives?
The Policing Minister and I will happily talk further to my hon.
Friend.
She is right that we need to prevent young people from obtaining and carrying knives in the first place, as well as making sure there is swift intervention.
We are also taking action, working with police forces across the country, to tackle knife-enabled robbery, which is one of the areas that has seen the biggest increases in recent years.
