The shadow Minister missed from his story the role of Liz Truss.
When she was the Chief Secretary to the Treasury in 2017, she made the decision to close our gas storage facility.
Does the Minister agree that if we want energy security and lower prices, that all depends on reducing our reliance on the volatile nature of the international fossil fuel market?
Does that not mean that his clean power action plan for 2030 is exactly the right policy to address the events of the past few days?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
The decisions that the previous Government took on storage are for them to answer, and anyone who looks at their record will rightly raise questions about that.
On the broader point, he is right.
The only plan for how we can get off the volatile fossil fuel markets, to which the previous Government left us far too exposed, is the clean power action plan that we have announced.
If the Tories oppose that, they need to come up with their alternative to deliver the resilience in the system that we are fighting for every single day.
