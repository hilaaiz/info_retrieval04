The Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and I, as the Policing Minister, have said that we want a common-sense approach to dealing with these matters.

We remember those who have lost their lives to knife crime, including 17-year-old Thomas Taylor, killed in Bedford, and 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa, killed in Woolwich just last week.
Kelyan’s mother said: “I tried to prevent it.
I’ve tried so many, so many times.”
No mother should live with that grief or feel that level of fear for her teenage son.
That is why this Government have set up the coalition to tackle knife crime, which involves families, alongside taking new action on serious violence.
