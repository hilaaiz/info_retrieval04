I thank my right hon.
Friend for that answer, and of course my sympathies also go out to that mother this weekend.
Recently published data showed a sharp rise in serious violent crime in Scotland, particularly in our cities and towns.
Too many of my constituents feel unsafe in East Kilbride town centre and the Village, particularly at night.
Meanwhile, the SNP Government’s chronic underfunding of Police Scotland has resulted in officer numbers being at their lowest level since 2008.
Does the Secretary of State agree that the SNP now has the funding in place to increase police numbers, and that protecting our community and citizens should be its priority?
