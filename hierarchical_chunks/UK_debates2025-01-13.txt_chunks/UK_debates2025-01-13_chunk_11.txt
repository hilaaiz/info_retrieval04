I thank the Minister for her answer.
Exposure to toxic substances is an avoidable risk and every firefighter should have access to the resources they need to protect themselves.
The dangerous nature of being a firefighter has also been amplified as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has had more than 1,400 frontline firefighter jobs cut since 2010, a reduction of nearly 20%.
Does the Home Secretary agree that the fire service needs proper investment and a national body with legal standing to set standards on fire cover, training, equalities, and health and safety?
