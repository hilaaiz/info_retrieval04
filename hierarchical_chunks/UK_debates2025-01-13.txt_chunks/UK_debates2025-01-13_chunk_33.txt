I welcome the Government’s plans to tackle youth violence, but also to prioritise early intervention.
In Battersea, brilliant organisations such as Carney’s Community are delivering targeted services to young people—from mentoring and life skills, to boxing and fitness.
Does the Minister agree that organisations such as Carney’s need our support?
Will she agree to visit it so that she can hear at first hand about its approach to tackling youth violence?
