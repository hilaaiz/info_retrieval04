My right hon.
Friend the Minister for Policing, Fire and Crime Prevention is looking at all fire and rescue issues and considering all possibilities, including potential reorganisations, as we move the services forward.
Will the Minister look at early diagnosis for firefighters because, very sadly, many suffer very bad ill health in retirement?
If they are diagnosed early, treatment can be provided to improve the quality and the length of their lives.
I agree that this is an important area and that much more work needs to be done to consider effective contaminants and risks from the dangers that firefighters put themselves in every day to protect life.
What assessment she has made of the impact of crime on rural communities.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help tackle rural crime.

We all understand the devastating harm that crime can cause in rural communities.
The Government are committed to taking action, which is why we will be enacting the Equipment Theft (Prevention) Act 2023 to tackle the theft of agricultural machinery and equipment.
We will strengthen enforcement on fly-tipping and antisocial behaviour, and we will deliver more rural patrols through our neighbourhood policing guarantee.
