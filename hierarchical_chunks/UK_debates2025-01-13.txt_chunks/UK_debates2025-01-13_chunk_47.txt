I thank the Minister for updating and reassuring the House and residents on the robustness of the system, and for his work taking forward a wider diversification of energy supply.
Will he update the House on support for the take-up of heat pumps, to ensure that, in the long run, we are far less dependent on gas from overseas?
Will he also say something about the importance of insulation and what the Government are doing to support further measures to encourage insulation?
