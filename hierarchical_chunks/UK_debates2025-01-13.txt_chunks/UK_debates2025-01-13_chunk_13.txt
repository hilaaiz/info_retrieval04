I thank the Minister for her answer.
She will know that the funding allocations for policing are based on reported crime, not underlying crime rates.
In rural areas such as North Shropshire, people say that they do not always report a crime when it happens.
Residents in Oswestry and Whitchurch tell me that they do not bother to phone the police because they do not think anyone will come.
Will she consider reassessing the formula to ensure that in rural areas the funding reflects the level of underlying crime?
