As the son of a farmer, I remember only too well waking up in the early morning and going downstairs to listen to Radio 4 in silence with my family as we heard about more and more animals being culled during the crisis in the early  2000s.
What steps are being taken to engage the National Farmers Union and other trade bodies to prepare for any outbreak here in the UK?
