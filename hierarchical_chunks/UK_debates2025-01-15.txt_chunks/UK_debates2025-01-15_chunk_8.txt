I thank the hon.
Member for raising the issue of the Public Service Transformation Board.
As he says, the interim board has a £235 million budget for transformation.
Several major projects—on health, special educational needs and justice—are now being sent to the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance for agreement, and I have pushed for the full board to be set up by the end of this financial year.
I agree that it needs to move ahead and get those projects done.
