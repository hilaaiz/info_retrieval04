I thank the hon.
Gentleman not just for his question, but for the concern he expressed about his constituents, who suffered so grievously.
The detailed conversations on these issues are conducted between the veterinary officers, who have a very close network.
However, any political decisions that need to be made will be made by Ministers, and I have a very close relationship with Minister Irranca-Davies.
If further action is needed, we will work together to stop any further incursions.
