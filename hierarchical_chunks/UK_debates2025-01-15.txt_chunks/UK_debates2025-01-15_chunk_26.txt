The Prime Minister knows very well that the Office for Budget Responsibility found no such black hole.
He talks about a mini-Budget three years ago.
Borrowing costs last week were at a 27-year high for 30-year gilts.
The Chancellor is apparently promising to be ruthless in reducing spending.
Let me suggest something that he should cut.
There is no way that we should be giving up British territory in Chagos.
He is rushing a deal that will be disastrous and that will land taxpayers with a multibillion-pound bill.
Why does the Prime Minister think that British people should pay to surrender something that is already ours?
We inherited a situation where the long-term operation of a vital military base was under threat because of legal challenges.
The negotiations were started under the last Government.
The then Foreign Secretary came to this House to say why he was starting negotiations and what he wanted to achieve.
He said that the aim was to “ensure the continued effective operation”—[Official Report,  13 December 2022 ;
Vol. 724, c. 865.] of the base.
That is precisely what this deal has delivered.
There is no one the Prime Minister can blame for this dud deal except himself.
At the Budget, Labour was congratulating itself for having the first female Chancellor, instead of ensuring that the country had someone actually qualified to do the job.

Order.
I want to hear the Leader of the Opposition.
