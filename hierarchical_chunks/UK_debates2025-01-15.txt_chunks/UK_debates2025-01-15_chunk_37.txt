Age UK Leicestershire has done a sterling job over the last few months in supporting pensioners who have lost the winter fuel payment as a result of the Government’s Budget.
It now faces a staggering £400,000 increase in its costs as a result of the increase in national insurance.
What advice can the Prime Minister give to charities such as Age UK that now have to decide whether to cut jobs or slash services to some of the most vulnerable in society?
The advantage, I suppose, of the Leader of the Opposition having no policies is that Opposition Members can say completely contradictory things without breaching their policy.
They want the benefits of the Budget, but none of the tough measures to support the Budget.
We have taken the decision in relation to pension credit and pension allowances, but because of our commitment to the triple lock, there will be an upgrade in April of this year of £460 for everyone.
What I notice is that before Christmas, the shadow Chancellor said that the triple lock is “unsustainable”—unsustainable—so that is their position.
Pensions are going up under this Government because we are committing to the triple lock; the triple lock being unsustainable is their argument.
Later this month, my constituency will mark the anniversary of the tragic murder of Holly Newton.
Will the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary look urgently at the calls from Holly’s mother Micala Trussler to lower the age at which a person can be recognised as a victim of domestic abuse?
