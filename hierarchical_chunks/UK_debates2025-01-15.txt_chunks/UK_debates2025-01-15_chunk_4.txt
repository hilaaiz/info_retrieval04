The Secretary of State will share the concern that I felt yesterday about the news that the four Harland and Woolf shipyards across the United Kingdom would be going into administration, and he will know of the countless businesses throughout the UK that are owed tens of millions of pounds in respect of the work on those fleet solid support ships.
We want their viability to continue, and we know of individual businesses that have been family-owned for generations and have succeeded.
Can the Secretary of State indicate his endeavour to ensure that that viability will be at the forefront of his mind, so that we can deliver the fleet solid support ships in Belfast and Devon?
The administration announcement, which involves the other side of the runway, is part of a process to ensure that the takeover by Navantia goes ahead, because it is very good news.
The right hon.
Gentleman and I were present to celebrate that announcement, which provides security for the future.
Ultimately the question of how to relate to those suppliers is a commercial matter for Navantia, but I am sure that it wants to build a good relationship with firms that will help Harland and Wolff to build the three fleet solid support ships.
While the contract with Airbus is welcome, there is concern about the split of the Spirit plant in Belfast.
Can the Secretary of State reassure me that wider defence and aerospace contracts with companies such as Skyrora in my constituency that are held in Belfast by the non-Airbus part of Spirit will not be put at risk because of that?
I understand my hon.
Friend’s concern.
We will know the answers to these questions when the commercial negotiations are concluded, but I will draw the attention of my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland to the specific issue that she has raised in relation to her constituency.
