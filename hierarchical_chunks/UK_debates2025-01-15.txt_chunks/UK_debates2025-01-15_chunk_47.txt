I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this deeply distressing case.
Our thoughts and sympathies are with Richard Lee and his family.
The Defence Serious Crime Unit continues to appeal for new evidence in this case, and I will make sure that he has a meeting with the appropriate Minister to discuss progress.
