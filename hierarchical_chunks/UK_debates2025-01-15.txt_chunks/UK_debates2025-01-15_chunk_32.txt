I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that issue, which shows the state of public services under the SNP.
If you can believe it, Mr Speaker, a third of Scots struggle to access dentistry, and a quarter of Scottish children start primary school with tooth decay—that is really shocking.
Clearly, there is much more that the SNP should be doing.
[Interruption.]
The SNP should be ashamed.
When a quarter of children are starting school with tooth decay, that is nothing to crow about; it is something to be ashamed of.
Here, we are delivering an additional 700,000 appointments and reforming the contract, and of course we will work with the Scottish Government to improve the health of children in Scotland.
