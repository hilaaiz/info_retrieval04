I recently visited MidKent college, which serves my constituency of Gillingham and Rainham.
It teaches valuable construction skills to young people, but I have been informed that it faces significant challenges in recruiting teachers to deliver those courses.
Does the Prime Minister agree that proper skills training and having the teachers necessary to deliver it is absolutely vital to growing our economy and building the homes that we need for the future?
Will he agree to set up a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss the recruitment challenges that some colleges face?
Skilling up the next generation is vital to kick-start economic growth.
Our plan for change will rebuild Britain by delivering 1.5 million new homes.
That is why we have established Skills England, and are reforming our planning system and training the workforce.
I will ensure that my hon.
Friend gets the meeting that she wants with the relevant Minister.
