As someone who was an academic until about 5 am on  5 July  last year, I thank the Secretary of State for her statement and for the leadership she has shown on this issue.
I will ask a question in the context of my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
I am proud of all the universities in Edinburgh and how they attract students from all over the world, but last year when I visited the Edinburgh Hebrew Congregation, which is the main synagogue in Edinburgh, I was ashamed to hear of the intimidation that Jewish students were facing in university.
I was pleased to hear that universities are taking that seriously
and I know that the Edinburgh faith forum is too.
Freedom of speech is an important right, but that should never extend to bigotry and hate.
Does the Secretary of State agree that students should be free to practise their faith, always, and able to display their faith publicly, no matter what it is, without fear of intimidation?
