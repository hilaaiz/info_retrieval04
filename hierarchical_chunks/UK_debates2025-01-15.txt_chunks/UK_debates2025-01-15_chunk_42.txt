My constituents on the Isle of Wight are entirely reliant on foreign-owned, debt-laden, unregulated ferry companies for essential travel, but public transport in the United Kingdom, such as buses trains and Scottish ferries, is regulated and subsidised.
Does the Prime Minister agree that the Isle of Wight anomaly must come to an end?
Will the Government intervene to protect passengers from excessive ferry prices and bad services?
The hon.
Member is right that the ferry services for his constituents have simply not been good enough.
I know that both he and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Isle of Wight West (Mr Quigley)   share a commitment to ensuring that their constituents receive a better service.
The Maritime Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane) , has met the ferry and hovercraft operators, the leader of the council and other stakeholders.
There will be further meetings, and I will ensure that the hon.
Member is fully informed by the Minister on progress on this issue for his constituents.
This year marks the 850th anniversary of my home city of Glasgow.
One of the key aims of the celebration is to speed up ambitions around the city council’s grand challenge of tackling poverty and inequality and increasing prosperity and opportunity—themes that chime clearly with this Government’s agenda.
Will the Prime Minister join me in congratulating Glasgow on this milestone, and does he agree that people make Glasgow?
