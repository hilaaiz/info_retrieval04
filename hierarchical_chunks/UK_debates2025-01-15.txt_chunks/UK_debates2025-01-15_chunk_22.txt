I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
I am pleased that his constituents are benefiting from upgrades at the station, including, I think, new lifts to make the station fully accessible.
The issues that he raises are faced by passengers right across the country.
That is why we are bringing rail services back into public ownership, setting up Great British Railways, and making ticketing simpler and fairer to ensure a better service for all passengers, including those in his constituency.
