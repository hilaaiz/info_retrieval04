Today  marks 467 days in captivity for Avinatan Or, just one of the more than 100 hostages that Hamas still cruelly hold.
Avinatan is my age and has his whole life ahead of him.
I felt the raw pain of his family when his mum Ditza, a British citizen, shared her story with me as part of the “twin with a hostage” campaign.
Will the Prime Minister assure me that he is doing everything in his power to ensure that all the hostages are returned, so that Avinatan can be at home where he belongs with Ditza and his girlfriend Noa?
