I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that matter and I am deeply sorry for those receiving inadequate care in his constituency.
The previous Government left the NHS in a critical condition.
We cannot deliver growth with record waiting lists and 2.8 million economically inactive people.
Through our plan for change we will invest in NHS diagnostic centres.
I will, of course, consider his invitation.
