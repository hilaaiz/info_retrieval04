I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that tragic case; it is a really important issue.
We have seen an increase in violence in teenage relationships in the last decade, and I have been continually shocked by research that shows there is abuse in relationships at a younger and younger age.
We do need to look at the earliest opportunity at how we properly protect girls.
