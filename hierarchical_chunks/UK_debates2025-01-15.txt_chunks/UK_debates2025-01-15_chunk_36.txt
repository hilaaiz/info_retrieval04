I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this.
I believe everyone is entitled to fair, flexible and secure working.
That is why we introduced our Employment Rights Bill, which is the biggest upgrade  to workers’ rights in a generation.
It includes measures that will end the scandal of fire and rehire, prevent exploitative zero-hour contracts and introduce basic rights for more workers from day one—secure wages, secure jobs and ensuring workers have the rights that they deserve at work.
