Could the Minister confirm, given the seriousness of the issues, that when in doubt the precautionary principle will come to the fore, there will be urgency and the proper decisions will be taken?
He mentioned working with the devolved Administrations.
Given the shared land border on the island of Ireland and the trade there, can he confirm what conversations he has had or may be planning to have with the Government in Dublin?
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right.
We will, of course, take every precaution and apply the precautionary principle.
We treat Northern Ireland in the same way as the other devolved Administrations.
The Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Coventry East (Mary Creagh)  will be having conversations later today.
