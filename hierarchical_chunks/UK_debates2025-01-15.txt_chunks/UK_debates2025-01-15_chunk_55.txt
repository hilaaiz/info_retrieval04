As well as noting my own entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, I should tell the House that my wife is a practising veterinary surgeon who is occasionally contracted to provide local veterinary official services to the APHA.
I, too, remember the events of 2001 and I remember, having just been elected, the debates we had in this House.
We said that we must always learn the lessons and never forget, but in truth, frankly, we have.
The  extent to which we are exposed today is something for which responsibility is shared across the parties.
The state of the APHA headquarters in Weybridge is a disgrace and it is now an urgent disgrace.
Hopefully, this is a bullet that we will dodge, but if we do, we know there is also the risk of African swine fever, bluetongue and avian influenza all coming.
Is this the point where, across the House, we can all agree on the importance of biosecurity and the importance of funding it?
