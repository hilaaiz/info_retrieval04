I thank my hon.
Friend for his question—good try.
At the moment, we are talking about an outbreak in Germany.
Should there be—obviously, we are doing everything we can to prevent it—an outbreak in the UK, we will come back with further proposals, but at the moment we are working hard to make sure that that does not happen.
