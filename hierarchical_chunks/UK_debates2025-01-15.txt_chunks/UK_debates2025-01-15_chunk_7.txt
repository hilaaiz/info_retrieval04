The Minister talks of transformation.
When the Executive were restored at this time last year, the Government put a pot of £235 million into transformation.
A senior Northern Ireland Office official sits on the board.
To date, not one penny has been spent on supporting the transformation of either the health service or the education service.
Can the Minister update the House on what the hold-up is in regard to spending that money?
