I thank the hon.
Lady for expressing her concern.
I reiterate the point I made earlier about the border controls that we have in place.
I am afraid this has been a long-running issue, but we have much stronger border controls in place than we would have done in previous times.
We are working hard with the port health authorities to make sure that we crack down on illegal imports of meat.
