The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to support the aerospace sector in Northern Ireland.
What progress his Department has made on securing the future of Spirit AeroSystems in Northern Ireland.
The Government are working with the Northern Ireland Executive to help to ensure the best outcome for Spirit’s aerospace production and its skilled and hard-working staff in the current commercial negotiations.
It is welcome that the Secretary of State has visited the Spirit AeroSystems site a number of times.
He will know of its importance to advanced manufacturing, and of its aeronautical history in Northern Ireland—it originated in 1908 as Short Brothers—and he will also know that at this stage there is a purchaser for about a third of the facility and a third of the staff.
The current plan fails to recognise not only the integration of the units within Spirit AeroSystems, but its importance to the Northern Ireland supply chain.
Will the Secretary of State join Unite and GMB in their call for the Government to support a one-sale solution, so that the integration of staff, work flows and supply chains continues to benefit for decades to come?
I agree with everything the right hon.
Gentleman has said about the importance of the site and its history, but in the end there will be a commercial outcome.
Airbus wants to buy the bit that makes the A220 wings, because it wants the site to produce more of them, and Boeing is seeking a buyer for the rest of the production.
The right hon.
Gentleman will be well aware of what else is produced on site.
I continue to engage with all those involved, but, as I have said, in the end this will be a commercial decision.
We do, of course, want to see the production and the jobs remain.
