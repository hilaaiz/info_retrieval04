I thank the hon.
Member for raising this, and he knows our support for Ukraine is ironclad.
We are funding NHS doctors and nurses to work closely with their Ukrainian counterparts to share best practice, including how to prevent the spread of infections and AMR.
Through the World Health Organisation, we are also strengthening Ukraine’s health system to provide better care, and we will continue to do so.
