I thank my hon.
Friend for his dedicated campaigning on this issue.
I am proud that the Government have overturned a historic injustice, boosting the pensions of over 100,000 former mineworkers.
We are working closely with the coal staff scheme trustees to consider the proposal, and I will ensure that the Industry Minister keeps him fully updated.
