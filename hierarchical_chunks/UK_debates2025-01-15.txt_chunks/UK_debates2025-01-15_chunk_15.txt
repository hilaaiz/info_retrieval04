I thank the Secretary of State and the Minister for their responses so far.
One response highlighted Northern Ireland as having dual market access.
On that basis, do they agree that initiatives such as the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor in my constituency need support so that we can make the most of our economic opportunities?
