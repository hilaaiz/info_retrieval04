I thank my hon.
Friend for her point and her concern.
We have an extensive set of facilities and agencies who are tasked with protecting our country on these issues.
I have every confidence in the chief veterinary officer and her officials in the APHA, subject to the issues that have been raised around long-term funding.
We have good protections in place and people should have confidence in them.
