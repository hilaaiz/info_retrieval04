I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising this case.
It is appalling that Hamas continue to detain Avinatan and other hostages, including Emily Damari.
I know that the hon.
Gentleman has spent time with the families—it is nothing short of torture what they are going through.
We will do absolutely everything in our power to ensure that we make progress to bring these hostages home—I am sure that I speak for everybody in the House.
We will do everything to try to make sure that we get those hostages home.
