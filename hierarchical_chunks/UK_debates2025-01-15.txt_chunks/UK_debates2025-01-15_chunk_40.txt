You can never have too many Morrises, Mr Speaker.
To their credit, in their first Budget the Labour Government transferred the mineworkers’ pension scheme investment reserve fund, benefiting nearly 4,000 former miners and miners’ widows in my constituency.
However, almost 700 British Coal staff superannuation scheme pensioners in my constituency were excluded.
Will the Prime Minister correct that injustice and ensure that BCSSS beneficiaries—many of them are now elderly and in very poor health—are treated equally to their co-workers in the MPS?
