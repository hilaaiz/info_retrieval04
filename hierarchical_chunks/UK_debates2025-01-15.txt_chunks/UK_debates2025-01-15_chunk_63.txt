I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
I know she takes these issues very seriously and we have discussed them before.
Let me be clear: this is an outbreak in Germany at the moment.
We are doing everything we can to ensure it does not extend into our country.
Of course people are concerned and worried.
Should it develop further, which we are absolutely determined to make sure does not happen, then we will look at further measures to help and support people, but we are not at that stage.
