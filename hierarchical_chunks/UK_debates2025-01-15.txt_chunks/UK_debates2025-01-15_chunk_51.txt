I thank my hon.
Friend for her question and for the concern she has rightly shown.
As I said at the outset, we are well aware of the concern that people feel.
However, they should be reassured that we have very good tracing facilities these days; the technologies have improved.
What is particularly important is that we are in close contact with our German colleagues, who are sharing advice regularly.
Everything that can be done is being done, but I absolutely recognise people’s concerns.
