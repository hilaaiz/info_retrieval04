Does my right hon.
Friend share my optimism that now that the future of the Harland and Wolff yard has been secured, the yard will be able to secure future orders?
I certainly do.
That is one of the great benefits of the commercial agreement that has been reached with Navantia on buying Harland and Wolff, and the adjustments made to the contract to ensure that the fleet solid support ships could go ahead.
This is a great facility, and it is open for business, including for other orders.
A company in my constituency of Strangford is among those that will suffer because of Harland and Wolff being in administration.
This small family firm—I will not put its name in Hansard—will lose half a million pounds.
The impact on that company and others is quite catastrophic.
What can be done to help those companies that, through Harland and Wolff being in administration, will either not be able to trade, or risk losing out entirely?
I recognise the hon.
Gentleman’s concerns.
This is a product of the failure of the old Harland and Wolff.
It now falls to Navantia to decide which of the invoices it wishes to pay, but it will want to secure a relationship with suppliers contributing to the fleet solid support ship programme.
Before we come to Prime Minister’s questions, may I welcome the Speaker of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania, Elisa Spiropali, who is in the Public Gallery?
