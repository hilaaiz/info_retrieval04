I welcome the Government’s efforts in bringing us up to speed today, but also in imposing the import ban.
I recognise that the ban applies to products from Germany, but does it capture products that may originate there but for which the point of import is outside Germany?
What steps are the Government taking to proactively increase spot testing or screening across the country, so that we can get ahead of any possible outbreak?
