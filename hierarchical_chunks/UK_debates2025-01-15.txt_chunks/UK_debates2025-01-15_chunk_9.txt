The Executive have warned of very serious pressures facing the NHS in Northern Ireland, which has the worst waiting times in the United Kingdom—more than six years for some surgeries.
Labour’s manifesto committed to improving public services in Northern Ireland, and it is clear that money alone is unlikely to solve the problem.
What other tangible support will the Government offer the Executive to reduce waiting times for people in Northern Ireland, or will they just devolve and forget?
The hon.
Member is correct to raise the issue of public services, especially health services.
The winter pressures on hospital care and other areas have been shocking to see, and I am grateful to health workers for their work on the frontline at the moment.
This week, I met the UK Government’s Health Minister to talk about how we can provide tangible support, and we have already done so.
As the hon.
Member says, funding is not the only answer; it is also about sharing best practice and expertise.
This Government have committed to doing that through the Public Service  Transformation Board, but there are other practical ways in which we can work together on the best ways to reform.
