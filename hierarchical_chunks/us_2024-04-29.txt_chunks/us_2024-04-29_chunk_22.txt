Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Howard Hanson of Granger, Indiana, and present him with the Congressional Patriot Award for a lifetime of service to our Nation.
Col. Hanson was born on June 28, 1940, in Slayton, Minnesota.
He spent most of his childhood on a family farm and had a desire to serve and defend his country.
In 1963, Col. Hanson commissioned into the United States Air Force and served as a pilot with the 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron and the 522nd Tactical Fighter Squadron.
During the Vietnam War, he flew 315 combat missions in the F-100 Super Sabre fighter jet.
Prior to retiring from military service in 1992, Col. Hanson served as the Commander of the Air Force ROTC Detachment 225 at the University.
He remained at Notre Dame until 2005, where he served as the Assistant Vice President and Director of the Office.
Currently, Col. Hanson works part-time at the Warren Golf Course at Notre Dame.
He is married to his wife Nancy, and together, they raised two children and have many more grandchildren.
In his free time, Col. Hanson participates in community service projects for Kiwanis International and volunteers as a Court Appointed Special Advocate to support children in need.
He also enjoys playing golf and walking his German Shorthair puppy.
I am proud to recognize Col. Hanson today for his important contributions to our community.
It is an honor to bestow Col. Hanson with the Patriot Award for his exceptional service to our Nation.
