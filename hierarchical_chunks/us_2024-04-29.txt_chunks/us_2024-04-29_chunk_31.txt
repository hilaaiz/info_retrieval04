1986, 
Mr. Brown moved to Sherman with his family to become Cola-Cola's Sales Center Manager, a position he held for over 24 years.
During this time, 
Mr. Brown's longtime support of the Sherman business community, as well as his many years of community involvement, did not go unnoticed.
After he briefly retired in 2010, he was selected the following year by members of the Sherman Chamber to serve as its Interim President.
In 2012, 
Mr. Brown became its President and Chief Executive Officer.
Through various initiatives and visionary leadership, he laid the foundation for the Sherman business community's tremendous growth and economic success.
During his 13-year career with the Sherman Chamber, 
Mr. Brown served on the board of the Texas Chamber of Commerce Executives to advocate for the business community and unite business leaders across North Texas.
He was also a board member of the Boys and Girls Club of Sherman and the Sherman ISD Education Foundation.
Moreover, 
Mr. Brown led efforts to connect Grayson College and the Texas Association of Business to ensure it received newly enacted education funding.
In his free time, he enjoys golfing, traveling, and the outdoors.
I am proud community.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol to honor 
Mr. Brown's lifetime of service to the people of North Texas.
May God Bless him.
