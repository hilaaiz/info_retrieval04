Mr. DAVIDSON.
Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 2022, the President signed into law S. 1404, which awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, known as the Ghost Army.
The Congressional Gold Medal is the oldest and highest civilian award in the United States.
I rise today to honor Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II for his contributions, sacrifices, and patriotism while serving in the Ghost Army during World War II.
Due to the unit's sworn secrecy, their service and contributions went unnoticed for far too long.
Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II was born in Mission, Texas, on November 13th, 1915.
Mr. Taylor joined the Civilian Conservation Corps.
After the outbreak of World War II, he was assigned to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops.
This specialized unit comprised only 1,100 brave Americans and often served near the front lines.
