Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor Waddles for his decade of public service in Ypsilanti.
His commitment to his faith, community, and mission is truly inspiring.
I join Pastor Waddle's family, friends, and congregation in extending my best wishes to him during this time, and I am sure he will continue to serve his community far into the future.
