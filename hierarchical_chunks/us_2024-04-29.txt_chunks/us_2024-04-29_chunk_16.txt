Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated for their dedication to the principles of sisterhood, academic excellence, and public service.
For over 116 years, AKA has been a beacon of empowerment for women and a force for positive change in our communities.
I would like to acknowledge the Central Director Kiahna Davis, State Social Action & Connection Chair Sherri Hale, my friend Erica Austin, the Illinois State Co-Coordinator, and Illinois General Assembly Liaison Erika Weaver.
Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority has exemplified leadership and a commitment to uplifting young women from across the country.
The sorority's dedication to academic excellence, social justice, and community service has served as an inspiration to countless people across the country.
I want to sincerely thank members of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc for their enduring contributions to society.
I also want to wish them the best as they visit the Illinois State Capitol, located in Springfield, for their annual day of advocacy.
I look forward to seeing what they are able to accomplish in the coming years.
