Mr. Baker eventually capped off his illustrious career as Vice President for Customer Support at Airbus Helicopters, the first African-American to hold the position.
Throughout his lifetime he overcame many barriers both personally and professionally, while always looking for ways to help others.
He was a man of faith who proudly served our community for many years in his capacity as a Deacon, a member of the Cedar Hill Volunteer Fire Brigade; he was the current President of Summit at Lake Ridge HOA; he served on the UTA Engineering Board of Advisors; a member of the Grand Prairie United Charities Board of Directors, and was involved in countless other charitable endeavors.
My thoughts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved Anthony, particularly his wife, Stacie, and his two children, Anthony DeWayne Baker, Jr. and Avery Alexander Baker.
May his memory last forever.
