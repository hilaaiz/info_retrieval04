Mr. Baker was a graduate of David W. Carter High School in Dallas, Texas before rising through the ranks of Airbus helicopters.
Anthony then went back to school, graduating from Dallas Baptist University with a Bachelor's Degree in Business in 2005.
Anthony's first job was employment at Walls Services delivering sheet rock and in 1991 his career in the aerospace industry began when he landed a job working in the Bond shop at Vought Aircraft, formerly known as LTV.
However, after 3 years with his newfound skills he accepted a temporary position as a blade repairman at American Eurocopter (Airbus), and due to his hard work and determined mindset he was later offered a permanent position.
