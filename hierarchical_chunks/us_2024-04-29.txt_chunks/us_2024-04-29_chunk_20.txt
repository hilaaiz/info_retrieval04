Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Mrs. Barbara Woodroof of Gunter, Texas, and present her with the Congressional Patriot Award.
Barbara has dedicated herself to serving and uplifting our community.
A native of Massachusetts, Barbara lived in the Bay State until 1978.
She received a bachelor's degree from St. Mary's College in South Bend, Indiana, and a Master of Arts in Teaching from Duke University.
After graduation, Barbara taught science in Massachusetts, Texas, and Okinawa, Japan for many years.
She met her wonderful husband George while teaching at Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, and they married in 1980.
Afterwards, they moved to Texas, where Barbara served as the Director of Religious Education at St. Michaels' Catholic Church in McKinney and the Holy Family Catholic Church in Van Alstyne.
In this capacity, she taught confirmation class and worked as a Safe Environment Officer.
In 1997, Barbara became the Precinct Chair of the Grayson County Republican Party after working as an election judge and clerk.
She was elected as the County Chair in 2017 and oversaw Grayson County's election procedures and operations for five years.
Additionally, Barbara served on the Grayson County College Foundation Board and helped raise money to provide students in our community with scholarships.
For her outstanding work and efforts, the GCRP has presented Barbara with the Eisenhower Award and the Chairman's Award.
Currently, she volunteers for the St. Vincent de Paul Food Pantry at St. Michaels and helps fundraise and campaign for local candidates.
In her free time, she enjoys gardening, scrapbooking, and traveling.
I am proud of the work Barbara has accomplished, and I am sure she will continue to make a positive impact on our community for many years to come.
It is an honor to bestow Barbara with the Patriot Award for her exceptional service to the people.
