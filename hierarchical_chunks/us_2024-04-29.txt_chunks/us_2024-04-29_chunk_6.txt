Mr. Taylor helped conduct numerous deceptive campaigns with the Ghost Army throughout Europe.
During his service, he received a Certificate rank possible for an enlisted soldier.
While the Ghost Army's work was secret, its impact was substantial.
The Ghost Army performed 22 ``deception missions'' across the front lines of France, Belgium, and Germany.
By simulating the movement of 30,000 service members, the Ghost Army fooled German forces and aided General Patton at several critical junctures in World War II.
It is my honor to recognize the service Sergeant Major James C. Taylor and the Ghost Army.
Their dedication and service saved thousands Taylor posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family and country.
