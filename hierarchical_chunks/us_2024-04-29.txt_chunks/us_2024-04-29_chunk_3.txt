Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy executive director and the President of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation in Charlottesville overseeing the historical process and interest of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.
As a native Mississippian, he was known for his ``Magnolia Alerts'' which would alert him to any vehicle with a Mississippi license plate.
David would personally go to the visitor's center and welcome his fellow Mississippians to Monticello.
He was known as ``the most consequential president on the Mountaintop since Jefferson himself.''
He worked hard to raise money for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation and to expand the research capabilities at Monticello.
David made the history of Jefferson accessible to everyday Americans through expanding Monticello's programing and growing their audience.
Dr. David Jordan was a frequent visitor to the Neshoba County Fair in Mississippi, even during his long tenure in Virginia.
I'm thankful for Dr. Jordan's dedication to the scholarship of history, the years of research into Jefferson's life, and his unwavering commitment to his Mississippi roots.
I will end with some of David's words about President Jefferson.
``We have 200 people trying to keep up with one man--one dead man, and we will never catch him.''
If anyone got close to catching Jefferson, it was Dr. Daniel Jordan.
