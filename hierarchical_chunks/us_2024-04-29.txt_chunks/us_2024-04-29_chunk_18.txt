Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commend and honor the outstanding work of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated, an organization that has long been a beacon of hope and a catalyst for social justice in our communities.
Since its inception, Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc. has stood firmly at the forefront of the fight for fairness and equity, tirelessly advocating for the rights and well-being of all people.
I also want to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of Alpha Phi Alpha, particularly Midwestern Regional Vice President Frank Stacy Jr., Illinois State Director Dr. Leonard McKinnis II, and Michael Gaines and Robert Dixon, the Directors of Illinois Day at the Capitol.
Their commitment to community empowerment and activism serves as an inspiration to us all.
Together, these individuals and organizations embody the spirit of service and selflessness, working tirelessly to provide communities with the tools, knowledge, and support they need to amplify their voices and effect positive change.
They remind us that true empowerment begins with collective action and a commitment to social justice.
I wish them all the best as they visit the Illinois State Capitol, located in my district, for their annual advocacy day.
