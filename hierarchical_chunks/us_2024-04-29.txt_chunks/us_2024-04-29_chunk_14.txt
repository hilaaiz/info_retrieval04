federal government both strengthen protections for workers in the workplace and defend the rights of workers to organize and create strong unions.
For this reason, I am proud to be an original cosponsor Washington to push Congress to take up and pass pro-worker legislation.
As someone who got their start in the labor movement, I will never stop advocating on behalf of the working men and women who serve as the backbone of this country.
On this Workers Memorial Day, I am proud to take this opportunity to honor them and the sacrifices they have made over the years to fight for their right to be treated with dignity.
