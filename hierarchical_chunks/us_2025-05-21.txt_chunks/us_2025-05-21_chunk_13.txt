Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a remarkable South Carolinian--a woman who embodied the values of hard work, resilience, compassion, and grace.
Thelma Lee Edwards-Riley, a daughter of Holy Hill, South Carolina, was born on July 10, 1930.
She was a woman who was devoted to her family.
A mother to Martha Stocker and Calvin Riley, she led a life full of warmth, love, and quiet strength.
Her pride in her children was unbounded.
She found joy in the simple and honest labor of working in her yard, tending lovingly to her plants and flowers.
Her garden reflected her spirit: nurturing, patient, and full of life.
Just as she cultivated her garden, she poured care, time, and love into the lives of those around her, most especially Colombia's Belvedere Community.
Thelma Riley had a heart always ready to help whoever was in need.
Whether someone needed a comforting word, a helping hand, or just a listening ear--she was there without hesitation and without expectation.
The personification of the life and legacy of 
Ms. Riley is encapsulated in the twenty-fifth chapter of Mark, verse 40, `Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.' ''
