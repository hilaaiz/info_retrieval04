This weekend, across Western New York and the Southern Tier, veterans and families will gather at town centers, VFW halls and cemeteries to commemorate the fallen and ensure that their sacrifice will never be forgotten.
This is a responsibility that we all must pass on to the next generation, to continue this great tradition in memory of those who made this life of freedom and opportunity possible.
Today, we remember those we've lost and give thanks to the veterans still among us.
We are the land of the free because we are the home of the brave.
The selflessness of our service members inspires deep gratitude every day--not just on Memorial Day.
May we never forget their sacrifice.
