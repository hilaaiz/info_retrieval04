Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of those brave men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the United States.
On behalf of the United States Congress, and the constituents of the 23rd Congressional District, I am proud to recognize our brave service members' courage, sacrifice, and valor as we come together this Memorial Day.
All gave some, and some gave all.
Memorial Day is more than a long weekend--it is sacred time for a grateful Nation to reflect on the cost returned.
In America--the greatest country on Earth--our founding promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is preserved only through the sacrifice of our heroes.
The American flag flies in red, white, and blue--each color rich with meaning.
Blue stands for vigilance and justice, a call to remain steadfast in our values.
White reflects our Nation's ideals and purity defending our rights.
