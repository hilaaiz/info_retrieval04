Mr. Speaker, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in celebrating the life of 
Ms. Thelma Lee Edwards-Riley.
Let us remember her with the love she gave so freely.
Let us keep her memory alive through the acts of kindness we show, the care we offer others, and the strength we find in one another.
Her life was a blessing and her memory a treasure.
