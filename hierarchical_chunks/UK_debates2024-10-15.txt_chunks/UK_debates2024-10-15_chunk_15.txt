My constituent Mel Lycett has terminal cancer.
After repeated visits to her GP, she was referred to a two-week urgent pathway in May.
She was not diagnosed until the end of July, and she still has not started treatment.
Every single target for her diagnosis and treatment was missed.
That is not uncommon in Shropshire, and it is not uncommon in the rest of the country.
Can the Secretary of State reassure me of what he is doing to deal with this terrible legacy left behind by the Conservative Government?
How will he ensure that cancer patients are treated in a timely manner?
