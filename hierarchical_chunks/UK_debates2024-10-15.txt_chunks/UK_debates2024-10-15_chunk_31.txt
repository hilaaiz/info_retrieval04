I welcome all efforts to increase the number of GPs throughout England.
Residents in new and growing towns such as Wixams in Mid Bedfordshire need a GP surgery.
My local councils have been told that they need to put up the capital to deliver one, causing concern about cash flow and borrowing costs.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss a new capital investment programme to ensure that residents in new towns such as Wixams do not have to wait for developer contributions to get the services they need?
