I thank the hon.
Member for raising awareness of this important issue.
He has spoken powerfully about the experiences of patients in his constituency and his wife’s personal battle with sepsis.
The long-term complications of sepsis can have a devastating impact long after discharge from hospital.
Through the National Institute for Health and Care Research, the Department is funding research to improve outcomes for sepsis survivors.
