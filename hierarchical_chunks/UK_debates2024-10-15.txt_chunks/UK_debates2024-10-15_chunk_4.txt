I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for helping to underline the shocking inheritance from the previous Government.
He is absolutely right.
We are committed to cutting waiting times and serving constituents, like mine, by delivering the long-term reform the NHS desperately needs.
The Government are committed to the funding model.
We are not going to change it.
He tries this every time, but we are committed to the funding model as it exists.
