Will the Secretaryof State meet me to discuss a cross-departmental pilot in my constituency, bringing together the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Education and the Department of Health and Social Care, to tackle some of the immediate pressures that face child and adolescent mental health services in my area, and the impact on schooling, the local work force and family outcomes?
By cutting mental health waiting lists and intervening earlier, we can get this country back to health and back to work.
There are 2.9 million people who are economically inactive, a large proportion owing to mental health issues.
Many people can be helped back into work through talking therapies.
We will put a mental health professional in every school and roll out 8,500 specialists.
I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss the matter further.
