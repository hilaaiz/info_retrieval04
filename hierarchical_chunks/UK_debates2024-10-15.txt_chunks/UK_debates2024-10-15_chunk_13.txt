The Prime Minister has repeatedly stressed the importance of preventing people from taking up smoking, as one of his priorities to improve the nation’s health, reduce waiting lists and lessen demand on the NHS, and we  agree.
The Government like to talk about the record of their first 100 days in office but, according to data from Action on Smoking and Health, 280 children under the age of 16 take up smoking in England each day.
That is 28,000 children in England during the Secretary of State’s first 100 days.
Why has he not yet reintroduced our Tobacco and Vapes Bill?
How many children need to take up smoking before he makes this a priority?
Perhaps the shadow Minister would like to give us the figures for the entire 14 years that his party was in government.
By the way, just to set the record straight, not only did I propose the measures in that Bill during an interview with The Times earlier last year, but if it was such a priority for the Opposition, why did they leave the Bill unfinished?
Why had it only had its Second Reading?
And why did we go into the general election with that Bill unpassed?
I will tell him why: because his party was divided on the issue, and the then Prime Minister was too weak to stand up to his own right-wingers who are now calling the shots in his party.
The smoking Bill will be back, it will be stronger and, unlike the previous Government, we will deliver it.
