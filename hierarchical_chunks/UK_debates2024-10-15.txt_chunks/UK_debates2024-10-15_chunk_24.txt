I thank the hon.
Gentleman for setting out a list of all the failures of the past 14 years.
He is dealing with that mess thanks to Members on the Benches he sits on.
I strongly encourage his constituents to get actively involved in the 10-year plan that we will launch.
There will be an important national engagement exercise on shifting from hospital to community, from sickness to prevention and from analogue to digital, because given the total and utter chaos that we inherited, we need systemic reform.
