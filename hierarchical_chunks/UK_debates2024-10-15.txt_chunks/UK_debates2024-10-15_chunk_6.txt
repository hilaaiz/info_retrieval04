I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his good wishes.
It is, indeed, a huge task we have before us.
We will maintain ambulance capacity throughout this winter.
He makes a valuable point about alternative models to hospital admissions and treatment in the community.
That is a matter for the local ICB, as I  know he knows.
It needs to look at which model is the best fit, particularly in rural areas, to reduce the pressure on frontline A&E services.
