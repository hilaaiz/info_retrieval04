The Labour manifesto spoke of the need for a consensus on social care, and the Secretary of State has said that he wants to reach out across the political divide—although the message does not seem quite to have reached the Minister yet.
During Health and Social Care questions in July, the Minister said that there would be announcements in the near future, but since then we have heard nothing.

I am not sure if the right hon.
Gentleman was listening to my previous answer.
We have just set out a groundbreaking piece of legislation to settle the issue of adult social care pay, which is more than the last lot did in 14 years.
We are absolutely committed to building cross-party consensus.
We know that we need a process that will be sustainable and fix adult social care for the long term.
That absolutely includes engagement and dialogue across this House, because we want to build a consensus that works.
We recognise that successive Governments have failed to get a grip on this issue, but we recognise the vital role that adult social care will play.
It is going to be a hugely  important part of our 10-year plan for the future of the NHS, and I look forward to engaging with all hon.
Members on this issue.
