I welcome the hon.
Lady to her role.
I am afraid that this case is just one of countless stories of people whose lives might have been saved had the NHS been there for them when they needed it.
It is bad enough when people receive a late diagnosis that equates to a death sentence; it is worse still when people in that position are not given the fighting chance of urgent, life-extending treatment.
