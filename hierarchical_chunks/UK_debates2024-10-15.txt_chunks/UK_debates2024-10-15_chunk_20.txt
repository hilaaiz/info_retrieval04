I thank my hon.
Friend for raising that deeply tragic case.
Words cannot express the heartbreak caused to Jamie Pearson’s friends and family.
I hope it might be some small comfort to them to know that all acute hospitals should now have a 24/7 mental health liaison service in A&E, and we are looking at how best to take forward the Government’s suicide prevention strategy for England.
We will do everything in our power to ensure that the tragic circumstances of Jamie’s untimely death are addressed, and that lessons are learned.
I am happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss that further.
