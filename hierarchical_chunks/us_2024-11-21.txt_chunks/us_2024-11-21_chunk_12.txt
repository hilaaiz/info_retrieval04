Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and life of Hendrik ``Hank'' Poppen of Portage, Michigan.
Hank Poppen was born in Wildervank, Netherlands, on July 28, 1951.
He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1957 and became a United States citizen in 1988.
Hank attended Kalamazoo Christian Schools and dedicated much of his life to serving the Kalamazoo and Portage communities.
In 1989, Hank found a lifelong passion when he and his son Brian joined Boy Scout Troop 244, where he then became the Scout Leader.
Through the years Hank watched his son, daughter, granddaughter, and 175 other scouts rise to Eagle Scout.
He took his beloved troop on hundreds of trips throughout the United States, even when his health failed him.
Hank was a remarkable individual characterized by his faith and love for his community.
Most of all, he loved his family.
On November 12, 2024, at the age of 73, Hank passed away surrounded by the people he loved most.
He is survived by his children, grandchildren, siblings, dearest friends, and the many scouts, students, and people he impacted throughout his life.
