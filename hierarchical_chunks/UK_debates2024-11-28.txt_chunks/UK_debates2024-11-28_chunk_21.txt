I recognise the huge contribution to communities made by grassroots clubs such as the ones my hon.
Friend has mentioned; I have seen that at first hand in my constituency in Barnsley.
I appreciate the number of challenges those clubs face, and I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss the options available.
Grassroots football is supported by medium and large community-based football clubs, such as AFC Fylde in my constituency, Chorley FC in your constituency, Mr Speaker, and Wigan Athletic in the Secretary of State’s constituency.
Wigan sadly posted a £13 million loss for the last financial year.
How does the Secretary of State think the club can make itself more financially resilient, given the significant impact that the need to pay national insurance contributions will have on their finances?
The hon.
Gentleman raises an important point.
That is why we are continuing the work of the previous Government by introducing our own Football Governance Bill to hopefully put football on a sustainable footing.
Kettering Town FC are currently the leading FA cup goal scorers, and are in the second round of the men’s FA cup on Sunday.
Will the Minister join me in wishing the Poppies the very best of luck in that game?
What steps is she taking to improve the financial resilience of local clubs such as Kettering Town FC?
I will of course put on record that I wish the team good luck and send them my huge thanks and congratulations.
The work that we are doing to support grassroots football, through our multi-sport grassroots facilities programme, will hopefully grow the grassroots game.
