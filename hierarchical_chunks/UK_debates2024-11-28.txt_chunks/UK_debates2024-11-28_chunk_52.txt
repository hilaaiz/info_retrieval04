First, I thank  the hon.
Member for Rochdale (Paul Waugh)  for raising the issue of epilepsy.
It is particularly important to me, as many years ago, I woke up in hospital, having had a seizure in my sleep.
I know how life-changing it can be.
In October, as the Leader of the House may remember, I raised the issue of half a million British pensioners overseas whose pensions have been frozen.
Many of those pensioners are originally from my constituency, and I have heard from further former residents since that occasion.
The Leader of the House kindly offered to raise it with the relevant Government Departments.
On behalf of the campaign, Anne Puckridge—a former war veteran who has been affected—is coming over next week for her 100th birthday, and had hoped to meet with leading politicians, including my own party leader, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Ed Davey) , who will be meeting her next week.
Unfortunately, I have heard this morning that the Prime Minister has declined to meet Anne, and is referring her to the Pensions Minister.
I appreciate that, but Anne is very disappointed, as she feels that this issue really needs to be tackled by the Prime Minister, and she wanted him to hear what she had to say.
I wonder if the Leader of the House could perhaps make further representations to the Prime Minister to see whether he will meet Anne.
I am sure the hon.
Lady can appreciate that the Prime Minister’s diary is not under my control, and is also incredibly busy.
However, I will make sure that the Pensions Minister is able to meet her constituent when she comes over next week, and I will certainly ensure that the Prime Minister is aware of this matter, and that the Pensions Minister looks into it properly.
