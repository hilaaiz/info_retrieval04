Yesterday marked Fuel Poverty Awareness Day, and just last week Ofgem unveiled another increase to the energy price cap for this winter—an increase of 1.2% in January 2025.
This follows a 10% rise in October and multiple occasions on which the Government have failed to prioritise energy support for this winter.
For example, the warm home discount scheme will not benefit households until 2025, and financial energy support for 1.2 million pensioners was removed under changes to the winter fuel payment.
Recent polling from the Warm This Winter campaign has found that almost half of those polled—47%—are worried about how they will stay warm this winter.
When can the House expect a statement from the Government on tackling fuel poverty this winter?
