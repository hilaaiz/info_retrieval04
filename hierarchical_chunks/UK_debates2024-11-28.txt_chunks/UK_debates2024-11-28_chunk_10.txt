I thank the Secretary of State for her enthusiastic response to the questions.
In my constituency, and for Ards and North Down borough council, the creative industries are really important, whether that be arts, metal sculptures or music, and Ulster Scots runs through the veins of all that.
May I invite the Secretary of State to come to Northern Ireland and my constituency of Strangford to observe and enjoy all that we have?
She will never see anything else like it.
