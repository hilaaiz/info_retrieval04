I thank my hon.
Friend for that refreshing question—normally as politicians we like to repeat questions that have come from others, so she has definitely got a gold star for that.
As someone who spent many childhood holidays in Morecambe, I am very familiar with it, and I am delighted that the Eden Project, other programmes, and the money that the Government have brought in will revitalise that gorgeous seaside town.
I am sure she will be able to raise such issues in forthcoming questions on many occasions.
