I thank the right hon.
Lady, but I do not accept the premise of the question.
The Government are doing more than ever to ensure that our railways are reliable and accessible.
The Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill is, I think, to become an Act today.
We are also bringing forward additional funding for buses, on which the Transport Secretary made a statement to the House, as well as bus reform.
Part of our agenda for transport is about ensuring that local communities design those programmes for the needs of their local areas, and it is right that Mayors do that.
