I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
She has done amazing work over the years with the Leigh Film Society and other thriving organisations that are leading the way.
From the conversations she and I have had, I am well aware of the importance of grassroots societies and venues in places such as Leigh and Wigan, and we are determined to put rocket boosters under them.
We are already working on supporting grassroots music venues and supporting voluntary action around a levy.
In addition, we are helping to channel funding to those smaller organisations so that they can create the pipeline of talent that enables people from places such as Leigh to go on and make a national impact.
