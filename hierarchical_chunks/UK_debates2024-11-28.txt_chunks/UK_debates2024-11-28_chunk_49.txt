I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising the accessibility of elections, especially for those with visual impairment or who are blind.
It is a really important matter.
I know that many of those in this House with disabilities find it difficult to vote here, as well—it gets raised with me often.
We have Housing, Communities and Local Government questions coming up next week, and I would encourage the hon.
Gentleman to raise this matter then.
