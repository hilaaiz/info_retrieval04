I am aware of the huge ambition that my hon.
Friend has for South Derbyshire, and the contribution that its people can make to our arts and culture and creative industries.
This Government are supporting those aspirations with a £3 million expansion of the creative careers programme, so that young people can find those jobs and get access to those opportunities.
