I thank my hon.
Friend for that question, which she and I have discussed in private as well.
As we discussed, amendments on Second Reading, while called reasoned amendments, do open with, “We decline to give this Bill a Second Reading”; should the amendment be selected, that would mean that the Second Reading debate and vote would not proceed.
As I said to the shadow Leader of the House, I say gently to my hon.
Friend that, as I have said a number of times now at this Dispatch Box, should the Bill pass Second Reading, the Government will work with the sponsoring Member, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Spen Valley (Kim Leadbeater) , to ensure that the Bill is operable and implementable, and that it will be implemented should the House wish it.
That work will begin in earnest after Second Reading.
Should the Bill not pass Second Reading, that work would not happen at all.
I think hon.
Members should consider that when considering the principles of the Bill, and not get too bogged down in some of the process.
