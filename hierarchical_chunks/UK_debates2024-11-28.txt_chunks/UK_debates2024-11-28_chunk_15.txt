I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I know Dudley well, and I know that she is a strong advocate for the area she represents.
I reassure her that the Government are committed to supporting those places in need through the community wealth fund.
We are working at pace on the details and delivery of the fund and will set out the next steps in due course.
