I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that incredibly important issue.
We have heard the message loud and clear from the music industry that the deal that was struck on touring is having a difficult effect on many artists from the UK.
We are also aware that that works both ways, and we need a much improved agreement with our friends in the European Union to ensure that their artists can come and perform here and our artists can freely go and perform there.
My right hon.
Friend the Paymaster General and Minister for the Cabinet Office is currently undertaking those negotiations, and we are determined to resolve the issue.
