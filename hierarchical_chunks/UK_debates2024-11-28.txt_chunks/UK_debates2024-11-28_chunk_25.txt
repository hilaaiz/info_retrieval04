I thank my hon.
Friend for raising an issue that is so important to fans throughout the country.
The Government, including my right hon.
Friend the Business Secretary, have acted decisively in announcing a consultation in order to consider how best to put fans back at the heart of ticketing, not whether to do it.
We will say more about this imminently.
