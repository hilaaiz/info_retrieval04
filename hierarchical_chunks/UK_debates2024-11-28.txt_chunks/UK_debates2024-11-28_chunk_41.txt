I thank the hon.
Member for that, and I hope he had a good time in Manchester.
I do not know whether he was there for the football, but I was at the Man City game on Saturday—the less said about that, the better.
If he is looking for the allocation of time for future business, he should please not mention the Tottenham game to me ever again, thank you very much.
