Will the Culture Secretary welcome the news that, thanks to levelling-up funding, Malvern theatres in the west midlands will be expanding?
Planning permission was granted last week, which will give lots of young people an opportunity to get jobs in the creative industries.
When the new theatre has been built, will she come to open it and meet some of those young people?
I would be delighted to do so.
I thank the hon.
Member for her support for theatres, arts and culture, and for always being a strong voice for them in this place.
One reason that we have prioritised expanding the creative careers programme is that we are determined that as many parts of the country as possible play their full part in the growth success story that is our creative industries, and that young people in such communities  get access to those opportunities and go on to have flourishing careers.
I would be delighted to come and open the theatre when the work is finally done.
Bath is a city of music, but so many of the musicians in the city and across the UK face enormous bureaucratic barriers when they want to perform in the EU.
Can the Secretary of State update me on what progress has been made on this issue?
