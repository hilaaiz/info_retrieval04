I thank the Minister for her detailed answer, and for all the work the Government are doing to support grassroots football.
We have many grassroots football clubs in my constituency, including Nuneaton Town and Nuneaton Griff, and we understand their importance and contribution to the town.
Both clubs have struggled recently, especially in securing a ground; they have to share one with their competitors in Bedworth.
While we appreciate their hospitality, we would like to meet Ministers to talk about how to bring football home to Nuneaton.
