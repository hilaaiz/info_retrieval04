I thank my hon.
Friend for being such an outstanding champion of his community, and I extend my warmest congratulations to Newton Aycliffe.
He is right to highlight the invaluable contribution that families make to the success of young people.
They often pitch in as volunteers and coaches, and take children and young people to matches come rain or shine—I imagine that in his neck of the woods, like mine, it is more often rain than shine.
I am really glad that they have such a good champion.
