I welcome the timely questions from my hon.
Friends as we are in the middle of Disability History Month.
The Church has started a project to support local parishes to adapt their buildings to make our churches more accessible.
It includes standardising signage to make accessibility obvious, training for church leaders and staff, and a grant scheme for adaptations.
The Church also continues to develop worship and educational resources, which are available nationally to people who are housebound and their carers.
