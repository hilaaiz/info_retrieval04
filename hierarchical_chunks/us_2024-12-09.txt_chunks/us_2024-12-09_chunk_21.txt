Ms. PINGREE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to recognize an organization that has done so much to make Maine a national leader in energy efficiency.
This past October, in recognition of its efforts to accelerate the replacement of fossil fuel appliances with more efficient electric alternatives in our state, Efficiency Maine received the ``Leader of the Pack'' award from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
The fact that this award is only given once every five years is a testament to just how impactful Efficiency Maine's programs have been.
Between 2010 and 2023, the share of Maine households that used heating fuel as their primary heat source fell from 70 percent to 50 percent.
That's a remarkable improvement--and the programs offered by Efficiency Maine have played a significant role in this trend.
Its initiatives in the areas of consumer-education, income-differentiated rebates, pilot programs for new technology, and close collaboration with local tradespeople have been truly remarkable.
By promoting the transition from fossil fuel-dependent heating systems to those that rely on clean, renewable energy, Efficiency Maine is helping our state reduce its carbon footprint--proving that ``going green'' can mean ``saving green,'' too.
Organizations like Efficiency Maine are absolutely critical to helping citizens embrace the power they have to bring about a greener, more sustainable future for our country.
I thank them for their incredible work, their tireless service, and their steadfast commitment to Maine's growing green economy.
