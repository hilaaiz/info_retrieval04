Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking my summer interns.
You cannot help but be inspired by our future, if you spend some time with the many great interns who work on Capitol Hill.
They work hard, they do important work interacting with constituents, and their passion and inspiration must be recognized.
I'm grateful to our team and I wish them the very best for their futures.
