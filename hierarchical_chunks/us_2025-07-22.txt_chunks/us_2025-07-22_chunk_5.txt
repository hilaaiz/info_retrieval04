Mr. Speaker, as 
Mrs. Papagiannis celebrates her centennial surrounded by loved ones, we pay tribute to a remarkable woman whose story represents the very best of the American immigrant experience who lived the American dream.
May her legacy continue to inspire, and may her next chapter be filled with joy and peace.
