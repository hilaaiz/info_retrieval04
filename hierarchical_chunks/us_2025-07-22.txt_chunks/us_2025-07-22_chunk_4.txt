Mrs. Stephanie Papagiannis, as she celebrates her 100th birthday on July 25, 2025.
a century marked by perseverance, family, faith, and an enduring love for this country.
Born in 1925 in the village of Vishini now known as Vissinia.
Stephanie grew up amid the political and cultural upheaval.
She witnessed firsthand the efforts to erase the language and customs of the native Macedonian people, yet she never lost her sense of identity or resilience.
In 1952, with incredible courage and hope, Stephanie left behind a war-torn Europe and emigrated to the United States with her young son, James, to reunite with her husband Peter in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Together, they built a new life grounded in hard work, community, and opportunity.
The couple raised three children, and today, their family has grown including five grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.
Stephanie and Peter contributed meaningfully to the local community, opening two highly regarded establishments; the Pontiac Rib Bar and Pete's Gateview Inn.
Their restaurants were not just businesses they were gathering places that embodied their warmth and entrepreneurial spirit.
A proud member of Fort Wayne's Macedonian American community, Stephanie maintained strong ties to her heritage and faith through St. Nicholas Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral, founded by her relatives.
Her life has served as a bridge between generations and is inspiring to all.
