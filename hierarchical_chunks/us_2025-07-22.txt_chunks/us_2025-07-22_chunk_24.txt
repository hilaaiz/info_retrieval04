Mr. MULLIN.
Mr. Speaker, it is with heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great woman and dear friend and neighbor, 
Mrs. Christa Sullivan of South San Francisco, California.
Christa passed away peacefully on Wednesday, July 2, 2025 and her funeral mass will be held for family and friends on Thursday, July 24, 2025 at 1:00 pm at Saint Agnes Church in San Francisco, California.
A native daughter of Germany, Christa immigrated to the United States as a girl.
She worked at St. Mary's Hospital, where she met and married the love of her life, the late Detective Patrick Sullivan.
Christa was a beloved mother and is survived by her children Stephanie, Kevin (along with his wife Orla), and Christian (along with his wife Karen), and her grandchildren Mick, Leah, Casey, Caeli, and Patrick.
She was a lover of animals, and a longtime volunteer at St. Veronica's Parish, Mercy High School and Serra High School.
She was a steadfast supporter the founder and lifelong advocate for their association.
Christa will be remembered for her warmth, quiet strength, and unwavering faith.
She lived a life rooted in service to her community and family, for which we will be forever grateful.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and the residents of California's Fifteenth Congressional District in rising to recognize a life well lived, and to extend our deepest sympathies to Christa's family, friends, and loved ones during this difficult time.
We pray that they will be consoled and comforted in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
