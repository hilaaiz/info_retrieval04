first place.''
That was Chad.
A source of wisdom and calm, always there when you needed him.
He lived in Stevenson Ranch with his wife Michelle and their daughter Brigette.
And while no words can ease the pain of this loss, I hope his family knows just how deeply loved and appreciated Chad was by all of us.
Chad was the kind of guy who would get there early to help set up an event, and then he would be breaking down the tables and chairs afterwards.
He was a talented designer and photographer.
He knew how to communicate, and he used that skill for the benefit of businesses and causes close to his heart.
Chad was known for his booming voice.
For many new activists getting involved, their introduction to civic engagement was seeing Chad kickoff a meeting or rally before taking the time to greet them and every person there, always with a big smile and an infectious laugh.
He embodied the truth, that the greatest title of responsibility in any democracy is that of citizen.
Chad was a rock of principle.
He was committed to making his community, his state and his country better.
And month after month, year after year, he did the work.
He and Michelle profoundly changed the Santa Clarita Valley for the better, and his impact will never be forgotten.
Chad gave so much of himself to this community because he believed in people and in the power of showing up.
His absence leaves a real void, but his spirit lives on in the work he championed and the friendships he built.
May we honor him not just in words, but in how we carry ourselves--with compassion, humility, and a commitment to something greater than ourselves.
