Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of Joseph H. ``Joe'' Campbell, a respected farmer and pioneer in California's table grape industry, who passed away on July 10, 2025, at the age of 81.
Joe Campbell was part of a generation that helped shape the modern agricultural landscape of the Central Valley.
After graduating from Delano High School in 1960 and serving in the U.S. Army, Joe began farming in 1969.
He first grew cotton and wheat, then later moved into almonds and, ultimately, table grapes.
In 1986, he leased his first vineyard, setting the course for what would become a transformative career in California agriculture.
Through his leadership roles at Delano Farms and Four Star Fruit, Joe helped grow the combined operation into one of the largest table grape producers in the state.
His business decisions often required risk, but they were grounded in instinct, common sense, and a deep familiarity with the communities in which he operated.
He played a defining role in shaping California's table grape industry--a legacy that endures.
While Joe's work ethic and vision helped drive the success of a major agricultural enterprise, he remained grounded in his roots and true to the values that shaped him.
He was known for his humility, consistency, and dedication to his family above all else.
He shared a long and loving marriage with his wife, Jana, and raised three sons who continue his legacy in agriculture.
Joe Campbell's story is a reminder of the strength and promise of California's farming families.
His contributions helped define an industry, and his example will continue to influence the generations that follow.
