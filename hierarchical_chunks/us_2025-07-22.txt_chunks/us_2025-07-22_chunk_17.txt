Mr. WEBSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Centennial of the Town of Windermere, Florida.
Originally established as a residential development in 1889 and formally chartered in 1925, Windermere's history is both rich and unique.
Its first post office opened in 1888, briefly closed in 1901, and reopened in 1911, signaling the resilience of a growing town.
The Florida Midland Railroad once ran just west of Main Street, where a bustling station once stood.
Today, a grassy expanse marks that historic path, serving as a quiet tribute to Windemere's early days.
Nestled on a scenic isthmus between Lake Butler, Lake Down, and Lake Bessie.
Windermere is a tranquil gem ``Among the Lakes'' in the heart.
With just over 3,000 residents within its twosquare-mile boundary, it has maintained a distinct small-town charm defined by tree-lined street, historic architecture, and a vibrant, close-knit community.
Just minutes from world-class attractions like Walt Disney World and downtown Orlando.
Windermere remains a quiet sanctuary rooted in history and guided by a shared commitment to quality of life.
The town owes much to the visionaries who helped incorporate it 100 years ago, including Cal Palmer, J. Howard Johnson, Howard Lyon, and Stanley Scott.
Their legacy lives on in Windermere's thoughtful planning and strong community values.
Over the past century, Windermere has grown while steadfastly preserving its natural beauty and heritage.
Today, it offers an exceptional blend of peaceful living and refined elegance.
Beloved local traditions, such as the weekly Friday Farmers Market and popular Food Truck Nights, bring neighbors together and highlight the town's enduring community spirit.
As part of its centennial celebration, the town has unveiled a special Centennial Lobby in the Town Administration Building, where residents and visitors alike can reflect on the milestones that have shaped Windermere over the past 100 years.
