I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue and being a champion on it.
He  is absolutely right about the appalling inheritance:  one in four children in absolute poverty—that is a terrible inheritance—and too many vulnerable children in unregulated accommodation.
Through our children’s wellbeing Bill, we will put children and their wellbeing at the heart of the education and social care systems.
We will also provide a home for all young care leavers to ensure that they are not homeless, and remove the barriers to opportunity so every child can thrive in safe and loving homes.
