I thank my predecessor John Penrose for his service in this place over 19 years.
I particularly pay tribute to him for his work on the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 and as the anti-corruption champion in the May and Johnson Ministries.
Before him came the late Lord Cotter, who was a visionary for our town, advocating for digital transformation and  regional economic development.
He was also a patron of a homeless and rough sleeping charity in Weston, Somewhere to Go, which he cared for deeply.
I am honoured to continue in his footsteps as a trustee.
I look forward to playing an active role in the Government’s ambitious plans to end homelessness, and to ensuring that technology is a force for good and that digital inclusion becomes a reality for all.
