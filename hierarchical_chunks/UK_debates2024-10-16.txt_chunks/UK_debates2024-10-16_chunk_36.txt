Let me turn to the middle east.
Israeli Finance Minister Smotrich has said that starving 2 million people in Gaza might be “justified and moral”.
National Security Minister Ben-Gvir called settlers who killed a 19-year-old on the west bank “heroes”.
After my visit to Israel and Palestine last February, having witnessed the damaged that those extremist Ministers in the Netanyahu Government are doing, I called on the last UK Government to sanction them.
They refused, but we now learn that the former Foreign Secretary was considering it.
Will the Prime Minister now sanction Ministers Ben-Gvir and Smotrich?
We are looking at that, because those are obviously abhorrent comments, as the right hon.
Gentleman rightly says, along with other really concerning activity in the west bank and across the region.
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire: the death toll has surpassed 42,000 and access to basic  services is becoming much harder.
Israel must take all possible steps to avoid civilian casualties, to allow aid into Gaza in much greater volume, and to provide the UN and humanitarian partners the ability to operate effectively.
Along with France, the UK will convene an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to address that.
It has been an honour to meet my constituent Tom Morton, a young person in care who cares so deeply about politics and communities—he is sat in the Public Gallery today.
Young people in care are at disproportionate risk of criminal and cynical exploitation by drug barons through county lines.
Will the Prime Minister tell Tom and the House what steps the Government will take to prevent vulnerable children in care from becoming involved in county lines operations?
