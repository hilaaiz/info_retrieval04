I welcome the Government’s historic investment in carbon capture and storage technology for Teesside and Merseyside.
This week I have been at the sector’s conference, and the feeling there is that this is a Government who are delivering after years of delay.
Will the Prime Minister recognise the unique potential that Teesside has for jobs, prosperity and economic growth into the future?
