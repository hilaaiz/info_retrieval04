It feels like I will be meeting everyone, but I am very happy to meet the right hon.
Gentleman.
Indeed, I am meeting Orbex later today, because an important point is that we have a specific geographical and skills advantage in the launch sector, which we need to exploit to our best advantage for the whole UK economy.
It is not just about what happens on Shetland; it is about lots of businesses in the supply chain, from mission control to technological support.
Yes, I am very happy to meet him.
What steps he is taking to protect children using the Roblox platform from online predators.
Keeping children safe online is the priority for this Government.
The Online Safety Act 2023 places strict safety duties on online platforms, such as Roblox, to protect children from being groomed by online predators.
Ofcom is the regime’s regulator and, by the end of this year, it will set out steps for the platforms to take to fulfil their duties.
One of my constituents is a volunteer moderator on the Roblox platform.
His group has identified and banned over 14,000 accounts involved in  child grooming, exploitation and sharing indecent images.
Does the Secretary of State agree that while we drive for tech innovation and investment, we must keep online safety at the heart of our strategy?
I extend my deepest sympathies to those who have been affected by the crimes that my hon.
Friend outlines.
The Online Safety Act—and its measures that will soon come into force—is there to address that concern directly.
I want these powers to be used as assertively as possible.
Just today, I have heard about another story concerning Roblox.
I expect that company to do better in protecting service users, particularly children, on its platform.
