Whitby InterActive has provided inclusive play schemes and holiday activities for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities for 26 years.
It has been a lifeline for families continually failed by Conservative Governments, but InterActive is set to close due to a funding shortfall.
Does the Prime Minister agree that action to tackle the crisis in SEND provision is urgently needed and that charities, such as InterActive, deserve our support more than ever?
Yes, I do, and I know this is a concerning time for families who rely on the brilliant work of Whitby InterActive.
Children with special educational needs and disabilities have been failed for too long.
It comes up repeatedly in the House, with parents struggling to get their children the support they need and deserve.
We must raise the standards for every child so that they can succeed in education.
We will fix the foundations and ensure that every child can achieve their potential.
