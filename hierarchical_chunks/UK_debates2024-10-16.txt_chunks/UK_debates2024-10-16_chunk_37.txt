I welcome Tom to the House.
It is encouraging to see young people engaging in democracy.
County lines is a real problem, and all of us will have experienced its effect and impact in our constituencies.
Our county lines programme focuses on preventing young people from being exploited and lured into criminal gangs, which is far too common, and we are committed to introducing a new offence of child criminal exploitation—that is long overdue.
We will also create a network of Young Futures hubs, staffed with professional youth workers, mental health support workers and career advisers, to provide focused support for young people, helping them to fulfil their ambitions and preventing them from being drawn into crime.
