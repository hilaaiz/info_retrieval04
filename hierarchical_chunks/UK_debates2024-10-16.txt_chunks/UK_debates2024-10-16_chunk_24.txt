I thank the hon.
Member for raising that very important issue and for championing the voices of women in his constituency.
We are committed to ensuring that all women and babies receive safe, compassionate and personalised care through pregnancy, birth and the critical following months.
Reconfiguration of the services, as he knows, is a matter for the integrated care boards, which is important, as it allows decisions to be made locally and to be tailored to local interests.
All changes should be based on evidence, be clinically led and involve engagement with patients to ensure that they will deliver better outcomes.
This is a very important matter.
