Diolch, Llefarydd.
My constituent Janette Crawford suffers from ME and chronic pain.
The cold, damp conditions of a Welsh winter are going to mean a lot more muscle soreness and fatigue for her.
She has lost her winter fuel payments due to having a very small savings pot.
With 86% of pensioners in poverty, or just above that line, to miss out in Wales, will the Prime Minister establish a social energy tariff to help people like Janette?
On this issue of winter fuel payments, we have inherited a £22 billion black  hole.

Conservative Members should be apologising, not groaning, for leaving the country in such a state.
We are committed to the triple lock.
The point about pensions is really important, and the triple lock means that the pension will increase again by £460 next year.
That means pensioners under Labour will be better off, because we are going to stabilise the economy after that lot lost control of it.
In Britain, the biggest killer of men under 50 is suicide.
We have some of the worst paternity leave in Europe, and boys are 50% less likely than girls to pursue higher education.
I know that my right hon.
and learned Friend takes this very seriously, and his commitment on reducing suicide rates is very welcome.
Can the Prime Minister update the House on this work, and does he agree with me that it is vital that we tackle these issues head on because of the increasing alienation and mental health issues among young men?
