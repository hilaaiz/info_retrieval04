The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 16 October.
Alex Salmond was a monumental figure in Scottish and UK politics.
He leaves a lasting legacy.
I know that the deepest condolences of the whole House are with Moira, his family and his loved ones.
This week, we also remember our colleague and friend, Sir David Amess, whose kindness and commitment to public service continues to inspire us all.
I know how deeply this is felt by those on the Opposition Benches, and I am so glad that his plaque is here in the House with us.
I also wish to acknowledge the extraordinary life of Holocaust survivor Lily Ebert whose message of hope showed such courage.
May her memory be a blessing.
We also extend our sympathies to the family of General Sir Mike Jackson.
He was an inspirational leader of the British Army and served with distinction.
I know the whole House will join me in wishing the best of luck to the new England manager, Thomas Tuchel.
I will not hold his old job against him, but I wish him well in the new one.
This morning, I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.
In addition to my duties in this House, I shall have further such meetings later today.
In last week’s maternity services debate, we heard of the devastating impact of the removal of consultant-led maternity services from hospitals.
Under the previous Government’s unfunded new hospitals programme, there were proposals to remove consultant-led maternity services from our hospital in Winchester.
Can the Prime Minister reassure me and my constituents that, under the new Government, consultant-led maternity and A&E services will remain in Winchester, and will he commit to funding properly the backlog of maintenance issues that has developed in our hospital?
