The Minister knows that improved connectivity is important to the economy of our south Wales valleys.
However, it has been hard for me to get definitive information on the roll-out of Project Gigabit to Trefil, just north of Tredegar, in my constituency.
Will he please look into   this so that my constituents in Trefil, and across the rest of Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney, know when their broadband service will improve?
I am happy to arrange the same kind of meeting with my hon.
Friend as I offered to  the hon.
Member for Chester South and Eddisbury (Aphra Brandreth) .
He is right that there are very significant problems in south Wales valleys communities, and we need to put those right.
It is a shame that we have not had a digital inclusion strategy for 10 whole years, which is a disgrace.
That is one of the things we need to put right.
What steps he is taking to help support the UK space sector.
We have already debated some of these issues, as the right hon.
Gentleman knows, and he is right to stress that the UK space sector is one of our most important areas of possible economic growth.
We want to maximise our unique potential in this area, and I look forward to working with him and the companies based in his constituency that are seeking to do this.
