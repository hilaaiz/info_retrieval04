What steps his Department is taking to enhance mobile phone reception in the Bridgwater constituency.
The most recent statistics, which are available for the old shape of the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, suggest that 97% of properties there have 4G connection.
However, I am not sure that the statistics reflect the lived experience of most people in his constituency—or, I suspect, any other constituency in the land.
That is not good enough, which is why our ambition is for all populated areas to have stand-alone 5G by 2030.
I am grateful to the Minister for his answer.
Bridgwater has a mixture of urban and rural areas, and many of my constituents in the rural parts complain of almost non-existent signals.
The O2 signal in Burnham-on-Sea is non-existent.
In Pawlett, the Vodafone and EE signals are non-existent.
In Chedzoy, the EE signal is non-existent.
[Interruption.]
Can he confirm that the Government intend to continue funding the shared rural network, so that we can improve coverage for all our constituents?
Well, I note that the mobile signal seems to be working in here, which is unusual for the rest of the country.
We have to get this right, because  people cannot live without a proper mobile signal.
It is essential for people’s lives, their health and their ability to run a business, and we are determined to put things right.
In direct answer to the hon.
Gentleman’s question, yes, we will continue to fund the shared rural network.
In constituencies such as Bridgwater and Carlisle, poor mobile coverage forces people to rely on their fixed-line services.
Does the Minister share my concern that the switch-off of the public switched telephone network will leave constituents unable to access 999 services in the event of an emergency?
