During the election campaign, the now Prime Minister made a hell of a lot of promises, some of which I am sure he will remember.
Of particular importance to my constituents in Andover and North West Hampshire was a promise made on 18 June during a campaign  visit to Basingstoke, when he made an unequivocal, unconditional commitment to rebuild our local hospital.
Is that a promise on which we can rely?
I am grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that; it is obviously of huge importance to his constituents and he is right to do so.
As he knows, we are reviewing the programme.
The programme that the last Government put in place for 40 new hospitals had a number of flaws: they were not all hospitals, they were not new, and they were not funded, so we are reviewing it.
He is right to raise this matter, and I will ensure that he has a meeting with the relevant Minister to discuss the development in his constituency.
It will matter to his constituents who are listening to this, and it is important that they know where the failure lay.
