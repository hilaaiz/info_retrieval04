I thank the hon.
Member for raising what is obviously a very important case, and she is right to do so.
I am not across the individual details of it, but it obviously does need to be looked into.
So we will commit to look into it, and I will make sure that she gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to lay out such details as she has and to get some answers as to our inquiries.
