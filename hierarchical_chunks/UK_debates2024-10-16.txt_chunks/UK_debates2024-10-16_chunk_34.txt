I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising that really important issue, which is affecting a number of people.
We have launched an independent review into the carer’s allowance overpayments, to look at the circumstances of the overpayments and see what went wrong and what can be done to put it right, because carers must get the support that they deserve.
I am grateful to him for raising it and I am glad that we have been able to take this action today to go forward on that really important issue.
