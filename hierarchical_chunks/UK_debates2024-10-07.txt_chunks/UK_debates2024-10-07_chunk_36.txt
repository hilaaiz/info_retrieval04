The Minister has referred to the army of carers that we have across the country, but we also have an army of unpaid carers who are being deterred from applying for carer’s allowance because of concerns about the financial implications.

What assessment she has made of trends in the number of benefit sanctions in the last five years.
In May 2019 the universal credit sanction rate was 3.17%.
It reduced considerably during the pandemic, gradually returning to 3.51% by November 2021.

According to recent research by Gingerbread, a high percentage of sanctions have been misapplied to single parents, not because they have not met the job search requirements but because of missed meetings for reasons connected with childcare.
Max, a bereaved single dad of two, had his sanction overturned, which involved a fairly challenging process.
