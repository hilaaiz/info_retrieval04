I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in condemning that horrific attack one year ago.
Yesterday at church during bidding prayers we prayed about the conflicts in the middle east and elsewhere.
My thoughts remain with those loved ones who are still displaced a year on.
Sadly, the United Nations has reported credible evidence of sexual violence against innocent civilians on both sides of the conflict.
No matter the intensity of the situation, there can be no justification for sexual violence, which leaves victims traumatised for many years.
What steps are the Government taking to raise that issue and ensure that innocent civilians across the middle east are protected from the horrors of sexual violence?
My hon.
Friend raises an important point about sexual violence, which, as she rightly says, has absolutely no justification.
Along with other issues, we continue to raise any such allegations with our allies.
