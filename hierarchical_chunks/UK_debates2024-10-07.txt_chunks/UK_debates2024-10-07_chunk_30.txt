I thank the Minister for that response.
My constituent Connor is in a predicament: he is out of pocket for taxi fares to weekly or even twice weekly sessions with a Jobcentre Plus private contractor.
Connor told me that the sessions last barely 15 minutes and are not helping him to reach his goal of becoming a mechanical engineering apprentice.
Will the Minister review the value of Jobcentre Plus private contracts to both jobseekers and taxpayers?
