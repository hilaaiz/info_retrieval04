I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
I met representatives of the WASPI campaign before this Government were elected.
My hon.
Friend the Minister for Pensions was the first Minister to meet them in eight years.
It really is a serious report that requires serious consideration.
We will do everything possible to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.
