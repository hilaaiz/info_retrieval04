Jobcentres are extremely good, as we just heard from  the hon.
Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Dame Meg Hillier) , who is leaving the Chamber.
Yet the new Minister for Employment previously described jobcentres as places nobody wants to go, and claimed that they do not offer real help.
Our jobcentres help to ensure that almost 4 million more people have work, compared with when her party left office in 2010.
More than 2 million of those employed are women.
Will the Minister and the DWP team who have made disparaging remarks apologise to work coaches and DWP staff, who she and they have rubbished but who now have to look up to them as the new ministerial team?
I fear that the hon.
Lady has misunderstood the criticism, which is levied not at our outstanding work coaches but at the policies of the previous Government, who have left us with economic inactivity at its highest rate in years.
We are the only G7 economy with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic.
Those are the challenges that we have been left with, and the problems that we will solve.
What guidance her Department has issued to private contractors working in partnership with Jobcentre Plus on reimbursing claimants’ travel costs.
Provider guidance, which is published on gov.uk, makes clear that contractors on all our employment programmes must reimburse customers’ reasonable travel costs.
