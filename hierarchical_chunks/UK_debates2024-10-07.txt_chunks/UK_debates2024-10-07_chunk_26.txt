What recent assessment her Department has made of the effectiveness of Jobcentre Plus in helping people get back into work.
To be frank, the current system is focused on the problems of yesterday.
In the last Parliament, economic inactivity increased and the employment rate fell.
We are planning fundamental reforms to the system that will focus on the problems of today and get more people into work, details of which will be set out in our forthcoming White Paper, “Get Britain Working”.
Will the Minister set out how the proposed merger between Jobcentre Plus and the National Careers Service will help to tackle economic inactivity and change the way that jobcentres work with their customers?
