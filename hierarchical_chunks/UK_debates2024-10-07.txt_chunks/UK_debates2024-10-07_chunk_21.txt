I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for that answer.
The disability action plan mid-year update is now somewhat overdue.
Can the Minister confirm to the House when there will be a much-needed update?
In helping vulnerable people to thrive in all walks of life, whether in employment or in respect of equality of opportunity, will the Minister’s Government commit, like the previous Conservative Government did, to working towards hosting the 2031 Special Olympics?
