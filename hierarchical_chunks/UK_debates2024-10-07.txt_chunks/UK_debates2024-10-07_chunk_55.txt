I thank my right hon.
Friend for that question, particularly her words about all civilian life being equal and protected.
I confirm that everything that we are doing is aimed at de-escalating across the region.
It is on the brink, and it is important for all sides to pull back from the brink.
That is why we have been working so closely with our allies in the G7 on de-escalation, speaking with one voice.
