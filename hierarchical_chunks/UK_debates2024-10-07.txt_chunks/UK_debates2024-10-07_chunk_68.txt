Today, as we remember all those killed in the  7 October  Hamas attack and all those killed day after day in Israel’s war on Gaza and now Lebanon, the case for peace, the preservation of human life and the protection of human  life has never been more urgent and compelling.
An immediate ceasefire is desperately needed to stop all the killing, end the war crimes, free the hostages and get aid into Gaza.
However, it is clear that Israel’s right-wing political leaders will keep rejecting ceasefires and keep violating international law without stronger international pressure.
To get Israeli leaders to back a ceasefire, do we not need to see tougher action, including an end to all arms sales, as recent international court rulings demand?
I completely agree that we need an immediate ceasefire.
That is what we are working for and what the US is leading on.
I do not agree with a complete ban on arms sales.
That would include a ban on arms being used for defensive purposes.
Looking at the attack of only a few days ago by Iran, I think the House will understand my position on this and the position of many across the House.
