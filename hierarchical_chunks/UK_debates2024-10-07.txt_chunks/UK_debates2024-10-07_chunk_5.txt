I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and I welcome her to her position as Chair of the Select Committee.
Alongside our work to increase pension credit uptake, the household support fund is available for those just above the pension credit level.
My own  council has done a lot of work to make sure that pensioners just above that level can get extra help with the costs of heating or energy debt.
There is also the warm home discount, which is available not just to those on pension credit, but again to those just above that level if they are on low incomes and have high housing costs.
