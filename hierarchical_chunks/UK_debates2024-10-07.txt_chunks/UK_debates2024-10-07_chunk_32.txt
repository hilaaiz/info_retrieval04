I thank the Minister very much for his response.
I think everyone wishes for claimants to be able to get job opportunities without finding themselves in a financial mess due to having to pay out for travel costs when they should be reimbursed.
This is a big issue in my constituency in Northern Ireland.
Will the Minister help directly those constituents who have been accordingly disadvantaged?
