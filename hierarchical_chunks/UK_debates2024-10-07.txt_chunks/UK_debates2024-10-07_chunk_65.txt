I thank the hon.
Lady for her question—as ever, she speaks powerfully on this issue.
I completely agree that the only way through in the long term is the two-state solution.
To answer her question directly, we are working non-stop with our allies on that question, answering “What happens next?” and never losing sight of the fact that the two-state solution is the only way to long-lasting peace.
We will continue in those efforts, which I know have the support of the House.
It is so important that we continue to do so, and we will.
