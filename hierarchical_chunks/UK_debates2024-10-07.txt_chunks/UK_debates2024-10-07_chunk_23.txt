I thank the hon.
Member for bringing that point to the House; it is a major focus of the work that is currently going into the White Paper.
We have had very worrying developments for young people since the pandemic, and we need to do much better to give them the best possible start in life.
I will say it again: on this issue we welcome input from Members on all sides of the House.
