The Government’s impersonal approach is cold comfort to thousands of disabled pensioners, including Ann in my constituency.
She has to boil water to prevent infection and uses an electric nebuliser, and as a result she has high energy usage to protect her health.
Can the Minister tell Ann what sacrifices she should make to protect her health this winter?
This is a decision that we neither wanted nor expected to make, but when we came into office there was a £22 billion black hole in the public finances.
There are mitigations in place.
We have extended the household support fund and the hon.
Gentleman’s council will receive an extra £3.9 million.
We are increasing the state pension.
Through the triple lock, the state pension will increase by £1,700 in this Parliament.
We will also deliver the warm home discount scheme, and I hope he will join me in making sure that every pensioner who is eligible for pension credit receives it, which will passport them to the winter fuel payment.
We know that 2 million older people currently live in poverty in this country, with millions more with incomes just above the poverty level.
Does the Minister agree that the Government should set up a pensioner taskforce to look at how pensioner poverty can be tackled once and for all?
