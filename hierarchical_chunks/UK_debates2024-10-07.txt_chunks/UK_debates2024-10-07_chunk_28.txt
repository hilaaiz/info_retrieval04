The challenge that jobcentres in Kendal and the rest of Cumbria face, as well as getting people back into work, is the fact that our workforce in Westmorland is far too small.
The average house price in our constituency is 12 times average earnings, and waiting lists for social housing are through the roof.
Some 66% of all employers surveyed in our community recently said that they were working below capacity because they could not find enough staff, so if we want to tackle the problem in our economy, we need to do two things: first, increase the amount of social housing and secondly, allow more flexible visa arrangements.
Would the Minister’s Department work with housing colleagues to provide more housing grants for our community and sign up to the youth mobility visa arrangements?
Order.
The hon.
Member should know better.
He gets in a lot, so he should not take advantage of other Members.
The hon.
Member will be pleased to know that we intend to work considerably more flexibly to support the needs of communities in a varied and bespoke way.
He has particular challenges because of the rural nature of his constituency and various other factors, but he will appreciate that I will not make housing or Home Office policy on the hoof from the Dispatch Box.
