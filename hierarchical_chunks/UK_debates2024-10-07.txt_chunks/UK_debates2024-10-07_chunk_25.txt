I thank my hon.
Friend again for her very welcome point.
Housing associations are extremely important for connecting with residents, who often have multiple vulnerabilities.
When thinking about the journey into work we need joined up services between the NHS, the local authority and our housing associations.
They will be a part of the future partnership, and I look forward to working with her for her constituency.
