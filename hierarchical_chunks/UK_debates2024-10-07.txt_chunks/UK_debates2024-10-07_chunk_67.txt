I thank the right hon.
Member for his question.
As he will understand, I will not go into details on the Floor of the House as to our capabilities, but he will know that the involvement so far—for example, in relation to the attack in April—related to Israel’s self-defence, when missiles were raining in on Israel.
That is the support that we did provide and would always be prepared to provide.
