I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his question.
He will know that this was not a decision that we wanted or expected to make.
The reason we have taken it is that we have to deal with the £22 billion black hole in the public finances left by Conservative Members.
But in doing so, we will as a progressive party always prioritise the very poorest pensioners.
That is why we are so determined to end a situation where up to 880,000 people miss out on the winter fuel allowance because they are not getting pension credit.
We are determined to put that right.
