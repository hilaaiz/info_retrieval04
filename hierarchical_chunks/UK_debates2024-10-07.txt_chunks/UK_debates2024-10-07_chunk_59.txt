I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for those questions.
I absolutely agree with him in relation to the hostage families.
When I sat with them, we often sat in silence because they could not find the  words to describe what they were going through.
I also agree with what he said about hate crimes.
The message and the messaging is very much de-escalation across the region.
He is right that we need to deal with state threats, including the IRGC.
We are working at pace to identify further ways to deal with such threats, including those from the IRGC.
More than 400 sanctions designations against Iranian organisations and individuals are already in place, and we continue to look at that important issue.
