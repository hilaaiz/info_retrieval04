Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the work of Patty Kim as she begins the next exciting chapter of her life.
From the 105th Congress to the 118th Congress, Patty Kim has proven herself to be a dedicated public servant and leader by working tirelessly to serve the people of the 14th, 18th, and 16th Congressional District through five administrations.
Like so many women, Patty has juggled family commitments with work obligations to make this world a better place for the next generation.
The American dream that Patty's parents envisioned for their daughters has been realized and exceeded through her extraordinary life of service.
How proud and grateful I am to have had her by my side.
