Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to honor and thank Karen Chapman for her extraordinary dedication and exemplary service on behalf of the people I've represented for over three decades.
I'm unendingly grateful to her for her sterling leadership, her 32 years of devoted service, and for the gift of her friendship.
