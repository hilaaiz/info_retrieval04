Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor the life of Penny Etson Rinehart of Olney, who passed away earlier this year.
Born in Utica, New York, in 1953, Penny later attended the University of Illinois, where she double-majored in psychology and social work.
After graduating, she dedicated her career to helping others, first as a probation officer and then as a drug and alcohol counselor.
While in college, Penny met Eric Reinhart, whom she married in Olney, Illinois, in 1977.
Their marriage was a testament to love and partnership, filled with cherished adventures, including memorable beach trips to Florida.
Above all, Penny was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and friend to all who knew her.
She and Eric raised two sons, Jonathan and William, and were blessed with two granddaughters, Claudette and Camille.
During this difficult time, I hold Penny's family in my thoughts and prayers.
Penny's love, humor, and kindness touched the lives of many.
Her impact will be deeply felt by those who knew her and by the Springfield community she called home.
Penny will be greatly missed, but her legacy
