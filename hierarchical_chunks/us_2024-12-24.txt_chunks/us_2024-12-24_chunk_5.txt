Ms. LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Renel Brooks-Moon as she receives the Key to the City of San Francisco from Mayor London Breed.
This prestigious recognition is a testament to Renel's extraordinary contributions to our community and her trailblazing career in broadcasting and sports.
Born in Oakland to her beloved educator parents Nathaniel and Juanita Brooks, who inspired her path to achievement and amazing journey and success story, becoming one of the most beloved women luminaries in the Bay Area.
A Woodside High School and Mills College graduate, she began her broadcasting career at KCBS and KFRC before breaking through at 106 KMEL in 1986.
Later, she woke up the San Francisco Bay Area with her iconic ``Renel In The Morning'' show on 98.1 KISS-FM.
She became the San Francisco Giants' public address announcer in 2000 and excelled in the position for 24 years.
As one of the first Black women in this role, Renel broke barriers and made history in Major League Baseball.
She was the first woman to announce a world championship game in any professional sport and the first to announce MLB's All-Star Game.
Renel Brooks-Moon has had a profound impact on our community, not only entertaining and informing us but also being a role model for aspiring broadcasters, particularly women and people of color.
Renel's impact extends beyond broadcasting.
She has volunteered in community service and received honorary doctorates from Mills College and the University of San Francisco, recognizing her contributions to education and society.
Her journey from a young Giants fan to the team's iconic voice that Bay Area fans have loved for more than two decades exemplifies the power of perseverance and believing in your dreams.
