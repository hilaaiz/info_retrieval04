Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Sharon Daughterty, founded Victory Christian Center in 1981 alongside her husband.
After his passing, Sharon served as the lead pastor for five years.
Over time, Victory thrived and developed into a large church community with a K-12 school, Bible School, camp, and a community center.
This church has also planted over 2,000 Bible Colleges in 102 countries and has played a supportive role in missions across the globe.
