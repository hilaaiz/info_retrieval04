Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Dr. Larinda King, is an entrepreneur and inspiration to many.
Dr. King has been an Elite Executive Senior Sales Director with Mary Kay since 2019, with her team ranking #1 in 2021.
Dr. King has founded several community organizations, including a church, and is also Executive Director of Remnant Kingship Academy.
In addition to these roles, she is also an expert broadcaster in television and radio.
