Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, did you know that September is national Brain Aneurysm Awareness month?
The Trinity Love Hoblit Foundation certainly does.
The Foundation is a nonprofit, headquartered in Florida and named after Trinity, who at age 9 was diagnosed with multiple brain aneurysms.
In 2015, Trinity was scheduled for open brain surgery but passed away 2 days prior because her aneurysm ruptured.
About 1 in 50 Americans have an unruptured brain aneurysm.
Brain aneurysms are more common and harmful than people know.
