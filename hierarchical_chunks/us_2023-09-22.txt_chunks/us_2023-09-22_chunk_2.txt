Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Courtney Dauwalter, a remarkable ultrarunner and Leadville resident who continues to redefine the boundaries of endurance in the world of ultra-distance racing.
In July 2023, 
Ms. Dauwalter achieved the remarkable feat of being the first female finisher at the grueling Hardrock 100-mile foot race, only a few weeks after she emerged victorious at the Western States 100 in California.
She also won the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, a race renowned for its extreme difficulty and terrain.
With this victory, she made history, becoming the first person ever to win all 3 of these races in a single year and the second person ever to achieve this incredible trifecta in their lifetime.
