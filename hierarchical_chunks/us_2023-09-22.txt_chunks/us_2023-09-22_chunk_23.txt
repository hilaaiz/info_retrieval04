Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Jaci Velasquez, is a Grammy nominated and platinum-selling Christian artist who has recorded albums in English and Spanish.
Since her debut at 16, she has had 16 No. 1 hits, authored three books, acted in seven movies, and has appeared on 50 magazine covers.
Jaci has also received 7 Dove Awards, a Premio Lo Nuestro Award, 3 Grammy nominations, 2 Latin Grammy nominations, and an American Music Award nomination.
