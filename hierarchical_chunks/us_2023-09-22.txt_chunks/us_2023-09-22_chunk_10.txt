Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trevonni Rossi from Canon City for his acceptance into the Juilliard Summer Dance Intensive, an exclusive and highly competitive program.
Even at his young age, 
Mr. Rossi has an extensive dance career that extends far beyond his years.
He was named 
Mr. Dance America at a prestigious regional dance competition for two consecutive years, earned the World Dance Championship Finalist award in 2019, and ranked fourth in the world at the Soloist World Dance Pageant in 2022.
