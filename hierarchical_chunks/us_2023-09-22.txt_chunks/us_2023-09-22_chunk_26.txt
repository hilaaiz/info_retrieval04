Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both a sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Joni Eareckson Tada, is a hero to many.
In 1967, Joni was left paralyzed by a diving accident but quickly emerged from rehabilitation, determined to help others who have similar disabilities.
Her autobiography, Joni, has been adapted into a film and was also translated into 15 different languages.
Today, she serves as the CEO of Joni and Friends, which serves to assist those who are disabled and in need of assistance.
Through this organization, Joni has delivered over 220,000 wheelchairs in developing nations and has hosted over 64,000 families at Family Retreats and Getaways.
Joni also had the unique opportunity to serve her country on the National Council on Disability during the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
