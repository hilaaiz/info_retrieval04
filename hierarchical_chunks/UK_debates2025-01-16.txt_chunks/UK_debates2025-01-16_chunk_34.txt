We have a housing crisis across the UK, and I am pleased that the Government have announced a plan to build 1.5 million more homes.
Does the Leader of the House agree that councils have an important part to play in fixing this crisis by updating their local plans and delivering the homes that are so desperately needed, including social housing and affordable homes?
Without these plans, our green-belt spaces are at risk, such as Whyburn Farm in my constituency, which Ashfield Independents on the district council are failing to protect by having no plan.
Does she agree that it is vital that councils use their local plans to meet the needs of communities, while also protecting our green-belt spaces?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right: this country faces a housing crisis.
That is why this Government have an incredibly ambitious target to build 1.5 million homes over the course of this Parliament, and we are changing the national planning policy framework to ensure that local councils have ambitious targets for their own local areas in order to meet that target.
In the 2024 new year’s honours list, Stuart Hogg was awarded an MBE.
Since then he has been charged, convicted and sentenced for domestic abuse.
Does the Leader of the House and Lord President of the Council agree that he should be stripped of that state honour?
