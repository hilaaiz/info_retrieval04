I thank the hon.
Member for the question.
As he will have heard throughout this Question Time, we are keen to ensure that the listed places of worship grant scheme continues, because we can see not only the immense benefits it brings to our communities, but how it helps to alleviate some of the challenges of raising funds.
It is important that all our heritage buildings, including our churches, are preserved and that adequate funding is available for them.
I would be very happy, if the hon.
Member wishes, to meet him to discuss this further.
