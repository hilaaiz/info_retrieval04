I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
I know that St Ives church is a cornerstone of that community, and I congratulate the congregation on the funding they have raised to stabilise some of the church’s structures.
Grants from the buildings for mission fund are available from the diocese and may help with some of the future work.
However, we all know the importance of the listed places of worship scheme, and I will continue to raise it with the Secretary of State.
I hope that the Government are listening and will come forward, as the scheme is due to end in March, and we certainly do not want that to happen.
