I am pleased that my hon.
Friend was able to meet the Under-Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Nottingham North and Kimberley (Alex Norris) , on Monday to discuss this issue, which falls under his remit.
As a local MP, I know from my constituency the important role that community spaces play in supporting local groups; they bring a huge benefit locally.
The Government encourage community  groups seeking funding to use the tools available on the My Community website, which suggests funding sources.
I hope this information will help the council to work out its next steps, alongside the feedback that it should have received on its unsuccessful application to the community ownership fund.
Community spaces are crucial hubs for so many people, and our churches play a key role in providing such spaces.
All Saints parish church in Hertford in my constituency has been in its beautiful riverside location for almost 1,000 years.
Over the past six years, it has been able to reclaim £50,000 of VAT using the listed places of worship grant scheme, including for repairs to the tower, refurbishment of the bells and rebuilding the church organ.
Will the Government extend the scheme beyond 2025, and if so, what will the allocation be?
This issue falls within the remit of the Minister for Creative Industries, Arts and Tourism.
He will answer a question on this later, but the Government are working on it.
What plans her Department has for the regulation of short-term lets.
We aim to get up a statutory registration system for short-term lets very soon, not least because we want to make sure that local authorities have all the data that they need to assess local accommodation needs, and so that there is a level playing field for different kinds of accommodation.
