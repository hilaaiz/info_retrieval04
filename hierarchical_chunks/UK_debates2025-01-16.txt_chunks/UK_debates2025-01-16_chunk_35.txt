I thank the hon.
Member for raising this important matter, which I know is of great concern to him and to many other Members across the House.
Let us be clear that domestic abuse is abhorrent, we condemn it, and it should not be, or be seen to be, rewarded by any of us.
It is completely understandable and appropriate that he and others raise questions about whether this honour should continue.
He will know that I cannot comment on individual honours.
However, recommendations to remove honours are considered by the Forfeiture Committee, which he might want to raise this with.
