I thank the Secretary of State for her answers.
When she cancelled the national citizenship service and announced a consultation on the national youth strategy from the Dispatch Box, she started to lay out how she intended to fund the strategy.
That was over two months ago.
Since then, the cost of borrowing has reached its highest point since 1997, and it is quite clear that significant spending cuts are on the way.
Can she tell the House in further detail what plans she has for revenue and capital spending under the national youth strategy?
Can she guarantee that the Chancellor, in a desperate attempt to save her job, will not balance the books by putting the burden on the backs of our young people?
