I thank the Leader of the House for allowing protected time for this afternoon’s Backbench Business debate, and also for allowing time next week for the annual Holocaust Memorial Day debate.
In addition to the business that she announced for Monday, there will be two Select Committee statements on behalf of the Treasury Committee and another on behalf of the Defence Committee.
Those Committee statements are important, so I trust that the Government will try not to schedule too many Government statements that would squeeze the time available.
We always like to satisfy colleagues, and on  Thursday 30 January  there will be a debate on proportional representation for general elections.
