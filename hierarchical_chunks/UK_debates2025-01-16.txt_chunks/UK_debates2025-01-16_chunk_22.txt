I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
When I met representatives from the Jewish community recently about antisemitism in the arts, I was shocked and horrified by some of their experiences, and we are working closely with them to tackle it.
I can confirm to my hon.
Friend that I have raised this issue directly with the BBC director general.
I am aware that the BBC gets criticism from all sides about its reporting and has a difficult balance to strike, but we are determined to work with the BBC and support it to get that right.
