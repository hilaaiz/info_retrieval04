I thank the Minister for her reply.
Swanscombe pavilion in my constituency is at the heart of the Swanscombe community.
It hosted dedicated lunch clubs for older people, provided a hub for local sports teams, and was a venue that local people could hire for parties.
The building has fallen into disrepair, and the town council is searching desperately for the funds to rebuild or refurbish it, having been unable to obtain funding from the youth investment fund or the community ownership fund.
What guidance could the Minister offer on bringing this crucial building back into community use?
