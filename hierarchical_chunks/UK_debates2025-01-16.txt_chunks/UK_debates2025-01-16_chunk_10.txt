I thank the Minister for her response.
We all know that 2.5% of the population are considered to be problem gamblers, and 44% of that population is at high risk of suicidal behaviour, according to the  excellent charity Gambling with Lives.
Of course, the loss of any life to gambling addiction is deeply saddening, and I give my condolences to all the affected families.
The impact of problem gambling stretches far and wide across the UK, including in my constituency of Monmouthshire, and it should be considered a public health issue.
What cross-departmental work is being done to tackle the concerning issue of suicide due to gambling?
