The previous Conservative Government invested over £400 million to support grassroots sport, recognising the vital contribution of sport to our communities across the country.
The Minister will already be aware of our concerns about the impact of Labour’s national insurance hike, and the impact that the schools tax will have on community access to sporting facilities.
Equally concerning is Labour’s decision to quietly cut the £57 million opening school facilities programme from March.
Does she understand why grassroots sport organisations are so concerned about access to school facilities, and schools potentially having to close them to the community?
Has she raised those concerns with Cabinet colleagues, and what measures are her Department taking to support access to grassroots sport for the more than 200,000 people who previously benefited from Conservative programmes?
I think that was six questions rather than one.
I will take no lectures from the hon.
Gentleman on the state of the economy and the inheritance that we received.
The Government are a huge champion of grassroots sport, and will continue to be one.
