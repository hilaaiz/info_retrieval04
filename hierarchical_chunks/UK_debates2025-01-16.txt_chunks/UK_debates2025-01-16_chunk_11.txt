I thank my hon.
Friend for raising such an important question.
Of course, any life lost is an absolute tragedy.
When I was the shadow gambling Minister, I visited the Gordon Moody residential treatment centre, which supports people with gambling-related harm.
On that visit and at other meetings, I heard at first hand about the devastating impact that gambling can have.
We are committed to working across Government on this issue, particularly with the Department of Health and Social Care, including by establishing a comprehensive support and treatment system, funded by the statutory levy, and by strengthening messages in order to raise awareness of the risks of harmful gambling.
