Over the past two years alone, Newport cathedral has reclaimed over £87,000 under the listed places of worship scheme.
When it soon becomes necessary to repair the tower, at an estimated cost of £1.1 million,  a further £220,000 in tax will be added to that bill, and if that cannot be reclaimed the project will be delayed even further.
The cathedral provides crucial support to schools, charities, refugees and the homeless.
Does my hon.
Friend recognise the importance of the scheme not only in saving significant heritage treasures, but in preserving those vital services?
I absolutely recognise the importance of the scheme and the difference that the cathedral’s social impact projects are making in her community.
I would be very happy to put my hon.
Friend in touch with the director of property strategy for the Church in Wales, so that they can discuss this issue and, I hope, lobby together to ensure—to say it once again—that the scheme is renewed.
The withdrawal of the listed places of worship scheme disproportionately affects rural churches.
In my constituency of Farnham and Bordon, six listed churches saved nearly £43,000 in the past financial year through the scheme.
Directors of St Andrew’s in Farnham and of St Bartholomew’s and St Christopher’s in Haslemere have raised concerns with me this week about the oversubscribed nature of other grant opportunities, such as the National Lottery Heritage Fund, which combines heritage restoration under the same scheme as, for example, coastal protection in the Humber estuary.
This dilutes the vital church funds needed for their heritage.
Can the hon.
Lady inform me how churches can be supported to preserve heritage in my constituency if the VAT relief for repairs is not reinstated?
