I thank the Minister for her response.
Last year, in my constituency, the Stevenage Football Club Foundation delivered more than 9,000 hours of activity in grassroots sports and engaged over 15,000 participants, generating nearly £10.7 million-worth of social value.
This did not happen only in my constituency.
Last year, the 72 English Football League community club organisations delivered more than £1.2 billion-worth of social value across this country.
Will the Minister commit to supporting local community club organisations, such as the Stevenage FC Foundation, in engaging local people and directly supporting communities?
