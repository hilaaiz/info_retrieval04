I thank the Minister for his statement.
I too am disgusted and appalled by Epstein’s actions, and my thoughts are with the victims of his crimes.
Will the Minister confirm that we have an excellent deputy ambassador in Washington, who will ensure that our mission continues and that next week’s visit will go ahead?
