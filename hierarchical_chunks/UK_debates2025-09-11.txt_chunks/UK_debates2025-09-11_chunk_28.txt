Obviously this is a very sad day for the United States, with 9/11 and the assassination last night.
Our relationship with the United States is crucial, and there is a dark cloud over the upcoming state visit, so will the Minister forgive me if I give him some gentle advice?
In my experience of such scandals, the cover-up, the lack of due process and allegations of cronyism are much more serious than any original offence, or alleged offence.
Will he ensure that every single document about the process is released post haste, including about the meeting that Mandelson requested with Prime Minister Blair over Epstein?
We need everything released straightaway, and we need to move on and get a new ambassador.
The right hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right about the importance of our relationship with the United States.
The upcoming state visit is very important, and we have an extensive team working on it.
His Majesty the King is obviously very much looking forward to welcoming President Trump, and many, many officials are working diligently day and night to ensure the visit is a success.
I will not get into the individual issues and claims that the right hon.
Gentleman makes, but what I will say is that this is a decisive action.
In the light of the additional information in emails written by Lord Mandelson, the Prime Minister has asked the Foreign Secretary to withdraw him as ambassador.
I would also like to offer my support to my hon.
Friend  the Member for Washington and Gateshead South (Mrs Hodgson) .
That incident follows a number of others that she has experienced this week.
It is out of order.
