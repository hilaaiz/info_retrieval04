I welcome the Department’s recognition of the positive impact that the Penistone line rail upgrade will have, boosting economic growth, improving connectivity and supporting ambitions for half-hourly services between Huddersfield and Sheffield.
This is a clear example of what can be achieved when Labour leads at every level—council, mayor and MP.
What further support can the Secretary of State’s Department offer when it comes to securing the next phase of this vital project to ensure a frequent and reliable service across the entirety of the Penistone line?
