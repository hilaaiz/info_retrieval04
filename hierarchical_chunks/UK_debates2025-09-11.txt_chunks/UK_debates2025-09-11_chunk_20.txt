I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Middlesbrough and Thornaby East (Andy McDonald)  for his comments on the decision.
As I said, the decision has been taken by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, and Lord Mandelson has resigned.
My hon.
Friend asked about the process.
Any candidates for ambassador positions are subject to routine, extensive vetting and background checks as a matter of course; I point him to the formal processes outlined in the diplomatic service code, which highlights the robust security clearance and vetting process that all members of the diplomatic service undergo.
