Before I ask my question, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the fact that last night, a man lost his life, a wife lost her husband, and children lost their father because of political intolerance.
It was a personal tragedy, but also a tragedy for the body politic.
I want to take a moment to recognise the importance of free speech in our democracies.
