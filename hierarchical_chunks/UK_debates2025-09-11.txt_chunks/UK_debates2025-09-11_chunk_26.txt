We have an excellent team overall in British embassy Washington.
Indeed, I pay tribute to the work of all our diplomatic service colleagues across the world, who do an excellent job in representing this country and ensure that our security and prosperity is at the forefront of their work.
Of course, our special relationship and unique security partnership with the United Staes is crucially important.
I will be at the United States embassy later today.
It is our closest and most important relationship.
I agree with my hon.
Friend that there is an excellent team in British embassy Washington.
