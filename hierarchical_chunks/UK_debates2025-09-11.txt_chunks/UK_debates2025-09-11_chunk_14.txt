I have a meeting soon to discuss the matter with my hon.
Friend’s constituency neighbour, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Dr Tidball) .
I would be happy for him to join that meeting.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help support people to use electric vehicles.
The Government are committed to making Britain a clean energy superpower, which is why we are investing £4.5 billion to support the transition to electric vehicles.
That includes £1.4 billion to support the continued uptake of EVs through targeted grants, with 35 models now eligible for discounts of up to £3,750 through our electric car grant.
To make charging up an electric car as easy as filling up at the petrol station, we are also supporting the roll-out of 100,000 more public charging points, building on the 84,000 already available.
