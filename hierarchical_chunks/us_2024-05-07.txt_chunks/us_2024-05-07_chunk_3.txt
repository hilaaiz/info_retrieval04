Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor and celebrate Dell Technologies' 40 years of remarkable service.
Founded on May 3, 1984, by Michael Dell in a dorm room at the University of Texas, the company has made a monumental and lasting impression toward making Central Texas a great place to call home.
The impacts Dell Technologies has made not only on the region by also the state are impeccable and I am honored Dell Technologies calls Round Rock home.
Throughout their years of service, Dell Technologies has become a global leader in innovation and a critical economic engine for Central Texas.
During their many years they have remained devoted to their mission of making technologies that drive human progress.
While having their headquarters in Central Texas, Dell Technologies has been able to provide high paying jobs, make economic opportunities, and support our district's growth.
Dell Technologies has made enormous contributions to the technology revolution that has defined our changing times, bringing growth and prosperity to Central Texas.
Dell Technologies has touched countless lives for the better and continues to make a positive impact on those it is dedicated to serve.
I am proud to help celebrate 40 years of this incredible organization, and to join Central Texas in wishing this amazing company nothing but the best in the decades to come.
