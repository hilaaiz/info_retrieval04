Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, while I strongly oppose a nuclear Iran, I will vote against this Resolution because it states that U.S. policy is ``to use all means necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.''
That language allows for an open-ended war authorization, using all means necessary, which I deem inappropriate.
I believe that America's military commitments must be tied to clearly defined strategies, and vague war authorizations have, unfortunately, been used as justifications for unwarranted military actions in recent history.
I will vote against this Resolution, the majority of which I agree with, because I do not want to see foreign policy mistakes mirrored.
