Mr. FERGUSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the career opportunities and economic contributions international automakers operating in my home state of Georgia have made to the state and local community.
Auto workers from KIA and Hyundai that build vehicles in Georgia have come to Washington, D.C., advocating for policies that enable their employers to continue investing in their communities and American operations.
These hard-working men and women are sharing their stories with us--how their jobs are more important than ever as our Nation rises to meet the challenges of a 21st century economy--and how American workers employed by international automakers are driving growth and innovation.
But that leadership takes investment in American workers.
Last year's economic impact report from Autos Drive America found that, nationwide, international automakers employ more than 156,000 Americans, with twothirds of those jobs in manufacturing.
In Georgia, these companies employ more than 6,000 Georgians across 30 facilities, in jobs like production, engineering, technical training, and many other career areas.
In fact, 45 percent of all cars and trucks made in the United States today are built by international automakers, who have increased their U.S. production by more than 85 percent in the last 25 years alone.
