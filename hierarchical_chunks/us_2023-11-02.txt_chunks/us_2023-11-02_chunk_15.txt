Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend TLC for Kids Sports, upon celebrating its 15th anniversary serving the Bay Area community.
This outstanding achievement is a testament to the critical work that TLC for Kids Sports has accomplished to give every child the opportunity to safely participate in youth sports.
Originally founded in 2009, TLC for Kids Sports is improving local communities and youth sports by transforming youth sports facilities in underserved neighborhoods.
Its work across the Bay Area--including in Antioch, Martinez, and Richmond--helps ensure that every child, no matter where they live, can enjoy the countless benefits of team sports.
TLC for Kids Sports is active in community outreach and frequently collaborates with local businesses and neighborhood volunteers, uniting participants in working toward the common goal of building a better future for our youth.
Since its founding, over 5,000 volunteers have worked with TLC for Kids Sports to support communities in need and create safe environments where children can thrive.
The fields built and restored by TLC for Kids Sports are places where our youth can learn sportsmanship, hard work, and confidence, empowering them with the knowledge and skills to build their future.
TLC for Kids Sports plays a vital role in improving our communities, supporting our children, and giving youth the resources and space to grow.
On behalf of the constituents of California's Eighth Congressional District, I would like to congratulate TLC for Kids Sports upon its 15th anniversary and extend my sincere gratitude for its years of service to the Bay Area community.
