Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Thomas Poulton for his achievement of the rank.
Thomas is a senior at Kingsway Regional High School, and he has future plans to pursue a degree in business management.
Thomas's academic journey has been marked by excellence, with a particular passion for history, earning college credits through AP History classes.
Outside the classroom, Thomas has been an active participant in sports, contributing to his school's cross country, winter track, and tennis teams for three years.
Thomas's impressive 12-year scouting journey culminated in achieving the rank of Eagle Scout.
His scouting journey is marked with countless hours of community service, numerous leadership positions, and endless outdoor adventures.
For his Eagle Scout Project, he built a gaga pit for a local park, a project which he planned and executed himself from beginning to end.
His scouting experience has shaped him into a fine young man, emphasizing leadership, a strong moral compass, and a dedication to positive societal influence.
Thomas's achievements are a source of pride for his family and his community, and I congratulate him on everything he has accomplished.
God Bless Thomas and God Bless the United States.
