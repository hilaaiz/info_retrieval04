Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Fatima High School on their victory in Missouri's Class 3 Softball State Championship.
The team claimed the Class 3 title for the second consecutive year by beating St. Francis Borgia 12-2.
Senior Taylor Baumhoer led the way in the circle to finish her season with a sub-1.00 ERA as Fatima cruised in five innings.
The Lady Comets have now won 68 of their 75 games in the past two seasons.
The team should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home another state championship to their school and community.
