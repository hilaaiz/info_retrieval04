Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Charles Benjamin ``Ben'' Bayse and his 43 years of dedication to serving this country.
Ben served as a Navy pilot in the United States Pacific Fleet during World War II and in the Korean War.
For his time and service during World War II, Ben was awarded multiple medals including the World War II Medal and a Good Conduct Medal.
In 1949, he was one of the first Navy Pilots to land a jet on a carrier.
He did this in a Grumann F9F Panther Jet Fighter during the earliest stages of catapult take-off and landing operations.
As a reservist, he served as a Consulting Engineer and Maintenance Officer.
He retired from the Navy on his 60th birthday in 1987 at the rank of Captain.
In addition to his service in the Navy, Ben dedicated is life to improve the United States education system.
Mr. Bayse earned a Ph.D. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, to which he then served 37 years as an engineering professor in higher education.
He wrote two books regarding his time in the military and education system and the values that should be upheld in these great American institutions.
Ben Bayse was the embodiment of American ideals and exemplified at an extraordinary level what it means to be an American.
Ben was willing to make any sacrifice, including the ultimate sacrifice, required to defend the values of the United States.
