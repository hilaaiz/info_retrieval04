Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Karmen Ashlee Bernard's exceptional accomplishments and wish her continued success as she embarks on her next chapter at Prairie View A&M University.
Her story is a testament to the power of ambition and the importance of supporting our students in their educational endeavors.
