Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Coach Doug Blevins, who passed away on March 9th, at the age of 60.
Coach Blevins was born with cerebral palsy.
While his condition confined him to a wheelchair for his life, he was not deterred in pursuing a career in the sport of football.
As a student at Abingdon High School, 
Mr. Blevins served as a student assistant coach, specializing in the kicking game.
He would continue his education at Virginia Highlands Community College, University of Tennessee, and Emory & Henry University seeking more student coaching opportunities.
Coach Blevins would stay close to home, starting his own consulting firm and assisting prospective kicking talents at summer camps, clinics and more.
In 1994, Coach Blevins was hired to be a consultant for the New York Jets.
He would go on to coach for several years in the National Football League, working for the Miami Dolphins and NFL Hall of Fame Coach Jimmy Johnson, New England Patriots and Minnesota Vikings.
From 1995 to 2000, he served as kicking coordinator for the NFL Europe League.
He earned the remarkable achievement of becoming the NFL's first-ever disabled coach.
