A lifelong Washingtonian, Stephen was born in 1930 to the late Steve and Georgia Pappas and was a proud graduate of Western High followed by his ophthalmology residency at Episcopal Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital.
In 1961, Dr. Pappas completed his clinical fellowship in the retina service at Harvard's teaching hospital, Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary, in Boston.
He returned to Washington as the first formally fellowship-trained retina specialist in the region.

He later served as a civilian consultant at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda from 1968 to 1976.
In 1963, he founded his solo ophthalmology practice, providing compassionate, state-of-theart care.
In 1978, he moved his growing practice, Retina Consultants, from the District to Bethesda.
