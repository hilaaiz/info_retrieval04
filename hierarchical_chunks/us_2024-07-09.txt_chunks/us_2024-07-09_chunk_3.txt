Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mountain Lake Fire Company and Ladies Auxiliary on their 75-year anniversary.
A team of 25 volunteers including firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), and first responders, the Mountain Lake Fire Company has generously supported the communities of both Liberty and White Townships during any and all kinds of emergencies.
The Company was founded in 1949 with a single small fire truck, and over the past 75 years the Company has grown into a pillar of the community, from bringing townspeople together for their annual car show to educating children on fire safety.
Reflecting on their dedicated service, it is no surprise that the Mountain Lake Fire Company and Ladies Auxiliary is still thriving after 75 years.
As a former volunteer firefighter myself, I am honored to have such dedicated first responders and community members in the 7th Congressional District, and I look forward to seeing them continue to flourish in years to come.
