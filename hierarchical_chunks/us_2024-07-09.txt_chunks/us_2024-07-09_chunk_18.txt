Mr. Blevins' success as a coach caught the attention of many talented kickers dreaming of playing in the NFL.
Modern-day kicking legends, Adam Vinatieri and Justin Tucker, are just two of 26 current and former NFL kickers and punters who were trained and mentored by Coach Blevins.
Coach Blevins' years of hard work and tutoring prompted a significant recognition from the NFL community: his nomination to the NFL Pro Football Hall.
Perhaps, someday he will be inducted.
Most recently, he served as the kicking specialist at East Tennessee State University (ETSU), his alma mater, and as a volunteer assistant on the football staff at Science Hill High School.
Coach Blevins' inspirational journey from Southwest Virginia to the NFL, and his contributions to the sport of football, will not be forgotten--along with his kindness and compassion for others.
Despite his lifelong disability, Coach Blevins followed his dreams of coaching football and helped scores of young football players develop and succeed in the sport.
May his legacy live on.
