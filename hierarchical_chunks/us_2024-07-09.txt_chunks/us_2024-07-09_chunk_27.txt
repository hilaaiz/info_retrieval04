Whereas; Audra assisted as a trusted ally as I attempted my inaugural run to represent the 2nd Congressional District in Congress, and Whereas; Audra dutifully served as a valued member of my Congressional staff for more than eleven years, and Whereas; Audra undertook many responsibilities in my district office including, but not limited to, direct constituent assistance and success related to Veterans Affairs and Education, and Whereas; Audra professionally and loyally performed her duties as Constituent Services Manager, and Whereas; Audra serves as an inspiration and leader to her fellow colleagues and many residents of the State.
