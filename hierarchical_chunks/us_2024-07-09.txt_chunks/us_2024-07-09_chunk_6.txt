Mr. BLUMENAUER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the extraordinary heroism displayed by Timberline Lodge employees and first responders from Hoodland Fire, Clackamas Fire, Estacada Fire, Portland Fire, Gresham Fire and the United States Forest Service.
In the middle of the night on April 18, 2024, a fire was detected in the attic of the historic Timberline Lodge on Oregon's iconic Mount Hood.
Lodge staff jumped into action with fire extinguishers and safely evacuated guests who were staying at the Lodge, many of whom were roused from their sleep to be escorted out.
Fire crews from around the mountain arrived in record time to battle the blaze and protect Timberline Lodge, a national historic treasure.
Constructed in 1937, Timberline Lodge stands on the south slope of Mount Hood at an elevation of 6,000 feet.
Iconic and awe-inspiring in its architecture and design, it is a tribute to the rugged spirit of the Pacific Northwest.
The Lodge was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977 and is one of Oregon's most popular tourist attractions, drawing nearly two million visitors every year.
The quick thinking, bravery, and exemplary effort by both staff and first responders ensured that fire damage was limited to the attic and that all the guests made it out safely with no injuries reported.
To think, we could've lost this national treasure if it wasn't for the courageous actions of a few brave souls.
I am forever grateful for their response.
