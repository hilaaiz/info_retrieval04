Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a trailblazer in the realm of education and civil rights, John L. Barnes.
A native of Charleston, MS, John grew up about 10 miles north of Charleston and attended Sherman Creek Elementary School.
He was also the valedictorian of his 1964 graduating class at Allen-Carver High School.
He courageously shattered racial barriers while pursuing his education at Mississippi State University (MSU).
During his time at MSU, John encountered significant challenges due to racial prejudice and discrimination.
As one of the first African American students at the university, he faced hostility, exclusion, and limited opportunities.
Despite these obstacles, John persevered, contributing to the gradual transformation of MSU's campus climate.
His courage and resilience paved the way for future generations of students seeking equal access to education.
His enrollment at MSU in 1965 marked a significant milestone, as he became the first African American student to graduate from the university, June 2, 1968.
He received a Bachelor of Arts from the MSU College of Arts and Sciences.
His brother, Aaron was the third African American to graduate from MSU.
After graduating from MSU, he briefly taught at Allen-Carver School before embarking on his corporate career in New York City.
His achievements as the first African American graduate from MSU and his subsequent professional path demonstrate resilience and determination.
While specific achievements beyond this groundbreaking moment may not be widely documented, John's legacy remains an inspiration for those who continue to fight for educational equity and social justice.
