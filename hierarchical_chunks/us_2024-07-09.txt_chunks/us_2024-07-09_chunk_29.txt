he supervised and trained generations of ophthalmology residents as a volunteer from 1963 to 1994.
He was also assistant clinical professor in Ophthalmology at both GWU and Georgetown.
He continued to value his professional relationships with mentors, peers, and mentees for his entire career and beyond.
His distinguished career was marked by many local and national accolades.
Despite these remarkable professional achievements, Dr. Pappas will most be remembered as a man of faith who was truly devoted to his beloved wife of 62 years, Virginia (Ginny) Nicoludis Pappas, as an incredible father to Dr. Stephen Pappas, Jr. (Michelle) and Adrienne Kalavritinos (Jack), and as a loving papou to his four grandchildren: John, Analiese, Mark, and Alexander.
He was an active, early member of the St George Greek Orthodox Church in Bethesda, MD.
Faith, family and friends were paramount in his life.
His remarkable ability to connect through his warmth, sense of humor, and genuine caring will be remembered by all who knew him.
May his memory be eternal.
