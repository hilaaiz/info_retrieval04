Thank you, Mr Speaker.
May I associate myself with your remarks and those of the Prime Minister about  the right hon.
Member for Richmond and Northallerton (Rishi Sunak) , and thank him for his service?
I wish him and the whole country a happy Diwali.
Despite our political differences, I have always felt a certain kinship with him since the general election, when he was the only other party leader to get as wet as I did.
[Laughter.]
I am looking forward to debating the Budget with him and the Chancellor shortly, but may I wish him and his family all the best for the future?
Next month’s summit in Baku is a chance for the UK to regain world leadership on climate change—a role disastrously lost under the Conservatives.
As this is the final summit before countries must ratchet up their new  Paris agreement targets for 2035, will the Prime Minister take this opportunity to seize back world leadership on climate change by committing today to support the targets set out this week by the independent Climate Change Committee and publishing a programme to deliver on them?
We will seize that initiative.
We have reset on the international stage, and climate is one of the biggest challenges that we face.
I will be going to the conference this year, just as I went last year as Leader of the Opposition, to continue those discussions about how we reach the very important targets that we must reach.
