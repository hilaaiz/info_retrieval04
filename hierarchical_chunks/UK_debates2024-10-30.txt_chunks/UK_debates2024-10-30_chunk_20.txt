I thank—[Interruption.]
I thank the Secretary of State for his reply.
In any discussions he has, will he take account of the fact that I have written to UNESCO about the potential for a huge offshore wind farm very close to the Giant’s Causeway and the UNESCO world heritage site there?
The Communities  Minister in Northern Ireland has also met UNESCO.
Will the Secretary of State make representations to ensure that all considerations are taken account of, so that people know the problems that may compromise that world heritage site?
