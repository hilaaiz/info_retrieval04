I thank the right hon.
Member for raising this tragic case, and I join him in paying tribute to Greg’s parents.
Their tireless work to raise awareness of spiking, to support victims and to call for changes in the law is inspiring, given what they have been through.
This Government will act.
We will make spiking a specific criminal offence to better protect victims and support the police in tackling these crimes.
