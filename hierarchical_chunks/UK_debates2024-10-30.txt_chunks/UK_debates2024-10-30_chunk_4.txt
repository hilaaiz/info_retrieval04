The Secretary of State mentions Orbex.
At present, it employs 125 people; by 2030, it could employ as many as 500.
Is the Secretary of State willing to visit Orbex in Elgin and, indeed, the Sutherland space launch site?
Elgin is certainly not the final frontier, so I would be very happy to visit.
The Minister for Science recently visited the UK Space Agency’s new office in  Edinburgh, and during that visit, he echoed my sentiments about the importance of Scotland’s space sector.
The Minister for Data Protection and Telecoms has recently met Orbex as well, and I will remain in close contact with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that we back the sector.
I am very happy to visit when ministerial time allows.
