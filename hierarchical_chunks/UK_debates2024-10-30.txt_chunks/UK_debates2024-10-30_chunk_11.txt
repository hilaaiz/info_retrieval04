I thank my hon.
Friend for that reply, and I congratulate him on his debut at the Dispatch Box this morning.
As he mentioned, earlier this month the Secretary of State joined me on a visit to Rosyth dockyard in my constituency.
Does my hon.
Friend agree that the failure of the SNP to support the defence sector in recruiting the highly skilled workers it needs from my constituency and the rest of Fife is a damning indictment of the SNP’s commitment to the security and prosperity of the people of Scotland?
Will he reassure me that he will do all he can to ensure that the defence sector in Scotland contributes fully to the UK’s security and future economic growth?
