I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
She is the first female and first Labour MP for Aldershot, and she is doing a superb job for her constituents.
Rushmoor borough council was left with a shortfall of over £19 million over the last four years.
The running down of local services has been one of the most painful features of the last 14 years.
We will work hand in hand with councils, including on multi-year funding settlements, and with local leaders to develop and make sure the services that are needed are there.
