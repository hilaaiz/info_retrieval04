I thank the hon.
Member for raising this issue.
We are all grateful to our veterans for their service in protecting our country.
I understand the value of the Veterans’ Orthopaedic Service and the  support it provides for veterans.
We are committed to ensuring that veterans receive the employment, mental health and housing support they need.
The upcoming Budget will set out the changes we will be making.
