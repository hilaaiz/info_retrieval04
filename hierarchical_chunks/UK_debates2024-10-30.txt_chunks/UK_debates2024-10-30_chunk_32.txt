I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for raising this, because it is an important issue and I  do not think we discuss it enough in this House.
We continue to see mounting evidence of appalling atrocities against civilians and unacceptable restrictions on humanit-arian access.
Working with international partners— including as penholder at the UN Security Council, as he knows—to end the violence, secure humanitarian access and ensure the protection of civilians is a major priority.
