I welcome my hon.
Friend to his place; it was a wonderful election result in his constituency of Airdrie and Shotts.
Investment in the UK to drive growth is the Government’s No. 1 priority, and we have already started delivery on it.
Just this month, we hosted an international investment summit, at which we announced £63 billion of shovel-ready investment across the UK.
That includes the likes of Greenvolt’s £2.5 billion investment in Scotland and Iberdrola’s £24 billion investment in green energy.
We also announced this week that Glasgow will host the Commonwealth games, which will bring £100 million to the city.
