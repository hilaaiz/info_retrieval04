As the Secretary of State knows, I recently had the opportunity to visit California with the Scottish Affairs Committee to look at how that state has created an environment that encourages new space projects.
In Scotland, we have a unique opportunity, not least because of developments in Glasgow, but also because the University of Edinburgh is already well respected and part of the programmes at Stanford, New York University, Columbia and NASA.
What will the Government do to encourage the creation of that sort of environment in Scotland, and will the University of Edinburgh, given its reputation, be central to that?
Scotland will be central to the space sector, and I very much welcome the question.
We will fully back the space sector, as I said to  the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Jamie Stone) .
The Minister for Science has been to the UK Space Agency’s new office in Edinburgh, and the Minister for Data Protection and Telecoms has met Orbex.
I have met Orbex and been to Unst in Shetland to visit the spaceport up there.
We will fully back this; of course, its potential reaches to infinity and beyond.
What recent discussions he has had with Cabinet colleagues on encouraging inward investment into Scotland.
