I thank my hon.
Friend for his empathy with the complexity of delivering this.
I recognise the urgency, of course.
That is why, over the recess, I had several meetings with officials.
We are moving forward with the appointment of the clinical, legal and care experts.
However, I recognise that his focus and that of colleagues across the House is on the speed of delivery of payments.
Obviously, we made those interim payments further to the first interim report recommendations in October 2022.
I will continue to have meetings with colleagues to move this forward as quickly as I can.
