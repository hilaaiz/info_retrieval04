I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important matter.
I know it is of concern to many people, which is why the RAC has highlighted it.
He will know that in the current provisions for vehicle headlamps there is a maximum and minimum light intensity, and specifications for the light pattern and the position of the lights on the vehicle.
This is a highly regulated area.
My hon.
Friend can raise the matter directly with the Secretary of State on  8 February , but I will ensure that he is aware of the survey and what the RAC has said.
I thank my hon.
Friend for his campaign.
