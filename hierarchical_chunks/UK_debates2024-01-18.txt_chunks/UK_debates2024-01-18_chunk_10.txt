I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question.
As he will know, there are clearly defined circumstances in which the Government can exclude companies from bidding for contracts.
With regard to Fujitsu, he may be interested to hear that this morning the Cabinet Office received a letter from Fujitsu voluntarily undertaking not to bid for Government contracts while the inquiry is ongoing, unless of course the Government asked it to do so.
