What recent discussions he has had with the chair of the Grenfell Tower inquiry on the timetable for publication of the phase 2 report.
The Grenfell Tower inquiry is a statutory inquiry established under the Inquiries Act 2005.
Under the Act, the drafting of an inquiry’s final report and the timing of that process are rightly matters for the independent inquiry chair.
In its November 2023 newsletter, published on its website, the inquiry confirmed that “the report will not be published before April next year but the Panel hopes to be able to send it to the Prime Minister before the next anniversary of the fire with publication soon thereafter.”
