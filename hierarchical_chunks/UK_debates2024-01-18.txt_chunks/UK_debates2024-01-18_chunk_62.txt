Given that there is a debate later today on HS2 compensation, and that Skelmersdale in my constituency has repeatedly been denied any support for a train station—infamously, it still has none—will the Leader of the House share her thoughts on the Department for Transport’s Network North advert that boasted of rerouting £235 million of HS2 funds from the north to fix potholes in London?
I am not sure I have seen that Government advertisement, so I cannot comment on it.
However, if that is a matter of concern to the hon.
Lady’s constituents with regard to HS2 compensation, I encourage her to attend the debate this afternoon.
