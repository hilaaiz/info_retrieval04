I pay huge tribute to Morag and the many others who I have met over the past few years who work night and day at the coalface of veterans’ care and policy.
They are the true heroes in looking after our veterans.
It is the nation’s responsibility, and those who have left the military often set the example for how we look after our veterans.
I pay tribute to her and the hundreds and thousands of others across the country who spend night and day helping veterans.
