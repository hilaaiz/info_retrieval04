I add my condolences to the family and friends of Tony Lloyd.
Last night, in the local I frequent in Kennington, Tony was remembered with great fondness by the regulars.
The manager, who is also a friend of mine, asked me to make it known that he really respected, loved and missed Tony Lloyd.
He will be missed by all in the House.
He was probably the nicest Manchester United supporter I have ever come across.
