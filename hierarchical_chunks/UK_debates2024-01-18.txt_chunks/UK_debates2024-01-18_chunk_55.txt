I thank my hon.
Friend for her work on that matter.
Her question comes in a week when we have also seen reports about previous whistleblowers on other issues, such as Maggie Oliver and her work on grooming gangs, at tremendous personal cost to herself, losing her career and livelihood in the process.
We owe those individuals a huge debt of gratitude, and I will certainly make sure that the Cabinet Office has heard what my hon.
Friend has said.
As I mentioned, I wrote last week to the Cabinet Office asking it to reflect on what it could learn from Horizon and from other inquiries that we have established.
My hon.
Friend may wish to raise the matter directly at the Business and Trade questions on  25 January .
