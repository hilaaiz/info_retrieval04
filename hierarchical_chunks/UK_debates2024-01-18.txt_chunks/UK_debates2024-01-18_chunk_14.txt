I thank the Minister for his answer.
My constituents in Strangford, and indeed people across Northern Ireland, including a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses—they create many jobs, wage packets and opportunities—very much want to be part of this process, and I know the Minister is keen to support us.
What can be done for defence procurement, for example, and also for the food and agriculture sectors, because we have great companies that have the potential to do better.
Can the Minister add his support?
