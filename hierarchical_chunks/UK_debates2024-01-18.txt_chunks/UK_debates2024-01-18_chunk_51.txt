I thank the hon.
Lady for her very important question.
The Competition and Markets Authority is doing important work in a number of areas, and that is one of them.
We have had announcements  on petrol retail, for example, in the last week.
I shall certainly make sure that the Secretary of State has heard her concerns about that particular area.
