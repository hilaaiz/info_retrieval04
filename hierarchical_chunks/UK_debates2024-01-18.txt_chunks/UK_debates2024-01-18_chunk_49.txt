I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
The powers and privileges of this House are necessary to enable Parliament to function freely and fully, and it is vital that Select Committees are able to obtain full and accurate evidence from witnesses as part of their inquiries.
That is critical.
The powers available to this House and Select Committees have been under continual review, and they have been investigated numerous times in the past decades.
It is, of course, very frustrating when witnesses do not co-operate with Select Committees, and the Government support this House in asserting its powers to ensure that it can scrutinise effectively.
