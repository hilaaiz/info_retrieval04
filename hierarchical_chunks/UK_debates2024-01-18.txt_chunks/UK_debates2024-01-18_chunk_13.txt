In his reply to  the right hon.
Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Sir David Davis) , the Minister totally missed the point, because he referred to defined reasons why companies could be excluded.
The Government and Parliament make the rules.
They have been dragging their feet month after month, year after year, on changing that in this regard, but also in terms of supporting domestic industry, as every other major economy does.
When will they sort this out and get it down to the House and into the rules, over civil service intransigence and delaying tactics?
The right hon.
Gentleman will have heard what I just said to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Sir David Davis) .
I know that, as a lover of due process, he will believe that the statutory inquiry should appropriately have the final word on this.
And when it does, we will have absolutely no compunction in acting.
May I, too, convey my sympathies to the family of Tony Lloyd?
I thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing us the opportunity to come together more fully as a House to pay tribute.
