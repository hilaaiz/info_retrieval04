The Centre for Military Women’s Research has identified numerous gaps in our understanding of women’s experiences in the military, the consequent problems they face and the reluctance to pursue research on those matters.
Is it right to presume that the women veterans’ strategy—I hear what the Minister says about his genuine concern on these matters—will be his main vehicle for ensuring that we tackle those issues?
Absolutely; the point of the strategy, essentially, is to ensure that the voices that have been unheard for too long are heard.
I know that there is unmet need and pain in the female veteran community.
There is also huge pride, and there are extraordinary examples of those who have served and have gone on to achieve extraordinary things in their lives.
We will of course look to achieve balance; I want to ensure that female veterans are correctly catered for and looked after in this country.
I want it to be the best country in the world to be a veteran—and that is for all veterans, female or male, across the piece, irrespective of cap badge.
I am determined to keep going until we get there.
What steps his Department is taking to protect public services and institutions from cyber-threats.
We are protecting our public services from cyber-threats through our world-leading Government cyber-security strategy.
We are also tackling the threat at source.
Last year alone, we sanctioned 18 criminals responsible for spreading a prolific ransomware strain, and we exposed the Russian intelligence services for their attempts to target high-profile individuals and entities through cyber-operations.
