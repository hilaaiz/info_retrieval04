I thank the Secretary of State for his response.
In the wake of the recent attack on the British Library, will he tell us what assessment the Government have made of potential cyber-attacks on other non-departmental public bodies?
How will he ensure that they are not vulnerable to similar attacks and that the country is not brought to a standstill?
