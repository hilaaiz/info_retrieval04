My hon.
Friend is right that it is vital that commissioners are held to account.
Our NHS will not function properly without accountability and choice.
The former Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Steve Barclay) , undertook work on patient outcomes data and the quality of commissioning in each board and across the UK, which will help to drive accountability.
Now that we have that data, I am sure it will make for a very interesting debate.
My hon.
Friend knows how to apply for a debate, and he may also wish to raise this matter with the Secretary of State on  23 January .
