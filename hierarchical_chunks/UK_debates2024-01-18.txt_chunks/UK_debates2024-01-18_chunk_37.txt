I thank the hon.
Lady for again raising the important issue of infected blood.
This session follows Cabinet Office questions, in which a number of things were placed on record both by the Paymaster General and by Members.
I again remind the House that the compensation study was established acknowledging the moral case for compensation, that the study should be concurrent to the inquiry, and that the inquiry and the study could make reference to each other.
The reason for that was to ensure that we could arrive as swiftly as possible at a compensation package for all those affected by this appalling scandal.
I do not disagree with any hon.
Member who believes that we should not have to wait.
