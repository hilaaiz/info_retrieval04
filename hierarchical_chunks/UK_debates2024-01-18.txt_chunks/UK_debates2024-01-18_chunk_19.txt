Yes, of course.
The review of welfare services for veterans is the most significant review that has happened ever on the statutory service of veterans’ affairs across the Ministry of Defence and across Government.
It has of course been a concern of mine for some time that female veterans have not felt as included and as part of the veterans’ community as I would want them to feel.
I am absolutely determined to over-correct that and ensure that women veterans are looked after and are as proud as I am of their service and of being in the veteran community.
