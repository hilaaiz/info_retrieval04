I thank the hon.
Lady for her question, but I think it is deeply unfair to suggest that there has been a lack of urgency from the Government.
The then Prime Minister announced the inquiry the day after that terrible event, and we have taken huge action to provide compensation for people and to ensure that no qualifying leaseholder living in a building above 11 metres will face the cost of remediation for unsafe cladding.
Of course we are eager to get the response from the official inquiry, and we will take action thereafter.
