I thank the Leader of the House.
I want to start by paying my own tribute to my dear and hon.
Friend Sir Tony Lloyd.
The words spoken about Tony since his passing yesterday, which have come from across this House and the political divide, really are a reflection of the special person he was.
He was kind, sincere and driven by his deep values and principles.
He worked with everyone necessary to further a cause, and always with integrity and humanity.
