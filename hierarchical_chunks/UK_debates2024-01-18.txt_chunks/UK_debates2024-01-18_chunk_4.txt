The hon.
Gentleman will have seen, further to what I have just read out, the report that was published in November, in which the chair explained that rule 13 of the inquiry rules requires the inquiry “to write to those who might be subject to criticism” and give them fair time to respond.
The newsletter states: “The rule 13 process is proving time consuming.”
However, I hope that the hon.
Gentleman will be reassured by the dates that I have read out.
