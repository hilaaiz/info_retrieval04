My hon.
Friend  the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)  knows how to apply for a debate, and I am sure it would be well attended.
My constituent, Mr Richard Troote, had to wait over 18 months to receive from His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs a national insurance refund worth more than £1,300 for the tax year 2021-22.
HMRC still has not responded to his complaint, or indeed his request for a complaint, on the refund.
Could the Leader of the House ask for a written statement on what Treasury Ministers will do to provide more support to HMRC civil servants to try to deal with these backlogs?
In a cost of living crisis, none of our constituents can afford to wait 18 months for these refunds.
It is not acceptable.
I agree with what the hon.
Gentleman says.
Money owed by HMRC accrues interest, but that arrangement is not reciprocal.
As Treasury questions will not be until later next month, I will write to the Treasury if he gives me details of the case.
Hopefully we will be able to get this resolved swiftly for his constituent.
Can we have a debate on bus priority measures so that I can express my constituents’ strong opposition to the proposal by Barnet Council and the Mayor of London to introduce bus lanes on the A1000 in High Barnet and Whetstone?
They will cause huge congestion, they will damage local businesses and they are not needed or wanted.
My right hon.
Friend is right that any such proposal should really be developed with input from the local community, and something has gone wrong if the community is so galvanised against a scheme that is due to come to the area.
The next Transport questions are not until  8 February , but I will make sure that the Secretary of State knows about her concerns.
I am afraid that the Mayor of London is the decision maker, and I hope he will listen to her and her constituents.
When we ask written questions and when our offices require information from Government Departments, our constituents expect a comprehensive response.
However, we are getting standardised responses from UK Visas and Immigration, in particular.
We have desperate people who fear for their future, so will the Leader of the House talk to the Home Office about how we can have comprehensive responses so that we can know the timelines, the details and the reasons for the delays in processing cases?
