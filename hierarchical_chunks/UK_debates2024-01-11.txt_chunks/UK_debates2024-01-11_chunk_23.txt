Our film industry is world leading.
He is right that the strikes caused disruption.
We work very closely with our partners in other jurisdictions.
One example is the international hit film “Barbie”, which was filmed in the UK, supported 750 jobs, added £80 million to our economy and earned more than £1.1 billion at the global box office.
We needed to ensure that the film industry could continue to thrive after the strikes, which is why we are continuing to support the industry with tax incentives, funding pots and, importantly, the development of a skills pipeline to ensure success long into the future.
Whether she has had recent discussions with the BBC Board on the impartiality of the BBC’s current affairs coverage.
The BBC has a duty to deliver its impartial and accurate news and current affairs coverage under its royal charter.
It is editorially independent, which means that editorial policies are a matter for the BBC, but both the Secretary of State and I regularly meet the BBC’s leadership team.
We have discussed the important issue of impartiality on multiple occasions.
It is also a key focus of the Government’s mid-term review of the BBC’s governance and regulation.
As a former BBC journalist myself, I completely believe in its editorial independence from the Government, but, just as strongly, I consider it essential that the BBC, across all its programming and from all presenters, should be absolutely and unequivocally impartial.
Given the concerns that we have heard about the current coverage of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, the reporting of the resignation of the president of Harvard and examples of where Ofcom has found significant editorial failings, does my hon.
Friend agree that the BBC needs to work consistently, constantly and visibly to enforce that requirement on impartiality?
