The Secretary of State was asked— What assessment she has made of the potential merits of requiring venues to introduce a surcharge on large event tickets to support grassroots music venues.
If she will take steps to require arenas, stadiums and major festivals to charge a ticket levy to help fund grassroots live music.
I pay tribute to my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Maldon (Sir John Whittingdale)  for supporting my maternity leave.
The chance to raise a tiny child is fleeting and precious, and his superb stewardship of my portfolio granted me that gift.
One of my big worries on standing for election and then becoming a Minister was that it might prove incompatible with starting and now expanding my family.
I simply say to other women who want to get involved in public life, “Do not be afraid.
There is a lot of talk of barriers, but service and motherhood are compatible privileges.”
As my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Norwich North (Chloe Smith)  said so encouragingly to me, you can do it.
Grassroots live music venues are the talent pipeline of our music industry.
We are supporting them with funds and rate relief.
We have no plans for a Government-mandated ticket levy, but we encourage industry discussion.
