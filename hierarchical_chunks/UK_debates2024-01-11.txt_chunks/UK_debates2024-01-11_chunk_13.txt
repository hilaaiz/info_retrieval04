I thank the hon.
Lady for highlighting this issue, which the Cabinet Office leads on.
The DCMS has been in talks with the Cabinet Office about that spend.
As I say, I have spoken to groups such as Reach about this previously.
I was in the Cabinet Office during the pandemic, when some large adverts were used and some of the issues faced were about regularity; the Government spent a large amount of money with local newspapers because of that audience reach, because of older readership and so on.
So the Government do a lot in this area, but I appreciate that there is always more we can look to do
and I understand the point she is making about online advertising.
