Unfortunately, in recent weeks there has been a spate of disgusting sexist, misogynistic abuse directed towards sportswomen just for being at the top of their game.
I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport,  the right hon.
Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) , has been on the receiving end just for standing up to it, which I commend him for.
I agree with him that vile, misogynistic comments are dangerous.
The reality is that they are putting women and girls off sport.
Does the Secretary of State agree that every sporting organisation should have a strategy to eliminate all forms of sexual harassment and abuse?
I agree with the hon.
Member: we should not have misogynistic, bullying behaviour in sport, and all governing bodies should be looking at what their sports are doing.
We set out in our sports strategy how we should have fair competition and integrity in sport.
