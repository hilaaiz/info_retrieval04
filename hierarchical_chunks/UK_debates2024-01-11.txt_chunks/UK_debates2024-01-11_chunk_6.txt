My right hon.
Friend has made his point well, if not briefly.
We agree about the importance of grassroots music, which is why we have given another £5 million to the supporting grassroots music fund, but we are also in close touch with the Music Venue Trust, which has a great initiative called “Own Our Venues”.
Arts Council England is helping with the purchase of some of the freeholds of these venues.
We support that as well, but we think there is more scope for the industry to lead a solution, and we are backing talks between different parts of the industry.
Let us hear from the industry.
I call Pete Wishart.
The music industry is just about the most unequal sector in the whole of society.
Those at the bottom—the  vast majority—earn an absolute pittance, while those at the very top have unimaginable earnings.
Surely we should be doing everything possible to try to change that.
It is the sensible option: they do it in France, and the Scottish National party Government are considering doing it in Scotland.
Will the Minister support that effort and initiative in Scotland, and if it shows that it can help redistribute some of this money, will she follow that example?
