I thank the Leader of the House for the business statement and for announcing the Backbench Business for next Thursday.
I give her advance notice that we have a heavily subscribed application for a debate on Holocaust Memorial Day on  Thursday 25 January , if we are allocated the time.
Holocaust Memorial Day itself is on  27 January .
