I thank the hon.
Lady for raising these issues.
I know that sustaining a good, financially beneficial career is a concern for many people working in journalism.
Before I went on leave, I met Reach and other local newspaper groups to talk about some of the challenges they face.
The Government are doing what we can through our ad spend, and we have looked at various things over the years, including zero rating of VAT, rates relief and so on, to try to help the sustainability of the local newspaper model.
Ultimately, sustainability is at the heart of the challenge of giving local journalists places to have good careers.
We are encouraging the BBC’s local democracy reporting service, which gives journalists opportunities beyond local newspapers.
