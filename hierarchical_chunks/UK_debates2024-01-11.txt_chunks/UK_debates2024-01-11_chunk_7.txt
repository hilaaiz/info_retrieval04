I thank the hon.
Gentleman for telling us what the Scottish National party is doing.
I had understood that it was cutting a substantial amount from the arts budget.
We have been supporting, for instance, the Edinburgh grassroots hub.
I think there is a great deal of appetite in this place for a solution; I also think that the best option is for those in the industry to get together, and we are backing discussions of that kind.
Indeed, before I went on leave I talked to Mark Davyd of the Music Venue Trust about the issue.
