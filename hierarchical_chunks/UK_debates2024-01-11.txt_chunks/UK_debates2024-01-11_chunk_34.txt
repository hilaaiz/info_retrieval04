I think the whole House is very sorry to learn what has happened to my hon.
Friend’s local churches.
A theft during the mass is really quite extraordinary.
I will make sure that the Church of England nationally gets in touch with the Metropolitan police to pass on his concerns about that case.
On general security advice, alarm sensors and attaching safes securely to the building will help, as will making sure that there is an accurate record, and pictures of valuables can help to secure their return.
We certainly do not want a repeat of what my hon.
Friend has experienced.
What steps the Church is taking to support Christians in Cuba.
I commend the Prime Minister’s special envoy for freedom of religion or belief for yet again bringing this issue before the House.
It is extremely concerning that the Cuban Government continue to control religious activity so tightly by using surveillance, harassment, forced exile, fines and ill-treatment of prisoners.
The Church of England works multilaterally through the United Nations, the World Council of Churches and other bodies to advocate vigorously for freedom of religion or belief for everyone in Cuba.
