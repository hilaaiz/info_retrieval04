What recent discussions she has had with Cabinet colleagues on developing new sports facilities in Devon and Cornwall.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the Government are investing in facilities up and down the country.
I am pleased to say that the multi-sport grassroots facilities programme has invested, through the Football Foundation, more than £766,000 since 2022 across Devon and Cornwall, supporting 79 projects so far with equipment.
Groups such as the Torquay athletics club do great work in coaching and encouraging young people across Torbay to participate in sport, yet there are no synthetic 400-metre track and field athletics facilities suitable for high-level training in our bay.
What opportunities does the Minister see for getting such a facility in Torbay to address that need?
