I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
He is absolutely right: trust is the BBC’s currency.
That is especially important in relation to its international coverage, particularly during conflicts, so it must use its words with care.
With regard to the events in Israel and Gaza, the Government have been clear that the BBC should reflect on its coverage and learn lessons for the future, but, of course, we again emphasise impartiality and the highest editorial standards.
That is a strategic priority of the BBC’s leadership, and we are talking to them about this in relation to the mid-term review and licensing renewal.
