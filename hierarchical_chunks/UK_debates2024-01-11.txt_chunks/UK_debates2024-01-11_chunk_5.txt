I welcome my hon.
Friend back to her place.
In 2023, across the country, not just in Edinburgh, live music boomed, with some 22 million people attending gigs, yet 76 small venues closed—more than one a week.
I draw the Minister’s attention to an analogy with another hugely successful leisure industry, football, where a small amount of the enormous riches gained by the Premier League is allowed to trickle down to the grassroots so that the future of the sport is preserved.
Just as with football, we have hugely profitable large arenas where the superstars of today perform and create huge revenues.
