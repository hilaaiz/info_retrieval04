I welcome the Minister back to her place.
The Government are one of the biggest advertisers in the UK yet, when it comes to placing adverts and campaigns, local papers  such as the Barnsley Chronicle can be overlooked in favour of buying ad space online.
Many people in this country do not have digital access or still rely on print media as their primary source of news and information, and our local papers are struggling.
What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the Government’s policy on placing adverts supports the interests of both our press and the public?
