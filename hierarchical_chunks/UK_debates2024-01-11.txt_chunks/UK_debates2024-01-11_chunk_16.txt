What steps her Department is taking to tackle loneliness.
Since the tackling loneliness strategy launched in 2018, the Government  and their partners have invested more than £80 million in tackling loneliness.
The 2023 annual report included 60 new cross-government commitments, and updates on progress on things included in that report are due to be published in March.
Severe cuts have left a £600 million gap in adult social care funding.
More than 1 million lonely and isolated elderly people now rely on charities such as Re-engage, which I volunteer with, to plug that gap.
I know that the Minister does care about this, but surely he must recognise that those cuts and their leading to that rise in desperate loneliness are because of this Government.
First, let me pay tribute to the hon.
Lady for the work she does with those charities.
The partnership between Government and charities has made the UK one of the world’s leading countries on tackling loneliness.
That is why in the Budget in 2023 we announced £100 million of support for charities and community organisations, recognising the challenges they face and paying tribute to them for the work they are doing in tackling this important issue.
