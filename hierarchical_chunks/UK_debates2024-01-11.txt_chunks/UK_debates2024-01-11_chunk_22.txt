I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for her answer.
She will know that there is now more studio space for feature film production in the home counties than there is in Hollywood.
However,  there is a vulnerability.
We found that out at the time of the American writers and actors’ strikes, when a number of my friends, and many other people who are not my friends, were made redundant temporarily because film production halted.
How can we make the British film industry more independent of the American production machine?
