The imprints are going to be important, but we have already seen an attack on our system through cyber-attacks at the last general election.
At this general election, we face the increased, insidious threat to our democracy from artificial intelligence and fake news circulating false audio from politicians during conference season, so is there anything else that the commission is considering, or that it could do, to attack that sort of insidious approach?
