The Backbench Business Committee would very much welcome applications for debate slots in Westminster Hall.
We can secure for Members debate slots on Tuesday mornings and Thursday afternoons.
While we have a glut of applications for the Chamber, we very much welcome applications for Westminster Hall debates to be submitted as soon as possible.
I am also glad to report that application forms for Backbench Business debates can now be attained from the Vote Office, so Members can now just pick up a form, fill it in and submit it.
On a local issue for my constituency, the Tyne bridge between Gateshead and Newcastle has been earmarked for funding from the Department for Transport to give it a much-needed repair job and upgrade.
I am afraid, though, that the money has been promised but has not been forthcoming, and the work very much needs to start as soon as possible.
Indeed, if we do not get the work done, it will not be sound, solid and pristine for its anniversary in four years’ time.
Will the Leader of the House check what is happening with the Department for Transport and see whether the funds can be released so that we can get on with the work?
