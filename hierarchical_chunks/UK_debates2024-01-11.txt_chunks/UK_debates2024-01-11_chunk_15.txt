I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
It is vital that communities have access to the right facilities, in order to help us meet our target of having more than 3 million more people being active by 2030.
Sport England has provided more than £20 million to support grassroots projects in the region.
I would be happy to share a full list of the available funds that are open for him to have a look at.
Let me also add my thanks to his constituents for the work they are doing in getting people more active.
