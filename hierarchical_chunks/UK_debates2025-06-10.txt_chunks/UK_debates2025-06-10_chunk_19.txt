I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his expertise in this area, which he often brings to the House.
He is absolutely right that decoupling from volatile and expensive gas prices is critical, and the journey we are on to develop clean power by 2030 will do that.
Our objective is to deliver a clean power system where gas only provides the back-up, rather than setting the price, as it currently does.
Too often—80% of the time—we rely on gas to set the price.
We are trying  to remove that, and to build a clean power system for the future.
