I thank the Minister for outlining the support available to households with high energy bills.
Some 6,000 households in my constituency benefit from the warm home discount, but many in Barking and Dagenham, alongside almost 2 million other households in this country, are dealing with high energy debt.
What plans are under way for energy debt relief schemes, or  a scheme to help those who built up debt under the previous Government, so that we can support them now?
Unlike the Conservatives, we do not abandon those households suffering from debt that arose as a result of the legacy of past Governments.
