I thank my hon.
Friend for her advocacy.
When I was in discussions with the Chancellor, I did think that if this did not go ahead I would have to answer to my hon.
Friend and to the Mayor of the East Midlands, so she was a motivating force in ensuring that the project did go ahead.
Her point is crucial: this is about good jobs in areas of the country that really need those good jobs.
Last night, I was talking to an apprentice from Sizewell—she went there at age 16 and has been there for a year—about the experience she has had.
She gives credit to Sizewell.
We can see her career in front of her, and we want that for lots more people.
