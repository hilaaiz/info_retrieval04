I sincerely welcome her support for this programme, and she puts the case very well: it is a lesson to some of the Opposition Members sitting behind her that we need all the clean energy technologies; we should not choose between them.
Being in favour of nuclear does not mean that we are against wind.
I am the biggest enthusiast for offshore wind, onshore wind, solar and all these technologies.
Let us have all of them, to get off fossil fuels and meet our electricity and energy demand.
Thank you, Mr Speaker, and happy birthday; you were born only a few months after the opening of Calder Hall, the world’s first civil nuclear power plant, so you share that.
