I think we all agree that it is important for us to protect all consumers from the volatile oil and gas prices that my hon.
Friend has mentioned.
However, while we shift and undertake that reform, has the Minister considered the benefits of having an energy social tariff, to protect customers now from those volatile oil and gas prices, and to prepare them for a cleaner, better and reformed energy market in the future?
I always agree with my hon.
Friend, but on her initial point, I probably do not.
I am not sure that we do all agree in this House that we should remove the volatility of fossil fuel prices.
Some want us to remain linked to fossil fuels for longer and longer.
We are determined to remove that vulnerability from people’s bills, so that we do not face the price spikes that many families still struggle with.
She is right to point to targeted support as well.
We are looking at social tariffs.
Part of the challenge is that the phrase means different things to different people, but we are clear that bringing down bills for everyone is a top priority for this Government, and the clean power mission is how we will do it.
