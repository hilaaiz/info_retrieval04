I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his excellent question.
I 100% agree with him about the role of community energy providers.
I hope that he can persuade his Front Benchers to convert to supporting Great British Energy, because one of things that it will do—we will be happy to work with him on this—is unleash a wave of community energy across our country, doing precisely the things that he talks about.
