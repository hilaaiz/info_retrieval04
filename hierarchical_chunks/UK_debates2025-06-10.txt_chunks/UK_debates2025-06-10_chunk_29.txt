I welcome the Government’s commitment to nuclear energy as a means of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, but I am concerned that far less attention has been given to another low-carbon, low marginal cost, firm baseload power source—deep geothermal.
By some estimates, there are over 30 GW of geothermal energy potential in the Cornish granite batholith alone.
What are the Government doing to assess and unlock this untapped geothermal potential?
