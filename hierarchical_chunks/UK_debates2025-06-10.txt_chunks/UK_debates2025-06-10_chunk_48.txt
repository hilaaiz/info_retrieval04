This £14 billion splurge on English nuclear power plants comes on top of £22 billion for English carbon capture and storage, while there is nothing for Scotland’s Acorn project.
With Grangemouth allowed to close and the fiscal regime ruining the north-east’s energy jobs, this latest announcement shows that Scotland is not an afterthought—Scotland is not a thought at all.
If nearly £40 billion can be found for English energy projects, why has money never been found for Scotland’s carbon capture project?
Maybe a change in the SNP’s position is coming.
Absolutely, if the hon.
Lady wants, let us have a discussion about Scottish nuclear power stations.
We are in favour of the Acorn project and will say more about that in the coming weeks.
But on nuclear power, SNP Members have really got to think again.
They are sticking their heads in the sand.
This is about jobs, investment and clean energy.
They should really rethink.
If I had known it was your birthday, Mr Speaker, I would have brought you down a Chorley cake, but never mind.
As you know, my constituency hosts Heysham 1 and 2 nuclear power stations.
As the Secretary of State is aware, I am pushing for Heysham also to host new nuclear.
Will he tell me how today’s announcement supports nuclear communities such as mine and will enable the next generation of nuclear across the country?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right.
To get slightly into the weeds, the new planning framework that we are consulting on opens up possibilities for new nuclear.
Today we have set out the public money that we can commit to new nuclear at this stage.
We are seeing this a bit in the US and in other countries with a 50% increase in nuclear investment last year globally.
My message to the private sector is that if it is interested in partnering with us and saying to us, “We want to build in places other than those where you’ve put the public investment,” we are absolutely open for business and dialogue.
