The Minister may know that we used to have nuclear power in Ayrshire, creating many well-paying jobs.
Does he think we could see small modular reactors at Hunterston, and what does he think of the SNP’s abject failure to bring nuclear to Scotland, even though it has planned for an independent Scotland to rely on English nuclear?
The SNP’s is an anti-jobs, anti-investment and anti-clean energy position, and SNP Members should be ashamed of themselves.
During the last election campaign, the Secretary of State said he would cut energy bills by £300.
Could he set out for families and small businesses in Bridgwater the timescale for fulfilling that promise?
We said we would cut energy bills by up to £300 by 2030, and that remains our commitment.
Penn-bloodh lowen, Mr Speaker.
