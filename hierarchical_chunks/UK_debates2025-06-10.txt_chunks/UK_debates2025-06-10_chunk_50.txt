The Secretary of State’s message to the private sector is, “If you want to build new nuclear, Britain is open.”
Companies have told me that they need decisive and committed leadership from the UK Government to be confident to invest in a new project at Wylfa.
I have raised that 11 times in the  Chamber, yet today there was no mention of Wylfa.
Will the Secretary of State make it clear that the UK Government support the delivery of new nuclear projects at Wylfa?
Yes, we do.
Again, we are open to discussions with the hon.
Lady and other colleagues.
I will not say “happy birthday” to you again, Mr Speaker; perhaps we can arrange to sing it next time so that we do not all have to repeat it.
