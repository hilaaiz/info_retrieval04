I hear that it is your birthday, Mr Speaker.
Congratulations!
The UK Government have announced £14 billion for new, extremely expensive nuclear energy projects, while crucial shovel-ready green developments in Scotland are receiving nothing at all.
Both Cruachan 2 and the Acorn project are awaiting the Minister’s approval to create new green jobs in Scotland.
When will that money be made available?
When we hear the SNP opposing jobs, it seems sad for the people of Scotland.
We are supporting jobs up and down Scotland.
The hon.
Gentleman does not have long to wait to hear about Acorn, because the spending review will be published later this week.
