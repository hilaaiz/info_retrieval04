The Secretary of State’s statement is welcome.
The other welcome news today is the Government’s commitment to £460 million of investment at Sheffield Forgemasters.
That is primarily for defence nuclear, but it also provides extra capacity for civil nuclear.
There is a bit of concern about Rolls-Royce’s link with Czechia, so will my right hon.
Friend commit to using forgings from Sheffield Forgemasters in the first-of-its-type SMR in this country and build the supply chain so that the vast majority of jobs are provided for British workers?
I definitely believe that Sheffield Forgemasters has an incredibly important role to play in our civil nuclear programme.
Contractual details for Rolls-Royce and our discussions with the company are for a bit down the road, but in my view, Forgemasters is central to our plans.
