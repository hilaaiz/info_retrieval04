We are working with Ofgem to put in place a debt support scheme to deal with the huge rise in energy debt that we saw during the energy crisis, which the Conservatives failed to deal with.
That will provide much-needed support, whether through debt write-offs or debt repayment plans.
It will mean that households that cannot afford their energy bills, are struggling, and will never pay that debt are provided with support.
Happy birthday to you, Mr Speaker.
The Government are targeting measures based on people’s income, but will they look at the issue of rural homes?
Many thousands of people live in poorly insulated homes in isolated areas; families there are left in the cold in the winter.
We know there are parts of the country where homes are not up to standard and families are struggling with bills.
That is why our warm homes plan is so important.
We will target homes across the country and ensure that we provide a range of measures, from insulation through to solar and heat pumps, so we can ensure that homes are warmer and cheaper to run.
Happy birthday, Mr Speaker!
Like me, you don’t count the years; you make the years count.
You are doing very well at that.
