I, too, wish you a happy birthday, Mr Speaker.
I very much welcome the statement, which is about the future-visioning and future-proofing of our energy security and production.
I particularly welcome the £2.5 billion investment in fusion, including for the STEP—spherical tomahawk for energy production —programme at West Burton in north Nottinghamshire.
I thank Ministers for their work to secure that, which is very welcome indeed.
The process has already started, with the tender outcomes for the construction and the design and technology to be announced later this year.
I am championing British companies, which are very much part of that process.
I am excited about the thousands of jobs and skills in new infrastructure that will be developed because of this programme.
The work has already started on the skills partnership, which is stretching right across regions including the east midlands, Lincolnshire and South Yorkshire.
That partnership is working with our further education colleges, our universities and the advanced manufacturing centre in Rotherham.
Does the Secretary of State agree that left-behind, red wall areas such as mine are where we need investment to revise our energy production and our industry?
This is where we start, and I want to see more.
