I warmly congratulate my right hon.
Friend on delivering on his promise from 2009 and confirming Sizewell C, along with the vast array of commitments to a bright nuclear future for this country.
The Select Committee looks forward to our inquiry in the autumn into the future of nuclear; we will be taking evidence and making recommendations to support the work that the Secretary of State has set out.
We visited Sizewell C, and I also visited the nuclear physics department at the University of Liverpool.
I learned in both cases about the jobs that will be available across the country.
Can the Secretary of State confirm that he sees this as the start of both gigawatt construction of new nuclear and a big expansion into SMRs and AMRs, which are still a nascent technology, to support a very good future for nuclear generation in this country?
My hon.
Friend speaks very well on this subject.
I agree with him about the huge jobs potential from new nuclear and the timelines.
My priority when we came into office was to get these things over the line, because there had been so many promises made by the last Government.
Long-term promises were made under Boris Johnson for 2050, but they did not deliver anything towards the 24 GW target.
My priority was to get on and deliver these things and get them over the line, which we are doing.
Then we can look at what the energy needs are going forward and how we meet them.
I agree with my hon.
Friend that nuclear has an essential part to play, alongside all the other clean energy technologies; electricity demand is going to double by 2050, so we need all of them.
