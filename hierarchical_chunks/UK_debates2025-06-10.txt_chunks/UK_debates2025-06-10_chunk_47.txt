I thank my right hon.
Friend for her incredible advocacy on this issue, including at the AMRC.
She makes such an important point: this will be taxpayers’ money, and we need to ensure that as much as possible is built in Britain.
I make absolutely no apologies for saying that.
The answer to her question is that as we negotiate terms with Rolls-Royce over the coming months, that will be a key part of our discussions.
