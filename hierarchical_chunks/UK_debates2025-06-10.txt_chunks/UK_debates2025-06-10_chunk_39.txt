We welcome the Government’s renewed focus on energy security through nuclear power as part of the energy mix.
It is long overdue, after years of dither and delay from successive Conservative Governments.
It has been 16 years since Sizewell C was first announced in 2009, and now, seven Prime Ministers later, we are finally seeing real movement.
That is not a success story but a warning.
Short-term thinking, poor delivery and exorbitant costs— Are you quoting Nick Clegg?
Will the hon.
Member let me continue?
Order.
I will decide when things are out of order.
I do not need any help.
I want you to get the question finished quickly, so come on.
I cannot help but wonder whether the Secretary of State imagined when he stood at his Dispatch Box back in 2009 that he would be back in 2025 still announcing funding for the same project.
We support investment in clean, home-grown energy.
Small modular nuclear reactors have real potential to reduce our dependence on foreign gas—from tyrants like Putin—and help bring down bills, so we welcome the Government’s backing of the nascent technology of small modular reactors and their choice of Rolls-Royce, which is recognised as a first mover across all of Europe.
That is where the focus should be—not on large-scale projects like Sizewell C that cost billions, take decades and so often go over budget.
We have to ensure that this does not land consumers with higher energy bills.
That risk is very real.
The Government must be transparent about how this will be paid for, because families cannot afford another hit to their household budgets.
The Liberal Democrats believe that the best way to cut bills, create good jobs and boost energy security is to invest in home-grown renewables such as solar, wind, tidal and geothermal, and to upgrade our national grid to deliver that clean power.
We look forward to seeing more detail on the long-overdue reform of the outdated first come, first served grid connection system, which is holding back renewable energy projects and could even delay the roll-out of new SMRs.
Today’s announcement is a step in the right direction, but the real test is in the delivery of cheaper bills, stronger energy security and a modern energy grid fit for the future.
