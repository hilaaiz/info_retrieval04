I welcome the Minister’s answer.
She has in the past been keen to ensure that Northern Ireland does not lose out on schemes.
Yesterday, the decision on the winter fuel payment was announced to the House, which we all welcome.
The Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions,  the hon.
Member for Swansea West (Torsten Bell) , was clear that the legislation starts here, but help for Northern Ireland will come from here as well.
Will there be the same help for those in Northern Ireland, who need it as much as people here?
