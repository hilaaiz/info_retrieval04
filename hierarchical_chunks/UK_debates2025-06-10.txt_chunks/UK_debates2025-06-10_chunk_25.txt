In the dim and distant past, in 2023, the Secretary of State described the Rosebank oilfield as “a colossal waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism”.
Does he still agree with that?
As with any application, there is a process that my Department will go through.
We will look at any application in a fair and objective way.
I forgot to say this earlier, Mr Speaker: a very happy birthday from me and my constituents.
I commend the Secretary of State for seeing the need to reform our energy sector, given that people across north Wales are currently paying some of the highest energy bills in the country.
Will he assure me that any proposed alternative to the current energy model will not put any one nation or region at a relative disadvantage?
We are developing proposals that will minimise costs and ensure a fair outcome for consumers throughout the country.
