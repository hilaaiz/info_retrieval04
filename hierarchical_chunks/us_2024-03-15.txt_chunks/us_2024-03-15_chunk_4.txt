Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, the Isle of Eight Flags, Fernandina Beach, Florida is home to many great things, whether it be the beaches, parks, or our pirate legacy; now we are also home to a wrestling state champion.
I rise today to celebrate Enzo Gamba, a Fernandina Beach High School Pirate from my hometown of Fernandina Beach who recently won the Florida High School Athletic Association wrestling championships.
Enzo, just like the Fernandina Beach pirates of old, went for the treasure and brought home gold.
Competing in Class 1A at the 157-pound division, Enzo won the final by decision, 8-4.
Not only did this victory win him a state championship, but it also capped off an undefeated season for Enzo.
Fifty-four matches, Fifty-four victories.
Enzo was phenomenal all season long and winning the state championship firmly lands him on the map as one of the all-time great Pirate athletes.
We are exceptionally proud of this young man.
The Pirates team, led by Coach Eric Kubatzke, brought home four individual state medals in total at the wrestling championships.
All of Fernandina Beach High School, under the leadership of Principal Chris Webber, played a role in this success.
