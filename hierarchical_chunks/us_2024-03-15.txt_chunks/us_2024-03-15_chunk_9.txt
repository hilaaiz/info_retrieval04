Mr. CASTRO.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the life and legacy of Mary Esther Rodriguez, who passed away on Sunday, March 10, 2024 in the town of Losoya, Texas.
Mary Esther Rodriguez was born October 4, 1944 in San Antonio, Texas.
The oldest of ten children, she was a devoted wife, mother and community servant who enjoyed volunteering her time to help those in need.
As a young woman right out of high school she began working as a nurse's aide at the San Antonio State Hospital and later focused her energy as a Home Health Aide for the sick and elderly.
A woman of deep faith she began teaching religious education at 19 years of age and eventually became the Director of Religious Education at El Carmen Catholic Church in Losoya.
She was moved to instill and strengthen the role of faith in the lives of children in the same manner that faith guided her life.
An active member of The Ladies of Charity of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, she lived by their motto ``to serve rather than be served, in humility, simplicity and charity.''
As a member she visited parishioners in nursing homes and the homebound, offering assistance to the poor in the community.
She helped run their community service programs including the thrift store and wellness center.
She leaves behind her husband, Ramon Rodriguez, a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, whom she shared a life of love, joy and many blessings over more than 57 years.
She will be remembered by her daughters Rosalinda and Elizabeth, her sons-in-law Henry Macias and Estuardo Rodriguez and her most treasured grandchildren, Maria Isabella, Valencia Lael, Nicolas, Fidel, Abram, and Emilio.
She will forever remain the heart of the Rodriguez family and serve as an unyielding call to charity and service for those she leaves behind.
