Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance on a decade of uplifting and supporting Tri-Valley nonprofit organizations, as they celebrated their ten-year anniversary on Thursday, March 14, 2024.
Founded in Livermore 2014 by Kathy Young and Mony Nop, the Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance has fostered support for its growing network of over 300 community-based nonprofit organizations through education, collaboration, and financial support.
The Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance offers educational workshops, industry-related seminars, workforce development programming, and access to a supportive professional network through their monthly meetings and networking events.
To date, the Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance has offered over 100 educational workshops specifically for nonprofit organizations.
The Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance provides financial support through its Tri-Valley Nonprofit Fund, which has given over $380,000 in grants to more than 40 nonprofits.
This financial support is crucial to help organizations carry out diverse programs to help those in need.
In June 2022, the Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance opened the CommonPoint Nonprofit Center in Downtown Livermore, offering physical workspaces and offices for over 20 growing organizations and consultants.
The Anti-Poverty Collaborative is another Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance-led initiative, and yet another example of their innovative thinking and solutions.
It seeks to eradicate poverty by bringing together leaders from nonprofit organizations, faith organizations, and elected officials to create innovative policies and solutions to create systems-level change.
With mindful guidance and leadership, Tri-Valley Nonprofit Alliance has become a force for good in my district.
They have fostered a safe space for nonprofits, big and small, to collaborate and grow.
I appreciate their work and wish them many more years of success.
