Mr. PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent who has dedicated decades of service to our community through his commitment to the Boys & Girls Club of Clifton, 
Mr. Robert Foster.
For forty-seven years, Robert played an integral role, shaping the lives of countless young people in our district.
``
Mr. Bob'', as he is affectionately referred to, announced his retirement in December of 2023 after serving as Executive Director for seventeen years.
The Boys and Girls Club of Clifton is right to honor his legacy at their Annual Great Futures Gala.
