I thank the hon.
Gentleman for that question.
The Equality Act 2010, which was brought in by a Labour Government, is absolutely clear on the provision of women-only spaces and that they are to be  protected, especially where they are needed.
We are proud to have brought in the Act and we stand by it.
I am sure he would have wanted to say in his question that the Labour party has done more to support women— to close the gender gap, to reduce inequalities, and to tackle violence against women and girls—than perhaps his party or the Conservative party.
