Since the Labour Government came to power, the list of patients waiting more than 65 weeks for treatment at my local hospital trust in Derby has gone down by a  whopping 82%.
With national waiting lists having fallen for four months in a row and the early delivery of the commitment to provide an additional 2 million NHS appointments, does the Minister agree that our plan for change is already under way?
How is the Department working to embed that culture of delivery right across the Government?
I am delighted to hear about the falling waiting lists in my hon.
Friend’s constituency.
Waiting lists are indeed falling.
Last month we announced that we had met our first step pledge to deliver 2 million additional NHS appointments seven months early.
We are determined to keep up the pace of delivering our plan for change, for which the public voted.
