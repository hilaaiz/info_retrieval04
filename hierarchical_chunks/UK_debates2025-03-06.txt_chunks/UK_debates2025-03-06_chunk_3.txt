The Minister for the Cabinet Office was asked— What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the emergency alert system.
What assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the emergency alert system.
The emergency alert system is a vital tool for warning and informing in a case of a serious incident where there is a threat to life.
This Government have used the tool five times, including the largest ever deployment for Storm Éowyn.
We are incorporating the lessons identified, including on improved targeting, into alert mechanisms.
A secret phone can be a lifeline for survivors of domestic abuse.
Can the Minister tell the House what steps the Government are taking to ensure that when emergency alerts are sent, survivors of domestic abuse are not put in any additional danger?
My hon.
Friend makes an incredibly important point.
The whole purpose of the emergency alert is to make people safer, so we are mindful of the potential risks to people with secret phones, such as victims of domestic abuse.
We are continuing to work with domestic abuse charities and organisations that support victims to mitigate the risk, including by producing guidance on disabling emergency alerts.
The threat of flooding is ever present in Carlisle, and although I and other local residents regularly receive flood alerts, they do not necessarily distinguish between a threat to life and a regular flood alert.
Could the Minister please explain at what point flood alerts are updated to reflect the seriousness of an emergency alert?
My hon.
Friend is right to raise this issue.
The Environment Agency is responsible for issuing flood warnings.
For locations covered by severe flood warnings, the Environment Agency may ask for an emergency alert to be activated where there is an immediate threat to life, in order to support the response in the local area.
