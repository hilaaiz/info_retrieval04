The hon.
Member has raised the issue of community pharmacies with me on a number of occasions, and rightly so.
They are a vital part of our national health service, and they have been left on their knees, with many closing in recent years.
We are turning that around, because getting services back into communities via pharmacies and other means is critical to delivering our health mission.
I will ensure she gets a reply.
This is on flooding again, I am afraid.
My constituency has suffered greatly from flooding in recent years.
Our steep valleys and wide moorland catchments make us particularly vulnerable.
I massively welcome the Government’s commitment to a record £2.65 billion of funding for flood defences.
We have a number of key schemes in Rossendale and Darwen that urgently need that funding, and I am in communication with the Department about that.
Will the Leader of the House agree to a debate in Government time on flood resilience and support for communities affected so badly by flooding?
My hon.
Friend is a great advocate for his constituency on this and other matters.
Flooding affects his area, as it does many others.
As I have said, this Government are finally turning the oil tanker around when it comes to our flood resilience.
I will ensure that the relevant Minister hears his call today.
We have had regular statements and debates on flooding, but I will ensure that we continue to have them.
