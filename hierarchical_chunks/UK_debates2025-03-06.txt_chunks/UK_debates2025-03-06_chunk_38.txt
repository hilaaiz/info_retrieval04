I thank the hon.
Gentleman for organising the estimates days this week, and all the other debates.
I am sure he will appreciate that I have been generous, much more than my predecessors on some occasions, in giving him notice both of estimates debates and of slots for Backbench Business.
I have heard his plea today for as many of those as possible, and I will look kindly on it, as I have done previously.
