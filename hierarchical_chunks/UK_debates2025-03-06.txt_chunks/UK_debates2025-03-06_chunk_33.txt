As the Leader of the House has already noted, today is World Book Day, and I would like to say a big thank you to Barnes Farm primary school in my constituency for inviting me in yesterday to open its brand new library.
One in seven state primary schools in the UK do not have a dedicated library or reading space, and almost 1 million children in the UK do not have a book of their own.
As such, it was wonderful to meet year 5 students and representatives of Barnes Farm student council, who were very enthusiastic about their new library.
It is fantastic to know that those students will have access to such a facility for a long time to come.
At Prime Minister’s questions on  8 January , I raised the plight of community pharmacies.
They are struggling to stay afloat due to the unfair terms of their NHS contracts, which often mean that they have to buy drugs that they dispense for more than the NHS reimburses them.
The Prime Minister asked me to follow up with more details, which I did that afternoon.
Despite chasing, I am yet to receive a reply from the Department of Health and Social Care, to which my inquiry was passed.
Community pharmacies cannot wait.
The National Pharmacy Association projects that nearly 1,000 pharmacies will close by the end of 2027.
There is no guaranteed funding for Pharmacy First beyond the end of this month.
This is a critical issue that the Government need to address urgently.
I know that the Leader of the House takes seriously the timeliness of replies from Ministers and Departments, so will she let the House know what further steps she is taking to ensure that issues such as protecting our vital community pharmacies are given the swift and full attention they deserve?
