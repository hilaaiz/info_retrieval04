I thank the hon.
Member for that important question.
She is absolutely right to highlight the barriers to politics that women in rural areas can face.
We want more women in rural areas and around the country to be elected to local government and to Parliament.
We should be proud that this House now has its highest ever number of elected women, including many outstanding women representing rural areas, but we know that there is much more we can do.
