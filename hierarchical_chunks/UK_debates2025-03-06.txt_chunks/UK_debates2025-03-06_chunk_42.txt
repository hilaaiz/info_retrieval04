I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the case of Jagtar Singh Johal, which I know is of great importance to many Members of this House.
We recognise that it is a very difficult case.
He will know that the Prime Minister has raised it with Prime Minister Modi, and Ministers continue to raise it on an ongoing basis, making it clear that we want to see faster progress and a full resolution to this case.
As part of that, we must see a full and independent investigation into allegations of torture.
I will ensure that my hon.
Friend and the House are kept updated on this important case.
