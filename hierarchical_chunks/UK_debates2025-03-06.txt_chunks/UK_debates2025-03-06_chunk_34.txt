I thank the hon.
Member for raising these matters with me.
First, I concur with what she says on World Book Day and school libraries.
I am sure that, as Members of Parliament, we have opened a library in a school.
I recently opened a library at a  school in one of the poorest parts of my constituency, and the young children, many of whom were not even wearing proper footwear, were queuing outside to get their hands on their first book—it was such a fantastic achievement.
I am sorry to hear that she has not had the responses and replies she has asked for from Ministers, and I do take these matters incredibly seriously.
I will ensure that she does get a reply.
