I thank the shadow Leader of the House for his comments on Ukraine.
It has been really important to this country’s international role and in supporting the Prime Minister that the House of Commons has once again shown such unity, and such backing for Ukraine and for the Prime Minister’s leadership in recent weeks.
As the shadow Leader of the House knows, we are focused on making sure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position to achieve long-term, lasting peace through strength.
As we have done in recent weeks, we will make sure that the House is kept constantly updated on these matters.
