I thank the Minister for that answer.
I was proud to vote for the £22.6 billion increase in NHS spending, which means that we are getting 2 million more appointments seven months early and that waiting lists are coming down.
Of course, there is still a long way to go and the British public deserve to know that every penny of that extra investment is being spent as efficiently as possible.
Will the Minister update the House on what the Government’s plans are to reform the NHS to ensure that every single penny is spent wisely?
