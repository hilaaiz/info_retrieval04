ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, is required as a Chinese company to have an in-house Chinese Communist party committee.
We all know that attacks from China on our national infrastructure as well as on our cyber-networks are becoming increasingly common, and it is clear that elements of the Chinese Government are behind them.
Yet, astonishingly, the Government are still failing to fully declare ministerial meetings with TikTok representatives.
Will the Minister ensure that meetings with TikTok executives are declared by Government Ministers alongside other senior media executive registrations, given TikTok’s huge presence in the media space, the massive public influence it has and the known cyber-risks posed by this Chinese platform?
There is a well-established process for transparency about meetings between Government Ministers and outside organisations, and TikTok will be treated in the same way as anyone else.
