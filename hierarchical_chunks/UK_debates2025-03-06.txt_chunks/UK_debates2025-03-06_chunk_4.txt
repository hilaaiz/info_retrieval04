I thank the Minister for her response.
It is good that we have this system right across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and that all our constituents can respond to it.
It has a very clear role.
First, how quickly can there be a response to things such as domestic abuse, flood warnings or whatever?
Secondly, my understanding is that councils have a role to play.
If so, perhaps the Minister could remind us of their role.
