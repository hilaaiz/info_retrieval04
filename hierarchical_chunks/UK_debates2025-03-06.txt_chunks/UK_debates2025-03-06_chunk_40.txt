I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this serious matter.
I recognise the concern about the loan charge scheme, as do the Government, and we are committed to ensuring that there is a fair resolution for those affected.
We do not believe it is right for them to face years of uncertainty, which is why, as my hon.
Friend said, we have established an independent review.
It is tightly focused so that we can get the report out before the summer, with a Government response, and I will ensure that the House is kept fully up to date on that.
