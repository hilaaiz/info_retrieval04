I welcome the Minister’s progress in this area.
I visited IBCA on  30 January  and was impressed by the professionalism of the team.
Since then the Minister has made himself accessible so that I can give him feedback.
One issue that has come up is the need for recipients of payments to sign non-disclosure agreements or terms.
I am anxious that misunderstandings do not arise as a consequence of that.
Can the Minister  use his good offices to implore IBCA to explain why that happens?
If IBCA cannot do that, perhaps he can explain to the House why such agreements might be necessary.
