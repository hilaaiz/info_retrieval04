What steps his Department is taking to help ensure the resilience of local government digital infrastructure against cyber-attacks.
The Government are working hard to improve the cyber resilience of the public sector, because cyber-attacks can be against central Government institutions, local authorities and, of course, individuals and businesses.
With regard to local authorities, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has launched a cyber assessment framework for local government.
It sets a clear cyber-security standard for the sector, and the Department also provides monthly cyber clinics to support local authorities in improving collaboration, sharing intelligence and tackling vulnerabilities in this area.
Local councils manage mountains of sensitive data, deliver essential services and lead on emergency responses to critical incidents, among much more, yet 15 years of Tory underfunding has left outdated digital infrastructure, leaving them particularly vulnerable to cyber-attack.
Does the Minister agree that improving cyber resilience in local authorities is of paramount importance if we are to protect our citizens’ data and continue to deliver essential services without interruption from hostile actors?
My hon.
Friend is absolutely right: not all the systems used across central or local government are as up to date as they should be.
This is a constant battle and a constant challenge.
It is really important that we put every effort into ensuring that we are as well protected as possible against hostile acts from both state and non-state actors.
