I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this critical issue.
The Employment Rights Bill will introduce new measures that will give staff and their chosen trade union a meaningful shot at gaining statutory recognition.
I hope those provisions will ensure that GMB Union members across the country can have their voices heard in their workplaces.
