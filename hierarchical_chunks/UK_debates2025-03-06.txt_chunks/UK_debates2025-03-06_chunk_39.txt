I am very sorry to hear about what sounded like a serious attack on a visitor to this country from the Indian Parliament.
That is unacceptable and not the way in which we want our visitors to be treated, and I will ensure that the hon.
Gentleman receives a full response from the Home Secretary.
May I first wish the Leader of the House a happy International Women’s Day for Saturday?
My constituent Chris is among many people affected by the loan charge, which applies to “disguised remuneration” schemes.
While everyone should pay their fair share of tax, many, like Chris, used these schemes in good faith when they were legal and now face retrospective penalties.
The Government’s long-awaited review is a welcome step, but Chris and many others who have been affected feel that its scope is too limited.
They believe that it fails to examine how we got here, its implementation, or those who promoted and mis-sold these schemes.
Will the Leader of the House allocate time for a full debate on the loan charge and its consequences?
