Friend is right in what she says.
Those of us who are opposed to the death penalty, for example, are against it because we do not believe in the infallibility of the state.
The state can get things wrong; professionals can get things wrong—and when they do, there should be a proven, clear path as to how that wrongdoing can be identified, to try to ensure that it does not occur again.
