rose— Given what you have said, Mr Speaker, I will make some progress.
[Interruption.]
A lot of Members wish to speak today.
I now turn to new clause 14 and amendment 73.
The new clause imposes a duty to make regulations prohibiting advertising of services related to voluntary assisted dying.
This issue was discussed in Committee, following an amendment tabled by  the hon.
Member for West Worcestershire (Dame Harriett Baldwin) .
It was proposed that there should be no advertising of assisted dying services.
I agree, and there was a consensus on that in the Committee.
There were some issues with the previous amendment’s workability, so I gave a commitment to return to the matter on Report—hence the inclusion of this new clause.
Amendment 73 provides that regulations under new clause 14 would be subject to the affirmative procedure, providing parliamentary oversight.
On the evidential basis, on page 15 of today’s edition of The Times there is a story about a gentleman who was born in South Africa and lives in Australia.
He has come to London this week for this particular Bill in order to give his story.
He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had only two weeks to live: he lived for three years and one month, and he is still living.
There is a growing evidential basis.
He said that he was never afraid to die, but he says that he is afraid of the process of dying, and the hon.
Lady is the initiator of that.
Will she acknowledge the evidential basis and the importance of this subject?
Does she realise that the evidential basis against this Bill is growing?
