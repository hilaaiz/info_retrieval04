Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Demetrius West and The Jesus Promoters Gospel Choir on their 20th anniversary.
Demetrius was influenced by his great-grandmother and discovered his passion for gospel music at an early age.
As an internationallyrenowned recording artist, he has shared the stage with notable Gospel and Christian artists such as Marvin Sapp, Byron Cage, Kirk Franklin, and Chris Tomlin.
His work made the Billboard Music Charts several times and has held several No. 1 hits on Gospel airplay radio charts.
In 2015, Demetrius released the album ``Jesus Promoter'' in 2015 featuring award-winning Earnest Pugh and 40-voice choir, The Jesus Promoters.
An Indianapolis native, Demetrius has a deep-rooted sense of community, exemplified by his support to the Resource Hub Foundation, Westside Baptist Church, and other local organizations aiding families in need.
He is additionally involved in local politics and elections, and as Minister of Music and Arts for the Westside Missionary Baptist Church with Pastor Michael O. Bryant.
He has assisted many choirs, groups, soloists, and musicians with his knowledge and love of music by conducting workshops and seminars nationwide to help other ministries perfect their talents.
Music helps us translate joy, sorrow, and faith.
Demetrius West and The Jesus Promoters is a voice that resonates across generations and will continue to play a role in the cultural fabric of our community.
Demetrius is married to the lovely Shalette West, and they have one beautiful daughter, Zanobia Denise.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Demetrius West and The Jesus Promoters Gospel Choir on their 20-year celebration.
