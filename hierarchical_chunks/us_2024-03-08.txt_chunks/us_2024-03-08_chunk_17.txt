Mr. PHILLIPS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Karen Hosler, a distinguished Baltimore Sun correspondent whose beats included Congress and the White House.
Karen died on February 1 of this year, and it is an understatement to say that Karen lived life to its absolute fullest during her 75 years on this earth.
Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet Karen, but I wish that I had.
Those that worked with and knew her said, ``Karen always brightened up a room with her cheerfulness, her wonderful laughter, her joy for life and her deep commitment to first-rate journalism done the right way...
She loved reporting on politics, be it Annapolis city government, the governor and General Assembly or the White House and Congress.
