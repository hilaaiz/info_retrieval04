Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the life and legacy of a remarkable man, 
Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Wirth.
Bob was born on October 2, 1932, and grew up in Shiocton before his family moved to their family farm in Hortonville.
Beginning in high school, Bob was involved in many extra-curricular activities such as football and basketball.
Bob demonstrated incredible leadership and talent resulting in him being named team captain for both football and basketball.
Following high school, Bob was drafted into the Army and served at Fort Lewis in Tacoma.
Washington.
I commend Bob for his service and dedication to the United States.
On March 2, 1957, Bob married the love of his life, Marlene Rollmann.
Throughout their life together, they enjoyed years of happiness and welcomed five children:
Barb, Kelli, John, Mark, and Ricky.
Bob was so proud of each of these children and was thrilled as their family grew.
Family was always of utmost importance to Bob, and he was blessed to have 15 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
When Bob wasn't spending time with his growing family, he enjoyed many hobbies.
Bob cherished each opportunity to join family and friends exploring the outdoors.
He especially loved their annual deer hunts and snowmobiling trips.
Bob's kindness and friendship will be missed by many that were blessed to know him.
