Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding New Yorker, Attica Fire Department Member, Jay Myers, for his 50 years of service to the community of Attica and the Attica Fire Department.
On Saturday, March 9, 2024, members past and present from the Attica Fire Department will gather to honor him for his service.
Jay Myers was born and raised in the Town of Attica in Wyoming County, New York and began his service as a volunteer in 1973 with the Attica Fire Department.
Throughout his years with the Attica Fire Department, he has responded to countless numbers of ambulance and fire responses.
His excellent service has earned him the title of Fire Chief along with numerous other positions within the department.
Jay's call to service did not stop at the Attica Fire Department, he served for 41 years as a 911 dispatch operator for Wyoming County before his retirement.
Along with his passion for the fire department, Jay enjoys traveling in his spare time.
I thank Jay Myers for his incredible volunteer service providing protection to local homeowners, farmers, businesses, and schools in Wyoming County, New York.
His many years of dedication have made the community a better place to live, and I wish him all the best in his many more years serving in the Attica Fire Department.
