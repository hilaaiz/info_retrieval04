Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Texas College in Tyler, Texas commemorating its 130th anniversary.
Founded in 1894, Texas College was formed by ministers of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to educate African-American students excluded from the university system of Texas at the time.
Since its eventual charter in 1907, Texas College has aimed to form the next generation in theology, music, teaching and commercial training as well as agricultural and mechanical sciences.
Today, Texas College inspires intellectual, spiritual, moral, and social development, empowering graduates to engage in life-long learning, leadership, and service.
For generations, the college has formed upright, intelligent citizens who honor God through their knowledge, work, and families.
I am proud to see the many accomplishments that Texas College has made since its inception.
I am equally grateful to have Texas College as an integral part of the Tyler community and broader East Texas region.
I look forward to another 130 years of success from the faculty and staff at Texas College as they celebrate their anniversary this month.
