Mr. COMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Union County High School wrestling team for achieving their 15th state championship and 3 individual state champion titles.
The Union County wrestling team has been the gold standard for Kentucky wrestling for nearly two decades and has created a dynasty of success.
In the past 11 seasons, they have achieved 9 state titles.
Their first state championship title was in 1976 and they have continued their winning traditions since.
I am honored to stand with the community of Union County to celebrate another state wrestling championship.
I am proud to recognize this tremendous achievement by the Union County wrestling team as they add another trophy to their case.
