Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school diver in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
Isabella Pfeil, a senior at Avon Lake High School, has ably represented her school on her way to achieving her first Division I State Diving Title.
Isabella overcame the challenges posed by intense competition in her effort to win the Division I One-Meter Dive State Championship.
In pursuing the State Championship, Isabella defeated her opponent in the finals of the one-meter dive classification.
Her hard work and dedication in achieving this accomplishment is truly outstanding.
She has accomplished an impressive season record, bringing pride to her school and community.
