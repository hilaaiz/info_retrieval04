It is always a pleasure to meet my hon.
Friend, who has an office next to mine in the Foreign Office.
May I thank her for her comments about the publication of the White Paper?
The way in which it has been received around the world demonstrates renewed energy and vigour.
I hope that it shows Britain’s reinvigorated leadership on those important matters, and, of course, value for money for our taxpayers.
The White Paper also talks about development diplomats.
How many will be trained and what will be the cost?
How many— Development diplomats—they are in the White Paper.
Yes, the right hon.
Lady is quite right: we are increasing the number of development diplomats—I thought she mentioned something about water, but  I may have misheard.
The point about the White Paper is that it sets out very clearly the aims and aspiration that Britain has to drive forward the sustainable development goals and ensure that we increase climate finance at this critical time.
She will be pleased to have seen that and will note that we are now driving forward that agenda.
What recent discussions he has had with his counterpart in Mauritius on the negotiations on the sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory.
The Foreign Secretary has not yet had a chance to meet his Mauritian counterpart.
However, the Prime Minister met the Mauritian Prime Minister at the G20 in September to assess the state of negotiations.
They welcomed the progress made and agreed to meet again soon.
