I thank the Minister for that reply and for his leadership on the excellent White Paper, particularly because, in the run-up to its publication, he clearly listened to calls for more targeted support and humanitarian relief for those who are left behind on account of their religion or belief.
The challenge now is to turn those innovative commitments into reality, which will require a revised approach to development programming.
Will he meet me and others at a roundtable to discuss that?
