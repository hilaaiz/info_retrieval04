I thank my right hon.
Friend for that answer.
The hostages who have been released report sexual and physical violence committed against them while in captivity.
The Israeli Health Ministry reports that hostages were drugged to make them look happy.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that Hamas are treating hostages in an inhumane fashion, the international Red Cross should be given the opportunity to visit them all, and we should ensure that they are returned home as soon as possible?
