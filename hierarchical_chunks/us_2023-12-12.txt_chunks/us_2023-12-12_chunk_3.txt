the way.
Students like Fidel, who strive to make the most of their education, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Fidel's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Arvada K-8 School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Fidel Flores on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
