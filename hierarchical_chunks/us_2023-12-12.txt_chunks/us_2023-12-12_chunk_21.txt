She was joined in holy matrimony to lsiah Kelly, and together they had ten children.

She instilled in all her children the importance of kindness and the ability to respectfully resolve disagreements with others.
In addition to caring for her own children, Ethel regularly fed other children that frequented her home.
Ethel and Isiah raised all their children to be faithful servants of God.
The Ten Commandments guide Ethel's life, and she believes adhering to them is of principal importance.
