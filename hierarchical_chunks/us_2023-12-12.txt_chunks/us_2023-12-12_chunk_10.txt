Mr. KEATING.
Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote for H.R. 5378--Lower Costs, More Transparency Act.
I have long supported the critical medical and social services that community health centers provide and fully support their funding.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on rollcall No. 708.
