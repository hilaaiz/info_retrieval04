Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Mayor Mark Senter, who is completing his tenure of dedicated service to Plymouth, Indiana at the end of this month.
Currently serving in his fourth term, Mayor Senter has advanced solutions that have made Plymouth a better place to live, work, and raise a family.
In particular, Mark can and should be proud of his work in helping create downtown Plymouth's River Park Square, which hosts the popular ``Mayor's Month of Music'' event every August.
Prior to becoming Mayor, Mark served as a trooper and detective with the Indiana State Police for 28 years.
Mark's service on the thin blue line has given him valuable firsthand knowledge of the public safety issues our communities face as well as the brave sacrifices law enforcement officers make in the line of duty every single day.
As he prepares to step down as Mayor, spend more time with his family, and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to congratulate Mark on a distinguished career and a job well done.
The Plymouth community and all of Marshall County is unquestionably better off thanks to this good man with a servant's heart.
I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our gratitude to Mayor Mark Senter for his service and in wishing him, his wife Leanne, and their family all the very best going forward.
