Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and commend Karen Cleveland on an inspired career in community service.
Earlier this year, Karen announced she would be transitioning from her role as President & CEO of Leadership Fairfax (LFI), which is Northern Virginia's premier leadership development organization.
Karen has become a pillar of our community during her eight-year tenure with LFI, so I am pleased to report this is not so much a retirement as a turning of the page to her next chapter.
I've had the pleasure of knowing and collaborating with Karen for the past three decades, starting with my service on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors.
Since 1988, LFI has dedicated itself to shaping the future leaders of tomorrow.
The dedication of LFI to this endeavor is one that I know well; a number of my staff from my time as Providence District Supervisor and later as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors are LFI alumni.
I know firsthand the value that LFI adds to both the graduates and the organizations to which they return.
When you walk into a crowded room it's easy to spot the graduates of LFI--they just stand out!
Karen has been an invaluable resource to leaders in both the public and private sectors, serving as a facilitator, mentor, partner, and friend to us through her work on multiple community initiatives.
In addition to her role with LFI, Karen has made important contributions to our community as the first executive director of the Greater Reston Chamber of Commerce, inaugural chair of the Reston YMCA Board of Directors, and executive director of Habitat for Humanity of Northern Virginia.
She also previously served on the Wolf Trap Foundation Board of Directors, supporting the only national park dedicated to presenting the performing art.
On behalf of our grateful community, I wish Karen, her husband, Jim, and their family all the best as she embarks on her next chapter.
