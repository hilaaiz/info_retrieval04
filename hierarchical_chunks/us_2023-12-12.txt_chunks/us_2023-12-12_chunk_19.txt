Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Staff Sergeant Willie A. Curtis, U.S. Army, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His excellent service to both the Army and his local community is a shining example of citizenship and commitment to duty.
During SSG Curtis's 20+ years of service to the United States Army, he went above and beyond to serve his country.
Due to his extensive period serving our country, he earned many awards such as the Army Commendation Medal, an Army Achievement Medal, and a National Defense Service Medal, among other medals, decorations, and badges.
Upon retirement, SSG Curtis settled in Taylor, Texas.
An eternal optimist, he has an enormous heart and an endless capacity to contribute his time, energy, and resources to assist local students, the homeless, and first responders.
Whether it's organizing public music events or celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., SSG Curtis is renowned as a man unafraid to do the hard work to do good for his neighbors.
When I reflect on SSG Curtis' life of service over the years, I am reminded of the teachings of Christ when he taught, ``Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.''
To SSG Curtis, these are not mere words but a summons by which to live a fulfilling life.
He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
