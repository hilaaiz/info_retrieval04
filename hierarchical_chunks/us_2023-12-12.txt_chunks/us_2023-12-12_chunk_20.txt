Mr. McHENRY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize B. Dan Berger as he prepares to step down from his role at the President/CEO of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU) at the end of the year.
Dan first joined NAFCU in 2006 and helped the association become a strong advocate for credit unions in Washington.
I have had the pleasure of working with Dan on several issues before the Financial Services Committee during that time.
Dan became the President/CEO of NAFCU in 2013.
In a decade under his leadership.
NAFCU has grown its membership by nearly 50 percent, while increasing assets and revenue.
His final act for NAFCU will be leading it into a merger with the Credit Union National Association (CUNA) to create a new voice for credit unions--America's Credit Unions.
Dan earned a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from The Florida State University.
He is a member of The Economic Club of Washington, DC, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100, and was an adjunct professor at The George Washington University in the communications department.
He also serves as Vice Chair of the conservation group Bonefish and Tarpon Trust and formerly served as Chair.
I know the credit union community will miss Dan as he heads back to Florida to spend more time with his wife Aimee and daughter Shelby.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dan Berger and wishing him the best of luck with whatever comes next.
