Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Henry Thompson for earning the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
Henry has achieved great things, all while overcoming adversity and challenges along the way.
Students like Henry, who strive to make the most of their education, develop crucial skills and a work ethic that will guide them for the rest of their lives.
This award is a testament to Henry's hard work, determination, and perseverance at Three Creeks K-8 School and is clearly just the beginning of a bright and promising future.
It is my honor to congratulate Henry Thompson on achieving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth Award.
