The Minister mentions sexual offences, but it frustrates me beyond belief that my constituents have to wait on average 839 days for their cases to be heard.
Is the distress caused taken into account, or is the system too broken?
The hon.
Gentleman is absolutely right to raise the issue of victims of serious sexual offences.
We take that incredibly seriously, and that is why we have introduced measures such as section 28, which enables evidence to be taken and recorded in advance.
We have increased the fees for barristers to make that more straightforward.
We have also increased the number of independent sexual violence advisers, who accompany, as it were, those victims on that journey.
That is very important to prevent dropout rates.
This is an important point: the sentencing levels are much higher—up by 30% compared with 2010.
I draw the attention of the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests in that my wife is an education lawyer.
Parents appealing decisions in relation to education, health and care plans and health needs are forced to wait between nine months and 13 months from appeal registration to hearing.
That is far too long in terms of a child’s development.
Does my hon.
Friend agree with that?
Does he also share my concern that some schools are delaying providing education, health and care plans in the knowledge that it will take a year or more to have an appeal?
My right hon.
Friend is right.
Despite special educational needs and disabilities appeals and disposals being up by 24% and 29% respectively, I do share his concerns, and systematic reform is required.
That is why through the SEND and alternative provision improvement plan, the Department for Education and ourselves will be working hard to ensure that it is improved.
I am more than happy to meet my right hon.
Friend to go through the details.
