I thank the shadow Secretary of State for bringing this debate forward.
The stats from the British Dental Association cannot be ignored.
In its survey, 41% of practice owners and 38% of associate dentists said that they would like to leave NHS dentistry as soon as possible.
This debate will resonate with many people out there.
Does he agree with the chair of the Northern Ireland Dental Practice  Committee that now is the time for the funding allocation to pay for a better contract and for training more dedicated dentists who will commit to the NHS, rather than private practice?
