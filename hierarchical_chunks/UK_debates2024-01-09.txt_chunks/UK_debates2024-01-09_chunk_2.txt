I thank the Lord Chancellor for his response and his clear commitment to ensuring that victims are considered.
As the Member of Parliament for Strangford, many people contact me about those getting early parole and decisions that are made.
Will he reassure me and the House that victims will be considered and contacted before any person who has carried out an evil crime is actually released?
