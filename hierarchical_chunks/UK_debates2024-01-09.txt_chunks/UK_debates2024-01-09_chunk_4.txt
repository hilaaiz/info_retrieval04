I thank my hon.
Friend for drawing the attention of the House to that appalling incident.
Yes, it is absolutely imperative that both victims and witnesses can access support in the aftermath of such shocking crimes.
As I indicated, we are quadrupling funding for victims and witness support by 2024-25 on 2010 levels.
This is important.
Under the 2006 victims code that we inherited, support was available only for direct victims.
We have changed that, so it is now available for witnesses who have suffered mental or emotional harm.
