Commandant of the Marine Corps.
After speaking with the General a few days later, Master Gunnery Sergeant Fearns returned to Orange County having secured the charter.
Today, Orange High School has one of the largest Marine Corps JROTC Program in the Western United States.
The JROTC Program instills in its 162 cadets the values of citizenship, service to others, selfdiscipline, and personal responsibility.
Personal success after high school is an integral part of this program, exemplified by the James H. Fearns Marine Corps JROTC Memorial Scholarship.
This scholarship awards cadets who wish to attend college or pursue a vocational school certification.
Last year, 12 cadets received this prestigious award.
As we prepare to celebrate the 248th birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps, I am proud to recognize Orange High School's JROTC program and its cadets.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these accomplished students as they grow to become the leaders of tomorrow.
