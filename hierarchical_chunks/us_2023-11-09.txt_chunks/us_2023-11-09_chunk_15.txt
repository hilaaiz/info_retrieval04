Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing Barry R. Feirstein being honored with the 2023 V.V. Anderson Community Service Award.
This award is a fitting honor for the profound difference he and Holly Peyton Good Feirstein have made in the lives of those with autism through their `Pay it Forward' campaign.
