Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Fort Wayne Police Officer David Tinsley, who five years ago died in the line of duty, and to commemorate the designation of the Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Officer Tinsley was known to his colleagues as a committed, professional police officer devoted to the force and to his craft.
Across his sixteen years in the Fort Wayne Police Department, he led by example, developing a reputation as a faithful servant to his community, his fellow officers, and his family and loved ones.
The Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will honor its namesake, encompassing a stretch of Fort Wayne's roadway that Officer Tinsley would frequently patrol.
It also passes by his home church of Emmanuel Lutheran and serves as a gateway for visitors entering downtown Fort Wayne from the west.
I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute.
Each time they travel along the parkway, residents of northeast Indiana will celebrate Officer Tinsley's service and recognize what an indispensable role he played in his community.
We will never forget his memory, and the Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will stand as an enduring testament to his valor and service.
