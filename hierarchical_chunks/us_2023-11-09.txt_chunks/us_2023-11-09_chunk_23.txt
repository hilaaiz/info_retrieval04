Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Lula ``Mae'' Parker-Harris, a pillar of the Dutchess County community who was beloved by all who knew her.
Mae recently passed away on August 27, 2023, at the age of 79.
Mae attended public schools and was educated at Dutchess Community College.
She spent her career at various organizations including Dutchess Community Day Care Center, Wassaic Developmental Center, and Astor Head Start.
Mae was known throughout the community for her selflessness and integrity.
A devoted member of the Smith Metropolitan AME Zion Church, she was committed to civil activism, social responsibility, and equity and equality in and around her community.
Her contributions to Poughkeepsie, NY and Dutchess County will endure for generations to come, and she will be dearly missed by all who knew her.
