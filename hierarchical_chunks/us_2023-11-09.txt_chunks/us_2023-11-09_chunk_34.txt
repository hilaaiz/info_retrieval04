Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to all the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States and risked their lives to defend our freedoms and way of life and took and lived the oath to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.''
Our Veterans have borne ``true faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation they took freely, without any mental reservation or purpose Veterans are truly heroes walking among us.
I want to thank all of our armed servicemen and women for their selfless dedication to our protection every day.
Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who live in freedom that as President Kennedy said, ``The price of freedom is high, but Americans have always paid it.''
This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity to remember the fallen who gave the last full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields around the world--in places whose names may be unforgettable--or locations that have slipped into the pages of history.
We will never forget:
