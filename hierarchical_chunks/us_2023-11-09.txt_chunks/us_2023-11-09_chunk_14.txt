Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barry R. Feirstein and the memory of Holly Peyton Good Feirstein, who both worked to create the `Pay it Forward' campaign which has positively impacted the lives of those in the autism community by raising over $97,000 for the Anderson Center for Autism.
Barry is also the 2023 recipient of the V.V. Anderson Community Service Award that recognizes his outstanding contributions to helping those living with autism.
Barry is a graduate of Brooklyn College and Harvard Business School.
He was a two-term Chairman of Brooklyn College where he worked tirelessly to create the Barry R. Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, one of the few remaining film schools in a working studio.
Barry spent his career as founder of Feirstein Capital Management where he concentrated his efforts to help others make solid financial investments.
He is currently on the Weill Cornell Deans Council and the Board.
His contributions to local communities in New York, through both the `Pay it Forward' campaign and the Barry R. Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema, will not be soon forgotten.
