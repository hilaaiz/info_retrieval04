Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the MCNHA.
Our auto and labor industry helped establish and expand the United States as an industrial power and was a driving force for the creation of the middle class, and we thank the MCNHA for their great work in promoting and preserving our unique legacy.
Just last year they were reauthorized for another 15 years, and we are excited to see how they will continue to tell our incredible story.
Thank you to MCNHA.
