Mr. BACON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National Space Day, a moment to honor the extraordinary contributions of the aerospace community to our Nation and the world.
Designating May 2, 2025, as National Space Day gives us the opportunity to reflect on the achievements of the past, recognize the advancements of today, and inspire the possibilities of tomorrow.
Our Nation has long led the way in space exploration.
From the Apollo missions that landed the first humans on the Moon to today's Artemis program, which will take us back to the Moon and beyond, the United States has shown what's possible when bold ideas meet determination.
These milestones remind us of the pioneering spirit that defines America.
Today, we see that same spirit driving innovation in every corner of the space sector.
NASA's groundbreaking missions, the Space Force's contributions to national security, and the work of private companies and universities are redefining what we can achieve in space.
In Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, we're witnessing history made through initiatives like the Big Red Satellite team, where students from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Aerospace eXperimental Payload team, along with middle and high school students from Lincoln, Omaha, and Aurora, built the state's first CubeSat satellite.
This satellite, launched in 2024 on NASA's 30th commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station, represents the unlimited promise of our next generation.
Space exploration doesn't just inspire; it delivers real benefits to our daily lives.
Our Nation's farmers utilize technologies like GPS, weather satellites, and internet connectivity, which has allowed our producers to increase efficiency and productivity in their operations.
NASA's impact on Nebraska is significant, supporting 33 jobs and generating $7.4 million in economic output, along with $238,000 in state tax revenue.
For every million dollars of economic output generated by NASA civil service employees, an additional $6.6 million is sustained throughout our state economy.
Nebraska's contributions to space exploration are significant and growing.
Four Nebraska suppliers have contributed to NASA's Artemis program, including manufacturing supplies for Exploration Ground Systems at NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
We're also proud of our state's space heritage through Clayton C. Anderson, Nebraska's first and only astronaut, who spent 152 days aboard the International Space Station and conducted three spacewalks totaling over 18 hours.
Perhaps most importantly, National Space Day reminds us to invest in the next generation.
By investing in STEM education, we ensure that young people across Nebraska and the Nation have the tools they need to dream big and take on the challenges of tomorrow.
Programs like the NASA Nebraska Space Grant Consortium at the University of Nebraska Omaha and our state's partnerships
