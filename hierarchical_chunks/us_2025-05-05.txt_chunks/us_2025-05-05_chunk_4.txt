with the International Space Station are lighting the way for future scientists, engineers, and astronauts.
As we celebrate National Space Day, we must also remain vigilant in protecting NASA's crucial programs and funding.
Any significant cuts to NASA's science funding would not only impact our space economy and workforce but could threaten our national security and technological leadership position.
We must maintain America's preeminence in space.
I encourage all Americans to reflect on how space exploration shapes our lives and futures.
I'm proud of our district's contributions to this great endeavor, and I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together in the years ahead.
