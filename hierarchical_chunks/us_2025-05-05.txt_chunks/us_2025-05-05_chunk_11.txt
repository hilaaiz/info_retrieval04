Mr. JACKSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the upcoming 100th anniversary of a beloved institution, the Harlem Globetrotters.
Their centennial will be in 2026 and will mark 100 years The Harlem Globetrotters were founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1926 by Abe Saperstein at Wendell Phillips High School.
They began as the ``Savoy Big Five'' and have since become a global phenomenon, known for their amazing athletic skills, their comedic routines and the goodwill they spread.
Their unique blend of athleticism and showmanship has captivated fans of all ages, and their impact extends far beyond the basketball court.
The Globetrotters have a deep and meaningful connection to the 1st Congressional District.
On May 6, 2025, a street will be named after the Globetrotters near Phillips High School in the 1st District.
Their roots in Chicago's vibrant Bronzeville community have created a legacy that resonates within our community.
As we approach this milestone, it is fitting that we recognize the Globetrotters' contributions to the world of sports and entertainment.
They have brought joy to millions, transcended cultural barriers and served as ambassadors of goodwill for the United States.
Among the many talented players who have donned the Globetrotters' uniform, some have become legends.
These include Lynette Woodard, a trailblazing Olympian and the first woman to play for a men's professional basketball team; Wilt Chamberlain, a basketball icon known for his dominant presence: Meadowlark Lemon, an unforgettable showman and one of the most beloved Globetrotters of all time; Marques Haynes, a legendary dribbler whose skills were unmatched; Reece ``Goose'' Tatum, known as the Clown Prince of basketball; and Curly Neal, famous for his incredible dribbling skills.
These players, among many others, have contributed to the Globetrotter's rich history and enduring legacy.
