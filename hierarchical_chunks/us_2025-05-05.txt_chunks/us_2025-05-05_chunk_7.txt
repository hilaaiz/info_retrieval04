understanding of the Pacific Northwest region and a steadfast commitment to delivering results for families, workers, and businesses across the district.
His work on trade, foreign policy, and health care demonstrated a valuable combination of policy expertise, strategic insight, and tireless dedication.
Abe's contributions have made a real difference in people's lives.
He helped lead efforts to stand up against harmful tariffs and supported the introduction of the Prevent Tariff Abuse Act, which aims to protect Washington's economy and jobs.
Abe also showed deep commitment to fixing our health care system, playing a major role in advancing legislation to reform prior authorization to allow patients to get the care they need without facing hurdles.
He also supported the construction of new military housing at Naval Station Everett to ensure our servicemembers and their families had a safe place to call home.
Amid the baby formula shortage in 2022, Abe fought hard to remove tariffs on imported formula to ensure families had safe, affordable access to the nutrition infants need.
Abe fought hard to secure disaster relief for dairy farmers and growers who were hit the hardest during the 2021 heat dome.
Through every challenge, Abe brought a calm presence, a sharp policy mind, and quick wit.
This work often happened behind the scenes, but its impact will be felt across Washington's First District for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Abe Friedman and wishing him the best in his next chapter.
