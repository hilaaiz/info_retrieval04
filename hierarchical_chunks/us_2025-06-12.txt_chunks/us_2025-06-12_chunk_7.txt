Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize an extraordinary institution in American journalism and Black history as the Indianapolis Recorder Newspaper celebrates its 130th anniversary.
Founded in 1895 by George P. Stewart and Will Porter as a two-page church bulletin, the Recorder has grown into one of the most enduring African American newspapers in the United States.
It has served as a vital platform for truth, justice, and community empowerment, particularly for Black Hoosiers, for over thirteen decades.
From its early advocacy against lynching and for voting rights, to its courageous coverage during the Civil Rights Movement, to dedicated coverage of issues impacting the Black community and all Hoosiers, the Recorder has always championed fairness and equal representation for all.
It has lifted up local Black institutions like Crispus Attucks High School and the Madam Walker Manufacturing Company, while promoting civic engagement and public health.
In recent decades, the Recorder has continued to evolve under visionary leadership.
From William G. Mays' preservation of its legacy to Shannon Williams' modernization of operations, and now under Robert Shegog, the Recorder has expanded its reach through digital innovation, multimedia platforms, and award-winning journalism--earning over one hundred honors in just the past few years.
Today, with more than 120,000 weekly readers, the Recorder is not just a newspaper--it's a living institution.
Through initiatives like Recorder Charities, the JAWS youth journalism program, and the Minority Business Review, it continues to invest in the future of media and enrich civic life in Indiana.
