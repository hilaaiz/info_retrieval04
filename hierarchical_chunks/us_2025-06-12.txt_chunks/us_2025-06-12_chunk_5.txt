Mr. GOLDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend an exceptional young student from my district, Addyson Pannell, for being named Best STEM Student by Constituting America.
Addyson's achievement reflects not only her academic excellence, but also her passion for the principles that form the foundation of our Nation.
By combining her talents in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics with a deep understanding of civic responsibility, Addyson embodies the kind of engaged, thoughtful, and innovative citizen our future depends on.
Constituting America is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating students about the U.S. Constitution and the importance of civic engagement.
Addyson's recognition as Best STEM Student highlights her outstanding contributions to promoting these values through creative, STEM-based solutions and projects.
Her commitment to excellence and civic education is an inspiration to her peers and a source of pride for her community.
On behalf of the 12th Congressional District of Texas, I am proud to recognize Addyson on this prestigious accomplishment.
I am confident that her future holds even greater achievements, and I look forward to seeing the continued impact she will make.
I congratulate Addyson on this well-deserved honor and for serving as a shining example of youth leadership in America.
