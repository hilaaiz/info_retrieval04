Mr. ROSE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible life of Joe Moore.
who passed away in late March at the age of 90.
Moore lived a life dedicated to agriculture.
I, along with many other current and former Tennessee FFA members, consider him to be a mentor, a role model, and indeed a hero.
The Time Magazine cover was published after he was named the FFA Star Farmer of America in 1955.
Appearing in the October 24, 1955, issue, it shows a 21-year-old Joe Moore, the only active FFA member to make TIME's cover.
At the FFA convention that year, judges were impressed by his farming operation conducted in Jackson County, Tennessee, which I am honored to represent today.
He had a net worth of $37,000 at the time--a great deal for someone his age in the mid-1950s.
At that time, he was farming 505 arches, 85 of which he owned personally.
I often say farmers are our Nation's original conservationists.
Joe Moore is a shining example of why I believe that to be true.
The TIME article noted how he incorporated modern farming techniques to combat erosion and improve soil health.
He carefully monitored the diet of his livestock to keep them healthy.
He showed great attention to detail and inspected his animals closely, which enabled him to detect any health issues early.
Over the years, his family farm has taken a bit of a beating.
Very little care was taken to where row crops went into the ground.
No remedies for erosion had been taken.
But Joe was determined to restore the land to richness.
He tackled years of abuse and the less-than-ideal terrain, arguing that his rocky slopes could be as fertile as flat land with the right amount of care.
The article even says Joe viewed misfortune as a test of faith.
