Mr. GIMENEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a decade of excellence at the Academy for International Disaster Preparedness at Florida International University.
Over the past decade, AIDP has trained and graduated more than 500 students in disaster preparedness, emergency management, and humanitarian response.
These programs have successfully prepared students to work in local, tribal, state, and federal government as well as in Fortune 500 companies and the private sector.
AIDP's curriculum aligns with FEMA's Next Generation Core Competencies, focusing on four phases of emergency management: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.
Through hands on training, students, along with experts in the field, use the frameworks of the Incident Command System and the National incident Management System to experience complex, real-world disaster environments.
FIU and AIDP are setting the standard for the next generation of emergency management professionals, and I am proud to recognize their service and leadership today.
