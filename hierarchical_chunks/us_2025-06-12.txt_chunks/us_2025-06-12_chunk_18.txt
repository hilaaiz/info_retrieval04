family, friends, coaches, and teammates.
I am grateful local and federal law enforcement took swift action to apprehend those responsible, as that was the bare minimum we owe to Ava and to every American family trying to raise children in peace and safety.
I had the privilege of speaking with Ava's father, a man of great faith, kindness, and forgiveness.
Even in the face of unimaginable loss, he told me he was remaining hopeful and positive, because, in his words, ``that's how Ava would have wanted it.''
That tells you everything you need to know about the kind of young woman Ava was, and the family who raised her.
They chose to honor her life not with sorrow, but with a coming home memorial, a celebration of how she stood as an incredible example for all those around her.
This past week, Ava was laid to rest with full military honors, as family and friends gathered to celebrate her grace, dignity, character, and strength.
Our Nation is at a loss with Ava's passing.
She was leading a life of service as a young woman whose dream was to protect and defend the very freedoms we enjoy in this country today.
She was taken far too soon.
May we honor Ava by remembering the incredible young woman that she was and may God bring peace to her family knowing that though her time on earth was cut short, her legacy and her example will last with all of us.
We ask the Lord to bless and receive His servant, Ava Moore.
She has come home.
