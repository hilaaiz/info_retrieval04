Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor a tremendous young woman from the Texas 24th Congressional District, Ava Moore.
Ava was an exceptional individual.
She was a leader, a patriot, and a bright light in our North Texas community.
From the first time we reviewed her application to the U.S. Air Force Academy, it was clear she was destined for greatness.
Her academic excellence, leadership, and dedication to serving our nation stood out.
That's why I nominated her not once, but twice to the Air Force Academy.
The Academy itself recognized her potential and asked her to attend the U.S. Air Force Preparatory School.
Ava successfully completed that program this May, and she was home for just a short break before heading off to basic training and beginning her next chapter at the Air Force Academy.
Our staff had spoken with her about her abbreviated summer break and could hear in her voice how excited she was to start a career in service to her beloved country.

Our entire office is heartbroken about her loss and grieved for Ava's
