Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and honor Rosemount Police Sergeant Shawn McMenomy for his courageous service during the tragic February 18th incident in Burnsville, MN which lost officers Matthew Ruge and Paul Elmstrand and firefighter/paramedic Adam Finseth.
Sergeant McMenomy provided mutual aid support to Burnsville and was in the Bearcat and helped extract the mortally wounded officers and the rest of the Burnsville staff that were on scene.
Sergeant McMenomy joined the South Metro SWAT team in 2018 and is currently serving as a Team Leader for the team that handles critical incidents across Dakota and Rice County.
A Hastings native, Sergeant McMenomy began his service with the Rosemount Police Department in 2011 and was previously a park ranger and correctional officer for Dakota County.
He has served as a patrol officer, on the department's crime scene team, as an advisor for the police Explorer program and was promoted to Sergeant in 2015 assigned as a detective.
I'm grateful for Sergeant McMenomy's service to Rosemount, Burnsville and Minnesota.
He represents the best of law enforcement and it is a privilege to represent him in Congress.
