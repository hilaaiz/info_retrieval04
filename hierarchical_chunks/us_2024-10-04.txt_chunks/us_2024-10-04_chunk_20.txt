Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable constituent, Betty Stout of Pennswood Village in Newtown.
Betty was born on September 30, 1923, in Trenton.
N.J., and is now turning 101.
Betty was known during her childhood in Trenton as the ``The Little Mother of Rutherford Avenue,'' because of the long hours she spent caring for her younger brother, Gary.
Her father worked even longer hours, leading a band, playing the organ in local movie theaters, and delivering newspapers before the crack of dawn.
After graduating from Trenton High, Betty worked for the Trenton Banking Company.
She married Ralph Stout, who also worked there, in 1947.
Ralph had a liberating effect on her life, mainly by encouraging her do many of the things she had not been able to do as a child.
They were wonderful dancers and excelled at bridge.
Betty learned to swim and play golf, a sport that gave her great pleasure until she was 90.
She was an active member of the Hopewell Valley Golf Club for 50 years.
One of her grandchildren jokes she even looked down on the 9-holers.
Betty was a member of Ewing Presbyterian Church for many years before joining Lawrenceville Presbyterian Church.
She now attends services at Pennswood.
She volunteered with the Children's Committee of Mercer Hospital.
Betty is adored by her three children, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
At her 100th birthday party, one of the grandchildren described her as the hub of the family's wheel.
At the age of 94, she served as the celebrant at another grandchild's wedding.
At Pennswood, Betty is surrounded by loving friends and staff.
To be her friend or a spoke on her family's wheel is a rare, and always rewarding privilege.
To be on the Pennswood staff is often to become her friend.
Her capacity for friendship is matched by her passion for setting wrongs right.
Happy Birthday, Betty.
