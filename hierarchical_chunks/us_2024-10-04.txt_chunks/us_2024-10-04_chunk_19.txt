Mr. Davis was known to be an exceptional man by his friends, family, and all the people he worked with throughout his career.
He has deeply touched the Blackshear community and will be greatly missed by many.
Our community is forever indebted to 
Mr. Davis's service, and I send my deepest condolences to his family and friends.
