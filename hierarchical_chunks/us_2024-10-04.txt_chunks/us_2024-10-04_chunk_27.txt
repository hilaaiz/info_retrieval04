Mr. PERRY.
Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize the Mechanicsburg Lions Club on their 75th Anniversary.
Chartered in 1949, the Mechanicsburg Lions Club has provided continuous service to our local community and the Lions International organization--fostering a spirit of understanding among people for humanitarian needs by providing voluntary services through community involvement and international cooperation.
In some of their recent work, the Mechanicsburg Lions Club supported the Operation Wildcat Project Clothing initiative, volunteered at One80 Ministries preparing their new transitional living space, and volunteered for Pink Hands of Hope during a last-minute emergency cleanup.
The organization also supports Boys Little League Baseball and Girls Softball leagues, Red Cross Blood Drives, Meals on Wheels, subsidizes eyeglasses and hearing aids for needy adults and children, supported the Silver Spring Township Veterans Memorial, and myriad other worthy causes.
In recent years, with more than 50 members, the Mechanicsburg Lions Club has raised and distributed approximately $40,000 to help local and worldwide charities--proving an indispensable Godsend to our community.
Every penny the Club collects is distributed to those in need, and the administration of the Club and international organization is provided for through modest annual dues, which provides maximum charitable impact.
Their work focuses on alleviating humanitarian crises, hunger, childhood cancer, and support of many other critical needs truly makes our communities, Commonwealth, the United States, and the world a better place.
