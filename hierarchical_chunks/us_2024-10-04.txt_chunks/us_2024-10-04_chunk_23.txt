Mr. LARSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and celebrate Jason Sodano, who has been honored with the prestigious 2024 William M. Usdane Award that recognizes outstanding achievement and exceptional character by an employee with a disability.
SourceAmerica confers this award as part of its AbilityOne Program, which leverages federal procurement to create job opportunities for Americans with disabilities through the nonprofit organizations that employ them.
Jason overcame his developmental disability and earned both his high school diploma and an associate's degree in office technology.
His perseverance helped him land a job with New Leaf, a participating nonprofit in the AbilityOne Program that operates at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington.
For the past 13 years, Jason has worked on the naval base as a janitor.
Jason's supervisors, colleagues and family praise his commitment to excellence and his positive attitude that seems to brighten the workplace and inspire those around him.
Along the way, Jason has earned awards for perfect attendance and exceeding quality standards by ensuring cleanliness for up to 1,700 military personnel at NAS Whidbey Island.
Jason exemplifies the American spirit in overcoming adversity.
His journey from struggling with standardized tests to becoming a valued employee at New Leaf is a testament to his resilience and determination.
He has shown that regardless of the challenges one faces, it is possible to achieve great success through hard work and a positive attitude.
