significant hearing loss, but Joe was willing to sacrifice his own health for those around him.
Joe was a well-known pillar of his community and was there to lend a hand to anyone who was in need.
He would help people that did not have food and people who could not pay their bills.
Joe never hesitated to support his community with time, money or labor.
His loved ones say that he viewed his community as an extension of his family, fondly sharing stories about the time he helped deliver a baby at his grocery store.
Joe wanted nothing more than to share love and family, and if we all cared about out communities the way that he did, the world would be a much brighter place.
On this day, I would like to celebrate Joe Stires as a veteran, a volunteer firefighter and as a pillar in our community who dedicated himself to a life of giving.
His service has made his community and New Mexico a better place.
On behalf of the great people of New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, I thank Joe Stires, for all he has done for us.
