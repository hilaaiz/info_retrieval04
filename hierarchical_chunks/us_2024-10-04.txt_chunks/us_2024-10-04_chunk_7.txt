Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish Dave Cole and Isles Pub & Pizza a very happy 40th anniversary.
Established in 1984, Dave Cole turned an old Italian restaurant into a community favorite pizza kitchen with the help of many dedicated friends.
After a customer led naming contest for the business, the restaurant became ``The Isles Pub & Pizza'', more oftenly called ``The Isles.''
Since then, Isles Pub & Pizza has grown and distinguished itself in many ways.
Cole and company have dedicated hours of their time curating the perfect pizza sauce for their customers.
Many local community leaders consider Isles Pub & Pizza to be some of the best pizza in the area.
Cole and his staff have continued to provide quality food and excellent service for 40 years.
Isles Pub & Pizza have been recognized with many achievements including Lincoln's recent 2024 Choice Award.
As Dave Cole and Isles Pub & Pizza reach their 40th anniversary, there is much to celebrate.
On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I congratulate them on 40 years and wish them fun as they celebrate this incredible milestone.
