Mr. GOMEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate El Gallo Bakery on their 75th anniversary of doing business in California's 34th Congressional District.
El Gallo Bakery is an outstanding small business in East Los Angeles that exemplifies the entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses.
Founded by Magdalena Martinez de Huerta on February 2, 1949, 5 years after immigrating to East Los Angeles from Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.
El Gallo Bakery was passed down to 
Mr. Jesus Huerta, the son of Magdalena Martinez de Huerta.
Mr. Huerta became the owner at 18 years old in 1984 and has transformed El Gallo Bakery into a staple of the East Los Angeles community.
