I thank the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for her question.
If people look at page 39 of the document, they will see many references to China, and I referred to the statement that the Foreign Secretary is going to make.
On our advice to people, as I said, it is guided by the protection of our security interest and the promotion of our economic interest.

We did arrange a recent security briefing for the First Ministers at the time of the recent meeting of the Council of the Nations and Regions, because we agree it is important to bring them into our thinking and help them play their role in protecting our national security interest, too.
