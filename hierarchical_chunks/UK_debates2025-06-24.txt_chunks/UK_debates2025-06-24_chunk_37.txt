My hon.
Friend is quite right to draw attention to the deep expertise that exists in the diplomatic service, which advances our national interests in a whole range of ways every day, including in conflict resolution.
I pay tribute to the work of those in our diplomatic posts and diplomatic service across the world.
If you will allow me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will read a small quote from page 10: “We will continue to abide by the important principle—shared by NATO and its key partners—that the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions are inextricably linked”.
But that is not how the US views it.
The Trump Administration see them as quite separate, and would prefer the United Kingdom to focus its efforts on the Euro-Atlantic.
How does the right hon.
Gentleman explain that discrepancy?
They are inextricably linked.
While the Prime Minister attends the NATO summit today, our carrier group is in the Indo-Pacific region.
It is quite right that the strategy we have published today draws attention to our responsibilities, our ambition and our determination to act in both arenas.
