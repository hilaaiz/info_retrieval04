I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his continued engagement on these questions.
We have discussed across the Dispatch Box many times the restrictions on aid getting into Gaza, including in relation to construction materials.
I am very happy to take a further look at this specific proposal and see if there is anything that we can do.
