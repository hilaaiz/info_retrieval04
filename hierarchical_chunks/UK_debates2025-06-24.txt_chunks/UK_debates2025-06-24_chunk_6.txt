The humanitarian situation in Gaza simply cannot continue.
We have spent a lot of time in this House discussing the extent of that situation and the fact that food and essential supplies are not getting through to support innocent victims.
What proposals has the Minister put to Israel about the opening of specific crossing points for aid delivery into Gaza?
Will he give his assessment of why the Israeli Government may not be listening to this country and our Government on this particular issue?
The disagreement that the Israeli Government have is not simply with the British Government; it is with a wide range of their partners.
As the right hon.
Lady is aware, we signed a statement with 26 partners about the humanitarian situation.
We made a leader-level statement with France and Canada.
There is wide disagreement with the approach that the Israeli Government are taking in relation to aid distribution.
At the weekend, the Foreign Secretary discussed these matters, including entry points, with the Foreign Minister of Israel.
We would like to see the Israeli Government shift position.
It is clear, for the reasons that she says, that that shift must come urgently.
