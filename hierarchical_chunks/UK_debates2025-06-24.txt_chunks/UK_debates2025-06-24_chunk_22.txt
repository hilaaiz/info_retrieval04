I thank the Minister for the Indo-Pacific, my hon.
Friend the Member for Hornsey and Friern Barnet (Catherine West), for her support for the family of Simone White, who tragically died last year after drinking a free vodka shot in Laos.
I hear worrying reports that the hostel where that happened is due to reopen shortly under another name.
What assurance can the Minister give me and the family that everything is being done to hold those involved accountable, and to keep travellers safe from the dangers of methanol poisoning?
