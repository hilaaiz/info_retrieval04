The right hon.
Gentleman’s long experience will tell him that sometimes in government the grander the language the less significant the actual announcement.
But if on this occasion—I am perfectly prepared to accept that this is so—the Government are making a serious effort to redraw the boundaries of what is national security policy and what is not, does he agree that we need matching parliamentary scrutiny of that area of policy?
As he knows, the Intelligence and Security Committee is the only Committee with the necessary clearances to look at classified material.
Does he think that this is a good moment to look again at the memorandum of understanding between the Committee and the Government about what the Committee covers?
The right hon.
and learned Gentleman is right to say that the document is distinguished by a broader view of national security, which is also reflected in the discussion at NATO today, where we are looking beyond our core defence expenditure on our armed forces to the other things we have discussed that contribute to our national security.
I thank the Intelligence and Security Committee for its work in all its iterations over the years.
I have a good dialogue with the Committee.
I look forward to that continuing, and to the Committee playing its very important role.
