I thank the Chair of the Joint Committee for his question.
I should have said, in response to the shadow Foreign Secretary, that I hope to reach a resolution with the Committee soon on the matter of appearances before it.
I am always happy to appear before the Committee, if invited.
The Chairman of the Joint Committee is quite right to say to the House that publishing strategies is one thing, but there must be follow through.
The difference between this and some other documents produced is that it is a whole-system approach, looking at sovereign capability, international  alliances and making our country a harder target for our enemies.
All three of those must be brought together and followed through in a systematic way.
