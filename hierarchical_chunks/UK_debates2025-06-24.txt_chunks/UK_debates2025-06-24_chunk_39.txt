My hon.
Friend is right that resilience and target hardening must be part of our national security strategy.
Resilience is about capability and investment; we are determined to do both, and will have more to say about resilience in the coming weeks.
Before the most recent election, the Intelligence and Security Committee produced a very comprehensive report on China, making it very clear that it considers China to be one of our greatest threats.
I am therefore astonished that, in the whole of today’s strategy, there are three paragraphs that deal with China, and that it raises one or two issues and then proceeds to take a different decision.
It talks about there being a problem with human rights—which is genocide—and the cyber-security attacks on the UK, as well as China’s espionage, interference in our democracy, sanctioning of people like myself and undermining of our economic security, and its being guilty of transnational repression.
China also ships arms to Myanmar, keeping that brutal regime in charge, at the same time as building the largest navy.
To what degree do three paragraphs satisfy the idea that China should surely be in the list of threats?
