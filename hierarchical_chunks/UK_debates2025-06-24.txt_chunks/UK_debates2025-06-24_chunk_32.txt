I thank the hon.
Lady for her comments.
Let me try to go through some of the issues she raised.
She is absolutely right to draw attention to the importance of the recent cyber-attacks on Marks and Spencer, the Co-op and the legal aid system.
They show what both state and non-state actors can do, and they show how important it is that we strengthen our cyber-capabilities and our cyber-defences as much as possible.
In terms of being serious, the actions we have taken so far since the election show that we are serious.
We have a plan in place to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP this Parliament.
It took a very difficult decision to do that, but at the spending review we showed exactly how that would be paid for.
On her reference to the United States, it remains a strong, reliable, deep and important ally for the United Kingdom.
The relationship between us helps to protect the British people every day.
