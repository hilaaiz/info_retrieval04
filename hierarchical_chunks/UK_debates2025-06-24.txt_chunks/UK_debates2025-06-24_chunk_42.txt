I believe my hon.
Friend is due happy birthday wishes, so let me take that opportunity, and thank him, too, for his tireless campaigning for locating the laboratories in Harlow.
The facilities are an important capability for the United Kingdom.
A decision has been awaited for some years; I am not ready to announce it today, but people will not have too long to wait before it is announced.
The national security strategy document outlines an expanded meaning of national security to include areas such as food security.
If food security is national security—I certainly agree it is—we need to increase domestic production instead of cutting support for farmers and increasing our reliance on imports from the other side of the world.
Will the Chancellor outline how the national security strategy will be used to change policy at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs?
The Government agree that food security is important.
Our farmers, food producers and food retailers have been burdened with far too many increased costs and delays in recent years, but the recent sanitary and phytosanitary agreement we reached with the European Union will lift that burden.
That will be good news for food producers in the UK, who will be able to grow and sell their magnificent produce with much greater ease than in recent years.
It is vital that the UK has robust defences against biological incidents, accidents and attacks.
What steps are the Government taking to invest in our biosecurity, and how that will help to protect our country from the range of bio-threats that we face?
There is a £1 billion investment in biosecurity.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for DEFRA has been able to announce only today new investment in critical resources at Weybridge as part of that.
