I welcome today’s national security strategy, which bears a remarkable resemblance to every single one I have seen over the past 15 years.
There have been only very slight adjustments over that period; I wonder whether there is any connection  between the authors, or whether it is just that the officials have not changed, so the politics has not changed.
However, one thing that really has changed over that period is technology, and the document I have seen this morning has very little connection to the democratisation of technology that we have seen in Ukraine’s warfare in Russia or between Israel and Iran—or, indeed, in warfare we might see waged against us by the switching off of electronic items, including solar panels and cars by the Chinese state.
