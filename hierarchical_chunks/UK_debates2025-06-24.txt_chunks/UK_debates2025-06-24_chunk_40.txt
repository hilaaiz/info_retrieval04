I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his question.
Let me make it clear that any sanctions on UK parliamentarians are wrong, and there is no place for them.
The paragraphs he refers to set out some of our position on China.
As I have said, the Foreign Secretary will, however, make a broader statement on the China audit immediately after this statement.
I repeat again what I said in my opening remarks: our approach to China will be guided by protecting our security interests, which we will always do robustly, but also by promoting our economic interests; we do have an economic relationship with the second biggest economy in the world.
