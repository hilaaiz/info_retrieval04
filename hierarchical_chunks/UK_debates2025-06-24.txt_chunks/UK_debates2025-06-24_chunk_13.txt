The Minister responsible for Europe, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty) , has condemned what took place in Georgia over the last few days, and I endorse that condemnation.
On the issue of Russian assets, we are engaged particularly with European colleagues who are more exposed than we are.
It has been right to allow new Governments in Europe to take their place and consider these issues, because they require some technical understanding, but we continue to press this issue, and it will be a topic at the NATO summit later today.
