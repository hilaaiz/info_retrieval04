I welcome the proposals that my right hon.
Friend the Chancellor made in his Mansion House speech, which will increase investment in the United Kingdom.
In his upcoming autumn statement, I implore him to build on his Budget announcement with a policy that was originally advocated for in a paper by the Adam Smith Institute, a think-tank I am proud to be patron of, as is set out in my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
I implore him to make full expensing permanent and to scrap the hated factory tax.
