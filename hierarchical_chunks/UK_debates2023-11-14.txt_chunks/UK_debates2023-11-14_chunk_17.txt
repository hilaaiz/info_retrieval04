What recent assessment he has made of the implications for his policies of the economic growth rate.
Our policies are increasing economic growth, as the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed following last year’s autumn statement and the spring Budget, but the only way to secure higher, sustainable, long-term growth is to bring down inflation.
The OBR judged the Chancellor’s last Budget to have no overall long-term impact on the level of potential productivity.
Does he expect the OBR to make a similar judgment of his next Budget?
I remind the hon.
Gentleman of what the OBR actually said about the spring Budget: “the overall impact on GDP is around 0.2 per cent in 2027-28.
This is the largest upward revision we have made to potential output within our five-year forecast as a result of fiscal policy decisions taken by a Government”.
Economic growth in northern Lincolnshire will be severely impacted if changes go ahead at British Steel’s Scunthorpe works, which will result in redundancies and a massive impact on the supply chain.
Will my right hon.
Friend give an assurance that the Government will not proceed with any support for those changes until a full economic assessment of the impact on the local area has been carried out?
