I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his comments, and perhaps I should start by addressing those about the Foreign Secretary.
Having a former Prime Minister and party leader as our Foreign Secretary, wherever one sits in this House, must be a plus.
They will be able to exert British influence and policy highly effectively overseas, and I greatly welcome the appointment of Lord Cameron to the position of Foreign Secretary.
As the House will know, he is an extremely experienced parliamentarian, and I have no doubt whatsoever that the House, the Foreign Office and the Government will gain enormously from his presence.
