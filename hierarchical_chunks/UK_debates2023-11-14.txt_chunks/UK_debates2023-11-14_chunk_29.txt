It has been a year since the Conservatives crashed the economy.
In 2023 so far, 1.5 million fixed-term mortgages have expired, leaving working people facing sky-high increases in their mortgage costs.
For people living in Wellingborough, for example, this Tory mortgage penalty means that households are paying another £190 a month on top of everything else in a cost of living crisis.
The truth is that working people are paying the price for the Conservatives crashing the economy last autumn.
Does the Economic Secretary think that is fair?
