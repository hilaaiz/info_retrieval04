I thank the right hon.
Lady for her comments.
She has spoken movingly and with great expertise and humanity about this situation both on the media and in the House.
If she will forgive me, we cannot give a running commentary on what we are doing to try to recover the hostages.
I hope that she will accept my word that we are doing everything, across Government and internationally, to try to get them home as soon as we can.
