My right hon.
Friend tempts me to make tax policy.
What I will say to her is that she will know that the Chancellor always keeps these things under review, as do the Government.
Indeed, we have a fiscal event shortly.
Can I ask the Minister why he said he wants particularly to support investment and growth in Sussex?
[Interruption.]
Is that the Tories reverting to type in terms of the blue wall?
Order.
I think it was Essex, not Sussex.
They are all the same to me.
Have you got a question?
I do not think an answer is needed.
What fiscal steps he is taking to support the growth of the life sciences sector.
Life sciences are one of the Chancellor’s key growth priority areas.
In May, he announced a significant new policy package, backed by more than £650 million of funding, reaffirming the Government’s commitment to supporting a thriving life sciences industry.
