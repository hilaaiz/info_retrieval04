I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.

I do; I know how much he cares about these issues and campaigns on them frequently in the House, and I commend him for it.
The Government are committed to delivering on a UK green taxonomy to provide investors with clarity on which economic activity should be labelled as green.
We expect to consult this autumn.
The green taxonomy will provide an important tool for enabling the supply of relevant and reliable sustainability information for the market, and information will come in due course.
