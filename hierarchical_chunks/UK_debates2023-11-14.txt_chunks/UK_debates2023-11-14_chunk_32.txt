The Minister will be aware that a big concern for rural constituencies is the cost of fuel.
The RAC has found that the margin enjoyed by the big supermarkets on fuel sales in October was double the figure for the year to date at 14p per litre.
That reflects concerns raised by the Competition and Markets Authority that although wholesale fuel prices fell in September and October, retail prices did not.
What is the Treasury’s assessment of the impact that these higher margins will have on households in the coming winter?
Fuel duty is a major cost for households and businesses.
We recognise that.
That is why in the spring Budget 2023, the Chancellor extended the 5p temporary duty cut.
That was a £5 billion saving for motorists, worth £100 for the average motorist, but we always keep these things under review.
What steps he is taking to support economic growth in Essex.
As my right hon.
Friend knows, the Government are committed to supporting economic growth all over the country, but particularly in the wonderful county of Essex.
The recently announced £1.1 billion long-term plan for towns will, for example, provide £20 million of flexible funding over 10 years to Clacton, and there are many other measures.
