I thank my hon.
Friend for his question.
On his first point, we are increasing the number of homes and we are optimistic that we will reach our target of delivering 1 million new homes over this Parliament.
Secondly, the help to buy ISA was closed to  new accounts in 2019, but existing holders can continue to save into their accounts.
On his third point about stopping 35-year mortgages, it is important to have choice in the market and for people to make those choices for themselves.
As a Government we are committed to supporting people doing just that.
