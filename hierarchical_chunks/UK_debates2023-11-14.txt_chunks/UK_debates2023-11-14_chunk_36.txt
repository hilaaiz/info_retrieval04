My hon.
Friend is absolutely right to highlight the benefits and importance of life sciences to the country.
We are genuinely a world leader: I was out in Boston in the United States seeing the other world-leading area for life sciences, and it is not a patch on ours.
That is why, as an example, we are looking to support life sciences through the investment zone programme, but, as I said, they are a key priority for the Chancellor as part of his growth agenda.
If he will make a statement on his departmental responsibilities.
As we have a debate this afternoon, I will limit my comments to welcoming my outstanding new colleagues.
The new Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Sevenoaks (Laura Trott) , will brilliantly solve the problem of how we stop the state expanding, building on the work of her wonderful predecessor, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Salisbury (John Glen) .
The new Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Bim Afolami) , will single-handedly ensure that the City and stock market remain competitive, building on the superb foundations laid by his predecessor, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) .
The job of the new Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Nigel Huddleston) , will be to work out how to bring taxes down, following in the footsteps of his excellent predecessor, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins) , who as Health Secretary will no doubt be trying to push them up.
There is widespread consensus that growth is essential to the economy.
With 800,000 fewer self-employed in the economy post covid and post IR35, does the Chancellor agree that increasing the VAT threshold to £250,000 for new registrations would boost growth and be a net gain in revenue terms in the  long run?
