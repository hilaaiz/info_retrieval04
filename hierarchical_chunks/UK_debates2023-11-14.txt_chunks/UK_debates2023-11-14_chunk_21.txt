I thank my hon.
Friend for his interest in this issue—of course, he has great experience of local government.
Working with the former Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) , who I see is in the Chamber, we announced major reforms in July to help local government pension funds lead the way in the transformation we are looking for, in particular by sending a direction that they should invest in pools worth more than £50 billion.
That will make it easier for them to have the expertise necessary to invest in infrastructure.
