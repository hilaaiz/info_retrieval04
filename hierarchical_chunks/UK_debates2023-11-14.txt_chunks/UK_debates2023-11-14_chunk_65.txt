As of today, I am informed that no more aid will reach Gaza, not because it cannot get to the Rafah crossing or because it is piling up in Egypt, but because the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees has no fuel left and so the aid cannot be redistributed.
So although I really appreciate the Government looking at maritime and air efforts, and, crucially, at the need to open a second aid crossing to the west bank, there is no point—it is futile—unless we get the fuel to the UN.
Will my right hon.
Friend reassure me as to what is being done to change that situation?
Secondly, has the Foreign Office’s overseas judicial assistance assessment increased since  7 October —yes or no?
My hon.
Friend asks me about the position on fuel.
Fuel is desperately needed today—it is going to run out.
The United Nations has been accessing dirty fuel, but now that is at an end and we are incredibly worried about the situation.
We are talking to the key American humanitarian intervenor, Mr Satterfield, about this.
We are working diplomatically to do everything we can to make sure that the position on fuel is addressed, as we have been doing since I last updated the House.
I did not catch the first part of my hon.
Friend’s final question, so I will write to her on that point.
