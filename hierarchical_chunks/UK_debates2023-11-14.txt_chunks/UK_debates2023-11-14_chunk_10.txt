The Secretary of State for Defence and my predecessor, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Andrew Griffith) , recently set out that the values within ESG practices of financial institutions should never undermine capabilities developed to help us preserve peace and security.
The Treasury recently consulted on a potential regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers, which aims to improve transparency and promote good conduct.
I hope this will address some of the issues that defence companies have raised.
ESG is so vital when it comes to investing in all our services, including defence.
We were promised that the “Greening Finance” road map would come out at the end of 2022.
Then we were told that the consultation would come out by autumn this year.
It is still just about autumn, and it is yet to come out.
Why are the Government kicking ESG down the road?
Why have they stopped caring about ESG, and when will we have the consultation to get a UK green taxonomy sorted?
