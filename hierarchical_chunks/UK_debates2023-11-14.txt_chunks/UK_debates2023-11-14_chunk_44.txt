I welcome my hon.

One of the reasons why our productivity is 15% lower than Germany’s, for example, is that it invests 2% more as a proportion of its GDP than we do in the UK.
Improving the rate of business investment is one of the most effective ways to boost productivity and people’s real disposable income.
We are proud of what we introduced in the spring Budget, and we will continue to see whether it is possible to extend it further.
