Some 28% of people in Chester have a mortgage and they are still bearing the burden of the Government’s disastrous mini-budget.
They deserve peace of mind that mortgage rates will come down soon, so what is the Chancellor going to do about it?
Can I say gently to the hon.
Lady that interest rates have gone up by 3% in the UK since then?
That is just above the United States and just below the eurozone, so this is a global phenomenon.
There is no short cut to bringing down interest rates.
We have to support the Bank of England as it bears down on inflation and then we can bring mortgage rates down.
Will the Chancellor look at the red tape around the apprenticeship levy?
Many businesses in my area, such as Asda, Amazon and DPD, all say that they want to take on more apprenticeships but that the red tape around how they spend the money is very difficult.
This is something that he could change overnight, and really help to grow and boost our economy.
