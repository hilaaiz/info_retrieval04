I welcome my hon.
Friend to his new role.
I hope that he will know not only that the only way is Essex, but that Essex is a net contributor to the Treasury.
We want more economic growth in Essex.
In a week’s time, we will have the autumn statement, so may I give a message to those on the Treasury Front Bench?
May I appeal to the Chancellor in particular to look at lowering the rates of personal and business taxation, particularly the areas of business rates, corporation tax and all aspects to do with enabling people to keep more of the money they earn?
