I thank the Minister for that response but, of course, interest rates have made matters much more difficult for graduates, who cannot afford to both pay off their student loan and buy their own property.
Is there anything further that the Government can do to help graduates, who are struggling to do both?
One of the things we could do is raise the threshold at which they start to pay back the loans.
