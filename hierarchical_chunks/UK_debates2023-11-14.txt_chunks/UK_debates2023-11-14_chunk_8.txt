I welcome the Minister to his place.
The Government have the opportunity next week to right an historical wrong by abolishing non-dom tax status.
The Chancellor could use that money to get our NHS back on its feet and to provide free breakfast clubs for all primary-age children, just as Labour has called for.
Is the abolition of non-dom tax status under consideration, or has the Prime Minister ruled it out again, for personal reasons?
