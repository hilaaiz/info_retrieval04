The right hon.
Gentleman asked me whether I will commit to working closely with you, Mr Speaker, and of course there is only one answer to that question.
That wasn’t much reassurance, was it?
[Laughter.]
In addition, I will seek to ensure the fullest possible accountability, as you set it out, Mr Speaker.
The right hon.
Gentleman speaks of the scale of death and misery.
All deaths of civilians are to be profoundly regretted.
He talked about the scenes from the Al-Shifa Hospital, which will have shocked every Member of this House.
He, like me, will be aware that 102 humanitarian workers, who placed their lives in jeopardy to support their fellow human beings, have lost their lives.
He asks me about the ICC.
It is not for me to fetter or speak in the place of its chief prosecutor, but the right hon.
Gentleman will know that he has spoken and will do so again.
The right hon.
Gentleman called for the hostages to be released, and I hope that everyone in this House will echo that.
He said that Hamas are terrorists and suggested that some do not recognise that.
I agree with him and hope that every Member of the House will make it clear that Hamas are terrorists.
A dreadful pogrom took place on  7 October , where more Jewish people lost their lives in a day than at any time since the holocaust, and that piece of information is fundamental to our appreciation of the events to which he referred.
