I thank my hon.
Friend and, indeed, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Scunthorpe (Holly Mumby-Croft)  for their extensive lobbying on this very important issue.
I have had meetings with him and her, and with many others, to discuss it.
I reassure him that we are absolutely committed to steel production in the United Kingdom, and to making sure that any changes that are necessary support the local communities that depend on steel production.
