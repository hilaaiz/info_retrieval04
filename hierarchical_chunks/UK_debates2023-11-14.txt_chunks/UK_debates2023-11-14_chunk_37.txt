I thank my hon.
Friend for raising the support we give to small businesses.
As he will know, supporting small businesses, particularly by rolling over   the retail, hospitality and leisure business rates discount of 75%, was a major feature of the autumn statement.
We will continue to keep under review anything that we can do to help our small businesses.
