I thank the hon.
Member for his question, which is incredibly important.
As he knows, this Government are absolutely committed to ensuring that jobs in the defence sector, within an ESG framework, are protected.
I am happy to meet him to discuss further the issues relating to his constituency and Northern Ireland.
