I thank the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Gareth Davies)  for his recent visit to Darlington, where he opened a new branch of Darlington Building Society.
He will know   from that visit the impact that Treasury jobs are having locally, including an additional £80 million of spending in our local economy.
Does he agree with me that Darlington Economic Campus is a fantastic levelling-up project, ensuring that people can stay local but go far?
