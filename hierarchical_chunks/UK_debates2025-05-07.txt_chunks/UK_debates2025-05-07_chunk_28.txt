I welcome the Minister’s measured and thoughtful response to President Trump’s latest announcement and his full-throated support for the British film industry.
He will be aware that my constituency is very much a filming venue for both film and television.
In his discussions with the United States, will he ensure that he is also championing high-end television, as I think he briefly mentioned, which is often filmed, produced and made in Hackney?
I also make a plea for all the creative industries in my constituency that feed into the film industry.
Can the Minister ensure there is good communication from the Government on these negotiations?
This is creating a great a deal of uncertainty.
