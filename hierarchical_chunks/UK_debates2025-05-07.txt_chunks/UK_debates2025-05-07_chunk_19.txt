I thank the hon.
Lady for raising that very important issue.
I am sure that Members on both sides of the House would support a memorial to the service and sacrifice of those veterans.
The bravery and service of individuals such as Captain Tilley, and others in the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit and the photographic interpretation units, saved the lives of many servicemen and servicewomen and, of course, civilians, and—as the hon.
Lady rightly pointed out—the cost was the many casualties in those units.
As we mark the 80th anniversary of VE Day, we will remember those who helped to secure our greatest victory.
