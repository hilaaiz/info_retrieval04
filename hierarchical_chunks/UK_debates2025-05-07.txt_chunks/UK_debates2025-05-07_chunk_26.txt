I welcome the fact that the Minister recognises the film industry in this country as a jewel in our crown of world-leading creative industries.
I also point out that the sector alone is worth £1.96 billion here, and supports 195,000 jobs up and down the country.
It shows off our great British culture and values, the talent we have, and some of the most amazing settings for so many films of different genres.
