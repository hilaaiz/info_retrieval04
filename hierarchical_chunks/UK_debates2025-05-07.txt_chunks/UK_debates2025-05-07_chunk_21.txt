I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this issue.
The contrast, as she points out, is stark.
In England and Wales, waiting lists are falling, with over 3 million extra appointments already delivered.
In Scotland, the SNP Government have just introduced their fifth NHS recovery plan in just four years.
They have had the biggest Budget settlement since devolution and nearly two decades in power.
They still have no idea how to fix the NHS, and they have run out of excuses.
