only wrestler to win three titles two years in a row.
In August, Amit won an Olympic gold medal in the women's freestyle 68kg wrestling event.
This historic victory made Amit the youngest wrestler from Team USA to ever win gold.
Since 2019, Amit has accumulated 42 wins and outscored her opponents 375-19.
We are eager to see her make history again in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
Our community is beyond proud of Amit and it has been a delight to root for her during this year's Paris Olympics alongside California's 10th Congressional District.
Please join me in congratulating Amit on her incredible accomplishments and the many more to come.
