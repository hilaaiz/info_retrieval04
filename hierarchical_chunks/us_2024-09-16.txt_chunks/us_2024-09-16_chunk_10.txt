Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember the extraordinary life of Edward ``Ed'' D. Pettitt, Sr. Born on June 27, 1961, in Newfane, NY.
Ed was a man of deep conviction and unwavering principles.
Raised on his family's farm, Ed's early years were steeped in the values of hard work, independence, and a deep connection to the land.
He was the beloved son of George and Marion Pettitt, who instilled in him a commitment to family and community that would guide him throughout his life, A brilliant student, Ed graduated as valedictorian from Newfane High School in 1980.
He then attended the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, graduating magna cum laude in 1986.
His love of learning led him to further his education, obtaining a Master of Science in 1998, followed by a second Master's in Creative Studies from SUNY College at Buffalo in 2002.
Ed's professional career was marked by innovation and excellence.
Over his 35-year tenure at Mahle (formerly Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems), he earned more than 20 patents and was inducted into the Delphi Automotive Systems Innovation Hall of Fame in 1997.
His dedication to his work culminated in receiving the prestigious 2013 ``Boss'' Kettering Award, and he retired as a Product Engineering Manager in 2020.
However, Ed's legacy extends far beyond his professional achievements.
He was a man deeply committed to First Principles Thinking--a philosophy that guided his approach to life, problemsolving, and civic engagement.
Ed believed in the importance of returning to fundamental truths and using them as a foundation to build solutions, a method that influenced both his engineering work and his advocacy.
Central to Ed's belief system was the conviction that natural rights--those to life, liberty, and property--originated not from any earthly government, but from our Creator.
He held that these rights were inalienable and that governments were instituted among men to protect them, not to grant them.
This belief fueled his passionate advocacy for the Second Amendment, as he viewed the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental protection of these God-given rights.
To safeguard these principles, Ed founded the Second Amendment For Ever (SAfE) organization in Niagara County.
He was a staunch defender of the rights of responsible gun owners, believing that public safety and personal security were interdependent, both sustained by the individual's right to self-defense.
Ed's commitment to
