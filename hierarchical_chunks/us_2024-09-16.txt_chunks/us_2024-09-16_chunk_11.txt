this cause was rooted in his deepseated belief that the Second Amendment was essential to preserving all other freedoms.
Ed also championed the rights of farmers and the agricultural community in Niagara County.
Recognizing the challenges faced by rural areas under the current political system, he was a vocal advocate for Rural Electoral Equity.
He argued that rural communities were politically disenfranchised, with power disproportionately concentrated in urban centers like New York City.
Ed believed this imbalance undermined the principles of a republic, where all regions should have an equal voice in governance.
His advocacy extended to challenging the 1964 Supreme Court ruling in ``Reynolds v. Sims,'' which mandated that Senate districts be apportioned based on population rather than by county.
Ed contended that this ruling led to political gerrymandering that favored urban areas at the expense of rural communities, affecting key issues such as gun control, energy, land use, and criminal justice.
Ed's vision was to make Niagara County a leading example of how rural areas could assert their rights and push back against state overreach.
He worked tirelessly to build coalitions with other counties, strengthen local government, and create barriers to state infringement.
As part of his efforts to support the agricultural community, Ed helped form the Niagara County Agricultural Rights Advisory Panel, ensuring that the voices of local farmers were heard and their rights protected.
His contributions to the community were recognized through several awards, including the 2018 Ken Burner Memorial Award and the 2022 Oliver Jones Memorial Award Sportsperson of the Year from the Niagara County Federation of Conservation Clubs, Inc.
Above all, Ed was a devoted family man.
He married his high school sweetheart, Lisa (Bowers) Pettitt, in 1981, and together they raised four sons: Edward II, Jonathon, Michael, and Thomas.
He was a loving grandfather to five grandchildren, with whom he shared his love of the outdoors, including fishing, camping, kayaking, and farming.
Edward D. Pettitt, Sr. will be remembered as a man of integrity, a fierce defender of constitutional rights, and a tireless advdcate for rural communities.
His legacy lives on through his family, his community, and the many lives he touched with his unwavering commitment to freedom, justice, and the principles upon which this Nation was founded.
