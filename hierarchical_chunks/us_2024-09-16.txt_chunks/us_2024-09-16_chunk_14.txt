Mr. Speaker, Martin Griffin was an innovative leader who never shied from an opportunity to advocate for our environment and the health of future generations.
It was my privilege to know Marty and consider him a friend.
His legacy in Marin County, California, and beyond cannot be understated.
I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing my appreciation for his lifetime of good work.
