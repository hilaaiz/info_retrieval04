Mr. Reed was born in New York City, NY in 1934.
His military career began as a member of Cornell's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.
He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering as Cadet Colonel, the highest-ranking officer in his class.
Shortly thereafter, he was commissioned as Second Lieutenant in the Air Force.
Mr. Reed served until 1959, ending his active-duty career as Technical Project Manager for the Minuteman Re-Entry Vehicle System with the Air Force's Ballistic Missile Division.
While enlisted in the Air Force, 
Mr. Reed simultaneously attended the University of Southern California where he completed his Master's Degree in electrical engineering.
He later moved to the Bay Area where he was stationed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory as a chief strategist working to develop new thermonuclear weapons systems.
This work contributed to the end of the Cold War and launched his political career.
As one of the key scientific minds behind the invention of thermonuclear devices being tested in the Pacific Ocean during the early 1960s, 
Mr. Reed earned the respect of his peers including Manhattan Project member Edward Teller.
In 1973, he was appointed as Assistant to the Secretary.
Just a few years later, under President Gerald Ford's administration, 
Mr. Reed was named Secretary of the Air Force, a post he held until the beginning of President Carter's term in 1977.
Throughout his life, 
Mr. Reed held many passions including writing and winemaking.
What started as a small hobby growing wine grapes in Sonoma County's Alexander Valley would eventually transform into the renowned Clos du Bois Winery, which by the late 1980s, would sell more than 200,000 cases of wine per year.
