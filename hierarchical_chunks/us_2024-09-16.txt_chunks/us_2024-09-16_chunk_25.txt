Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Assyrian community in the Central Valley.
In particular, Stanislaus County has had a long history of Assyrians seeking refuge from religious persecution and genocide in their ancestral homelands known as Mesopotamia.
This vibrant and thriving community is determined to preserve the language, heritage, culture, and their identity as Christians.
Over fifty thousand Assyrian Americans call Stanislaus County home.
The 10th Anniversary of the Assyrian Festival hosted by the Assyrian Church of the East local parishes bring thousands of visitors to the Turlock Fairgrounds to celebrate the rich heritage, cuisine, and traditional dances of the Assyrian culture.
The Assyrian language, heritage, and culture form the bedrock of Assyrian communities in the Central Valley, which anchors them in traditions that span millennia while also acting as guiding lights that propel them successfully forward while preserving their unique narrative.
In addition, the Assyrian Church of the East's most ancient faith dating back to the first century of Christianity offers this community spiritual nourishment.
This heritage instills pride, and the language and culture fosters unity.
Together, they empower the Assyrian people worldwide to preserve the rich legacy and advance as a vibrant community, forging connections across generations and continents, ensurIng their enduring presence in the tapestry of humanity.
Therefore, 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in proudly recognizing the Assyrian community in the Central Valley of California for its invaluable contributions to our Nation's history, culture, and prosperity as we celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Assyrian Festival this month.
