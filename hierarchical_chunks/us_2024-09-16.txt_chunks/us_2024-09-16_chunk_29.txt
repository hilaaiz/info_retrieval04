Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees, subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.
This title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or changes in the meetings as they occur.
As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the Meetings scheduled for Tuesday, September 17, 2024 may be found in the Daily Digest of today's Record.
