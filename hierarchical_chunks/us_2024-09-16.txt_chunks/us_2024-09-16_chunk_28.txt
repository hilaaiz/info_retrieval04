positively impacted the health and well-being of many of our low-income residents.
Since the Foundation's inception nearly two decades ago, founders Billy and Nancy Thompson have fostered an environment that places families and their concerns first.
To date, the Thompson Family Foundation has helped conduct over 5,000 autism spectrum disorder diagnostic evaluations through the Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopment at the University.
In addition, the foundation contrIbutes equipment, like that used for cardiac and vision screening, and has recently led the expansion of patient examination rooms at the Lestonnac Clinic.
The Foundation is currently funding efforts to open the Nation's first dedicated free surgery center, which would allow uninsured community members to receive non-life-threatening surgery procedures, like hernia repairs or colonoscopies, that are often neglected.
Providing quality health services to our community is critical--and through the Thompson Family's involvement and leadership, the Lestonnac Clinic will be able to continue providing essential preventative care to their patients.
I'd like to thank Billy and Nancy, important leaders in our Orange County community who have demonstrated their commitment to caring for our children and families.
The work of the Thompson Family Foundation continues to be an important cornerstone of support for healthcare services to our district's low-income and uninsured residents, and I join our community in thanking them for the great work they do.
