Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that Thomas Reed was a dedicated public servant who will be missed and whose many contributions to the Sonoma County region and Nation are worthy of commendation.
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor his many contributions and express our deep condolences to his family and friends.
