Mr. FRY.
Mr. Speaker, Constitution Day is a time set aside to commemorate the signing of the Constitution of the United States of America--the most important document in our Nation's history.
In 1787, the thirty-nine men that convened in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, forever altered history when they formed the supreme law of our land--written by the people, for the people.
Through times of prosperity and times of hardship, our constitution has never wavered.
Let this Constitution Day remind us of the liberty, justice, and freedom for all--and the never-ending pursuit of a more perfect union.
