Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise with Congressman Mike Thompson to honor Thomas Care Reed, who passed away at the age of 89 on February 11, 2024, and his extensive public service to the United States and local Sonoma County community.
Mr. Reed served as the 11th Secretary of the United States Air Force and was a dedicated public servant to three former Presidents.
