Representative DeGette, to honor the life of an extraordinary Coloradan.
John Fielder was a prolific nature photographer who lived in Summit County since 2006.
Over 50 books have been published showing his photography.
John also worked to protect Colorado's ranches, public lands, and wildlife.
Over his 40 year career, John was recognized on several occasions for his work.
He received the 1993 Sierra Club Ansel Adams Award, the 2011 the Aldo Leopold Foundation's first Achievement Award ever given to an individual, and an Honorary Degree in Sustainability Studies from Colorado Mountain College.
We thank John for his work elevating the natural beauty of Colorado and for fighting to protect our pristine lands.
