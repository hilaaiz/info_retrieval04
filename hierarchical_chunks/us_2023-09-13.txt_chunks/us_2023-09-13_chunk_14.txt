Mr. Speaker, in his 1983 Memorial Day address, Ronald Reagan said, ``We are forever indebted to those who have given their lives that we might be free.''
As a Nation, we must never take for granted the liberties we enjoy today, recognizing that these freedoms have been hard-won by the honor, commitment, and sacrifice of our Veterans.
Each Member in this chamber and citizen in these United States should be humbled by the courage of the brave Veterans who voluntarily underwent the dangers necessary to preserve our country.
Colleagues, please join me in thanking these Veterans and the volunteers of Honor Flight of Oregon for their remarkable service and devotion to our great country.
