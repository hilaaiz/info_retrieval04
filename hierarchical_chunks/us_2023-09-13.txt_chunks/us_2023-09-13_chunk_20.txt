dedication earned him great respect among his colleagues and everyone he encountered at the Port.
Jim's storied career paralleled the growth of the Port.
When Jim first started working at the marina in the 1970s, the Port hosted fishermen, mill workers and log tug crews; its central marina was home to fewer than 1,000 slips.
Over the next 50 years, Jim played a central role in the transformation of the Port from an industrial waterfront into the largest public marina on the West Coast, helping to design, build, maintain and upgrade many of the marina's facilities, as well as the Jetty Landing boat launch, Jetty Island docks and Boxcar Park.
Today, the new and improved Port is the ``jewel of Snohomish County,'' a place where people can work, shop, go out to eat and enjoy the outdoors, thanks to the hard work of people like Jim Weber.
Jim was involved in and had time to enjoy many of the great events the Port offers throughout the year, including Wheels on the Waterfront, Sail-In Cinema, Holiday on the Bay, waterfront concerts, Opening Day of Boating and fishing derby events.
