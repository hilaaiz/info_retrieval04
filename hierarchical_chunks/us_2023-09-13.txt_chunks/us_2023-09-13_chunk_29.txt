Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring the remarkable life.
Danny often quoted a Morman hymn: ``Do what is right, let the consequence follow.''
Danny lived by those words, and the people of South Carolina are better off because of his adherence to them.
I will always remember Danny and he will be sorely missed.
