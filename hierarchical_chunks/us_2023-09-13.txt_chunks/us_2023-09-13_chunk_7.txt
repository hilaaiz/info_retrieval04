Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and self-motivated leader, Pastor Larry Benford.
He has shown what can be done through hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve.
Pastor Larry Benford surrendered his heart to God at a very young age and he has been declaring the good news of the Lord Jesus Christ since then.
A native of Leland, Pastor Benford graduated from Leland High School and Mississippi Valley State University, where he received a bachelor's degree in environmental health with a minor in Chemistry.
He also has received training from The University of Illinois at Chicago as well as formal Biblical tutelage from Lifeway Christian and New Orleans Theological Seminary.
Pastor Benford is an anointed leader.
With pastoral services expanding over two decades, through the help of the Holy Spirit, he has served as Deacon, Sunday School Director, Assistant Pastor, and Pastor at Greater Springfield, Victory Temple and Mount Carmel Churches, respectively.
As pastor of Living Word Fellowship Church since October 10, 1999, he has always taken the stance that the Word must be taught with passion and boldness--without compromise--in order that the lost will be saved, and the saved will be strengthened.
Growing together in the Word of God, Pastor Larry and First Lady Wanda Benford are consummate students of the Word and outspoken believers in its ability to change lives for the better.
Pastor Larry and First Lady Wanda Benford's greatest desire is that others would develop an intimate, personal relationship with the Lord.
Pastor Larry and First Lady Wanda Benford have been married for 32 years.
To this union, they have been blessed with 3 daughters, Keyna, Leslie and Ariel and 3 grandchildren, La'Kya, Kylar and Gervase.
