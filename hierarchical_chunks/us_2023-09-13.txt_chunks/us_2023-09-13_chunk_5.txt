Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and self-motivated leader, Kelvin Reed.
Kelvin Reed has shown what can be done through hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve.
Kelvin Reed was one of Warren Central's top boys' basketball players in the late 1980s.
He led the Vikings in scoring as a sophomore, and steals and assists as a junior and senior, and was twice selected to The Vicksburg Post's All-County team.
Reed averaged 15 points, 7 assists and 3 steals per game over three varsity seasons.
After high school, Reed moved on to Pensacola Junior College in Florida.
He set the school's assists record and led the team to the 1993 NJCAA Division I national championship.
Reed was inducted into the 2022 Vicksburg Warren School District Athletic Hall.
