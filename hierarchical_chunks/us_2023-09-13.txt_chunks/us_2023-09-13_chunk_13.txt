Mr. BENTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Vietnam and Korean War Veterans from Oregon's Second Congressional District who, through the efforts of Honor Flight of Oregon, are visiting their memorials on the National Mall.
When I meet these heroes, I am reminded of the enduring words of George S. Patton, Jr., who said, ``The highest obligation and privilege of citizenship is that of bearing arms for one's country.''
These words, 
Mr. Speaker, still ring true today.
Those who value liberty are indebted to these heroes, for each one of them defended our freedom through acts of service, sacrifice, and bravery on behalf of our country.
It is my privilege to include in the Record their names.
The Veterans on this Honor Flight from Oregon are: Joshua Alvarez, Army; Dennis Anderson, Navy; Thomas Beckley, Army; Jerry Chartier, Sr, Marine Corps; Fredd Conn, Marine Corps; David Cunningham, Navy; William Duncan, Army; Richard Gehrke, Navy/Marine Corps; Edward Goodman, Navy; Roger Haynes, Air Force/Army; Robert Howerton, Navy; Michael Hoffman, Navy; David Johnson, Army; Earl Kilpatrick, Air Force; Jesse Redding, Navy; Paul Lofland, Army; Robert Long, Marine Corps; Jesus Lopez, Air Force; Preton Manville II, Marine Corps; William Mathews, Army/Air Force; Lawrence Mixon, Jr, Army; Charles Owen, Army; Robert Rammin, Army; Steven Rolston, Army; Loyd Thurman, Army; Jerry White, Army; and Otto William, Air Force.
These heroes join over 260,000 Veterans, who since 2005, have been honored through the nationwide Honor Flight Network of volunteers.
I would also like to recognize the volunteers and guardians traveling on this trip: Janet Wilkerson, and the guardians who have also served our country: Kathrine Berg, Army; Jody William, III, Marine Corps.
