Mr. Speaker, Jim Weber's accomplishments are many, and his commitment to the Port of Everett is remarkable.
As Jim told the Everett Herald in a recent article, he plans to dig his toes in the sand a bit and buy a few more classic cars in retirement.
Congratulations to Jim on a wellearned retirement.
We hope to see him showing off his newest classic car at Wheels on the Waterfront.
