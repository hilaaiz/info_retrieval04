Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Lieutenant Jessica Wyman of the Nashua Fire Department, who, on November 28, 2023, passed away after her battle with cancer.
Lieutenant Wyman was not only an exemplary public servant working two jobs as a firefighter and an ER nurse, but also a trailblazer for women in the fire service.
She was the first female firefighter to be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in Nashua Fire Department history.
She also led week-long summer camps to help women get involved in the fire service.
Lieutenant Wyman will be remembered as many things: a hero, a professional, a civil servant, a trailblazer, a community leader, and a friend.
My heart is with Jessica's husband, Chris, her family, and the Nashua Fire Department.
May she rest in peace.
