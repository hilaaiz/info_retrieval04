Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Taylor Doggett and her tremendous work as my Communications Director.
In her time in my office, she has been an outstanding leader, mentor, and colleague.
It is with gratitude that I thank her for her work and her talents.
From day one, Taylor has been dedicated to ensuring that the constituents of my district felt connected to my work, both at home and in Washington.
She developed a streamlined process for expanding and managing contact with constituents on the issues that matter most to them.
Under her leadership, we were able to expand our subscriber base significantly and provide accessible channels for the people of the 39th District to feel connected to their Member of Congress and this legislative body.
Taylor proved to be a strong advocate and valuable voice for our most important legislative priorities.
She steered our communications team through some of our greatest legislative accomplishments, including the introduction of the Equality Act and the passage of the Korean Valor Act into law.
Despite the challenges of being in the minority, her innovative vision for our social media stood out.
To the members of her communications team, she has been a mentor and a model of running an effective, relationship-based comms shop.
Above all, Taylor has been a joyful presence in my office.
She is cheerful, sharp, and quick-witted, and her jokes often make it to my social media pages.
She is known for always being good for a laugh or a heart-to-heart chat among my staff.
Wherever she may go down the road, she will always be a member.
I am enormously grateful to Taylor for her contributions.
She will be dearly missed, and I wish her luck in her next adventure.
