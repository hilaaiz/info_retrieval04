Mr. KILDEE.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in recognizing 
Ms. Lucetia Manwaring as she marks her retirement from public service after 30 years as a congressional staff member.
As a Casework Manager in my office, 
Ms. Manwaring has established herself as a dedicated and distinguished professional with a demonstrated record of achievement.
Lucetia has served our country in many ways, including in the U.S. Navy from 1989 to 1993.
During this time, she served on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Nuclear Repair Division; served honorably in U.S. Desert Storm campaign; and was a member of the U.S. Ready Reserve from 1993 to 2000.
In addition, she has received several awards, including the Navy Wide Command Award, the National Defense Service Medal for Desert Storm, and a Naval Citation.
Lucetia received her Master of Science in Human Services from Capella University, and her Bachelor of Business Administration from Davenport University.
She was a member of the Dean's List upon completing both degrees.
Since 1994, 
Ms. Manwaring has helped thousands of constituents throughout the state.
Her tenure began as a staff member for my uncle, retired U.S. Congressman Dale Kildee.
She met Congressman Dale Kildee while serving in the Navy and began her career as a staff member shortly thereafter.
Upon his retirement, I was grateful to have her join my staff as well.
