Mr. AMO.
Mr. Speaker, Rhode Islanders know that small businesses are the backbone of every city and town in our great state.
It is my distinct pleasure to honor Small Business Administrator District Director for Rhode Island Mark Hayward for his long and important service to our state.
Mark's service has benefited small businesses and the constituents of our First Congressional District in innumerable ways.
I applaud his decades of commitment, and I express my gratitude on behalf of Rhode Islanders across every community for Mark's dedication.
I understand Mark's retirement has been planned since before the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, Mark opted to continue to serve an additional few long years to help ensure that the Rhode Island small business community saw its way through the crisis.
Mark's decision to help his community get to the other side of such a major event is the mark of a true public servant--one who is willing to put others first no matter the circumstances.
The success of so many small businesses across our state is because business leaders, Mark's steady leadership was a lifeline.
Whether helping small businesses navigate the Paycheck Protection Program or helping new business owners access the technical resources they needed to be successful, Mark has been relentlessly focused on growing our economy through his public service during his long and effective entire career.
I wish Mark some very well-deserved rest and time off with his wife Nancy, his children, and grandchildren.
I know Mark's commitment to our community is thread throughout every fiber of his being and that he will continue to serve his fellow Rhode Islanders for many years to come.
Happy retirement to Mark, and I thank him for all he has done for Rhode Island.
