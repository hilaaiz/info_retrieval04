making him the longest-serving sheriff in the history of the State of Georgia.
Born in 1932 in Bonaire, Georgia, 
Mr. Talton was a Houston County commissioner and a dairy farmer before being elected sheriff in 1972.
When he first took office, Mr, Talton was responsible for a department of just 28 employees, which has grown to over 300 today.
Additionally, Houston County had a population of 63,000 in 1972 and now boasts over 170,000 residents, which 
Mr. Talton has selflessly dedicated his career to protecting and serving.
He is a shining example for all law enforcement officers to aspire to.
Family and friends describe Sheriff Talton as a ``role model,'' a ``servant,'' and a ``peacekeeper.''
He has embodied the meaning of each County.
I wish 
Mr. Talton a long and healthy retirement, surrounded by the family and friends he has served tirelessly throughout his esteemed career.
I would like to thank Sheriff Talton for his years of service to our community and our country.
It is an honor to represent such outstanding constituents like him in the Eighth Congressional District.
