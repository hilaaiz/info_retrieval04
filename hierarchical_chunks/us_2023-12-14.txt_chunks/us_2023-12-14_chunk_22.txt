Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Phoebus High School Football Team from Hampton, Virginia on becoming the Virginia High School League's Class 4 State Champions.
On Saturday, December 9, 2023, the Phoebus Phantoms won the Class 4 State Championship Game against the Salem High School Spartans with a score of 21-14.
This is the third year in a row Phoebus High School has claimed a state championship title following two consecutive victories in the Class 3 division.
Led by Coach Jeremy Blunt, the Phantoms won this title on the tail end of an equally astounding season.
Phoebus High School closed their season undefeated, with a record of 15 wins and 0 losses, and maintained a 35-game winning streak going back to the two previous seasons.
Throughout the game, the Phantoms and Spartans fought back and forth for control of the scoreboard, with the victor only being determined in the final moments of the game.
The two teams, tied 14-14, were seemingly set for a showdown in overtime.
But with one second remaining on the clock, freshman quarterback Maurikus Banks completed a pass to senior wide receiver Keyontae Gray, who ran the ball for an 86-yard touchdown to secure the championship.
The determination it took for these young athletes to keep fighting down to the end is an example for all of us.
Because of their hard work, they have made our community proud.
