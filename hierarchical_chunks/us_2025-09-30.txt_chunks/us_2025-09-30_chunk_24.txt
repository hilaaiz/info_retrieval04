Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the 100th anniversary of the West End Fire Company No. 2, Quakertown, Pennsylvania, in extending a heartfelt thank you to the men and women who have served, and continue to serve, in this distinguished Fire Company.
May the next 100 years of Firefighters serve with the same valor, honor, dignity, and dedication to duty as the exemplary men and women of the West End Fire Co.
No. 2 have so expertly demonstrated over the last century of service.
