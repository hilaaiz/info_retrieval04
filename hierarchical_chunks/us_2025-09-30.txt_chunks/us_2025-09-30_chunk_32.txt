Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable life and legacy of my good friend, Albert J. ``Al'' Llorens.
Born and raised in Chicago, Al grew up in Englewood on the Southwest side and attended Chicago Public Schools.
He went on to earn his bachelor's degree in mathematics education from the University of Illinois at Champaign and later a master's degree in curriculum and instruction from National Louis University.
Al was, above all, a good man.
He believed deeply that making the world a better place begins in the classroom.
For more than 30 years, he poured his heart into teaching mathematics and coaching at the high school level.
He loved the classroom and dedicated himself to empowering the next generation of students.
But Al's impact reached far beyond the walls of any classroom.
Even when he stepped away from teaching--always calling it a ``leave of absence'' rather than a retirement--he carried his passion for students into his work with the Illinois Education Association.
Before being elected IEA president in 2023, Al served two terms each as vice president and secretary/treasurer, working tirelessly to address the teacher shortage crisis in Illinois and to ensure that every student had access to a higher quality education.
As president of the IEA, he was a giant in education, fighting for his beloved teachers and students until the very end.
Al dedicated his life to strengthening public education as he believed deeply in its power to transform communities, leaving a legacy that will continue to change the lives of many.
I will miss Al not only for what he accomplished, but for how he carried himself.
He was a friend to all, a leader who combined compassion with resolve, and a fierce advocate for public education.
