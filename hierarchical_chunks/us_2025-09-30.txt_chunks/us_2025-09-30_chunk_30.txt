Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of H.E. Christian ``Chris'' Peeples, a dedicated public servant and tireless advocate for public transit whose decades of service improved the lives of countless residents in the East Bay and beyond.
Chris Peeples was first appointed to the AC Transit Board of Directors in November 1997 to fill one of the District's two At-Large Board positions.
He went on to earn the trust of voters time and again, being elected in 1998 and re-elected in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020.
Over the course of his distinguished tenure, he represented Ward 1--including Albany, El Cerrito, El Sobrante, Richmond, San Pablo, and the surrounding unincorporated communities--with energy, vision, and compassion.
A longtime champion for transit riders, Director Peeples was deeply engaged in the AC Bus Riders Union, Alliance for AC Transit, Regional Alliance for Transit, Alliance for Sensible Transit, and the Coalition for a One Stop Terminal, among many other groups.
His commitment extended beyond the Bay Area, as he actively participated in the Transportation Research Board of the National Academies and the American Public Transportation Association, where he elevated local priorities to national and international conversations.
Director Peeples was especially devoted to advancing clean transportation and was a strong proponent of AC Transit's groundbreaking zero-emission fuel cell bus program.
He spoke at and moderated panels across the country and abroad, promoting hydrogen and zero-emission transit as solutions to climate change and air pollution.
Chris was also a pillar of civic life, serving on the Oakland Ethics Commission and numerous community and political bodies.
A graduate of Crown College, University of California at Santa Cruz, and Hastings College of the Law, he combined his intellectual rigor with a passion for equity and sustainability.
Christian Peeples leaves behind a legacy of advocacy, innovation, and public service that will endure for generations.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his extraordinary life and in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, and the community he served so faithfully.
