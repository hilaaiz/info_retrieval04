Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to rise in recognition of the distinct achievements and serviceable contributions of the Quakertown West End Fire Company No. 2, on this occasion of their 100th anniversary as of September 25, 2025.
For a century, the men and women of the West End Fire Company No. 2 have served Upper Bucks County, Pennsylvania, with distinction, dedication, resilience, and valor.
West End Fire Company No. 2 is known as Bucks County Station No. 18 and has been completely staffed by volunteers since its formation in 1925.
Their unwavering dedication to continued training and willingness to serve their neighbors to meet the needs of the ever-changing fire service landscape is no better demonstrated than in their daily quick response to all types of emergencies.
Station No. 18 has modern fire equipment and is constantly adding to its services.
As expected, they have the most modern Fire Suppression equipment, Heavy Rescue equipment, and Water Rescue equipment.
The West End Fire Company No. 2 is a sister Company to Quakertown Fire Company No. 1, which both operate as the Quakertown Fire Department.
Throughout its long history, Station No. 18 has embodied the core values of: Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do.
They have safeguarded the Community, provided critical support in times of need, and stood ready to respond when called upon.
Their knowledge and skills, and superior operational support personnel, have been, and continue to be, some of the most skilled and dedicated in the fire service.
As we celebrate this historic milestone, it is my distinct honor to celeberate those who faithfully served in the West End Fire Company No. 2 over the past century.
Their sacrifices of their time and those of their families have ensured our fire safe security.
It is with deep gratitude that we acknowledge their service and pay tribute to their bravery.
