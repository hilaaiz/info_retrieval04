In Hawaii, we also regularly honor the over 250,000 Filipinos nationwide who answered the call to protect and defend America and the Philippines in the Pacific theater.
In 2016, President Obama signed into law the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act to bestow Congress's highest honor upon those veterans.
With my colleagues in the House, I have introduced our Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, which seeks to reunite World War II Filipino soldiers with their children, so that we can honor those living in our community who fought to protect the free and open Indo-Pacific that we have today.
Each and all these lives of achievement are but a small sampling of a broader community that has achieved so much and contributed so much to the rich fabric of our country.
And the story of Filipino Americans is still in its early chapters.
It is fully appropriate that we again honor our Filipino American community whose story is a quintessentially American story.
