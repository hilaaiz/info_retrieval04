She earned a degree in Agricultural Business Marketing with a minor in Fruit Science from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, where she met her husband, Tim.
After graduation, they moved to the Central Valley to continue their families' farming legacies.
Since marrying in 2010, Jenny and Tim have farmed almonds in Wasco and Shafter, instilling the values of hard work, stewardship, and love of the land in their children.
Before her advocacy work, Jenny spent five years in agricultural sales and later became a freelance writer, using her platform to connect farmers with consumers.
Known as ``Almond Girl Jenny,'' she has shared stories as a blogger, social media content creator, and freelance writer, strengthening the public connection to agriculture.
Jenny's leadership began early when she helped revitalize the Kern Young Farmers & Ranchers in 2011, serving as Chair for two years, and later as California YF&R State Chair in 2018.
She has been a Kern County Farm Bureau Board member since 2011, serving in multiple leadership roles, and has represented Kern and Kings counties on the California Farm Bureau Board since 2018.
Beyond Farm Bureau, Jenny's service extends to the Almond Board of California Leadership Program, the Wasco Planning Commission, and California Women for Agriculture.
She also brings a wealth of knowledge in water management and currently serves as Executive Director for multiple water agencies.
In 2020, Jenny and Tim launched a direct-to-consumer almond business, sharing their family farm and farm-fresh almonds with households across the country while continuing daily farm life with their young family.
