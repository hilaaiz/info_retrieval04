came together in partnership to establish the Toledo Technology Academy.
The legendary Local 14 leader Oscar Bunch, understanding the critical need for training in the advanced technologies taking shape, secured this innovative Toledo Public School in 1997 which thrives today.
Through the years UAW Local 14 has been an established and integral part of the fabric of our community, ensuring security for current workers and retirees, as well as making its mark on our community.
The union notes: ``We stand on the shoulders of giants and are immensely proud of our history.
As we move forward, UAW local 14 is committed to remaining a powerful, essential voice in our union and our community for many years to come.''
The great labor leader Walter Reuther explained, ``There is no greater calling than to serve your brother.
There is no greater contribution than to help the weak.
There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.''
Throughout it's nearly century of service, UAW Local 14 has met this challenge with honor.
I thank the Local 14 leadership--Tony Totty, Bernie LaPoint, Jr., Sue Rodgers, Rhoni Clark, Henry McCoy, all the shop stewards, and all their predecessors for their courage, consistency, and care.
Ninety years is no small achievement.
It is a testament to shared purpose, to collective power, and to neighborhoods knit together by trust and work.
May the halls of this Union always echo with the voices of the proud and the hopeful.
May Local 14 forever remain a pillar for workers, for Toledo, and for Northwest Ohio.
We applaud 90 glorious years of solidary, struggle, and strength and look toward a future carrying forward these ideals.
