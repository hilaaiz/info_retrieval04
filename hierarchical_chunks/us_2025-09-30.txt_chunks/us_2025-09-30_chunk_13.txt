Mr. Speaker, Congressman David Valadao and I invite our colleagues to join us in recognizing Jenny Holtermann for her dedication to family farming, leadership in agriculture, and service to her community, which have left a lasting mark on Kern County and the broader agricultural industry.
Her years of service and commitment to agriculture have strengthened the Farm Bureau and inspired meaningful progress throughout the agricultural community.
We wish her continued success as she moves forward from her role at the Kern County Farm Bureau.
