Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my colleague Congressman David Valadao to honor Jenny Holtermann, a fourthgeneration California farmer, water advocate, and strong communicator who has worked tirelessly to preserve family farming, elevate women's voices in agriculture, and strengthen the connection between growers and consumers.
As she steps down as President of the Kern County Farm Bureau, we have no doubt her leadership and service will continue to influence the Central Valley and its farming community.
Jenny was born and raised on her family's almond and walnut farm in Chico, California.
