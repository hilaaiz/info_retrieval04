Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very special occasion for UAW Local 14 in my District.
Tomorrow, on Wednesday, October 1, 2025, the union will celebrate 90 Years of Solidarity: A Milestone for UAW Local 14...
a testament to the enduring strength, unity, and unwavering spirit of our membership.
Throughout the decades, UAW Local 14 has been at the vanguard of manufacturing while at the same time ensuring worker rights, dignity and economic fairness, making history while leaving a legacy of accomplishments that continues to benefit workers across the Nation.
In 1935 a strike was called at Chevrolet Toledo.
During the threeweek strike, full bargaining rights were established as well as seniority.
These key elements laid the foundation for the union's strength yet today.
In 1936 a national agreement, led by founder Bob Travis, allowed for the saving of the Chevrolet plant.
This effort to spread unionization began with a 44-day ``sit-down strike'' and demonstrated the strength One of the most difficult strikes in Toledo--fifty years after the deadly Auto-Lite Strike--was the 285-day AP Parts strike.
The union held firm through this challenge to bring about a resolution beneficial to all.
Turning toward the future, UAW Local 14, General Motors, and Toledo Public Schools
