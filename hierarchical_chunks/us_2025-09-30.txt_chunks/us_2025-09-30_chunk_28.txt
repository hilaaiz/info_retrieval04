Mr. PATRONIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a remarkable man, Gus Butchikas, who passed away on September 21, 2025, after a courageous battle with cancer.
Gus was a beloved member of our community, a devoted husband and father, and a cherished friend to many, including myself.
Born into the legacy of Angelo's Steak Pit, Gus dedicated himself to preserving and enhancing the family business, ensuring that it remained a cornerstone.
His culinary talents were evident in the creation of signature recipes, including the renowned Greek dressing, which continues to be prepared exclusively by family members.
Beyond his professional achievements, Gus was known for his deep faith, kindness, and unwavering commitment to his community.
As a trusted confidant to governors, political leaders, and public servants, Gus played a pivotal role in guiding many of us in our public service journeys.
His wisdom, encouragement, and genuine care for others left an indelible mark on all who had the privilege of knowing him.
In this time of sorrow, our thoughts and prayers are with Patti, Angelo, Brittany, Evey, and the entire Butchikas family.
May they find comfort in the knowledge that Gus was called home to the Lord, where his spirit will continue to shine brightly.
May he rest in peace.
His legacy lives on in all of us.
