Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along with the 765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District in honoring 
Mr. Chris R. Sheridan for his service to his community, and all of humankind.
May God continue to bless him and his family as he continues on his journey to making the world a better place to live for all people.
