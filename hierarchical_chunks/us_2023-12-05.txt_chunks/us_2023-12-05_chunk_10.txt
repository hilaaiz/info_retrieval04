Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Staff Sergeant Johann Schrap of Rockwall, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
Sergeant Schrap honorably served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War.
As a young man, Sergeant Schrap sailed with his family when they immigrated to the United States.
As his ship passed by the Statue of Liberty, he understood that the values of democracy and freedom it represents and knew these come only through sacrifices.
During the Second World War, Sergeant Schrap's father helped provide refuge for Jewish citizens in the Netherlands from persecution by the Nazi regime.
For these actions, his father was imprisoned but was rescued by American forces when the Allies liberated Holland.
As a token of appreciation for American assistance to his family, Sergeant Schrap chose to serve his country and joined the Air Force.
He was eventually sent to Saigon, Vietnam as part of the 75th Military Airlift Squadron where he assisted in postal and administrative operations.
In this role, Sergeant Schrap managed incoming mail and ensured that soldiers received correspondence from home in a timely fashion.
For his service and contributions to our nation, Sergeant Schrap received several awards, including the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, and Silver Rose.
After returning home, Sergeant Schrap attended California Baptist University in California and later received a degree in Biblical Studies.
As part of the First Baptist Church in Garland, Texas, he participated in several mission trips to help rebuild homes that were damaged by natural disasters.
Sergeant Schrap ran a very successful small business specializing in home repairs, painting, and remodeling.
He is a member of Vietnam Veterans of America and Disabled American Veterans, where he conducts veteran outreach
