Ms. GARCIA.
Mr. Speaker, I was serving as Ranking Member in the House Financial Services Committee on November 29 when votes were called on the House Floor.
The Chairman did not recess the committee in time for me to make the first vote of the series, therefore I missed recording my vote on Roll Call No. 678.
Had I been able to vote, I would have voted NAY on Roll Call No. 678.
