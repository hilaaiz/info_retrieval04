Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate my Legislative Director and Counsel, Julian Johnson, and his wife Agnieszka Johnson (nee Dziadek), on the birth of their first child.
It was my honor to officiate the couple's wedding on October 22, 2016, and now I am delighted that their family continues to expand.
