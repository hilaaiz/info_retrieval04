Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brigadier General Michael ``Mike'' Cates of Frisco, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
General Cates honorably served in the United States Army as the 23rd Chief of the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps.
In 1980, General Cates followed in his family's footsteps and joined the Army after obtaining his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree at Texas A&M University.
He specialized in veterinary services in South Korea and Germany, and was the first veterinarian to command the Army's Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine.
I commend his extensive efforts to improve public health and the wellbeing of animals in the military.
For his exemplary service, General Cates was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, and several other awards.
In 2005, he was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Texas A&M's College.
After his retirement in 2008, General Cates continued to make profound impacts in his community in many ways.
He became a professor at Kansas State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and served as their Master.
As the Program Director, General Cates helped prepare students for success in public health careers.
When he retired from academia, he served as a board member for the Heritage Association and Pet Partners in Frisco.
In these roles, General Cates helped preserve Frisco's rich history and supported local animal shelters so that they may have a safe place to call home.
These actions highlight his commitment to uplifting the world around him and being a voice for those in need.
I am honored to represent BG Cates in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas.
