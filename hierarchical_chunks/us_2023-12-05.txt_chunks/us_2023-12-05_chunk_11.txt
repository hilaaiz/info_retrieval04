and provides guidance for veterans to receive assistance.
Sergeant Schrap also has a keen eye for spotting veterans in public, and he will happily engage with them in order to listen to their stories or help in any way he can.
I highly commend Sergeant Schrap for continuing to uplift the men and women who served our nation and uplifting the community around him.
I am honored to represent Sergeant Schrap in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas.
