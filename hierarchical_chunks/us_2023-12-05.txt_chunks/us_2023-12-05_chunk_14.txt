he held for more than fifty years.
As pastor, he dedicated his life and mission to service, fighting for justice for our communities and improving the lives of residents in Northwest Detroit.
He was a tireless advocate in the fight for safe housing for all and for affordable childcare for working families.
Pastor Adams served as President of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP in 1984 and served on its executive board consecutive years until 1992.
His bold and grounded leadership is a testament to his impactful work and legacy.
The 12th Congressional District sends our deepest and heartfelt condolences to Pastor Adams's family and to the entire Hartford Memorial Baptist Church family on this significant loss to our community.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Agnes Adams and his children, Dr. Tara Adams Washington and Reverend Charles Christian Adams.
Please join me in remembering Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams for his incredible spiritual leadership and impact on our district and the community.
May he rest in love and his legacy continue to impact our community.
