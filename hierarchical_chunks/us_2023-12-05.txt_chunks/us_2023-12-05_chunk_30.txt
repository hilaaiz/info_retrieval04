Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Wrightstown Tigers Football Team for their runner-up finish at the 2023 WIAA Division 5 State Boys Football Championship.
Following an impressive season and playoff run, the Wrightstown football team traveled to Camp Randall in Madison to compete in the 2023 WIAA State Football Championship Game.
With a record of 11-3 during the season, the Wrightstown team worked together all season to become a dominant force in the conference.
I commend head coach Steve Klister, the coaching staff, and the entire team for their unwavering commitment and dedication to an incredibly impressive season.
This being their first trip to the state championship since 2011, the entire team and community have much for which they should be proud.
Although they lost a tough battle to a talented La Crosse Aquinas team, the team displayed great skill and determination throughout the season.
Congratulations to the entire team for this remarkable achievement, and a special congratulations to the senior players on the team: Riley Verbeten, Quade Thompson, Payton Vande Hey, Kevin Biese, Riley Sundin, Landon Helphrey, Elijah Lemke, Ben Zemple, Sam Keuler, Charlie Garvey, Trent Vande Hey, Garrett Hitner, Brendan Gustafson, Carter Lamers, Everett Lamers, and Gavin Ducat.
