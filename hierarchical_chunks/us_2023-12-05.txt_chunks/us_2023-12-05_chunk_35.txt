Damian Scipio Johnson was born at 4:14 a.m. on Sunday, October 8, 2023, in Washington, D.C., and he is quite possibly the cutest baby the hospital has ever seen.
His given names represent strength and an indomitable spirit.
Damian is a dual citizen by birth, and he will always have a home in the United States and in Poland.
I have known Julian since 2009 and have long valued his contributions over the years to my office and to the people of the Second Congressional District.
He is an integral member of my team and champion for the American people, and I continue observing with great pride what the future holds for him both personally and professionally.
My wife Vivian and I give our best wishes to Julian and Agnieszka, their respective families, and their own growing family.
