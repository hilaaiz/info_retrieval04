I thank the hon.
Lady for her points.
She addressed a number of issues, but not the fact that when Labour were in government, it ran a similar scheme for three years.
Does she want to explain how many were released during that scheme?
I am sure that she will welcome the opportunity to update the House.
She talks about risk, and she is right to raise these important issues, but it is also important that we set them out clearly and calmly.
First, unlike the Labour scheme in  which those who had been sentenced to under 12 months were released with no licence conditions, everyone will have a licence condition.
We need to be clear about what that means.
Under Labour’s scheme, which ran for three years, there were no licence conditions at all.
Under our scheme there will be licence conditions.
