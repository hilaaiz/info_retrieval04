The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have been clear that we must be bolder, seizing hundreds of billions of pounds of frozen Russian assets to support the Ukraine war effort, and that we must get hold of the interest on those assets.
In February, the Prime Minister said, “And then, with the G7, we must find lawful ways to seize the assets themselves and get those funds to Ukraine too.”
Can the Minister update the House on progress within the G7?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to ask that question.
We are making progress, but he is also right to point out that what we do needs to be lawful.
That is the key thing, and that is what we are working on.
Would the Minister for development and Africa please update the House on his recent visit to Ethiopia?
