The Minister said that Israel has a duty to protect civilians, but in the west bank there have been 400 deaths.
There are now testimonies from Palestinian civilians, including women and children, who have been subject to kidnap, torture and abuse at the hands of Israeli settlers, yet the UK Government have sanctioned only four illegal settlers.
What further action are the UK Government going to take against settlers?
Surely it is time to ban the trade of goods from those illegal settlements once and for all.
I really do not think that that would be a very sensible thing to do.
We do not comment across the Floor of the House on who is about to be sanctioned or where the sanctions regime is going, but the hon.
Member may rest assured that we keep these matters under very careful review.
