The Minister forgot to mention that this is one of the rare occasions on which the United Kingdom Government have a long-standing position that Israel is acting unlawfully in the west bank.
Some 700,000 separate criminal acts of unlawful occupation have been endorsed and instructed by Benjamin Netanyahu.
Because that illegal occupation has gone unpunished, we now see extremists, with the tacit acquiescence and sometimes direct support of the Israeli Defence Force, committing acts of cold-blooded murder against innocent civilians.
If they do not stand up to criminals, those crimes will get worse.
The Minister mentioned that two individuals have been sanctioned for their crimes in the west bank.
Why have the President or the Prime Minister of Israel, who ordered that unlawful occupation, not also been sanctioned?
The Government pursue the objectives I have set out clearly to the House in a way most likely to bring success.
The five core asks that are so relevant to many of these questions are: the release of all hostages; formation of a new Palestinian Government for the west bank and Gaza; removing Hamas’s capacity to launch attacks against Israel; Hamas no longer being in charge of Gaza; and, with our allies, the provision of serious practical and technical support for the Palestinian Authority.
That is the approach that is most likely to command support and not, I fear, the line that the hon.
Gentleman took.
