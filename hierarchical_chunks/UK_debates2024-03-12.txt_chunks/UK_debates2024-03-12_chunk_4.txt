The Foreign Affairs Committee recently returned from al-Arish, which is the staging point for aid into Gaza.
It was very difficult to see thousands of trucks on that border.
The Government have been clear that Israel has a legal  obligation to ensure that aid reaches civilians.
The last legal assessment took place at the end of last year.
Can my right hon.
Friend tell the House, in legal terms, whether Israel is demonstrating a commitment to international humanitarian law?
If he will not tell us in the House, will he please write to me?
