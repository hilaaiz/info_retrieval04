I appreciate my hon.
Friend’s motivation in asking that question.
We should keep in mind that our relationship with Germany on supporting Ukraine is strong, united and deeply co-operative.
Together we are delivering the fighting edge that our friends in Ukraine need.
One of the things that rang in my ears after my recent visit to Ukraine was the frustration with what is happening not just in the US, but even in those European countries—Germany, the UK, France and others—that are a “yes” on weapons support.
It is the slow
yes that is frustrating people.
What is the Minister doing to turn that slow yes to Taurus into a quick yes?
More broadly, does that not make the case for a comprehensive defence agreement between Britain and the EU?
No, it does not, but we continue to work very energetically and closely with our friends across Europe, including at the recently convened French summit, to ensure that the heft and military capability of all Ukraine’s allies are brought to bear in increasing Ukraine’s fighting edge.
