I thank my hon.
Friend for raising this important issue.
As he knows, some of our officials have met representatives of the company concerned, and we are continuing to take action to close gaps between our Russian and Belarusian sanctions—we keep them under constant review.
I would be very happy to meet with my hon.
Friend to discuss the Belarusian sanctions further.
