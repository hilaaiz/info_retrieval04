I thank the Minister for a comprehensive response, as always; he is certainly across his subject.
It is great that action has been taken to ease prisoner overcrowding.
An element of concern must, however, be expressed at the thought of criminals being released early, even though their crimes are being deemed “low level”.
What procedure will be followed to ensure that those being considered for early release pose absolutely no threat to the public?
What is the Minister’s plan should one reoffend upon release?
