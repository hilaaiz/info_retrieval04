I thank the Minister for her response.
We in Northern Ireland have a border with the Republic of Ireland.
What discussions has she had with her counterparts in the devolved nations, and particularly in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, about tackling illegal migration?
I am ever mindful that we have a land border that needs to be patrolled and policed.
