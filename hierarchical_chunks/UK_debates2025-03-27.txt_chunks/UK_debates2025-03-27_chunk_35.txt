I thank my right hon.
Friend for coming before the House and calmly laying out some of the facts on this matter, as I would expect from him, given his experience.
However, there has been a lot of fear out there, and confusion among MPs, advisers and—most worryingly—people who are in receipt of PIP and other benefits and are affected by these changes.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that clear communications at all times about this matter are very important, and that every Minister should be very careful about clumsy and inappropriate language, because of the impact it has on the people who are most affected?
