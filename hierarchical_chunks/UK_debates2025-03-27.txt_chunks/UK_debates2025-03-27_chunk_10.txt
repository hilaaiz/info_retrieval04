It gives me great pleasure to wish the hon.

Northern Ireland is a great place for the aerospace industry with its three great airports—the two in Belfast and City of Derry/Londonderry—which gives people a lot of skills.
There is no limit to what people can achieve by getting into this industry in Northern Ireland and travelling the world over practising their skills.
