I acknowledge that my hon.
Friend is a great champion for the airport near his constituency.
We engage with airports to understand their plans.
Stansted has committed to creating over 5,000 jobs from its £1.1 billion expansion, and it has established an employment skills academy in the Aerozone to boost careers and deliver STEM—science, technology, engineering and maths—outreach.
I encourage him to carry on engaging as he has been doing.
I know that the Aviation Minister will understand the need for a major diversion field in the south-east of England.
With that in mind and in the light of my question to the Prime Minister yesterday, will he welcome the potential reopening of Manston airport in Kent in October 2028, and the huge investment and growth potential that will create?
The right hon.
Member, who raised this with me while I was in opposition and has now done so while I am in government, is a doughty champion for this campaign.
Manston needs to come forward with its plans, which will be subject to a development consent order, and we will then make a judgment about what is in our best interests.
