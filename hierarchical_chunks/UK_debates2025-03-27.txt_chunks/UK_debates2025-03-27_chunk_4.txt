I recall meeting my hon.
Friend just before Christmas, and I appreciate how critical the resolution of this issue is to his constituents and the wider area.
My officials, along with colleagues from the North East combined authority, have been meeting regularly with Gateshead council to build the case for the regeneration of the area, facilitated by the planned demolition of the flyover.
I know that the Minister for Future of Roads visited Gateshead in January to see the issues for herself.
Scotland’s ferry network to the islands is an essential transport system.
Island communities have at times been effectively cut off due to ferry chaos, disruptive cancellations and expensive repairs.
The SNP has decided to inflict a 10% fare hike and sent a contract for seven new ferries to Poland.
The Scottish Government  are depriving Scotland’s iconic shipbuilding industry of much-needed growth and jobs.
Can the UK Government assist the Scottish Government with fundamental reform of how we procure and run ferries in our country?
As all of us know, Scotland has a world-renowned shipbuilding industry, so it saddens me that, under the SNP, Scotland’s ferries are being built elsewhere.
I am aware that Scottish colleagues want to see reforms to how ferries are run and procured.
In the meantime, I urge the Scottish Government to reconsider sending vital jobs and investment abroad.
