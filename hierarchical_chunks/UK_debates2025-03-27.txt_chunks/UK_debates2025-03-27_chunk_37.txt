I thank my right hon.
Friend for how he is responding to this urgent question.
The Conservatives, after 14 years in government, broke our social security system and created a hostile environment for disabled people, and therefore it is for us—Labour in government—to fix our social security system.
I would like to press my right hon.
Friend on this: 30% of disabled people already live in poverty, and the proposed changes to personal independence payment could see more being pushed further into poverty and many being pushed out of work.
Indeed, the Government’s impact assessment highlighted that 150,000 people could lose carer’s allowance or the carer’s element.
May I press him again to think about how we ensure that we support ill and disabled people as we fix the mess that the Tories have created?
