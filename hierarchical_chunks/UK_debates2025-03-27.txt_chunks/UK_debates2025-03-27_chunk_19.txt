We are told that nationalisation is the answer to improving passenger rail performance.
If that is the case, surely it would make sense to start by nationalising the worst performing operators.
CrossCountry comes last out of all train operating companies for passenger satisfaction and it is not complying with its obligations.
The Secretary of State could call in that contract, so why is it not the first operator to be nationalised under GBR?
We made a commitment to bring the train operating companies back into public ownership without any cost to the taxpayer.
The appropriate point at which to bring the train operating companies back into public ownership is when the franchises expire.
If there is terrible performance, we can seek to break a contract earlier.
I am pleased that there are some improvements at CrossCountry.
We are seeing improvements from the train operating companies that have been brought into public ownership.
In particular, for TransPennine and LNER there is a really positive story to tell on passenger journeys and revenue growth.
