I welcome the Secretary of State’s comments on improving everyday transport for UK residents, and her comments on Scottish ferries.
Does she agree that my constituency, on the Isle of Wight, should not be left behind in the Government’s transport plans?
Will she agree to intervene and look at all options in order to regulate private equity—currently, we are entirely reliant on it for our connectivity with the UK mainland, which is harming our local economy—and to look at the potential of empowering any future combined mayoral authority with some regulatory power over cross-Solent transport?
