The Secretary of State will be aware that in response to her Department’s recent rail consultation, the trade unions welcomed her plan and said that a just transition to nationalisation would mean the levelling up of pay and conditions for rail workers.
The cost of that to the taxpayer could be considerable.
Would she consider a strike over harmonising pay and conditions to be a necessary strike?
Let us be clear: the cost of those national rolling strikes over two years was £850 million in lost revenue.
I am sorry, but I am not going to take any lessons from the shadow Secretary of State on industrial relations on the railway.
I have launched a petition in my constituency asking Warwickshire county council to take our buses back under public control.
Almost 30% of buses do not run on time, and my constituents are sick and tired of being stranded if they do not have a car.
Does the Minister agree that Warwickshire county council must do the right thing and improve the dismal service that my constituents are currently stuck with?
We know that too often local bus services are late or, worse, do not turn up at all, blocking passengers from accessing vital services.
Our reforms to the bus sector, combined with that £1 billion investment in buses, will give local leaders the tools they need to ensure that services truly reflect the needs of passengers.
