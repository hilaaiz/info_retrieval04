I thank the Minister for her answer on the work the Government are doing with businesses to support people dealing with the consequences of the gig economy and road safety.
Will she join with me in my work to ensure that the area around Baker Street is safer for residents, and will she work with me and  residents around Baker Street to make the case to gig economy businesses that we need to do more on enforcement and on the regulation of these workers?
