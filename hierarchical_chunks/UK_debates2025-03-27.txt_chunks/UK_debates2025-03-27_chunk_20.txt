I thank the Secretary of State for that answer, but she ducks the point that if she had the political will she could bring CrossCountry in-house now.
It is not the first operator to come under GBR or even close to it.
Under current plans, the Government will not get around to tackling CrossCountry until 2031.
In the meantime, highly effective private operators with some of the highest levels of customer satisfaction such as c2c and Greater Anglia will be subjected to dislocating nationalisation this year.
Why are the Government forcing nationalisation in areas where current services are liked, and sitting on their hands where people are crying out for improvements?
