When the Government handed the ASLEF trade union an eye-watering £9 billion pay agreement in the summer, they promised that it would “protect passengers from further national strikes”.

The hon.
Gentleman will know that I have extensive experience from my time in London, where we did take strikes when safety was at risk.
That is one direct example that I can give him.
