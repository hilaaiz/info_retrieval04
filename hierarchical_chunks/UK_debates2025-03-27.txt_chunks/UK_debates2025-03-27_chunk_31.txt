Yesterday, the all-party parliamentary group on cycling and walking published its report on social justice as it impacts on vulnerable road users.
Injuries to pedestrians could be cut significantly with simple side road zebra crossings without Belisha beacons.
That would align with the 2022 highway code changes.
Such crossings are common across the world, and they are being trialled around the corner from this building at the Department for Transport.
Will the Government consider amending the guidance for highways authorities so that these crossings can be rolled out across the country?
The Government agree that everyone should have the opportunity to walk or cycle, whatever their background, and we will obviously study the contents of the report in detail, which correctly highlights some of the ways in which cycle to work schemes, for example, might be reformed.
The Government agree that adapted cycles, which are included in the report, also play an important role in providing freedom and independence.
The root cause of the pothole problem is councils’ inability to afford to resurface roads.
Wokingham borough council saw no uplift in resurface funding for many years, with no account taken of inflation or new roads.
This is a legacy of the Conservative party in government, leading to maintenance funding per mile effectively being halved.
Will the Minister meet me to discuss the urgent need for funding for resurfacing of new roads?
I am afraid that the hon.
Gentleman’s local council has suffered the same fate as councils across the country as a result of the under-investment in local roads maintenance under the previous Government, but they will now have benefited from their share of our £500 million uplift for the year ahead, and they are absolutely encouraged to use that to resurface the roads and fix potholes.
