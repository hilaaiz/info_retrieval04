I thank the Minister for his response.
In Watford, private bus operators such as Arriva change bus routes on a whim, usually providing less frequent services and sometimes withdrawing them altogether.
That leaves Hertfordshire county council scrambling to plug gaps in services through expensive contracts.
Does he agree that there must be a better way to run local buses that puts passengers first and foremost?
