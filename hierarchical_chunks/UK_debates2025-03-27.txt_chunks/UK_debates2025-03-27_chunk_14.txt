I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
The English national concessionary travel scheme provides off-peak bus travel to those who are eligible, including those with disabilities and those of state pension age—currently 66.
However, local authorities have the power to go above and beyond their statutory obligations.
Areas including the hon.
Lady’s area will receive bus service improvement plans funding, which can be used for exactly that, but I am of course more than happy to meet her to discuss this further.
