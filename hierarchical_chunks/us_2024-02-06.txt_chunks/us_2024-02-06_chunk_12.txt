Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a great friend and mother figure to many.
I have fond memories of her.
I have fond memories of her helping to support me as I worked hard to represent the people of Missouri's First District.
She provided unparalleled guidance and never faltered in the work of ensuring St. Louis has the representation it deserves at every level of government, I got to witness what a remarkable human she was to those around and what an incredible mother she was through my personal friendship with Rasheen.
She touched so many of our hearts and she will be deeply missed.
May her memory forever be a blessing.
