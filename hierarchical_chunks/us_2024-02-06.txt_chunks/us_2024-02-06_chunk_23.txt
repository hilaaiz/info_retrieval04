Mr. Stambaugh heroically flew 38 Combat Missions, during which he had four take downs against the Japanese enemy, and numerous enemy installations.
He earned the Expert Marksman badge, the Presidential Unit Citation, and a personal letter to his parents from General George Kenney, Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific.
In the letter, General Kenney cited 
Mr. Stambaugh's ``Meritorious Achievement while participating in aerial flights in the Southwest Pacific area from February 25, 1945 to March 30, 1945...'' and noted his service as ``... a real and very tangible contribution to victory and peace.''
General Kenney further stated that ``I would like to tell you how genuinely proud I am to have men such as your son in my command, and how gratified I am to know that young Americans with such courage and resourcefulness are fighting our Country's battle against the aggressor nations.
You have every reason to share that pride and gratification.''
Mr. Stambaugh, having brushed with death numerous times, never forgets his Brothers-in-Arms who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation, fellow Warriors, and our way of life.
Returning home after earning an Honorable Discharge on 18 December 1945, 
Mr. Stambaugh transitioned to civilian life at PH Gladfelter in Spring Grove, and earned a Magistrate position in York County--further serving our Nation in a judicial capacity for four consecutive six-year terms.
Mr. Stambaugh and his wife, Bertha, had three children, and he still lives in the home he and Bertha built together near his childhood home in Spring Grove.
