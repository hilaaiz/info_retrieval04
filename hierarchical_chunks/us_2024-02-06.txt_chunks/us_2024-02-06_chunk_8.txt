Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize and immortalize the continued works.
In addition to his distinguished service career, he has been a mainstay of the veteran community within my district.
It is no small consolation to know that model citizens like Paul continue to inspire future generations.
I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in commending and thanking Paul Dillon for his endless service to the public.
