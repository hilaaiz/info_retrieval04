Mr. Speaker, I'm honored, privileged, and humbled to celebrate Mr. Quentin Roman Stambaugh on the blessed occasion of his 100th Birthday.
His tireless, selfless, and dedicated service of our communities, Commonwealth, and Nation sets the standard by which we should all be judged.
I wish him continued Godspeed.
