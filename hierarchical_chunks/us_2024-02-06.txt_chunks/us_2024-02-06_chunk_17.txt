Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, the deceptively titled ``Protect Communities from DUIs Act'' uses a catchy name to mask the true intent safety and the threat of drunk drivers to oppose.
There are already existing laws that make someone deportable if they are convicted of a ``crime involving moral turpitude,'' where the crime--including a serious DUI--is punishable by imprisonment of one year or more.
H.R. 6976 would expand current law for individuals who have been convicted of a single misdemeanor.
This could include a legal resident who is 50 years old who had a single offense at age 18.
Disrupting families and communities in such a case doesn't make sense and public safety would not be served.
