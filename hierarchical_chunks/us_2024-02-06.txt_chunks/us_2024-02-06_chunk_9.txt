Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Mrs. Tonya Latrice Finley-McCaw.
Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a remarkable servant leader who touched the lives of so many people across the St. Louis community.
A passionate advocate, 
Mrs. Finley-McCaw fought tirelessly for the rights of families and workers, including aiding efforts across the region and state for living wages and the right to unionize.
Together, alongside her inspiring son and a stalwart community leader, Rasheen, the pair were never far from a picket line, joining striking workers and allies demanding fair wages in the ``Fight for $15'' movement.
