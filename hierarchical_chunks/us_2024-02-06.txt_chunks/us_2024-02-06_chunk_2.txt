Mr. CASTRO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate AVANCE for their 50 years of service uplifting Latino families to their fullest potential.
San Antonio is proud to be home to the headquarters of this leading nonprofit, which is dedicated to improving the lives of Latino communities through high quality and culturally responsible early childhood and parenting education.
In 1973, San Antonio native Dr. Gloria Rodriguez saw a need to address growing systemic racial inequalities in education on our city's Westside.
Fifty years later, what started out as a program serving 35 San Antonio families at one housing development project has grown into a national-scale operation.
AVANCE now serves more than 13,000 caregivers and children every year throughout Texas and California.
AVANCE believes that parents are their child's first teacher and that home is a child's first classroom, and that thinking guides their core Parent-Child Education Program.
They work tirelessly to foster economic mobility for Latino families by opening the door to opportunity for both caregivers and children.
Over the years, hundreds of thousands of families have been impacted by AVANCE's work.
By 2030, Latinos will make up nearly 30 percent of the American student population.
