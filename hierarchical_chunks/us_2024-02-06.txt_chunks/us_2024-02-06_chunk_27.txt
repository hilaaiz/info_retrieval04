the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act, H.R. 6678, the Consequences for Social Security Fraud Act, H.R. 6679, the No Immigration Benefits for Hamas Terrorists Act, and H.R. 6976, the Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act.
Our Nation is amid unprecedented chaos at our southern border.
Every day, thousands of illegal aliens are flooding over the border and into our cities, increasing crime at alarming rates.
The rise of unabated human trafficking at our southern border should be among our greatest motivations for meaningful action.
While some illegal aliens are fleeing oppression and poor economic conditions in their countries, many of them are trafficking large quantities of drugs, weapons, and other contraband.
At a time when Americans are dying from fentanyl and other drug overdoses at catastrophic rates, we must do everything in our power to slow the stem of trafficking.
Moreover, with surges in violent crime across our country, we need to ensure that our federal immigration authorities have the resources necessary to remove illegal aliens who commit crimes against innocent Americans.
Each of these bills aim to empower federal authorities to reject or remove illegal immigrants who commit certain crimes.
This includes aliens who intentionally evade border patrol agents or law enforcement assisting those agents; aliens who commit social security fraud; aliens who are convicted of driving under the influence; and aliens who are members of the Hamas terrorist group or involved in the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
We must take action to make the United States safer, and I am proud to support these efforts to do exactly that.
