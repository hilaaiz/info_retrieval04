Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in honoring Stanford Women's Basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer.
I'm exceedingly proud to represent her and her teams in the Congress and know that all my constituents join me in a huge college cheer for this amazing champion.
She is widely and affectionately known by her wellearned sobriquet, G.O.A.T.
Tara VanDerveer is indeed the Greatest Of All Time.
She is a national treasure and a jewel in the crown of the 16th Congressional District.
