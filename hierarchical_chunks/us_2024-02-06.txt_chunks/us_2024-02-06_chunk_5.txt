Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary Since February 1974, El Paso has been assisting seniors across our community to receive at least one warm meal a day through the Older Americans Act.
The program first started at the Sacred Heart Church Center and St. Alban's Church Center and there are now over 16 centers across El Paso.
The El Paso County Senior Meal Program ensures that no senior goes hungry.
Today, in partnership with various regional government entities such as the City of El Paso, City of Socorro, City of San Elizario, Town of Clint, as well as grant funders including the Rio Grande Area Agency on Aging and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, El Paso County remains committed to delivering essential services, including providing nutritious meals, facilitating socialization, conducting wellness activities, and performing safety checks.
These services are consistently offered across 16 congregate sites, where a dedicated team approximately 12,057 congregate meals each month.
Additionally, an impressive 39,000 home-delivered meals are distributed monthly as part Today, it is my privilege to recognize the significant contributions of the El Paso County Community Services Department personnel, as well as their partners and the multitude of volunteers involved in delivering these essential and crucial services to our community, for the last 50 years.
I wish them continued success and impact for many years to come.
