Ms. Ahmann was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and later moved with her family to Long Beach, California.
She attended Long Beach State College, graduating in 1966, a year after marrying her husband, John.
Judy began her professional career at IBM, but her passion for the land soon led her and John to purchase their first 12 acres in California.
After a brief relocation to New Jersey for work, they returned to California in 1970 and settled in our Napa County, where they purchased 300 acres and began raising cattle.
In 1986, they acquired more than 3,000 acres along Lake Berryessa, establishing Running Deer Ranch.
With no prior ranching experience, the Ahmanns turned to the Napa County Farm Bureau and local Cattlewomen's and Cattlemen's Associations for guidance so they could raise their three daughters, Christina, Anna, and Erica, in the ranching tradition.
