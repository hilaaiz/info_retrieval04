Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Regina Whitney as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year for her extraordinary public service and mentorship, for more than four decades she has advanced justice, equity, and opportunity for countless Californians.
Regina began her professional journey as a legal secretary in family law, where for over a decade she supported attorneys and families facing some of life's most challenging circumstances.
Her compassion and meticulous attention to detail reflected her belief that every person deserves dignity and fairness under the law.
Building upon that foundation, Regina devoted more than 20 years to the California State Attorney General's Office, where she served with distinction in the Department.
Her work supported major legal operations that safeguarded the rights of Californians and strengthened public trust in government.
During this time, she helped organize Blacks in Government, a national network advocating for equity in public service.
Regina's leadership within the organization opened pathways for advancement, mentoring, and professional development for countless Black employees across state agencies.
Today, Regina continues her advocacy with SEIU Local 1000, one of California's largest and most influential public-sector unions.
In her role as a leader in labor relations and organizing, she has fought tirelessly for fair contracts, safe workplaces, and respect for public employees.
Her work has secured tangible gains in wages, benefits, and working conditions, improving the lives of thousands of workers and their families across the state.
Beyond her professional achievements, Regina has spent decades serving her community through volunteerism and mentorship.
She has long been involved with Battered Women's Alternatives, providing shelter and support for survivors of domestic violence; serves as Secretary of the Richmond Commission on Aging, advocating for seniors' health and dignity; and contributes her energy to the NAACP Richmond Branch, promoting civil rights and community empowerment.
She has also led women's mentoring programs for many years, teaching self-confidence, etiquette, and leadership to young women entering adulthood.
Through her compassion, professionalism, and leadership, she has demonstrated that true service is measured not by recognition, but by the lives uplifted and the opportunities created for others.
Her impact on California's public institutions and her enduring mentorship of others represent the highest ideals of civic leadership and public service.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Regina Whitney for her invaluable contributions to our community.
