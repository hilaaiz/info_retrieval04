Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Grace Episcopal Church for the organization's 150 years of dedicated service and commitment to the people of our community.
Grace Episcopal Church was founded in 1875 in St. Helena and remains the oldest stone church in Napa County.
Episcopal worship in St. Helena began in 1871, when a small group of parishioners gathered as a fledgling congregation.
Their efforts culminated on December 12, 1875, when Bishop A.W.D. Wingfield consecrated the newly built church and confirmed fourteen founding members.
In 1882, the congregation constructed the stone sanctuary at the corner of Oak and Spring Streets, where the church continues to stand today.
What began as a small congregation without a permanent home grew into a mission and, in 1954, achieved full parish status.
For nearly a century and a half, generations of families have sustained Grace Episcopal Church as a place of worship, service, and community life in our town.
Grace Episcopal Church's deep commitment to our community is reflected in its long history of service and outreach.
For more than a century, the church has been a place of refuge and fellowship for the people of our St. Helena.
Since 1975, Grace Church has hosted ``Joe's Group,'' the oldest Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in St. Helena, continuing its tradition of providing support in times of need.
Grace Church's ``Common Table'' program provides free community meals twice a month, offering nourishment and connection to all who attend.
The church's community involvement also extends to youth development, with the Reverend Irving Baxter founding Troop One St. Helena Boy Scouts at Grace Church in 1920, just twelve years after the scouting movement began in the United Kingdom.
Grace Church has been recognized for its steadfast response to community needs during times of crisis.
It serves as the Red Cross hub for our northern Napa County community, offering disaster relief and shelter when disaster strikes.
During recent wildfires, the church distributed more than $10,000 in assistance to low-income families who were displaced.
During the pandemic, the Napa Valley New Deal was founded at Grace Church to provide free food, supplies, and prepared meals to vulnerable residents throughout our region.
The church continues to partner with faith-based organizations to provide essential goods, collecting and distributing food staples to families in need.
Grace Church's dedication to service also extends to affordable housing advocacy and spiritual wellness.
Its participation in the Adopt-a-Family program for more than 20 years has brought comfort and stability to families during the holidays.
Its ongoing advocacy for affordable housing has helped secure homes for more than 30 low-income families.
In 1997, the parish committed to tithing 10 percent of its income to support work beyond its walls, producing a lasting impact locally and around the globe.
In 2015, the church built and dedicated a community labyrinth modeled after the Chartres Cathedral labyrinth to serve as a public space for meditation and spiritual reflection.
Periodic Taize services continue this spirit of inclusion, offering ecumenical worship dedicated to Christian unity.
