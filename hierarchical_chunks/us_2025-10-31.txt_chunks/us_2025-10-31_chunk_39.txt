Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the beautiful life, legacy, and memory of my Constituent Susan L. Zolotorofe who was a cherished daughter, a treasured friend, and a beloved member of our Bucks County community.
Susan passed away on October 24, 2025, at her home in Ivyland, Pennsylvania, at the age of 53, after courageously enduring complications stemming from radiation treatments she underwent as a teenager to overcome a brain tumor.
Her life is a testament to courage, perseverance, and a heart overflowing with love.
Born on August 17, 1972, at Abington Hospital, Susan entered this world with a radiant smile.
Her smile would go on to warm the hearts of everyone privileged enough to know her.
From her early years, Susan possessed a gentleness of spirit that enriched the lives of all who crossed her path.
Susan dedicated her life to helping children grow, learn, and feel seen.
She spent many years working in preschools and day care centers across Bucks County, including her service at the YMCA in Warminster.
For Susan, child care was not merely a profession but a calling.
She believed that every child deserved compassion, patience, and encouragement, and she gave those gifts freely.
Her kindness was not loud but was quiet, steady, and deeply felt.
For over twenty years, Susan faithfully served at Addisville Church, assisting with Sunday School and Vacation Bible School alongside her devoted mother.
Her work within the church reflected her strong faith and the values she lived each day.
The values of care, humility, service, and love.
Some of Susan's happiest moments were spent near the water.
From her childhood visits to Silver Bay on Lake George, New York, to cherished days walking the beaches of Ocean City, New Jersey, these places offered her peace and filled her with wonder.
They were her sanctuaries, where the world slowed enough for her heart to feel light.
Though she was strikingly tall and beautiful, it was her smile, a smile that was warm, gentle, and unmistakably genuine that defined her.
Even during her most difficult medical challenges, that smile remained.
It was a symbol of her resilience, her faith, and her refusal to let hardship dim her spirit.
Susan is survived by her loving parents, Eileen (nee Fetter) and Don Zolotorofe, along with a large, devoted family and a circle of friends who will forever hold her memory close.
Each carries with them the profound imprint of her kindness and the example of how to live with grace.
