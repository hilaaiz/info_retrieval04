Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saratoga County District Attorney Karen Heggen for her decades of service, leadership, and commitment to justice in her home community.
A Malta native, DA Karen Heggen has served in the Saratoga County District Attorney's Office since 1993, beginning her career as an Assistant District Attorney and advancing through the ranks to the office's second-highest position before being elected District Attorney in 2014.
Over more than thirty years, she has dedicated herself to protecting the people of Saratoga County with professionalism, compassion, and integrity.
As the first woman ever elected District Attorney in Saratoga County, Karen made history while setting a standard of excellence that inspired those who followed.
Her tenure as DA was marked by both achievement and resilience during a time of significant change in New York's criminal justice system.
Under her leadership, the office maintained one of the state's strongest records for case integrity and public trust despite the challenges of bail reform, discovery reform, and parole reform.
Her steady hand ensured that Saratoga County avoided the disruptions that plagued many other jurisdictions.
Throughout her career, Karen focused not on politics or recognition, but on people.
She emphasized teamwork, collaboration, and justice rooted in fairness.
Her approach reflected her belief that a district attorney's role is not merely to prosecute, but to pursue what is right--to balance the interests of victims, public safety, and the accused.
Her leadership earned deep respect from law enforcement, attorneys, and community members alike.
Karen leaves behind a legacy of fairness, compassion, and leadership that will continue to shape the Saratoga County District Attorney's Office for years to come.
Karen now looks forward to spending more time with her family, who have supported her through long nights and demanding years.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to recognize District Attorney Karen Heggen for her trailblazing career, her lifelong service to the people of Saratoga County, and the example she has set for future generations of public servants.
