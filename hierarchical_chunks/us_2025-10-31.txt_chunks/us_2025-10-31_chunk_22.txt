Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Miriam Wong as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women Latina Center, a Richmond-based nonprofit organization she established in 1999 to empower and support Latina women across the San Francisco Bay Area.
For more than two decades, she has dedicated her life to advancing leadership, healing, and opportunity within the Latino community.
Under her leadership The Latina Center has become a trusted community institution devoted to improving the physical, mental, and spiritual health of Latina women and their families.
In 2000, she founded Women, Health, and Leadership, a one-year leadership and community service program that began humbly in her own living room.
What started as small gatherings to build peer support among Latina women has since grown into a transformative program that has graduated more than 420 women as Peer Leaders.
The Latina Center's impact extends far beyond leadership training.
Its programs provide parenting classes, mental health support, and resources for survivors of domestic violence, while also offering small business training and access to microloans to promote self-sufficiency.
Graduates of The Latina Center's programs now serve as staff, volunteers, and board members, continuing the cycle of mentorship and empowerment that fulfills Ms. Wong's vision of community-led change.
Ms. Wong's leadership is defined by empathy, inclusion, and cultural pride.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, I am honored to recognize Miriam Wong for her extraordinary leadership and her decades of service to Latina women and families throughout the Bay Area.
