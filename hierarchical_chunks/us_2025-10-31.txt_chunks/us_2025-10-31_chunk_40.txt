Mr. Speaker, the true measure of a life is not found in what we accumulate, but in the hearts we touch.
By that measure, Susan lived a life overflowing with purpose and love.
She showed us what it means to persevere with dignity, to care without condition, and to walk through this world with a smile that reminds others they matter.
May her memory be a blessing, and may we honor her legacy by living as she did, with compassion, faith, and joy.
It is my pleasure to honor her in the United States Congress, so that future generations may know of the extraordinary kindness and courage of Susan L. Zolotorofe, a woman whose light continues to shine.
