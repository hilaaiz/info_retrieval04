Ms. Ahmann's commitment to our agricultural community is clear from her extensive advocacy work.
She became a long-standing member and leader in California CattleWomen, serving as president at both the local and state levels, including as state president in 2007 and 2008.
She later joined the Executive Board of American National CattleWomen, where her leadership earned her recognition as National CattleWoman of the Year in 2014.
In 2010, Judy was selected as a member of Common Threads California, which honors women for their volunteer leadership and contributions to agriculture.
Judy has rightfully been recognized for her advocacy at the national level.
In 2013, she testified before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation in support of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act.
Her testimony focused on the need to balance conservation efforts with the preservation of working ranchlands and grazing operations for future generations.
