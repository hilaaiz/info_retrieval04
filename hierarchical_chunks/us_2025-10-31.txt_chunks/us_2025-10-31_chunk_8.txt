Ms. Fry's tenure began in 2007 when she started working as a staff assistant in the office of then-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
Her competence, hard work, and dedication led to a 16-year career in that office, where she worked her way up to Director of Legislative Operations.
She then continued her service with the office of House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, where she has worked for almost three years as Director.
In this capacity, she has been a tireless servant to all members of the House Democratic Caucus, providing advice, guidance, and resources.
Ms. Fry has not only been an invaluable partner to my office and my staff--she also became a friend.
I thank 
Ms. Fry for her countless contributions to the Caucus.
She will certainly be missed here on Capitol Hill, and I wish her great success as she moves on to the next chapter of her career.
