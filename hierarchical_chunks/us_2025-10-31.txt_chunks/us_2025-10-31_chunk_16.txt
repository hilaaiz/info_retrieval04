Mr. Speaker, we thank Judy Ahmann for her decades of leadership in the cattle industry, dedication to agricultural education and advocacy, and commitment to supporting the next generation of farmers.
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today as the Napa County Farm Bureau's 2025 Member of the Year.
