Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me, as well as the people of Georgia's 2nd District, in honoring the life and ongoing impact of Lasmockie Octavia Fountain and the work of A Voice for Lasmockie/Lasmockie's L.O.A.D. on the 10th anniversary of her passing.
May her memory continue to be a beacon of hope, and may her story inspire continued action to end domestic violence.
