Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Marie Carayanis as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year for her decades of outstanding service and commitment to her community.
In 1970, together with her husband, Marie opened Nick & Marie's Delicatessen and Catering, a cornerstone of downtown El Sobrante for 30 years.
Through her work as a small business owner, she became a dedicated advocate for the needs of local businesses and an active leader in the community.
Marie has served on the El Sobrante Chamber of Commerce Board since 1968, holding the office of President in 1984 to 1985, 2003 to 2004, and again from 2014 to 2016.
She currently serves as Membership Chairperson.
She was also one of the founders of the El Sobrante Stroll, the community's signature festival, and continues to serve as Director of Vendor Booths for this beloved annual event.
Her commitment to civic life extends far beyond business.
Marie has served for many years on the board of the Boys & Girls Club of El Sobrante, including as President and Director of the Volunteer Program.
She has also been active in the American Business Women's Association and the Soroptimists, working to advance opportunities for women and strengthen community service.
While Marie's priorities have always centered on her family, including her three daughters and grandchildren, she has never wavered in her dedication to her friends, neighbors, and the well-being California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Marie Carayanis for her invaluable contributions to our community.
