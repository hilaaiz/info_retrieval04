The Select Committee welcomed the more than £2 billion provided through the building safety fund to private leaseholders with regard to remediation due to fire safety works.
On the other hand, social housing providers received only £200 million, which is about 10% of the amount going to private leaseholders.
How can it possibly be fair that in a block of flats a private leaseholder gets their remediation costs paid, but in the same flat next door a social housing tenant has to pay for the total cost out of their rent?
That simply is not fair.
Ministers have accepted the unfairness in the past.
When will they do something about it?
As my constituency neighbour recognises, there is, rightly, a substantial amount of taxpayer subsidy for remediation.
We are trying to ensure that that taxpayer subsidy is then clawed back from those responsible for the problems in the first place.
Where there are challenges and issues with registered providers, we are very happy to talk to them.
We have done that and we have made changes where necessary.
Following a fire last summer, timber and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride cladding on 586 homes in the borough of Barnet was identified as needing remediation.
A number of those homes are in my constituency.
Homeowners are facing bills of £23,000.
Will the Government help them with those bills?
This important issue is very much on our radar, and one that we are working through.
I had meetings about it only a few days ago, and I continue to do so.
Perhaps I could update my right hon.
