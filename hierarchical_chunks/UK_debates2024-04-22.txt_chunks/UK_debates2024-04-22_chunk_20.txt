I thank my hon.
Friend for his words welcoming Government expenditure on tackling rough sleeping and homelessness.
The Government are very focused on helping the most vulnerable in our society, who are often rough sleepers.
That is a cross-government effort.
For instance, I work closely with the Department for Education on care leavers and I work closely with the Department of Health and Social Care on those who have addictions.
I reassure my hon.
Friend that no one will be criminalised simply for sleeping rough.
