It is now approaching five years since the towns fund was launched, promising £3.6 billion of investment to level up the country.
Most of it remains unspent, and the cross-party Public Accounts Committee has said that the Department for Levelling Up could not “give any compelling examples of what had been delivered so far”.
That is a damning assessment of this five years of the fund, never mind after 14 years in power—so, Minister, why are this Government such a failure?
I think that is quite poor, Mr Speaker.
The hon.
Gentleman’s constituency has itself benefited from £11.1 million of UK shared prosperity funding and £13.4 million from the levelling up fund.
Next to him I see  the hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton (Jim McMahon) , whose constituency has benefited from £24.4 million from the towns fund.
Oldham is also the recipient of £10.8 million from the future high streets fund.
We are levelling up right across the country, including in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency.
What assessment he has made of the adequacy of the level of Government funding allocated to local authorities.
In answer to the hon.
Lady’s question, we make continuous assessment with regard to the adequacy of funding.
In this financial year we have made £64.7 billion available to local government in England, an above-inflation increase for local authorities as their real-terms increase in core spending power is now up to £4.5 billion or 7.5% in cash terms.
That includes the additional measures for local authorities, worth £600 million, that we announced on  25 January , having listened to the views of local government, to her views when she engaged in the consultation and to the views of hon.
and right hon.
