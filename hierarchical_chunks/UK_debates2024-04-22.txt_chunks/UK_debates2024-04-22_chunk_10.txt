I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting that exciting project, which seeks to secure the future of the Owain Glyndŵr hotel and develop it into a community social hub showcasing the life and history of the area.
I agree that the project is a great example of what the community ownership fund seeks to do across our United Kingdom.
The fund not only safeguards priceless and much-loved local assets, but supports ambition and builds opportunity in local areas.
I will be visiting north Wales in the very near future and will test my diary to see whether it is possible to swing by and say, “Da iawn.”
