The Secretary of State was asked— What steps he is taking to reform the private rented sector.
The Renters (Reform) Bill will have its Report stage on  Wednesday 24 April .
The Bill abolishes section 21 evictions, moves the sector to a system of periodic tenancies and introduces a private rented sector property portal and ombudsman, improving the system for responsible tenants and good-faith landlords.
Ministers first promised to end no-fault evictions five years ago.
Since then, 85,000 households have been threatened with no-fault evictions, including a constant stream of residents in Putney.
Does the Minister not agree that that was ample time to implement the necessary improvements and that the delay has caused immense suffering to people in the private rented sector?
I agree with the hon.
Lady that we need to abolish section 21 evictions as soon as possible.
When it comes to the Bill, we published the White Paper in 2022, we published the Bill in 2023 and we are bringing forward the Report stage on Wednesday.
