I thank the Minister for her answer, but two months ago the Secretary of State announced that he would pull funding from the Inter Faith Network, which is the largest interfaith charity on these islands.
It will close next week, after 40 years.
It is an astonishing decision by the UK Government to close Britain’s main forum for Jewish-Muslim dialogue now.
The Secretary of State could still reverse that very poor decision, but that would have to happen this week.
What are the chances of that?
