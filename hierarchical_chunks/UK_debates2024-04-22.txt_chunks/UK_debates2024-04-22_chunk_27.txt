I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities,  the hon.
Member for North Dorset (Simon Hoare) , for his reply to my letter of  21 March .
He said that a short paper on the topic of the Union was prepared by officials and presented to the UK Government in July 2020.
However, a media report at the time suggested that an employee of Hanbury Strategy had provided data and helped to prepare that paper for the Cabinet.
Was public money used for the insights that Hanbury Strategy prepared for that paper, and when will the public get to see them?
