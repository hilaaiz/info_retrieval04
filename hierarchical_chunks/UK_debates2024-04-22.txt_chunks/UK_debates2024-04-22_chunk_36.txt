I welcome this urgent question and the Government’s response.
We regularly talk about what is going on in Ukraine and the middle east, but we do not focus on the continent of Africa, or Sudan, which is turning into a failed state.
There is every prospect of what is going on in Sudan spilling out into other parts of central Africa and the Sahel.
Will the Deputy Foreign Secretary update the House on whether we have any presence in Port Sudan?
He talks about peace talks.
Egypt has also engaged in those, so can he update the House on the prospect of what is happening bringing the necessary parties together?
