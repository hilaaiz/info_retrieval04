I thank my hon.
Friend for his commitment to levelling up in King’s Lynn and across Norfolk.
Our long-term plan for towns puts power back into the hands of local people.
Each town must set up a new town board, comprised of local community representatives and the Members of Parliament for the respective area, who are responsible for developing the long-term plan for their area, underpinned by evidence of extensive community engagement.
This plan can include the regeneration projects that my hon.
Friend has mentioned, if that is considered a local priority.
I look forward to working with him and to seeing the plans when they are finally brought forward.
