I thank the Minister for his answers.
He will recall that I asked some time ago about the Ards and North Down Council’s Whitespots project—a historical project for tourism that relates to the second world war and also to the history of mining in the area.
The Minister said that when the Northern Ireland Assembly was up and running, he would be keen to ensure that the project could take place.
Can he confirm that the moneys necessary for the project are there, and will he ensure that he, as Minister, does everything he can to make it happen?
