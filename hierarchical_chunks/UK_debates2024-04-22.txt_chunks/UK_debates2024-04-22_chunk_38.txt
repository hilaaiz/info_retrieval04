Thank you, Mr Speaker.
You have caught me off balance; I was just about to take my diabetic tablets when you called me.
I thank the Minister for his answers to the UQ.
He will be aware that more than 9,000 people have been killed, and nearly 6 million displaced, and Christians are facing persecution.
What support are the Government offering to non-governmental organisations on the ground, such as Church missionaries, who seek to help displaced Christians not only feed children, but provide them with a semblance of an education and, most importantly, hope of a future life?
The hon.
Gentleman will understand the great difficulties in helping directly on the ground; I know the matter is of great interest, both to him and to the Prime Minister’s envoy for freedom of religion or belief, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) .
We must continue to find every possible way of supporting the important groups that he mentioned.
I draw the Minister’s attention to a report on the BBC website, in case he has not read it, by Zeinab Mohammed Salih, a Sudanese journalist.
She recalls: “People have told me of ethnically targeted killings and sexual violence.
They remain traumatised, months afterwards.”
