The Minister has done good work in protecting leaseholders and renters from remediation costs above 11 metres.
As a leaseholder myself, I am a bit baffled as to why people are not protected when fire remediation measures are necessary below 11 metres.
I would be grateful if he could explain the Government’s reasoning.
When the Building Safety Act 2022, which put in place the differentiation, was going through, we were very clear and asked colleagues, on the Floor of the House, for any examples of where there were potential issues below 11 metres.
If my right hon.
Friend or any other Member has an issue, I would be very keen to hear from them.
The reality is that, over the past two  years nearly, we have received only 160 potential issues.
Of those, we can count on one hand where there has been a problem.
We are working with each of those three buildings to make the progress we need to make.
