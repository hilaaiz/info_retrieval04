I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his questions and remarks.
I take them to mean that he will support the measures when they come before the House.
I am delighted to hear his support for our sensible, practical and pragmatic approach to unblock much needed housing across the country.
He asked about our engagement with Natural England; we have had detailed discussions.
He asked about the current legal framework;  we have looked at and discussed a number of options to make the changes, and we are taking what we believe is the right approach to unblock planning permissions more quickly than the current situation allows.
