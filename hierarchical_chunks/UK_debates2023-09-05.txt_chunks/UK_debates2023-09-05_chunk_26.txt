I thank the hon.
Lady for her long list of questions; I am happy to respond to all of them in detail.
On our approach, I stand by what I and the Government have said: we stand by our pledges to the  environment, and we do not accept that, as she stated, we will weaken our commitment to the environment at all.
It is important to consider what we are talking about here, which is unblocking 100,000 homes that add very little in terms of pollution.
To be clear, our approach means that there will be no overall loss in environmental outcomes.
Not only do the measures that we are taking address the very small amount of nutrient run-off from new housing, but at the same time, we are investing in the improvement of environmental outcomes.
We do not agree that this is regression on environmental standards.
We are taking direct action to continue to protect the environment and ensure that housing can be brought forward in areas where people need it.
