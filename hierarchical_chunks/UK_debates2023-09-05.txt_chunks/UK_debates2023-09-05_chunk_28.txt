The Minister will recognise that I and many other colleagues on the Government side of the House share the admirable objectives of  the hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)  in ensuring that the water quality of our rivers improves year by year under the Government and their successors.
The Minister’s proposals to amend the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill are not about damaging the status of our rivers; as I understand it, they are about dealing with a particular and specific interpretation of the EU habitats directive by the European Court of Justice in connection with a case in Holland prior to the time we left the EU.
If that is the case—she has referred to the litigation and measures she has undertaken—does she agree that in special areas of conservation such as the River Clun catchment in my constituency, where no planning consent has been granted for nine years, these measures will help to unlock that while preserving the quality of the river in the catchment?
You have taken longer than the person who asked the question.
