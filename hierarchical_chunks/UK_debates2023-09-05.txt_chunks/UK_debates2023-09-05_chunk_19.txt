I thank my hon.
Friend for his question, which I take very seriously.
Just to put it in context, last year HMRC received 38 million telephone calls; around 3 million of those were to do the simplest of tasks, which can be done digitally if at all possible.
If we are able to move people on to digital channels, that will free up at least 500 people to help with more complex tax affairs and help the most vulnerable.
This is a period of transition for the organisation, and one that we take very seriously.
