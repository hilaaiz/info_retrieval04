I thank the Minister for his answer and welcome those measures.
Have the Government considered what more can be done to unlock surpluses in defined-benefit schemes to allow employers to use that money more effectively, rather than having it end up going into insurance companies on buy-outs?
There is a huge tax penalty on unlocking surpluses.
Is there a way of relieving that to encourage the money to be invested more efficiently?
