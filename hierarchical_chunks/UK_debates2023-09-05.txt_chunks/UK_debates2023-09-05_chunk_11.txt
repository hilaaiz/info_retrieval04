Thank you, Mr Speaker.
The Chancellor claims that it is a success that inflation in the UK has risen higher and remains more stubbornly so than in the EU.
Adam Posen, formerly of the Bank of England, has underlined that up to 80% of the UK’s additional inflation woes can be laid at the door of Brexit—something the Tories and Labour are united on.
All the while, food price inflation is crushing household budgets.
So why have this Government done nothing?
Why have this Government learned nothing from countries such as France, which has worked with food suppliers to keep food prices capped to help those most in need?
