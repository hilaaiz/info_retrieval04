The hon.
Lady asked about engagement.
Ministers across Government, the Secretary of State and I have had numerous meetings with all parties involved, and we have had meetings with environment groups as part of Government business.
It is worth the House noting the significant enforcement steps taken on the water companies by colleagues at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
Since 2015, the Environment Agency has concluded 59 prosecutions against water and sewerage companies, securing £150 million in fines.
The regulators have recently launched the largest criminal and civil investigations into water company sewage.
We are taking action against water companies to protect our rivers, leave the environment in a better state than we found it, and build the affordable houses that the country so desperately needs, including in her constituency.
