Following the question from  the hon.
Member for Stroud (Siobhan Baillie)  on mitigation, the Government’s focus seems to be on wetlands, but if we are honest it will take a long time to fully mitigate the possible additional pollution.
What will be done in the interim to deal with this pollution before the wetlands become fully operational?
The hon.
Lady is right to highlight the fact that there is a focus on wetlands but other projects are in scope of the credit scheme.
However, she has hit the nail on the head: the key point is that some of these things take a very long time to come on stream but we need to start unblocking those houses now, which is why we have taken this proportionate approach with the amendments.
Over the summer, I met members of the Bedfordshire Great Ouse Valley Environment Trust.
They are concerned that our river is the fifth most polluted in England with forever toxins—the level is a shocking 10 times that considered safe—not to mention raw sewage and nitrate and phosphate contamination.
Can the Minister explain to my constituents why the Government are decreasing protections for our beautiful river when what is needed is an urgent plan to clean up our dirty waterways?
