I thank my right hon.
Friend very much.
He is right in his observation that this has been a judgment imposed on the United Kingdom after we left the European Union.
This is not a long-standing convention in any shape or form.
He is also right to highlight the measures we are putting in place to protect our rivers and the environment more broadly.
We are also putting in place a substantial package to help farmers to farm more sustainability, manage their slurry infrastructure more effectively and be able to drive the circular economy in farming that we all want.
He mentioned specific  catchments in his area.
We have committed to bring forward a Wye catchment plan shortly, which I hope will address the issues he is referring to.
