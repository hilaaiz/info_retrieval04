I thank my hon.
Friend very much.
She is right to focus on some of the very good work that is already taking place through some individual projects I am aware are being brought forward.
She is also right to highlight the role that sustainable drainage can take and we have committed to looking at that more broadly to see what more can be done with that particular policy.
Planning law is very clear.
It has to leave the environment in a better state than it finds it, not only in her area but across the country.
