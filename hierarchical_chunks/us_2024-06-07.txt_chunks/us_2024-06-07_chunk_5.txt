Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and legacy of Dana Campbell Saylor, a dedicated Phoenix community advocate and personal friend.
From her early years as a student at Arizona State University, Dana knew she wanted to dedicate her life to fighting for social justice-- especially on issues related to women's equality.
She quickly established herself in the greater Phoenix area as a fierce advocate for the vulnerable and underserved, sitting on countless boards, councils, and commissions to channel her passion for public service.
Throughout the years, Dana served four Arizona Governors, two Phoenix Mayors, and several ASU administrators in varying capacities to help address community issues.
She used her advisory positions to propose, pass, and implement legislation to enhance the lives of women, children, and veterans.
Many in the Phoenix community know Dana best for her role as CEO of the Maricopa County YWCA.
She was a firm believer and role model of their mission to empower women, stand against racism, and promote peace, justice, freedom, and dignity for all.
As CEO, she focused her efforts on transforming the organization into the impactful entity it is today.
She established the YWCA as a 501c4 for advocacy, created the YWCA Metropolitan Women's Forum, and acted as YWCA Board Chair for the Pacific Region for several years.
Throughout her lifetime, Dana was recognized with several highly esteemed honors and awards such as the NAWBO Visionary Award, the West Valley Mover and Shaker award, the YWCA Dorthy Willey Award, and an induction into the Phoenix Union Alumni Hall.
Dana continued to serve others until her passing on May 13, 2024.
She will be dearly missed, but her legacy in Phoenix will endure through the countless lives she touched.
Godspeed.
