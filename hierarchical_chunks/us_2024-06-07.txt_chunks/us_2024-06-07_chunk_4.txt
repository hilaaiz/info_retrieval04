Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, today we celebrate the 95th anniversary of the Lions Club of Kenmore and their remarkable contributions to our community.
Founded in May of 1929, the Lions Club was established to support the visually impaired in Tonawanda and Kenmore.
They are committed to improving access to eye and vision health for everyone through various initiatives such as their Eyeglass Collection Project, which gathers and distributes used eyeglasses worldwide.
Locally, the club offers free vision screenings for children, as well as hearing aids and related examinations for those in need.
The Kenmore Lions Club further creates welcoming spaces for the visually impaired, hosting annual Christmas parties, Thanksgiving dinners, and picnics throughout the year.
In addition to their work for the visually impaired, the Lions Club is committed to serving the broader community in every possible way.
Through participating in programs such as Adopt a Highway to keep our roads litter free, organizing personal care donation drives for women veterans, and providing scholarships for local high school students, the Kenmore Lions Club has undoubtedly made a positive impact on many people's lives.
I thank the Lions Club of Kenmore for 95 years of dedication and service in making our community a better place.
