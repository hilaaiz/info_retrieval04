Mrs. Jackson became involved in the Civil Rights Movement at an early age, serving as the First Vice President of the Metro Birmingham Branch of NAACP.
After the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church, she participated in the Children's March and Monday Masses, organized by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights and Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth.
In response to her peaceful demonstration, 
Mrs. Jackson was jailed twice and spent more than three weeks in the Birmingham Jail.
She experienced violence and troubling conditions during her incarceration but drew strength from the support and comradery that she received from other members of the Movement.
A dedicated community leader, 
Mrs. Jackson's commitment to service was the throughline of her career.
She served as a certified substitute teacher for several Birmingham schools, provided social services and workforce development to survivors of Hurricane Katrina, facilitated job training for students through the Birmingham Works for Youth, and served as Commissioner of the Housing Authority of the Birmingham District.
As a member of the Top Ladies of Distinction, she worked with Top Teens of America to provide scholarships and funding for students.
Even later in life, 
Mrs. Jackson's commitment to the ideals of the Civil Rights Movement never wavered.
In 2009, she organized a conference with the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and the FBI to promote healthy dialogue between youth and law enforcement.
In 2017, she helped commemorate the Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument and went on to serve as the Interim President for the Metro Birmingham Branch of the NAACP.
