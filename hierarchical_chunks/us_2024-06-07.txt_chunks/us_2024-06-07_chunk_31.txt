Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable individual from my district, Monsignor Michael Picard, who has touched and bettered countless lives in our community through his unwavering faith and commitment to his vocation as a Pastor.
Born May 30, 1938, Michael Picard entered St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Philadelphia in 1956 at just 18 years old.
After nearly a decade of rigorous theological training, he was ordained on May 21, 1966, and embarked on an illustrious 58-year career dedicated to serving the Lord and guiding the spiritual lives of countless individuals and community members.
Affectionately known as Father Mike, he embarked on his pastoral journey as an Associate Pastor at Corpus Christi Church.
Then, in 1967, he was assigned to Cardinal O'Hara High School, where he wore many hats: Teacher, Guidance Counselor, Counselor, Basketball Moderator, and Vice Principal for two years.
Throughout his tenure there, Father Mike profoundly impacted students and colleagues alike.
He mentored countless young men and women, guiding them toward successful futures and emphasizing the importance of character, integrity, and unwavering faith.
Father Mike embarked on a new mission in 1981, taking on the role of Principal at Lansdale Catholic High School.
Here, he continued to be a beacon of inspiration and guidance for his students and community, exemplifying unwavering dedication and faith.
His remarkable talents and unparalleled leadership qualities caught the eye of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, leading to his recruitment as the Director of the Cardinal's Commission and Office for Human Relations.
In 1989, Father Mike answered the call to serve once more and took on a new role at Saint Andrews Catholic Church in Newtown, Pennsylvania.
It has been here at Saint Andrew's that Father Mike has served as Pastor, mentor, and friend to over 20,000 parishioners for the past 35 years.
While his list of accomplishments is undoubtedly impressive, the quiet, personal moments are what define his profound impact.
With every baptism, confirmation, First Communion, Matrimony, and anointing of the sick, Father Mike has been a steadfast presence for so many in life's most significant moments.
His unwavering support and genuine kindness have intricately woven together the fabric of the church community, forming a beautiful tapestry of love and faith.
In moments of joy and sorrow, he has stood as a steady pillar of comfort, offering solace and hope to all in need.
His influence has grown to extend far beyond the physical walls of Saint Andrews, touching the hearts and minds of everyone fortunate enough to encounter him.
For Father Mike, being a Pastor is not merely a job but a lifelong vocation.
His tireless efforts in shepherding the largest Catholic church in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and fostering a warm, welcoming environment have transformed Saint Andrews into a beacon of hope, inclusivity, joy, and peace for all who cross its threshold.
Yet these accomplishments are not what defines him.
Father Mike has shown us that true greatness lies in the everyday acts of kindness, compassion, and encouragement and has the power to transform a community.
It is my great honor to commend and congratulate Monsignor Michael Picard--our beloved Father Mike--on 58 years of inspiring service to our community.
His exemplary character, unwavering faith, and positive spirit have touched and bettered the lives of so many, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations of our community members.
My sincere and best wishes to Father Mike as he enters this next chapter of life--may it be filled with continued blessings and the same spirit of love and devotion that has defined his life's work.
Thank you to Father Mike for his incredible contributions.
His legacy will forever shine brightly in our hearts and our community.
