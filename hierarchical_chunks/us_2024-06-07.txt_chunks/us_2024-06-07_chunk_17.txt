Mrs. Jackson is preceded in death by her husband, Issic Jackson; parents Willie George Carter and Willie Lee Ledger; and three brothers, Gilbert Carter, Alfred Lee Carter, and John Carter.
She is survived by two sons Jeffery Jackson and Michael Jackson; one granddaughter Denitra Streeter; one grandson Kieron Jackson; one brother Willie Carter Jr.; four sisters Sylvia Weatherspoon, Lee Edna Boone, Iris Elom, and Wanda Morton, and a host of cousins, friends, and church members.
On a personal note, 
Mrs. Jackson was a source of great inspiration for me and so many young Black women.
A trailblazer and pioneer, she was devoted to her community, her family, and the power of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Movement.
It is because of the courage, bravery, and strength of Foot Soldiers like Myrna Carter Jackson that we enjoy the freedoms we have today.
Her life is a testament to the power of ordinary Americans to achieve extraordinary social change.
May we find comfort in knowing that she lived a full and blessed life, and that her legacy will live on in the lives she touched.
On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy Birmingham, the State of Alabama, and our Nation.
May she Rest in Peace and Power.
