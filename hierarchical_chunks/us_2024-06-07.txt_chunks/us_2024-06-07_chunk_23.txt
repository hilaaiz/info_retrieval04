Mr. Speaker, I join our communities of Clallam and Jefferson counties in grieving the loss of a pillar of the community, passionate and dedicated journalist, and compassionate father, brother, husband, and friend.
I join John's wife, Barbara, his two sons, and the rest of his family in grieving this sudden and tragic loss.
