Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Batten Disease Awareness Day.
Batten Disease is a fatal rare disease of the nervous system that usually begins in childhood.
In the U.S., an estimated two to four children out of every 100,000 will get the disease, and unfortunately, there is no cure.
On June 9th Batten Disease advocates around the world will celebrate International Batten Disease Awareness Day.
Families and caregivers impacted by this disease are often fighting a silent battle due to a lack of public awareness.
Increasing awareness helps honor their fight and strengthen the development of innovative treatment options and research for a cure.
That's why last year I was proud to introduce a resolution in support.
I urge my colleagues to join me on June 9th in honoring the families and caregivers, and most importantly, the children who have been impacted by this terrible disease.
