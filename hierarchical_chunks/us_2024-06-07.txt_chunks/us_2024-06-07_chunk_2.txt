Ms. TENNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I use today to recognize the amazing life of United States Coast Guard Veteran Eugene ``Gene'' Gerrard, who recently celebrated his 102nd birthday.
Gene, like many from the ``Greatest Generation'' wanted to begin his military career before reaching enlistment age but had to wait and finally enlisted in the Coast Guard in 1942.
Gene served in the Coast Guard until 1945, where he attained the rank of Quartermaster First Class.
For his service, he earned an American Campaign Medal, an Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, and a Philippine Liberation Medal.
Previous to his enlistment, Gene worked as a printer by day and attended trade school by night in Brooklyn, New York.
After his military service, Gene started his own printing business in Elmont, New York.
Gene owned Gerrard Printing from 1951 to 1965, and St. Gerrard Printing in Port Jefferson Station, New York, from 1965 to 2013.
Gene was also a dedicated public servant, having been elected as town councilman for 22 years.
Gene also contributed to the Mount Sinai Fire Department for 50 years as its chief, chaplain, and fire police captain.
He founded the Mt. Sinai Fire Department Benevolent Association and the Brookhaven Volunteer Firefighters Museum.
Currently, Gene resides in the Town of Canandaigua in Ontario County, New York with his daughter, Pam Rushack.
At 102 years old, Gene still gives back to the community by attending events, giving invocations, and leading in the Pledge.
Most notably, Gene has served as a Red Coat Ambassador to the Canandaigua VA, where he has done so the last seven years.
Gene Gerrard is an exceptional community member whose devotion to his country and his community is truly inspiring.
It brings me great joy to know Gene.
I am thrilled to recognize him for his many accomplishments and wish him a very happy 102nd birthday.
