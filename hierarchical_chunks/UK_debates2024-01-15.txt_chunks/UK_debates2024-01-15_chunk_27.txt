I welcome the right hon.
and learned Gentleman’s support for the announcements we made with regard to Ukraine.
He is right to point out the importance of the security commitments we signed.
Thirty countries at the Vilnius summit promised to do so.
This House should be proud that the United Kingdom is again leading by being the first country to sign such a commitment, which I believe will serve as a template for others to follow.
I can tell him of the enormous appreciation in Ukraine for the UK doing that, so that there is long-term certainty for the Ukrainian people of our support, as well as further deterrence to Russia and others against future aggression.
