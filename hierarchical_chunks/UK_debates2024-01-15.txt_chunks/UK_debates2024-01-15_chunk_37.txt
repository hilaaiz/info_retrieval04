I thank my right hon.
and learned Friend for his support.
Of course, he will understand that I will not speculate on future action.
This was intended as a limited single action, and we hope the Houthis will now step back and end their destabilising attacks.
As I said earlier, we will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests, where required.
If we do so, we will, of course, follow the correct procedures and precedent, as we did in this case.
