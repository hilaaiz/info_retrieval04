I thank my right hon.
Friend for his excellent remarks and for his work on the Abraham accords, which have done much to bring more peace and stability to the region.
He is right to say that the behaviour of the Iranian regime poses a significant threat to the safety and security of the UK and our allies and ensures regional instability where we want to see more peace and stability.
I can assure him that we are keeping abreast of all the risks in the area.
That is why, for example, the Royal Navy last year and the year before continued to interdict illegal arms smuggling by the Iranians to the Houthis.
We will continue to keep in close contact with our allies to take all the measures we can to protect our people and ensure that the Iranians’ destabilising influence in the region is reduced to the best extent possible.
