It is a pleasure to speak on Third Reading.
It was important, when the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill was set aside, that a commitment was made to bring legislation forward, and this is a key element of it.
It is a key element of our manifesto commitment that we will fulfil, and frankly the other House should stop bleating about this element.
We will get the other aspects done.
I myself am taking a private Member’s Bill through that covers one elements of the kept animals Bill.
We should not be playing tit for tat on this.
It is about something that really matters, the welfare of animals, and this is a really important stage.
