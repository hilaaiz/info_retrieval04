I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his support for the action in Ukraine.
Let me touch on his last point, because I agree with him; we are, of course, concerned about the devastating impact of the conflict in Gaza on the civilian population—too many people have lost their lives already—and there is a desperate need for increased humanitarian support into Gaza.
I am pleased that the UK is playing a leading role: we have tripled our aid.
Recently, the Foreign Secretary appointed a humanitarian envoy to the region to address some of the blockages, and we delivered our first maritime shipment of aid into Egypt—more than 80 tonnes of new aid.
When I spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu, I impressed upon him the importance of not only increasing the flow of trucks, but, crucially, if we can, opening up extra crossings into Gaza, so that  we can increase the flow of aid.
We will continue to press on Israel to do that, so that we can bring more relief to people who are suffering a great deal.
