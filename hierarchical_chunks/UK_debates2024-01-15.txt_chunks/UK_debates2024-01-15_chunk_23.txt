I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and congratulate her police and crime commissioner on the excellent work she is doing.
My hon.
Friend will be aware that we have amended the Offences against the Person Act 1861 so that the offence of spiking is captured  specifically and comprehensively in law, in part because we want more victims to come forward, but we are told time and again by the police that the most significant barrier to conviction is the length of time between the offence taking place and a toxicology report being received.
We are therefore investing in rapid drink testing research, and we hope to bring testing capacity on site.
