More generally, we want a reduction of tensions in the region and a restoration of stability.
That is our stated aim.
It is incumbent on the Houthis not to escalate and not to continue what are illegal and unprovoked attacks on civilian shipping that put innocent lives at risk and damage the global economy and the prices that  British citizens and others pay for their everyday goods, as the right hon.
and learned Gentleman rightly pointed out.
I assure the right hon.
and learned Gentleman that it was necessary to strike at speed, as he acknowledged, to protect the security of the operations.
That is in accordance with the convention.
I remain committed to that convention, and would always look to follow appropriate processes and procedures, and act in line with precedent—he will know that there were strikes in 2015 and 2018, when a similar process was followed.
I also provide the right hon.
and learned Gentleman with the assurance that he rightly asked for about our international engagement, because there will be malign forces out there that seek to distort our action and to turn it into something that it is not.
It is important that we engage with our allies and others in the region, so that they understand what we did and why.
I provide him with the assurance that we have done that and will continue to do that, because it is important that there is no linkage between these actions and anything else that is happening.
This is purely and simply to respond in self-defence to illegal attacks by the Houthis on commercial shipping.
