I thank my hon.
Friend for his earlier answers.
As he knows, I received official notification today that Newton Park hotel, which was a four-star hotel in my constituency before it was taken over entirely for use by asylum seekers, is to have the contract ended at the end of February.
That is an enormous relief to those in those in the small village there and to those in other villages that the important V3 bus route goes through.
I thank him for keeping to the word of his predecessor that the hotel use for asylum seekers would end in the second tranche of closures.
