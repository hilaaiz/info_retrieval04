I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting that point.
I am proud of the fact that, since 2010, neighbourhood crime is down by 51% because of the kind of interventions that she highlighted.
I reassure her that we will continue to look at what works, to fund and support, and to make every effort to drive down neighbourhood crime even further.
