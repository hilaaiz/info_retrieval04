I thank the Prime Minister for a clear statement.
It is reported that the drones being used by the Houthis are being helped by Iran.
The American Enterprise Institute has reported that Russia has given $900 million to Iran for drones.
Will the Prime Minister assure the House that we are doing everything we can in this country to make sure that none of that money is going through the UK financial system?
