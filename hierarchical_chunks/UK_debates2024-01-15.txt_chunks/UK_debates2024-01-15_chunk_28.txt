In conclusion, the confluence of these two events over the same 24 hours serves to highlight the increasing threats we face as a country.
The global environment is becoming more challenging and more unstable.
It is incumbent on us to respond to those challenges with increased investment in defence, as we are doing, and by strengthening our alliances, because ultimately we must defend the principles of international law, freedom and democracy, and freedom of navigation that we all hold dear.
This Government will always stand ready to do that and to protect the British people.
