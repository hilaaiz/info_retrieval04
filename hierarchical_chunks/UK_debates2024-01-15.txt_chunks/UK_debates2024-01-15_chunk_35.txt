I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising an incredibly important point.
I reassure her and the House—she will know this from her own experience—that we are steadfast in our support to the Yemeni people as one of the largest donors of lifesaving aid to the UN appeal.
We are also committing, I believe, £88 million in this forthcoming year—over the last several years we have committed £1 billion—and that will help to provide food for at least 100,000 people every month and deliver lifesaving healthcare through 400 facilities.
The Yemeni people are suffering and we are doing everything we can to alleviate that suffering.
