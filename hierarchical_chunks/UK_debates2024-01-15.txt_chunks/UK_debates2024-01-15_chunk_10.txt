I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for the representations she made on this issue.
The situation in her constituency demonstrates that the Government’s plan is working and we are seeing hotel exits happen.
That is a direct consequence of getting on and making decisions, bringing forward alternative accommodation and also, crucially, reducing in-flow into the system in the first place.
