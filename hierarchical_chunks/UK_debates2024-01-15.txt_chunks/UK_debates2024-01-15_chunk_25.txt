I thank the right hon.
and learned Gentleman for his support for the action that we have taken.
He is absolutely right to highlight the international coalition that, over recent weeks, has called out the Houthis’ behaviour, culminating in the UN Security Council resolution strongly condemning the attacks, which he rightly referenced.
Our stated aim was to degrade and disrupt the Houthis’ capability to launch attacks on civilian shipping.
As I indicated, our initial assessment is that our strikes have been successful in the specific targets that were selected.
Obviously, that is an initial assessment, but that remains our case at the moment.
