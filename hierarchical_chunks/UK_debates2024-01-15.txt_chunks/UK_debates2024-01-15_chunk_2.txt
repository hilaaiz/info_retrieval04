The Minister has read out a litany of what we have achieved in our time in office.
The one person who cannot speak in this debate is my hon.
Friend  the Member for West Dorset (Chris Loder) , who took through the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Act 2021 with the support of the Government.
As the chief executive of the RSPCA said, that was a monumental moment for animal welfare legislation, empowering the courts to hand out sentences that more accurately reflect the seriousness of these crimes.
I strongly support the Bill.
I say to the House, and to the other House, that it is a simple, straightforward Bill and it could get through by the end of March and be done by Easter, without question.
This is not the moment to add other elements left, right and centre.
Let us keep it simple and keep our manifesto commitments.
I hope the House of Lords respects the will of this House, and I look forward to the Bill not coming back but becoming an Act before the end of the spring.
