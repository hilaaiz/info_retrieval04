I thank the Prime Minister for his statement.
He has been crystal clear on the need to degrade the capabilities of this terrorist organisation, the Houthis, that are causing havoc in the Red sea.
He will also know that Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the world and is suffering a mass humanitarian crisis with over 21 million people in need of humanitarian aid and support.
What will he do to ensure that the civilians of Yemen are not again engulfed in a mass humanitarian catastrophe?
