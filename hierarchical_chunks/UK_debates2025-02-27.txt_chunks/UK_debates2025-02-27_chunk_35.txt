I welcome the Secretary of State’s robust response from the Dispatch Box today, and thank her for it.
This is an egregious example, but the problem is the pattern of behaviour; for example, the BBC has spent £330,000 of taxpayers’ money on legal fees to cover up the 2004 Balen report into coverage of this conflict.
Does the Secretary of State agree that there are valid questions as to why the BBC has refused  to submit to an independent inquiry?
Does she agree that the findings of the Balen report have been suppressed, and will the Government urge the BBC to publish that report?
