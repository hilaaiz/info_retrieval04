Artificial intelligence is a significant innovation, but our media and creators are innovators, too.
Almost the entirety of those in the creative sector say that Government proposals are not fit for purpose.
They would allow AI companies to scrape content without creators getting paid.
UKAI has said that Labour’s plans would damage public confidence in the AI industry and hinder the industry.
In that light, will the Secretary of State admit that the Government’s approach to AI and copyright is a mess and that Government proposals are not fit for purpose?
Is she as disappointed as I am that the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology admitted on the radio this morning that he has not even met those in the creative sectors?
I can tell the shadow Secretary of State that I and my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rhondda and Ogmore (Chris Bryant) , who is also a joint Minister in the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, meet those in the creative industries regularly.
We are crystal clear that the creative industries have been powering the British economy for decades, and as our future economy moves towards high consumption, the creative industries will be even more critical to our future success.
I also say gently to the shadow Secretary of State that this is an issue his Government failed to grip for a long time.
We are delivering certainty through a copyright regime that provides creators with real control and transparency, and that helps them to license their content, while supporting AI developers to access high-quality material so that they can train leading AI models in the UK.
We are working with our fantastic creative industries to get that balance right.
We are not prepared to do what his Government did for 14 years, which was to leave this country with uncertainty, drift and low economic growth.
