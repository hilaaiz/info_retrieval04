I agree that those responsible for selecting the next archbishop must inspire confidence and trust, both among the public and among victims and survivors, who have been so badly let down.
Next Monday’s Adjournment debate will be on safeguarding in the Church of England.
There will also be a question and answer session on safeguarding with the Archbishop of York and other senior members of the Church.
I am pleased that that will take place, and I encourage hon.
Members from across the House to go along to those sessions.
The hon.
Member for Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney, representing the Restoration and Renewal Client Board, was asked— What steps the client board is taking to engage with parliamentary staff on the restoration of the Palace of Westminster.
The restoration and renewal programme has engaged extensively with staff of both Houses.
There is a legal duty to do so under the Parliamentary Buildings (Restoration and Renewal) Act 2019.
In the past two years alone, the programme has held over 420 workshops with parliamentary subject experts, engaged over 1,200 staff in group briefings, and taken over 700 staff members on R&R tours of the palace.
That includes staff who work for Members, in addition to those who work for both Houses.
Enabling staff to engage is vital, and the programme team will continue to ensure that there are opportunities to do so.
