The Secretary of State was asked— If she will make an assessment of recent trends in the gross value added of the video games industry.
We recognise the recent challenges for the industry, and we are continuing our support with the video games expenditure credit, providing £5.5 million for the UK games fund next year.
The UK is home to some amazing companies and developers, and we want to continue to support them as they grow and develop world-leading games.
