I thank my hon.
Friend for her fantastic and poignant question.
Historical and recent safeguarding failures have eroded trust in the Church.
To rebuild and restore that trust, the Church must show that it is serious about keeping people safe.
That must include holding to account those who are responsible for failures—no one, no matter how senior, can be above scrutiny and accountability.
