I thank the Secretary of State for her earlier response.
This year, Bradford is the UK city of culture.
This is a fantastic opportunity to show off the  creative talent of our wider district, including the Shipley constituency, and it could be the springboard for unleashing the economic potential of our city and area, which for too long has been unrecognised.
Can the Secretary of State assure me that the Government will help to secure the legacy of Bradford 2025 and support our creative industries to fuel economic growth?
