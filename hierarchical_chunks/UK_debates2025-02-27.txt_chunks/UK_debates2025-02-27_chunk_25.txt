I thank the Secretary of State for getting to grips with this issue so quickly and acknowledging that what happened on  7 October  and what happened subsequently in Gaza is of huge significance; her understanding gives me hope.
Will she commit to coming back to this Chamber and updating us on the outcome of whatever happens with the BBC investigation?
