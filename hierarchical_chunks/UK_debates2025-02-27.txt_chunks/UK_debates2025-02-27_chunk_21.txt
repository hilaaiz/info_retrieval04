I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for bringing this matter to the House, and also for raising it with me.
As he knows, I have a long history of taking antisemitism extremely seriously—for instance, when it poisoned my own party—and I will always speak out without fear or favour when I see it raise its ugly head.
I am, however, deeply disappointed by his attempts to pretend that the Government have been anything other than robust on this.
He will know that in the media interviews to which he referred, I made it crystal clear that the UK Government and I believe, and have believed for a long time, that Hamas is not only a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK but a terrorist organisation, and we will continue to describe it as such.
He will also know that in one of those interviews I made it clear that I had requested a meeting with the director general of the BBC to discuss the matter.
