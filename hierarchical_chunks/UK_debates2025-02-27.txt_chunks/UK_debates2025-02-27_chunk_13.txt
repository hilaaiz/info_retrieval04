I thank the Minister for that response.
In my constituency, formerly represented by the great Jennie Lee, the council-owned theatre and museum are due to close in just two months’ time.
Passionate members of our community have come together to form the Cannock Chase Theatre Trust and the Chase Heritage CIC to save these precious venues.
Will the Minister join me in thanking those groups for all their efforts, and will he set out how the Government are supporting such community groups to take on culture and heritage venues at risk?
