Of course I agree with the hon.
Gentleman that children cannot be held responsible for relationships that they have but, to be clear, if the child in question is related to senior Hamas officials, that is important context for viewers to understand.
Not to inform the public about that context falls way short of the standards we would expect of our national broadcasters.
Can I also say to the hon.
Gentleman that we as a country have not stood aside while over 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza?
My right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary has made this his top priority—he has been in the region several times in recent months—and just a few weeks ago, my right hon.
Friend the Minister for Development announced £17 million in humanitarian funding for Gaza to ensure that we support its people.
Notwithstanding the very difficult decision that the Prime Minister announced at this Dispatch Box on Tuesday, we are committed to continuing to support the people of Gaza.
The days when people gained their news from the BBC and ITV are long gone.
We now have a whole range of media outlets, many of which do not have the same editorial standards as we expect from our national broadcaster, so does the Secretary of State agree that it is vital that we can trust our national broadcaster and that it maintains the highest possible standards?
The hon.
Member makes an important point, which I do not think anybody has made yet in this debate, which is that we expect more from the BBC, because it is our treasured national broadcaster.
There is a media landscape out there, and we have got to make sure that all our broadcasters meet the highest standards, especially when it comes to this conflict.
