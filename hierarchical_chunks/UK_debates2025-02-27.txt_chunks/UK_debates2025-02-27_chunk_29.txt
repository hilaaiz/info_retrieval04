I welcome this statement because I think it is important that we talk about our tone in public life.
I worry that sometimes the public outside the Chamber do not see this House as being the best arbiter of appropriate tone.
In fact, in recent days I have heard jokes about suicide, I have seen sexism and so much more.
Does the Secretary of State agree that we should lead from the front and set a good example in this House on how we police our own boundaries and language?
