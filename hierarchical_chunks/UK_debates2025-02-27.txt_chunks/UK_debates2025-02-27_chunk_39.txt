I thank the Minister for her answers to the urgent question.
The BBC has publicly funded status and therefore has an obligation to report impartially, but that has been called into question since the  7 October  atrocities.
Will the Minister act to hold the BBC cameraman and the staff accountable for their failings?
Furthermore, what measures will be introduced to ensure that the BBC’s editorial standards are raised to prevent the dissemination of misleading, biased and unverified content?
