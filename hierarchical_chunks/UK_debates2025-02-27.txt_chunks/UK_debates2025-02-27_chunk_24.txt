I commend the Secretary of State for her response to the urgent question; we agree with the position being taken.
I cannot imagine what it must be like to be a Palestinian child in Gaza.
In the first six months of the war alone, 2% of the child population was killed or injured, and tens of thousands more will have been orphaned or left homeless.
Given this humanitarian catastrophe, many in this House today will find it deeply disappointing that, due to errors made in the production of this documentary, we are instead discussing why it was pulled, rather than the pressing matter at hand.
Many of us will share the regret that we have ended up in this situation.
Clearly, innocent Palestinian children have suffered terribly over the past 16 months.
Does the Secretary of State agree that, regardless of today’s discussion, it is vital to shine an ongoing, credible and sustained spotlight on the plight of children in Gaza?
Yes, and I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his careful and considered words on this.
In the last year I met with the British families of some of the children in Gaza and the stories are absolutely horrifying.
We have a duty to ensure that those stories are told, and that people can have confidence in what they are being told.
