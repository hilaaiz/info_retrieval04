I thank the hon.
Member for his answer.
As he says, there are 7,000 staff working here who support 650 Members of this House and 836 in the other place.
As he recognises, it is essential that the needs, wisdom and experience of the people who make  the estate a success are heard and fully considered.
Will he commit to continuing to run that full consultation and maximising efforts to do so in a way that will ensure the strongest attendance and the best engagement?
