I welcome the Secretary of State’s robust view on the BBC.
However, the problem is that the BBC does not refer to Hamas as a terrorist organisation, as it should.
Indeed, the problem is that David Collier, an investigative journalist, could  actually go through the documentary and identify all the errors that were made while sitting at his computer.
If the BBC cannot do that, something is seriously wrong, particularly when it is in the position of commissioning this documentary, not doing it internally.
Can the Secretary of State make sure that when she talks to the BBC, it makes extra efforts to ensure that if it commissions these sorts of documentaries, they are actually accurate and not using terrorists and potentially funnelling money to terrorists?
