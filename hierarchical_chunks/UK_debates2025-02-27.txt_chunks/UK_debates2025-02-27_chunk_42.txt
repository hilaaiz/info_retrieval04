Mr Speaker, I am not quite sure what mental obfuscation is filling my head this morning, but I thank you again.
It is my happy task to open by saying that today sees the retirement of Dawn, a stalwart of the Tea Room.
I am sure that I speak for the whole House in wishing her a very happy retirement.
