I thank the hon.
Lady for her reply.
I want to make her aware of a cross-party group that has been set up in Parliament, supported by  the hon.
Member for St Albans (Daisy Cooper) ,  the hon.
Member for Chester North and Neston (Samantha Dixon) , and others who represent cathedral cities.
We want to help the Second Church Estates Commissioner by providing greater evidence of the economic contribution of cathedrals.
The first world war centenary cathedral repairs fund helped many cathedrals, including Salisbury.
I hope that she will consider making representations for the creation of something similar to support our cathedrals in future.
