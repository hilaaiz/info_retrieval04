May I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State for Development and Africa for the constructive cross-party way that we have been able to work together since I was appointed to this post in such grim times?
He will know that every minute counts right now in Gaza.
Incubators have been switched off and children are drinking dirty water.
Fresh water and power are the most pressing issues, but despite our shared hopes of progress this week, fuel was not permitted in the convoys that entered Gaza, while several hospitals have been hit and many given multiple warnings to evacuate.
Can he share with the House what the Government are doing to help broker an agreement that  will protect hospitals and get fuel into Gaza so that international law is upheld, hospitals can power up and water and power can flow?
First, I welcome the hon.
Lady to her new position.
It is one that I held for five years from 2005 and I very much hope that she will hold it for five years—[Laughter.]
It is one of the best jobs in opposition and in government.
She will know that we are having humanitarian discussions with everyone, intent as we are on getting humanitarian supplies to those who need them.
She asked specifically about attacking a hospital.
Attacking a hospital is a war crime.
We should be in no doubt about that.
What steps his Department is taking to help ensure that humanitarian support reaches people affected by the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Following the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh last month, the Government called for an end to the violence, direct talks between parties to the conflict and urgent humanitarian access.
We have provided £1 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to meet humanitarian needs, and of course the UN has had access to the region.
We encourage Azerbaijan to continue co-operation in that regard.
