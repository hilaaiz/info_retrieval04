We are hearing horrifying reports from those who have done the right thing and taken terrible risks to escape to Pakistan, who are now living in constant fear of arrest or deportation because this Government have left them in limbo.

Respectfully, we have not left them in limbo.
The situation is extremely difficult.
It is difficult because of the depredations of—let me be very clear—the tyrannical regime of the Taliban; that is why we are in this situation.
We have relocated more than 21,000 people, and we continue to work at pace with our mission in Pakistan and elsewhere to ensure that these people, despite the local troubles and difficulties, get the support they need.

At a vigil outside Parliament this morning, the names of some of the more than 2,000 children killed so far in Gaza were read out.
Children in Gaza have begun writing their names on their hands so that they can be identified and buried with their families when they are killed.
What action are the Government taking to prevent more children being harmed in Israel’s military action and to ensure a rapid end to this conflict?
