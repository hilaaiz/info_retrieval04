George Mitchell, the great American peacemaker, said that diplomacy was “700 days of failure and one day of success”.
Labour recognises the hard, quiet diplomacy required to secure the release of hostages and eventually long-term peace, but in this bloody war we cannot afford 700 days without success.
Overnight, we saw reports of the possible release of 50 hostages, only to learn that those talks had stumbled.
Can the Foreign Secretary update the House on the progress to secure the release of all the 200 hostages so cruelly taken by Hamas terrorists?
