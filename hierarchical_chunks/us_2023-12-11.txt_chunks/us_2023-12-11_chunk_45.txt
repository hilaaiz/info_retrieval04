Mr. Speaker, the federal Renewable Fuel Standard's exclusion of fuel for ocean-going vessels, without any stated rationale, has created unnecessary regulatory complexity, hindered the advanced biofuel and renewable natural gas industries, and undermined the global effort to reduce maritime emissions.
I encourage all Members of Congress to join me in removing this outdated restriction by cosponsoring our bipartisan the ``Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act'' (H.R. 6681).
