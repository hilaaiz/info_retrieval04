cost of services that they had.
I am told that they just had trouble with finances, and they couldn't get a loan.
In some small rural areas, like where I grew up, there aren't credit unions everywhere like there are in the city of Houston where I live now.
Even in the city of Houston, many small businesses during the pandemic couldn't secure a PPP loan in round one.
We [as Congress] had to go in and do a carve-out to literally force the banks to provide loans to small businesses.
I am glad that one of my colleagues was openhearted and gave people a lot of loans.
I just hope that that included loans to minority small businesses.
