Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Captain Howard McKinney, U.S. Army, Retired, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His excellent service to both the Army and our nation is a shining example of citizenship and commitment to duty.
During his service, CPT McKinney served in Georgia, Louisiana, and Vietnam where, as a Captain Infantry Platoon Leader, he led soldiers directly into combat during several enemy engagements.
His accomplishments did not go unnoticed with his many awards including a Silver Star, Purple Heart, and an Army Commendation Medal.
CPT McKinney returned to Texas after his dedicated years of service.
With the extensive experience he acquired with his work with automated tax systems, he started his own business, McKinney E-Systems & Associates, Inc. in Austin.
Since retirement from the U.S. Army, he has devoted his time, talents, and resources to family, church, community, and veteran organizations.
I join CPT Howard McKinney's family, friends, and colleagues in acknowledging his selflessness.
His fearless support and devotion to service before himself makes him a worthy recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
