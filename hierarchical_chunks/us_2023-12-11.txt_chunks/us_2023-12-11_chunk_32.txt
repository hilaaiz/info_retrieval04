Mr. ISSA.
Mr. Speaker, today I take a moment to recognize Army Captain Kirk R. Proctor, Jr., an exceptional Officer, leader and public servant.
Cpt.
Proctor has concluded a year as a member of my legislative team, and within this duration, he has made a real impact on a multitude of defense, national security, and foreign affairs policy initiatives.
His on-the-ground perspective bolstered by my team's analysis--from how the industrial base ties into the operational force, to explaining the evolution of military medicine, and how readiness initiatives intersect with military family quality of life.
Furthermore, Cpt.
Proctor has inspired colleagues to learn more about the defense industry through his application of institutional knowledge and hardearned experiences.
Cpt.
Proctor's unwavering dedication to my office and contributions to Congress have not gone unnoticed.
His commitment to the American people and passion for public service is admirable, and I hope he is offered the most unique opportunities and enriching assignments as he continues his career as an Army Officer.
I wish Cpt.
Proctor and his wife Sabia the best of luck as he begins his next assignment as a legislative liaison, and I look forward to seeing him lead in the years to come.
On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a grateful Nation, I extend my deepest appreciation to Captain Kirk R. Proctor, Jr., and I congratulate him as he continues a career of public service within the U.S. Army and to our Nation.
