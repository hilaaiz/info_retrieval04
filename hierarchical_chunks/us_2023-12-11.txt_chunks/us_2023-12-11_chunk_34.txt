Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Mr. William ``Bill'' Shepler for his years of service to the Mackinaw City community and retirement as President of the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum Board.
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, our country assumed heavy demands on the war materials industry.
In order to sustain these increased production needs, the United States Coast Guard icebreaker, Cutter Mackinaw WAGB-83, was authorized for construction on December 17, 1941.
Until decommissioning, The Mackinaw proved to be an essential facet of the Great Lakes' economy, colloquially becoming known as ``The Queen of the Great Lakes.''
The Mackinaw was essential to the maintenance of the shipping lanes of the Lakes, becoming responsible for over 100 trapped ships being freed from ice blockages or buildups.
Following a long and successful career, the ship began its decommissioning process and the City of Cheboygan attempted to find a suitable home for The Mackinaw.
In August of 2004, 
Mr. Shepler, along with Dick Moehl and Sandy Planisek, founded the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum in order to keep the ship in the Great Lakes.
Following its successful development, the renowned icebreaker was decommissioned on July 10, 2006, and was moored at its permanent berth on July 21, 2006.
With gratitude to the IMMM board of directors under the direction of Bill Shepler, the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum welcomed its first visitors in the spring of 2007.
Visitors can now explore the ship's 62-year history, making their way around the Mess Deck, Engine Room, Captain's Quarters, Sick Bay, Galley, Navigation Room and more.
