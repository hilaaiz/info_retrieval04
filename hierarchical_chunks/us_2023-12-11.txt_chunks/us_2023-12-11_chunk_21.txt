Mr. Speaker, a transparent market will be a competitive market.
With transparency in lending, banks are driven to compete and offer better terms.
With this resolution, extreme MAGA Republicans are protecting the secret discriminatory practices of big banks and lenders.
Repealing this rule would harm all those who stand to benefit from much-needed transparency.
Make no mistake, extreme MAGA Republicans continue to put the interests of the big bank CEOs and corporate lobbyists ahead of their constituents.
It is they who, time and time again, put profits over people.
House Democrats will continue protecting everyday consumers and small business owners, while holding corporations accountable.
We will always put people over corporate profits.
We will always put light over darkness.
