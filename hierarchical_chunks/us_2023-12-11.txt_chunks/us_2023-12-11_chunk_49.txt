Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the extraordinary career of Colonel Robert R. Gosney, U.S. Army, Retired.
Throughout his life, he has dedicated himself to his country, fellow warriors, and neighbors.
I am proud to present him with the Congressional Veteran Commendation.
During his years of service in the U.S. Army, he went above and beyond to serve his country.
COL Gosney was a master of many assignments and responsibilities during two tours in Vietnam (where he served alongside his brother), including various field artillery, army aviation assignments, and commanding the 25th Infantry Division Aviation Battalion.
COL Gosney also served as Chief of the U.S. Military Mission in Monrovia, Liberia.
His commitment to service didn't end when he left the military as he remains active in numerous community organizations.
COL Gosney was a member of the Temple Founder Lions Club for 38 years, serving his neighbors by identifying and responding to the needs of the community as their main goal.
He also is a valued member of the Christ the King Catholic Church and Knights of Columbus in Belton, TX.
He's made lasting and indelible contributions that make Central Texas a place we're all glad to call home.
COL Gosney's life tells the story of a man unafraid to contribute both his time and energy to the defense of our nation and the betterment of his community.
His devotion to service before self reflects the best of the generous American spirit.
