Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following remarks by the Honorable Ventris C. Gibson.
Good Afternoon.
It is a pleasure to be here to introduce the designs for the 2024 Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Program.
Every day, across the Nation, the Mint connects Americans through coins.
Next year, it will be our great privilege to connect America to the service and sacrifice of American soldiers and civilians during the Second World War.
The National World War II Memorial stands as an important symbol of America's national unity, a timeless reminder of the moral strength and power that flows when free people are at once united and bonded together in a common and just cause for liberty.
This is the first national memorial dedicated to all who served during World War II and acknowledges the commitment and achievement of the entire Nation.
It honors the more than 16 million who served in the Armed Forces of the United States, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war effort from home.
Their legacy is part of our American story.
Since the Mint's establishment in 1792, the women and men story of our nation through enduring examples of numismatic art.
As the largest mint in the world, the United States Mint produces the coinage required by our Nation to conduct its trade and commerce.
In addition, Congress authorizes a maximum of two commemorative coin programs annually to celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and institutions.
I would like to thank 
Senator Browne,
