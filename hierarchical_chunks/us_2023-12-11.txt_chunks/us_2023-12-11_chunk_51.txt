Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to present a Congressional Veteran Commendation to First Lieutenant Debbie Ann NashKing, U.S. Army, Retired.
Her life and career reflect hard work, activism, and dedication to what's best for her nation and Central Texas.
After being commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army, she attended the Medical Services Corp Officer's course and completed her military tour as the Fort Hood Dental Clinic's company commander.
Her contributions didn't go unnoticed as she earned various commendations including the Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.
1LT Nash-King's commitment to service didn't end when she stepped away from the military.
She's tirelessly supported her community by volunteering and serving on a broad array of important organizations and groups throughout the region, committing her talents and energies to make the Lone Star State a great place to call home.
Currently, she serves as the Mayor.
Texas and has made lasting contributions to the city that is home to Fort Cavazos.
She has been a shining example of citizenship and commitment to duty in every step of her life.
I commend 1LT Nash-King's selfless service to the United States Army, her nation, and her community.
Her patriotism, citizenship, and commitment to others reflect the traits that make both our state and Nation great.
I join her friends and family in celebrating her outstanding achievements.
