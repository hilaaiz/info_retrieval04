Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Officer Mark Frost, upon his retirement on December 1, 2023 for 27 years of dedicated service to the people of the State of California as a California Highway Patrol (CHP) Officer.
Officer Frost began his journey in law enforcement in Sacramento at the California Highway Patrol Academy on December 2, 1996, and successfully graduated on June 6, 1997.
Following his graduation, he was assigned as a California Highway Patrol Officer to the CHP Hayward Office.
He later transferred to the Merced Office on October 1, 2001, where he served in various roles such as the union representative in the California Association of Highway Patrolmen (CAHP) for the CHP Merced Area, and as the CAHP District 3 Defense Representative.
Additionally, Officer Frost was certified as an Emergency Medical Responder (EMR) and served as a CPR instructor.
His expertise also extended to firearm safety as the Weapons Range Safety Officer.
Showcasing his attention to detail and commitment to maintaining the integrity of the law enforcement process, he served as the Evidence Officer for the CHP Merced Office.
His leadership qualities were further recognized as he assumed the responsibilities of Officer in Charge (OIC) and Acting CHP Sergeant for the Merced Area.
Officer Mark Frost exemplifies the highest standards of duty and commitment to public service with his 27-year career as a California Highway Patrolman.
Every day, he tirelessly strived to serve the people of the State of California, earning the admiration of myself and his local community in the Central Valley.
