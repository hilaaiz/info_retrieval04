In 2024, Mexico was the second-largest destination for U.S. exports and the top source of U.S. imports.
Total U.S. goods and services trade with Mexico, in 2024, totaled over $935 billion.
I am particularly grateful of the trade ties between South Carolina and Mexico.
In 2024, the Palmetto State exported over three and a onehalf billion dollars of rubber and plastic products, electrical equipment and components, iron and steel, and other items to our southern partner, while importing more than five and one half billion dollars in motor vehicle and aerospace parts, and other goods.
This integration highlights the deeply connected partnership between Mexico and South Carolina.
I applaud the deep commitment of President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate and collaborate in stopping illegal aliens crossing our Southern Border, including the murderous threats posed by drug traffickers with human trafficking.
This underscores the promise by President Trump to protect American lives.
This day is also special to me because I have a dedicated member of my staff, Daniel Ramirez, who is first generation Mexican-American.
I am appreciative that the United States and Mexico are partners--and neighbors--and wish the people of Mexico a Happy 215th Independence Day.
