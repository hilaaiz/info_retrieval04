For more than twenty-five years, Navin KC has been a tireless force in the world of dance and choreography, introducing Nepali language, art, and culture to audiences both nationally and internationally.
As the Founder and Director of KC Dance Center in Virginia, he has provided countless students, particularly second-generation children, with dance training that emphasizes not only technique but also cultural heritage and language.
His choreography has been featured in films, theater productions, and music videos, while his students have performed across the United States in places such as Hollywood, New York, Texas, and Colorado.
Since 2017, through his annual production, ``Kollywood Night,'' Navin has created a powerful platform where emerging talent and celebrated artists come together to celebrate the richness of Nepali culture on stage.
