Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Denver East High School--an institution that has been at the heart of my district for a century and a half--as it celebrates the centennial rededication of its historic building.
East High opened its doors 150 years ago in 1875 as Denver's first high school, setting a foundation of excellence that continues to this day.
The current building, designed by George H. Williamson, a proud member of East's Class of 1893, was completed in 1925.
Its iconic 162-foot clock tower, modeled after Independence Hall in Philadelphia, has stood as an iconic beacon.
In 1991, the building was recognized as an official Denver Historic Landmark.
Over the past 150 years, East High has shaped leaders, artists, athletes, and innovators.
From First Lady Mamie Eisenhower, to Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Philip Bailey and Larry Dunn of Earth, Wind & Fire, to aerospace leader Norman Augustine, to head coach of the Detroit Pistons J. B. Bickerstaff, East alumni have left an indelible mark on our city, our country, and our world.
Equally impressive is East's storied athletic tradition, with the Angels earning 99 state championships, the third most of any high school in Colorado.
Generations of students
