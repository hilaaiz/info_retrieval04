have worn the red and white with pride, carrying forward the spirit of teamwork and perseverance.
More than its achievements, East High has always been about community.
This rededication brings together alumni, students, teachers, and neighbors to honor its history, connect across generations, and create new memories for the future.
As a lifelong Coloradan and graduate of the Denver Public School system, I am proud to recognize East High School for 150 years of excellence in education and for the centennial rededication of its landmark building.
