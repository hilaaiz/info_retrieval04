Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to recognize September 16, 2025, as Mexico's 215th Independence Day.
Mexico has served as an invaluable diplomatic, trade, and cultural partner with the United States for two hundred years, reflecting the close relationship that make this alliance invaluable to both countries.
