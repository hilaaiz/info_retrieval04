Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to honor one of my dear friends, Denice Harlan, as she retires from her role as President/CEO of the Giddings Chamber.
Denice moved to Giddings, Texas, in 1983 with her beloved husband, Wade.
She opened Harlan's Restaurant in 1987 to provide delicious homestyle cooking.
Her passion for service led her to join the Giddings Chamber of Commerce and serve as Chamber Director.
In addition, Denice has also served on the New Horizons Lions' Club, Lee County Fair Association, and Rotary Club.
She was most recently recognized with the Giddings Lifetime Achievement Award.
I want to thank Denice for the devotion she has demonstrated and her commitment to serving the constituents.
I am grateful for her leadership, and I send my best wishes to Denice as she begins this new chapter in life.
As a member of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored to join her family and friends in congratulating Denice Harlan on this momentous occasion.
