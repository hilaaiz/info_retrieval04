I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his kinds words.
It is always a pleasure to work with him and his colleagues.
It is our intention that the legislation will clear both Houses by July, although obviously not all of these things are within our gift.
Should that be the case, as we fully expect it to be, the convictions will be quashed in July and compensation redress will be paid from August.
