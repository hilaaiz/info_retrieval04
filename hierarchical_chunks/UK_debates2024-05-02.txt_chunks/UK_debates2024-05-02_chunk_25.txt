I thank the hon.
Lady for her question and her interest in this important sector.
We regularly meet the UK seafood sector, which can often be subject to very high tariffs from foreign markets, but the UK’s quality shines through.
It is a key part of many of our current trade negotiations.
I urge her to watch this space.
We are always happy to meet the company concerned, but I can reassure her that when it comes to seafood exports, the Department is constantly engaged both in trade policy and in the support we give our exporters.
