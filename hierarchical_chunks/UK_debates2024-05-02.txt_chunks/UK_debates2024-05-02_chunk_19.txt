I thank my right hon.
Friend for her work on this, and she raised this important matter with me at meetings last month.
We allocate £50 million for the uncommercial part of the network, and part of that should help the services in her constituency.
I know she is disappointed at the closure of the outreach service in Kelsale, but there is an alternative permanent post office branch in Saxmundham, 1.3 miles away.
I am happy to continue the conversation between her and the post office to make sure that she gets the services she needs in her constituency.
