Can the Secretary of State tell us about the UK’s supply of cyber-security professionals and whether a lot of that work is now being offshored?
I am afraid that I do not have the details to answer that question.
On the face of it, given the information I have, it is not something I have heard before, but we can write back with more information.
However, it does not sound like that is the case.
In my constituency we have the fantastic company Selwyn’s, whose seafood is first class.
It exports a lot; what is the Government’s current assessment of the export of cockles and other seafood in the Welsh market?
