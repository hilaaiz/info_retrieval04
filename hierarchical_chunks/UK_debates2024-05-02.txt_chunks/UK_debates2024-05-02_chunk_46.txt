Hayfield Lane Primary School in Doncaster is a great school, with great teachers, a great head, Mrs Tempest, and wonderful children.
Sadly, the Labour Mayor of Labour-controlled Doncaster Council has failed this great school.
Her dither and delay is a disaster, and it is affecting our children.
Despite many years of letters, phone calls, meetings and false promises, the school still has a leaky roof, soaked carpets, water in the electric system, mould in the classrooms and a smell of damp throughout.
It is a disgrace that the Mayor is allowed to subject our most vulnerable—our children—to that.
Can we have a debate on the need for elected Mayors to step up and do their job of maintaining schools, like Hayfield Lane Primary School, instead of constantly blaming the Government for their own shortcomings?
