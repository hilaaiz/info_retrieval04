I also thank the hon.
Gentleman for being greatly responsible for the new Westminster Hall start time, which he has also advertised today.
Transport for the East Midlands has found that 60% of drivers feel unsafe driving on the A1, and over half report either being in an accident or knowing someone who has been in one.
In 2022, there were 500 collisions on the A1, which is 26% more than on the A5 and 16% more than on the A2.
Can we please have a debate in Government time on safety upgrades to the A1?
This affects dozens of constituencies, as the A1 is the longest road in this country.
Will my right hon.
Friend also kindly advise on when we can expect to see the next review of upgrading  A roads to motorways?
This is the No. 1 issue for my constituents.
I have sat in traffic on the A1 on many a school run after appalling accidents that take one or two days to clear.
