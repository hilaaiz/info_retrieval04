I thank my hon.
Friend for standing up for, and campaigning on behalf of, parents and children in his constituency.
His local authority has been allocated £900,000 for this financial year, to be prioritised across its schools, including the school he mentions.
That is on top of the school rebuilding programme, which is transforming buildings across the country, including three in the Doncaster local authority area.
I know that my hon.
Friend has raised and campaigned on the matter considerably.
He will know that where there are serious problems with school buildings and the responsible bodies that are supposed to be looking after them fail, the Department for Education will provide additional advice and support on a case-by-case basis.
I will write to the Secretary of State for Education this afternoon and ask that her Department meets my hon.
Friend to discuss this serious matter.
Doncaster local authority is failing in its duty, and that needs to be addressed.
