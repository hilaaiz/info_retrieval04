I thank my right hon.
Friend for the valuable work he is doing as the Prime Minister’s trade envoy to the Republic of Korea.
I look forward to his upcoming visit there.
He is famous for his timely interventions.
Detailed round 2 discussions on an upgraded FTA took place in London from 18 to  22 March , which provided an opportunity to conclude the exploratory phase of negotiations.
We now look forward to text-based negotiations in round 3, which is due to take place in Seoul from  24 June .
