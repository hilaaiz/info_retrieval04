I thank my hon.
Friend for her work on this issue, which is of huge importance to her constituents, and for her diligence in consistently raising it with the Government.
She will know that the next draft of the road investment strategy, covering 2025 to 2030, will be published shortly, and I will ensure that the Secretary of State for Transport has heard what she has said today.
I also understand that the roads Minister, my hon.
Friend  the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) , is happy to meet her to discuss these specific concerns.
