I thank my hon.
Friend for all the work she has done on this subject.
She has campaigned diligently on it, and made a huge difference to the lives of many people.
The forced marriage unit, which is run jointly by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the Home Office, is leading the Government’s work in this area.
It is running outreach and undertaking  casework, and operates both inside and outside the UK.
I will ensure the relevant Minister and officials have heard her suggestions on how its work can be enhanced.
