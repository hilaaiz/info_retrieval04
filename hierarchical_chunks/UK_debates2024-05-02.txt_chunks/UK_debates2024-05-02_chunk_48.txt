The Leader of the House has announced all kinds of worthy general debates, including on statutory instruments, leaving plenty  of time for Dissolution and wash-up, if need be, but she has not announced any Opposition days.
She will be in receipt of a letter from the Chair of the Procedure Committee, which says: “If, however, the Government has specific proposals in relation to any changes it envisages to Standing Orders” on Opposition days, “the Committee would be willing to examine and consult on such proposals”.
