I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising those concerning matters.
I will certainly make sure that the Foreign Secretary has heard the concerns he has raised.
Aside from the immediate issues on which the hon.
Gentleman is primarily focused, UNRWA has been financially fragile for a long time, with little long-term financial planning and security.
There are many issues that the Foreign Secretary and his team will want to consider before taking a decision on whether to restart funding.
