He is right that the Republic of Korea will play a vital role in that.
The recently signed Downing Street accord with Korea outlines the breadth and depth of the ongoing relationship.
We look forward to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership coming into effect later this year, and we look forward to seeing if the Republic of Korea will apply.
I am sure  the right hon.

The hon.
Gentleman has slightly jumped the gun, as the next question on the Order Paper relates to trade envoys.

We think they do an excellent, good value-for-money job for the United Kingdom in promoting trade in a number of key markets.
