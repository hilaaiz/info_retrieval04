I apologise to the House for my absence over the last two weeks.
I am glad to say that things are improving as we deal with a very difficult family situation.
The Leader of the House was kind enough to mention that the Backbench Business Committee has been allocated  Thursday 16 May , and it will be our intention to put on a debate on the parliamentary ombudsman’s report on the state pension age for women.
All Chamber slots up to the Whitsun recess are now allocated, but we still have several Westminster Hall slots to allocate for the new, improved start time of 12.30 pm on Thursdays, which seems to be working quite well.
We have three slots to allocate between now and the Whitsun recess, and we would welcome applications.
Mr Speaker, I am sure you will agree that there is no need for the hon.
Gentleman to apologise.
I hope he heard all our good wishes to him and his family while he was away.
