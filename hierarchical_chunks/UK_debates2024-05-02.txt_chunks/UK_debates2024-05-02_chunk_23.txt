I thank my hon.
Friend for championing businesses in her constituency.
We are putting £3.8 billion into skills training for people who work for businesses, which is important.
We are also improving skills for entrepreneurs and business owners through our help to grow management programme—it can be found on the help to grow webpage—a 12-week mini-MBA, which is 90% funded by the Government.
We also have “Help to Grow: Management Essentials”, which offers two hours of totally free online training for aspirant new business owners.
