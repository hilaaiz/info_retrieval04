The Government are clear that British businesses and solar developers should not stand for receiving solar panels from companies linked to forced labour.
We have already taken steps to address the issue through the Procurement Act 2023 and the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
In addition, the forthcoming UK solar road map will outline a clear path to reaching our solar deployment ambitions, including on energy security.
I reassure my hon.
Friend that sustainable solar supply chains will form a central chapter of that road map, and I would be happy to either arrange or have a meeting with her.
What steps her Department is taking to support postmasters affected by errors in the Horizon IT system in Northern Ireland.
On Monday, the House agreed a Government amendment to the Horizon exoneration Bill—the Post Office (Horizon System)
Offences Bill—to include convictions in Northern Ireland.
The Northern Ireland Executive faced unique challenges in delivering their own legislation in a timely manner.
Including Northern Ireland in the Bill ensures that postmasters there are not left behind, and receive exoneration and access to compensation on a UK-wide basis.
First, let me put on record my thanks to the Minister, who has been an industrious, assiduous and great champion for the postmasters and postmistresses across this United Kingdom.
There is not a person in the House who does not have great respect for him.
Further to Monday’s business in the House regarding that Northern Ireland provision in the Horizon Bill, which was brought forward by my hon.
Friend  the Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)  and my right hon.
Friend  the Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) , will the Minister outline a timeline so that postmasters and postmistresses across all of Northern Ireland can see an end to the reputational and financial damage, and the heartache caused by the disgraceful operation of the Horizon scheme?
