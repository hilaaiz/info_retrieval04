We recently announced that we were raising the monetary thresholds that determine  company size, reducing burdens on smaller businesses and removing low-value and overlapping reporting requirements.
Around 13,000 medium-sized companies will be reclassified as small companies, and 100,000 small companies will be reclassified as micro-companies.
This will save small and medium-sized companies around £145 million a year.
