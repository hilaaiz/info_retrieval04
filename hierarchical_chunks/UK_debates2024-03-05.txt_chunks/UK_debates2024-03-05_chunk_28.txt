I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question and her kind invite to visit her constituency.
I pay tribute to all the work she has done to secure investment in Anglia Ruskin University.
She is right to highlight the importance of delivering clinical placements as part of the long-term workforce plan.
I assure her that we are working closely with NHS England and partners in health and education to ensure that happens.
