The hon.
Lady will no doubt be extremely envious of the fact that in England there are 50 million more GP appointments now every year, which is a fantastic achievement by this Government.
She will want to look at what is happening in Scotland, which has some of the worst health outcomes in western Europe, and challenge SNP Ministers over drug and alcohol death rates and falls in life expectancy.
Will my right hon.
Friend explain an anomaly in the “Agenda for Change” pay deal as it affects non-NHS providers?
People working in the NHS for non-NHS providers may be eligible for extra money if the organisation they work for is in financial difficulties, but not if it is not.
So badly run organisations are being rewarded and well-run organisations are being penalised, which seems to me to be perverse.
I am happy to meet my right hon.
Friend to discuss the matter.
We have reached pay settlements with the “Agenda for Change” unions, and we continue to reach pay deals with other unions.
We are also supporting non-NHS providers whose contracts are dynamically aligned.
It is a complex area, so I am more than happy to meet my right hon.
Friend to discuss his concerns.
