I welcome the Government’s recent refresh of the women’s health strategy and the addition to it of birth trauma.
However, I am currently chairing a national inquiry into birth trauma, and we are hearing from mothers throughout the United Kingdom about some of the severe mental health conditions that they are facing, including postpartum psychosis.
I have been particularly concerned to hear about the risk of suicide among new mothers.
What action are the Government taking to address this?
