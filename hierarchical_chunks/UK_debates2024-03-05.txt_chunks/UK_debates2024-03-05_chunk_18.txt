I thank the Minister for that answer.
I just want to say that the age-related Bill on the sale of tobacco products will create the first generation of smoke-free people in the United Kingdom.
All politics is local, and it is vital that we have the same legislation in Northern Ireland.
In Northern Ireland, smoking contributes to at least 1,300 smoking-related cancers  per year.
Some 13.9% of the people in my constituency continue to smoke, irrespective of the guidance given.
I am glad to hear the Minister’s assurance on the legislation, but will the Government engage with the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure it is on their priority list?
