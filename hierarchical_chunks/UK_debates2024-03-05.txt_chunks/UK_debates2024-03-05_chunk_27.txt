I thank the Health and Secondary Care Minister for visiting the new medical school in Chelmsford yesterday.
This is the first time that students have ever been able to train as doctors in Essex in its history, and the results are phenomenal.
This is living proof of the Government’s commitment to train the NHS staff of the future.
What progress is he making to increase work placements for students so that we can train even more doctors, nurses and people for important roles such as physician associates?
