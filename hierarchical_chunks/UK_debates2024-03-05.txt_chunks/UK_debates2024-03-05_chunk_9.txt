I thank the hon.
Lady for raising her concerns, but as I said, this is a public consultation.
It runs for 14 weeks and will close on  17 March .
I urge her to raise her concerns as part of that consultation.
It is absolutely crucial that we keep expertise in our maternity services, but I understand that the local proposals by the trust and the integrated care board outline plans for £40 million of significant additional investment into maternity services.
Those decisions are for the local ICB and the local trust.
The deadline is  17 March , and I urge the hon.
Lady to ensure she takes part in that process.
