I thank the Secretary of State for her offer to help cut waiting lists in Scotland.
I listened to the frankly delusional statements from the SNP Benches about the state of the NHS in Scotland.
We are in dire straits and suffer the same problems, particularly about GPs and appointments disappearing.
When are we going to see an improvement in appointment availability?
