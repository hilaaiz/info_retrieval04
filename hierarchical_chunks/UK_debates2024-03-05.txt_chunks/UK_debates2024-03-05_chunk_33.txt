I thank the hon.
Lady for her question.
In fairness, colleagues from across the House have been raising this issue with me because it affects a large population of London and the surrounding areas.
I must leave it to NHS England to finish its consultation process, but I would be very happy to visit not just the Evelina but our other wonderful hospitals that look after children.
