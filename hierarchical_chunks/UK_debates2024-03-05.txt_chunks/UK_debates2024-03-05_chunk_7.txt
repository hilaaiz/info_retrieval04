It was the Minister’s party that promised to fix the crisis in social care “once and for all”.
With vacancy rates almost three times above the national average and turnover rates for new staff at more than 45%, it is clear that the Government failed.
Labour’s plan for a national care service with clear standards for providers and a new deal for staff will give social care the fundamental reset it needs.
The Government have done it with our workforce plan, and they have half-heartedly tried it with dentistry.
Does the Minister want to copy our homework once again?
Let us be honest, Labour has no plan for social care.
Whatever the shadow Minister says, it is unfunded.
There is no funding committed to it and it is not meaningful.
Those of us on the Conservative side of the House are reforming adult social care.
We not only have a plan, but it is in progress.
