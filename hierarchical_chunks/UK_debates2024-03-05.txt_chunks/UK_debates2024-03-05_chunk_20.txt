I thank the hon.
Lady for her work in this regard, and I absolutely acknowledge the issues that women are experiencing with this highly invasive procedure at what is often an extremely distressing time in their lives.
We are waiting for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to update its guidelines on best practice in hysteroscopies.
Following consultation last year that is under peer review, and is due to published soon.
However, as the hon.
Lady knows, I am clear that it should not be the responsibility of women in those very distressing circumstances to ask for pain relief.
Clinicians must assume that a woman wants it, and discuss that with her before the procedure.
