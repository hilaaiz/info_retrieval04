I thank my hon.
Friend for supporting our dental recovery plan.
Indeed, he is one of many colleagues who campaigned hard for it.
I am pleased to inform him that dental activity, as measured by courses of treatment, has increased by 15% on the previous year in his local integrated care board area, and our plan will support further increases to dental access through some 2.5 million additional appointments across the country, including in his constituency.
The first measure, namely new patient premiums, went live on Friday, and we hope to have the results very soon.
