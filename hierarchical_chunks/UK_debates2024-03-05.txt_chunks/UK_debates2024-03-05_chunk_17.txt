The simple fact is that the Conservatives have been in power for 14 years, and general practice has never been in a worse state.
Despite slogging their guts out, GPs are struggling because this Government have cut 2,000 GPs since 2015, making it even harder for patients to get an appointment.
Given that, why has the Government decided that the NHS needs what the Institute for Fiscal Studies has described as the biggest funding cut since the 1970s?
It has been a very long time since Labour were in government, but even the hon.
Gentleman knows that Ministers will never comment on fiscal events the day before they occur.
Let me introduce some  facts into his analysis.
We have now delivered on our  manifesto commitment for 50 million more general practice appointments per year, with 363.8 million booked in the last 12 months.
That compares with 312 million deliveredin the 12 months to December 2019.

If the hon.
Gentleman stopped shouting, perhaps he would be able to hear me.
About 62,000 more appointments were delivered per working day last December, excluding covid vaccinations.
We have our primary care recovery plan, and it is working.
Of course there is more to do, but even the hon.
Gentleman would not be so churlish as to deny those extra 50 million appointments.
When she plans to introduce a tobacco and vapes bill.
The hon.
Member will know that, shockingly, smoking kills 80,000 people across the UK every year, and costs society £17 billion in ill health and loss of productivity.
The Government will introduce the tobacco and vapes Bill shortly.
I am delighted to say that Northern Ireland Ministers announced just this morning that we will legislate for the whole of the United Kingdom.
