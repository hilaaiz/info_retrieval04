The Secretary of State will know that NHS England is expected to announce the decision about the primary children’s centre for cancer treatment in south London and south-east London.
Evelina London Children’s Hospital in my constituency is one of the only specialist centres in south London.
Does she agree that the final decision should be made as soon as possible in order to benefit staff, patients and families?
Will she join me in visiting Evelina London?
