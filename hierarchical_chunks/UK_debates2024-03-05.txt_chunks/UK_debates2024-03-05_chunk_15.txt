While we are talking about the recovery of primary care and the Secretary of State is at the Dispatch Box, the recovering access plan released last May talked about high-quality online consultation, text messaging services and online booking tools.
They were due in July, but that became August and then December, and I understand that it has now been delayed indefinitely due to a claim made against NHS England in what is a £300 million project.
That delay is hitting access to primary care.
Will the Secretary of State update the House?
We are determined to bring not just primary care but the whole NHS up to speed with technology.
We are firm advocates of the idea that technology can help free clinicians’ time and ensure that they are spending time looking at their patients rather than at computer screens.
In primary care, we are working to ensure the digital telephony services that have played such a critical role in providing those 50 million additional appointments, as I described.
I will take away my hon.
Friend’s points, and look into them carefully.
I have been corresponding with the Primary Care Minister,  the right hon.
Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom) , and her predecessors about urgently needing to protect general practice locations in city centres from outdated Treasury rules that potentially force them to move to ring-road locations.
The Minister’s latest reply suggested that the ICB could use capital funding to pay for new premises, but my ICB claims that that is against the rules.
Would she and her officials please urgently meet me and my local ICB to bottom out what the rules are and urgently protect our city centre GP locations?
I will ask the relevant Minister to write to the hon.
Lady.
