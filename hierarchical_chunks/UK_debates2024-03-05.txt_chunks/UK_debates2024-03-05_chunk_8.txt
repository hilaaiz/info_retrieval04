I have asked the Secretary of State a number of times how she intends to recruit and retain social care staff, particularly with the visa changes coming into effect next Monday, stopping those from overseas coming to fill skills gaps from bringing their spouse or dependants with them.
I ask again: how does the Secretary of State intend to improve the recruitment and retention of staff in the social care sector while her colleagues effectively work to undermine her?
We are grateful to international workers coming to support us in social care and improving supply, but we have to get the balance right between international recruitment and our domestic workforce.
In England, we are reforming social care careers to make social care work a career for our homegrown workforce, and I encourage her to make sure the SNP does the same in Scotland.
What discussions she has had with the North Central London integrated care system on the potential closure of maternity services in north London.
Improving maternity care is a year 2 priority in our women’s health strategy for this year.
Any decisions around maternity services need to be focusing on improving outcomes for mums and babies.
However, decisions on the local reconfiguration of services are made by local integrated care boards and local trusts.
The maternity unit at the Royal Free Hospital in my constituency is facing closure.
Last week, I met with doctors from the unit who told me that the Royal Free is uniquely placed to help mothers with diabetes, pregnant women with HIV, and mothers who require interventional radiology.
The Royal Free is the only local provider that offers this life-changing treatment 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Does the Minister agree that the Royal Free maternity unit has to stay open for the sake of those vulnerable groups of women?
