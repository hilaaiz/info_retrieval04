Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor the 100th anniversary of the Marshall Street Armory, a historic landmark that has served as a vital cornerstone of the Lansing community.
Since its opening in 1924, the Marshall Street Armory has played an important role in supporting our military through numerous conflicts and serving the people of Mid-Michigan.
Originally home to the 119th Field Artillery Regiment of the Michigan National Guard, the armory was designed by Michigan's first state architect, Lynn W. Fry, and stands as one of the earliest examples of Gothic-inspired military architecture in the state.
For more than 80 years, it housed Lansing-based National Guard units that contributed to the defense of our Nation in nearly every war during that period.
The Marshall Street Armory was also the staging ground for Guard units providing aid during domestic crises and natural disasters, helping to protect our country and assist those in need.
Beyond its military purpose, the armory became a gathering place for local residents.
It hosted weddings, concerts, swap meets, boxing matches, and even circuses, cementing its place as a hub for social events and activities.
Whether for celebrations or service, the Marshall Street Armory always brought people together in times of peace.
After the 119th Field Artillery Regiment was decommissioned in 2007, the armory closed its doors as a military facility.
In 2010, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, securing its legacy as an architectural and historical treasure.
In 2012, following extensive renovations, the Marshall Street Armory reopened as a nonprofit collaboration center.
Today, it houses several organizations, including Capital Area United Way, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and the Capital Region Community Foundation.
It continues to serve the Greater Lansing area in a new capacity, providing essential services and strengthening the fabric of Mid-Michigan.
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Marshall Street Armory, let us honor both
