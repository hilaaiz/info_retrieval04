Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Global Medical Response Stars of Life award recipients for 2024.
Each year, the American Ambulance Association (AAA) honors a select group of Emergency Medical Services professionals for their commitment to patient care, integrity, and compassion through the Stars of Life program.
Global Medical Response, a member of the AAA and the world's largest provider of emergent and non-emergent medical transportation and healthcare services, has identified 33 of its frontline heroes for this distinction, representing the best of the best in the air and on the ground.
We will find these heroes all around us in our communities.
From Maui, Hawaii where a Paramedic, served as the Incident Commander for EMS ground units during the deadly 2023 fire that devastated Lahaina to an advanced EMF in Lagrange, GA, who safely delivered a baby while the baby's mother was being transported to a hospital, and performed lifesaving interventions on the newborn, who was ``pulseless'' at the time of birth to Waco, TX where a paramedic, saved the life of a cardiac arrest patient after working on the individual for 30 minutes before achieving return of spontaneous circulation.
There are countless stories to share and so much that we can learn from the day-to-day lives of these heroes.
We must learn to exhibit integrity in everything we do and everything we say.
We must act with compassion and grace in even the most daunting and challenging of situations.
We must be vigilant, never wavering in our commitment to doing what is right for the community and answering the call to serve.
So that we will never forget the immense contributions to our communities made by the 2024 Global Medical Response Stars of Life award recipients, I respectfully request that each of their names be included in the Record to honor their service and humbly thank them for showing us what it means to truly serve, while providing care to the world at a moment's notice.
