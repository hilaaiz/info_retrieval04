Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Brian E. Fuchs, who retired this month after 41 years of faithful and dedicated service as a civilian employee of the U.S. Army.
After graduating from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Dr. Fuchs chose to apply his knowledge and experience to the U.S. military's munitions research at Picatinny Arsenal located in NJ-11.
The contributions he has made to our national defense, and to our allies' defense, are enormous, and we all owe him a debt of gratitude.
Dr. Fuchs first entered the U.S. Army in 1983 where he worked in energetics materials testing, detonation physics, and energetic formulations.
Since then, Dr. Fuchs has maintained a variety of different positions on various boards and organizations focused on insensitive munitions research.
Dr. Fuchs is also a leader in the rapidly growing field of research on explosive ink where, under his leadership, his team was able to produce the first qualified explosive ink.
Along with his long career in munitions development, Dr. Fuchs is an Adjunct Professor for the Stevens Institute of Technology and serves as the Steering committee chair for NATO's Munitions Safety Information Analysis Center (MSIAC).
Widely recognized by several organizations, Dr. Fuchs was awarded the National Defense Industrial Association Firepower Award for Technology Development in 2016.
Dr. Fuchs has also been awarded the Academic R&D Award by Printed Electronics USA, the Six Army Research Development Achievement Award for Technical Excellence, and the Army Research Development Award for Leadership.
These awards were all given in recognition.
Fuchs' outstanding devotion to duty and his contributions to research and development of munitions.
I want to thank Dr. Fuchs for the critical engineering and research work that he and his team have done over his career to support our national defense, and I wish him the best for a well-earned and restful retirement.
