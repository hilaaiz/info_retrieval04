Ms. MOORE.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Wisconsin, I would like to recognize the Arnwine Family for honoring their family's legacy of perseverance, activism, and dedication to create a more equal and just nation.
Sterling Arnwine's 1936 interview with the Federal Writers Project captured the unimaginable hardship and persecution of him and his family while enslaved.
I am inspired by the story of Sterling Arnwine and the commitment of his descendants to share the stories of Black Americans who suffered under the violent institution of American slavery.
The sharing of stories not only memorializes the many people who suffered but also gives voice to the survivors.
I thank them for all they have done to benefit our communities.
The Arnwine Family has touched the lives of many, and I look forward to seeing the continued impact and change their family creates in the years to come.
