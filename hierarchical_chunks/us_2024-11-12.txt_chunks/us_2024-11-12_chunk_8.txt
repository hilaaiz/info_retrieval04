Mr. McCLINTOCK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and service of El Dorado County Supervisor John Hidahl, who passed away on November 2, 2024, at the age of 73.
John Hidahl was born and raised in California's Central Valley and graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.
Throughout his successful career, he worked at Aerojet for 31 years and Northrop Grumman for 10 years, where he filled various roles, such as a rocket test engineer, the director of engineering, and the chief systems manager.
Coming from a farming family, Supervisor Hidahl was also the Chairman of Hidahl Ranch, where he helped manage the almond and walnut farm.
Outside of his career success, Supervisor Hidahl tirelessly worked to improve the community around him.
His motto of service before self is evident in the various areas where he volunteered and served his community.
Among his many other roles in the El Dorado Hills community, he served for 33 years on the County Water District, 36 years on the Area Planning Advisory Committee, and 23 years on the Community Council.
Supervisor Hidahl was elected twice to the El Dorado County Board of Supervisors, where he served as the District 1 Supervisor while advocating for a balanced budget, open space preservation, and housing options for seniors.
Supervisor Hidahl was also engaged with his community outside of his formal roles, as he also actively supported the boy and girl scouts along with groups that serve the county's homeless population.
In his spare time, Supervisor Hidahl enjoyed spending time with his family, traveling, and being outdoors.
Supervisor Hidahl is survived by his wife Eileen, their five daughters, and their 10 grandchildren.
