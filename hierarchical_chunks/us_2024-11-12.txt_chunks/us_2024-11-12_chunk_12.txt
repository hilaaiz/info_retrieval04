Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to present the Quilt of Valor to Army veteran Sergeant Francis McArdle, in recognition of his great service to our country.
Sgt.
McArdle gave three years of his life to the United States by serving in the U.S. Army during one of the toughest times of American history, the Vietnam War.
He served his country in a multitude of ways, first beginning with a special designation as a Forward Observer to the 101st Airborne Division with the 527th Artillery Unit.
He then served as Communications Sergeant for Battery Company of the 527th Artillery before finishing his enlistment with the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division.
Not everyone answers the call to defend our freedom, particularly during such a turbulent time for our country.
Sgt.
McArdle was one of those rare patriots that did, and it was my great honor that I was able to present him with the Quilt America.
