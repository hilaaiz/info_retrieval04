Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, it was my honor to pay tribute to Sergeant Andrew ``Tim'' Kiniry, a 102-year-old U.S. Army veteran who served his country gallantly on the shores of Normandy during World War II.
Sergeant Kiniry performed one of the most courageous duties a solider can do by volunteering as a medic right on the front lines of one of America's bloodiest battles.
Not only did he charge bravely into battle with his unit, but he also simultaneously treated his fellow soldiers for injuries while under fire.
Army medics were often the primary target on the battlefield, marked by the Red Cross for protection, but it ultimately led to increased fire by the Nazis.
Tim, however, carried out his duties with bravery, applying tourniquets, bandaging wounds, and helping evacuate casualties to hospitals.
This past year, he returned to Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day and pay homage to all the fallen heroes.
In the years following the war, Tim has devoted much of his time educating the youth of the atrocities that war brings, and he loves to remind me of the great quote ``Lest we forget.''
I thank Tim for all he has done for the United States.
God bless Sergeant ``Tim'' and God bless the United States.
