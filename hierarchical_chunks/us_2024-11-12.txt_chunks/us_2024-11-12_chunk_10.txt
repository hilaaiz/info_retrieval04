Mr. KEATING.
Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote for H.R. 82, Social Security Fairness Act of 2023, due to air travel cancellations.
As both a co-sponsor and a signer of the discharge petition that brought this bill to the floor, I am a strong supporter of eliminating the windfall elimination provision (WEP) and the government pension offset (GPO) that denies some retirees from receiving their full Social Security benefits.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 456.
