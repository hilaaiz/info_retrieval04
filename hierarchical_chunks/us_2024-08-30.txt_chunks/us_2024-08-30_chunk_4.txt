Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Shannon W. Swing on his retirement from the Federal Aviation Administration.
Shannon faithfully served this institution for 32 years, first in Anchorage, Alaska, then in Salt Lake City, Utah and finally in Boise, Idaho.
With his calm demeanor, Shannon quickly became a leader in the organization, training new employees and being a steadfast presence in the tower.
His contributions to ensuring a safe airspace were invaluable to providing efficient and secure travel for passengers across the country and world.
We thank Shannon for his dedication and congratulate him on his well-earned retirement.
