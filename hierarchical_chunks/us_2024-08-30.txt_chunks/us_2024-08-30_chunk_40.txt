of Burbank, the Burbank Chamber of Commerce, and other civic organizations entered Burbank's first float.
That float, entitled ``Goddess of Plenty,'' featured an intricate dragon's head and a large cornucopia filled with assorted vegetables, and was awarded a silver cup trophy.
Since that time, Burbank has participated in the parade intermittently, including a few years where decorated automobiles were entered instead of floats.
From 1935 to 1940, the Burbank city schools took responsibility for the floats, and after a few years' hiatus during World War II, the city sponsored floats, including an Isabella Coleman-designed float, made by professional float building companies, in 1947 and 1948.
When the City Council decided that funds would be better used for infrastructure and announced that Burbank would not participate in the 1949 Rose Parade, Burbank resident Esther Klein led the effort to privately finance a float.
After gaining widespread community support for a hometown-built float, Mrs Klein brought a self-designed model of the proposed entry and exploratory plans for a permanent Burbank Tournament of Roses committee to the Burbank City Council, and subsequently received the council's approval.
Thanks to the very first and newly elected Burbank Tournament of Roses Association President Esther Klein's stellar leadership, and against many odds, the association members and the Burbank community raised funds and mobilized volunteers to design, build, and decorate the 1949 float entitled ``First Love,'' which won First Prize for its division.
Over 75 years, Burbank's float has won thirty-three major awards including three Sweepstakes Awards for Best Float Entry.
Burbank's annual float entry in this emblematic New Year's Day tradition is a product of the unwavering dedication, hard work and local civic pride demonstrated by the Burbank Tournament of Roses Association and countless other civic organizations and community volunteers.
I ask all Members to join me today in recognizing the 75th anniversary of the Burbank Tournament of Roses Association and the 110th anniversary of Burbank's first float in the Pasadena Tournament
