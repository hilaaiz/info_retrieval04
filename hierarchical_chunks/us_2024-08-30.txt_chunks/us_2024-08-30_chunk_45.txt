Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I ask for the House's attention today to recognize Whit and Amanda Lovelady and their children Annagrace and John Luke for being named Alabama's Outstanding Young Farm Family.
The Talladega County farmers received the honor during the Alabama Farmers Federation Farm & Land Conference on August 3rd in Montgomery, Alabama.
The Lovelady family raise cattle and hay and have built their farm from the ground up over the last decade.
They annually bale 10,000 rolls of hay while managing Angus, Charolais and commercial cattle herds at Cedar Roost Ranch.
The Loveladys make every acre of their farm count.
In addition to the cattle and hay, they custom bale and fertilize fields for their neighbors, sell freezer beef and pork and use a forestry mulcher to make land more productive.
These young farmers are working diligently to expand these operations.
Their two young children have seen Whit and Amanda model a love for farming and are already deeply invested in life on the farm.
Whit was influenced by his late grandfather Windle Batchelor and Amanda by her late father O.E. Williams, Jr.
Their passion for agriculture runs deep, and they have encouraged younger generations to be involved in Alabama's No. 1 industry.
They are leaders in the Alabama Farmers Federation and their community.
Whit also serves as Talladega County Cattlemen's Association President.
