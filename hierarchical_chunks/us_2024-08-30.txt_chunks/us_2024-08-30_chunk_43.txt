undefeated in the winner's bracket and they all should be proud of their efforts.
All these boys, Kaleb Christ, Jett Matthews, Doc Mogford, Gray Collins, Dylan Burke, Aiden Munoz, Gage Steubing, Kole Newson, Julian Hurst, Ben Burkhart, Cooper Hastings, and Caden Guffey have performed an amazing feat.
The coaches, parents, and everyone in Boerne who mentored these boys, built them up, and supported them have done a great job and should be proud of what these boys did.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Boerne All-Stars; you have made all of Texas proud.
