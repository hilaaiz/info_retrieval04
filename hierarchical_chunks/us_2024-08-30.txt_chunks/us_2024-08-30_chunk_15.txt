Mr. SCOTT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate members of the Inaugural Class of the Bethel High School Athletic Hall commitment to sportsmanship and their contributions to the sports community.
To acknowledge their many accomplishments, the Bethel High School Athletic Hall of Fame will have an Induction Ceremony on Saturday, August 31, 2024.
Bethel High School, home to the Bruins, is an institution that has a rich legacy of success with its athletic programs.
Throughout its fifty-five-year existence, the school has fielded numerous teams that have successfully won district and state championships in multiple sports.
In addition, several former students have gone on to make significant contributions as collegiate and professional athletes.
