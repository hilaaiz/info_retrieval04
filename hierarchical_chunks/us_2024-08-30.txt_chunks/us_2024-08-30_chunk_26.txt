Mr. RULLI.
Mr. Speaker, having worked in a family-run small business my whole life, I understand both the challenges and importance of running a successful small business venture.
As you know, U.S. small businesses make up about 99.9 percent of all businesses and create more than 60 percent of all new jobs.
Accordingly, I would like to take a moment to recognize the 2024 award recipients for the Youngstown Warren Regional Chamber's annual Salute to Business.
I am proud to be able to honor these recipients for their work as upstanding business leaders in the community.
