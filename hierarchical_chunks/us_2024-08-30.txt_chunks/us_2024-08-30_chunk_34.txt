Mr. ROGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the 50th wedding anniversary of Larry and Betty Deason.
Larry Kenneth Deason was born in Anniston, Alabama, on February 9, 1952, to George Henry Deason and Mary Jewell Deason.
Betty Lowe Bagley was born on March 24, 1952, to Oscar Miller Bagley and Madell Lowe Bagley.
Larry and Betty both attended Anniston High School and graduated in 1970, the last class to graduate from the old high school building.
They started dating their senior year at AHS.
Their first date was a Coke party hosted by the George Neely Chapter college.
Larry and Betty married on July 20, 1974, at Parker Memorial Baptist Church in Anniston.
They are blessed with their daughter Maryann D. Gendron, son-in-law Steven Gendron, grandson Henry Steven Gendron and granddaughter Sarah Kathryn Gendron.
The Deasons spend most of their time at the lake in Wedowee, Alabama, or attending banking conventions.
They celebrated their 50th anniversary on a Mediterranean cruise with dear friends.
