After graduation, Donald enlisted in the United States Army in 1962.
He achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant during his six-year career, serving at Fort Bragg, Fort Benning, Fort Jackson, and on the Korean Peninsula.

He supervised delivery service and played a role in implementing the ``Zip-plus-four'' system in New York State (NYS) while increasing mail efficiency in the city.
After twenty-three years, he retired from both positions and was honorably named a First Sergeant of the National Guard, earning the NYS Military Commendation Medal, the NYS Exercise Support Ribbon, the NYS Humane Service Medal, and multiple NYS Aid to Civil Authority Medals.
Donald married his wife Ann Ellen Bernier in 1966 and proudly raised their three sons, Robert, Aaron, and Peter.

First Sergeant Donald Yetman's dedication and service to the United States is truly remarkable.
