Mr. Speaker, the Bethel Track and Field program has enjoyed tremendous success for several generations.
Coached by Inductee Eddie Williams, the program amassed fourteen state championships between the boys' and girls' teams.
One of his most prominent athletes was Inductee Francena McCorory, who broke national indoor track records in the 300meter and 400-meter races.
Ms McCorory later won an Olympic Gold Medal as a member of the 4x400 Relay team during the Games of the XXX Olympiad in London, England.
Inductee Glenn ``Skeeter'' Heath, II, was a standout member of the boys' golf team as a student-athlete at Bethel High School.
He won the Group AAA State High School Individual Championship en route to being named an All-American on the collegiate level at East Tennessee State University.
He later enjoyed a professional golf career on the PGA Tour.
Inductee Stephen Forbes was the first State Championship wrestler in Bethel High School history.
He went on to wrestle on the collegiate level with the College of William and Mary.
