Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in recognizing and honoring Calvary Episcopal Church on its 160th anniversary.
May their faith and actions continue to inspire others and make positive change in the Southwest Georgia community.
