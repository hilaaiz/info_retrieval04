Mr. Speaker, the inaugural class of the Bethel Athletic Hall of Fame includes figures who have, simply put, helped Bethel High School establish its identity.
Inductee Allen Iverson, a 2016 Basketball Hall of Fame Inductee, was a member of the Bethel basketball team.
As the starting point guard, he joined Inductee Tony Rutland on the 1993 State Championship Basketball team.
Mr. Iverson played on for Georgetown University en route to his Hall of Fame Professional Basketball career.
