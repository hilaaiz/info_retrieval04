Mr. KIM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career and retirement of Channell Wilkins, President and CEO of O.C.E.A.N., Inc., and his commitment to bettering the lives of communities across New Jersey throughout his years of service.
A public servant most of his life, Channell has worked at the Municipal, County and State levels before serving in the Federal government as the Associate Commissioner of the Office of Head Start at the Department of Health and Human Services.
His principled work has always been driven by his innate goal to improve the communities in which he served.
His desire to serve has also been borne out in finding new and innovative ways to solve problems--bettering communities here across the state.
While at O.C.E.A.N., Inc. Channell was also active in many organizations like Planned Parenthood of North, Central and Southern New Jersey and Jobs for America's Graduates New Jersey.
Throughout all public service is seen as a way to better one's community.
As President and CEO, Channell provided direction to frontline staff that interfaced with the public on a daily basis and reflected the mission and nature of the organization throughout New Jersey.
His leadership led to many programs that improved the lives of so many people living in Ocean, Atlantic, and Cape May Counties, including Head Start and Early Head Start, Home Energy, Affordable Housing, Housing Counseling, and Intensive Case Management Services programs--all of which are designed to assist low income people and families across the state.
Channell embodies the spirit of service that makes me proud to represent people like him in New Jersey.
We are lucky to have him as a member of our community and I wish him the best of luck as he endeavors on the next chapter of his life.
