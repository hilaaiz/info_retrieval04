Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr Speaker, I rise today to congratulate James and Pamela Reid, two lifelong farmers who were recently Inducted into the Michigan Farmers Hall.
James and Pamela began their journey in agriculture after acquiring a modest farm in 1978, which since then has transformed into the highly productive Reid Dairy Farm.
Under their management, the farm expanded from 120 to 900 acres, supporting 300 cows.
Their focus on productivity and employing new technology has significantly enhanced milk production, leading to an impressive 95 pounds per cow all while maintaining superior milk quality standards.
Their leadership extends beyond the fields and into civic engagement, where James' roles as Grant Township Supervisor and Chair of the St. Clair County Farmland Preservation Board reflect his deep commitment to our community.
These positions allowed him to influence local agricultural policies positively and advocate for the preservation and sustainability of farming in the region.
Moreover, the Reid's proactive approach included substantial upgrades to their farming infrastructure, adding a modern barn and updating milking systems.
These improvements boosted efficiency and served as a showcase for responsible agriculture.
Throughout his career, James has also contributed his expertise to several boards, including the MMPA Dairy Co-Op and the United Dairy Industry.
His leadership as President of the UDIM and his active participation on the Michigan Dairy Market Committee have been crucial in promoting the interests of local dairy farmers and influencing industry standards at both the state and national levels.
