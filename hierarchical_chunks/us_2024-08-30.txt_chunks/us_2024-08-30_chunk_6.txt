Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor John F. Welsh--a World War II combat veteran and American patriot who celebrates his 98th birthday on September 4th, 2024.
John Welsh, better known as ``Jack,'' was born in Macon, Georgia and grew up along the Gulf Coast from New Orleans to Pensacola, Florida.
Jack never had a doubt that he was called to serve.
Upon graduating high school on June 6, 1944--the same day allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy--Jack immediately spoke to his parents about enlisting in the United States Army.
Having watched World War II progress through his high school years and on the front pages of the newspapers he himself delivered, Jack was elated that his parents agreed, and he entered basic training in the fall of 1944.
By October, Jack had crossed the country and the Pacific Ocean to land in the Philippines, and upon completion of his mission there, served in the occupation.
After his years of service, Jack was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Theater Campaign Ribbon with two Bronze Stars, the Good Conduct Medal, the Philippine Liberation Campaign Ribbon with one Bronze Star, the Army of Occupation Ribbon, the Victory Ribbon, and three Overseas Service Bars.
After discharge, Jack enrolled in Duke University's Forestry school where he earned both a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Forestry.
He also met the love of his life, Mary Ann Casimes, with whom he later married and raised a family.
We thank Jack for his years of service and wish him a happy 98th birthday.
God bless.
