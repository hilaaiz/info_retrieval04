Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, 
Mr. Alan Wikett.
Mr. Wikett is the founder of Warrior 321, an anti-human trafficking awareness group.
According to those who have worked alongside him, Mr. Wikett's passion for prevention and assistance is unrivaled.
Though he is supposed to be retired, he is constantly on the road educating different organizations and gathering new intel to help the organization better keep our community safe.
He has spearheaded many successful initiatives to educate victims of human trafficking about the availability of services that can keep them safe and at-risk populations about how to avoid becoming a victim.
Mr. Wikett has also spoken to countless civic organizations to help garner support and raise awareness about the dangers of human trafficking.
It is clear that 
Mr. Wikett has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and on the lives of countless people he has worked with in the fight against the horrific crime of human trafficking.
I am grateful for his service.
