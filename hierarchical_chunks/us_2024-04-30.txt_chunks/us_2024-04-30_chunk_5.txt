Mr. Speaker, I can personally attest to the outstanding life of Bill Moritz.
We practiced law together for a short time early in our careers.
I saw firsthand his integrity, his Christian commitment, and his devotion to his family.
Today I ask my colleagues to honor a life of significant generosity, philanthropy, and innovation.
Because of Bill Moritz's life Colorado's Fifth Congressional District and indeed the world are a better place.
