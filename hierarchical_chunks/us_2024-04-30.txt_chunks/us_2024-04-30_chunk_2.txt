Mr. CARTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate William Cofield Widner on his well-deserved retirement from Southern Company after 43 years of service.
Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Southern Company provides clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to 9 million customers nationwide, including throughout the State of Georgia and its First Congressional District.
Throughout his career, Cofield's hard work, dedication and commitment to the communities where he has lived and served has made an indelible mark on our state and Nation.
A Georgia native, Cofield began his career at Southern Company in 1981 and has served in various roles including at Georgia Power and Southern Company Gas.
A portion of his career focused on serving customers in his hometown.
He also supported Georgia Power's residential and commercial customers, resource planning, nuclear development and regulatory affairs organizations, which recently announced the successful operation of America's first new carbon-free nuclear energy reactors in more than 30 years at Plant Vogtle.
Additionally, Cofield's work with the Georgia Department of Economic Development's ``Georgia Allies'' partnership has helped continually enhance the state's business climate, keeping Georgia ranked as the number-one state for business according to Area Development magazine.
On behalf of the people of the State of Georgia, I congratulate Cofield and wish him, his wife Jane, his sons Drew and Jack, and his grandson Bo the very best as he enters the next phase of his life.
