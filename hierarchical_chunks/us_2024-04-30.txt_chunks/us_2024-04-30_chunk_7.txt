Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sammy McDowell, who was a community leader, restaurateur, and friend to all.
Sammy grew up in Minneapolis and was a fixture in the community throughout his life.
He worked in food service for many years before starting his own catering service and restaurant.
His flagship restaurant, Sammy's Avenue Eatery opened in 2012 on West Broadway Avenue in North Minneapolis.
Not only has Sammy's served delicious food for over a decade, it has also become an important gathering place for the community.
He had recently expanded and began operating a Sammy's Avenue Eatery pop-up in Saint Paul, in a space which features Blackowned businesses.
Even as a business owner, Sammy never compromised his generosity towards others and always went the extra mile to check on the wellbeing of his friends, as well as his customers.
Sammy's passion for his community was contagious, and I know that the spaces he created will continue to be sources of friendship, inspiration, and comfort.
Sammy was also a well known devoted member of Shiloh Temple and sang in the choir there for many years.
He was worshiping among loved ones at Shiloh just before his death.
He had a hand in many things throughout the community, and was always a familiar face at events around the city.
This past week, a balloon release was held in several U.S. cities to celebrate Sammy's life.
These nationwide celebrations are a testament to Sammy's admirable ability to make an impression on those around him.
His company will be dearly missed by those who had the privilege to know him.
