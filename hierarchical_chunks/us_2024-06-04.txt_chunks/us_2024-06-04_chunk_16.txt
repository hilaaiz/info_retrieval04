Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the oldest Black-owned bookstore in the Nation, Marshall's Music and Book Store.
Jackson, Mississippi, is home to the oldest Black-owned bookstore in North America.
Marshall's Music and Book Store in the heart of downtown Jackson is a family business that opened in 1938.
The quaint store on the almost empty Farish Street has shelves stacked high with books, music, and everything in between.
The walls are also plastered with photos of unsung African American heroes with roots in Mississippi.
Pastor Louis Wilcher of the Greater Pearlie Grove Missionary Baptist Church first opened the store 85 years ago on the corner of Farish and Oakley streets.
Now, Primm is the third-generation owner of the store.
She believes in teaching people about the past, saying that Black history didn't begin with slavery.
Her newfound hope now lies in opening a school.
Primm believes that the way to stop the surge of violent youth crime is to teach children about hope.
