Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable servant, Jar'Kevious R. Edwards.
Jar'Kevious R. Edwards is a native of Charleston, Mississippi.
He is a 2020 graduate of Charleston High School and a 2024 graduate of Mississippi Valley State University.
With aspirations of becoming a news and television personality, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Speech Communication and completed a summer internship at WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi.
Jar'Kevious' bright personality, elegance, oratory skills, and charm have gained him the victory in winning the title of 
Mr. Mississippi Valley State University in 2023.
As a bright and prosperous future awaits, Jar'Kevious plans to branch out into the field of broadcast journalism as a news reporter and/or anchor.
Jar'Kevious' long-term goals include anchoring on Good Morning America, CNN, hosting Entertainment Tonight, and one day his own television talk show.
Jar'Kevious' life motto is, ``There is no passion to be found playing small--in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.''--Nelson
