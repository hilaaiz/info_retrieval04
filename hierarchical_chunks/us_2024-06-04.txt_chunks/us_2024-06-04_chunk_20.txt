These improvements also supported economic efforts within the City to reduce the retail vacancy rate to 6.3 percent, the lowest since his early days on council.
This was a significant accomplishment in spite achievement was accomplished by focusing not only on the newly developed neighborhoods, but also including the City's historic areas to redevelop park areas and infrastructure to keep the areas vibrant.
The economic vitality is evidenced with the additions of Babe's, Sweetie Pie's, Patriotic Pig, Floor & Decor, Winco, Platinum Music Complex, Painted Tree, Gritr Sports, Seconds & Surplus, Warespace, Truby Hilton Hotel and the development.
These private investments only foreshadow the potential of the former mall property redevelopment as new businesses and a Homewood Suites by Hilton are developed around the City's new City Hall.
As the Mayor steps down from his duties, I am proud of all he has accomplished for his beloved City and for the region that has been blessed with his public leadership and service.
I have appreciated his wisdom and insight on many occasions and I will personally miss his counsel and friendship.
However, I also understand the sacrifice public service requires of family.
I wish Mayor Trevino a long retirement with his wife Carol, his children and his granddaughter Reis, to make-up for the time lost as he served.
The City, our region and our State are all better as a result of his service.
