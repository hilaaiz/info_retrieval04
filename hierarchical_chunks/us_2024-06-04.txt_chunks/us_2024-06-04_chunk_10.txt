Mr. Williams embarked upon the cleaning and maintenance business specifically because he did so much of that while working at Baxter and supervised others doing that.
He has a staff of five as well as others when needed.
His daughter, Sheila Williams, also works for the business.
She handles the books, paperwork, and the business side of the company.
Mr. Williams states, ``we're thorough and efficient, we do a good job, and we take pride in our work.
I check on my staff daily and often go into the offices we clean the mornings before their staff arrives to make sure everything was done properly if I didn't do the work myself.''
His slogan, ``Doing whatever needs to be done, wherever it is needed''.
This is how his business has remained successful.
He is motivated to make positive impacts on his community by helping people in the community.
He loves to cook and take meals to the elderly people in the area as a part of simply giving back to his hometown of Cleveland.
This also keeps him active and gives him an opportunity to stay connected with the community.
