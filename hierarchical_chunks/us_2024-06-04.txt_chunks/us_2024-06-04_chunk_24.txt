Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and legacy of 
Mr. John Joseph Williams, a brave and dedicated soldier who served our Nation with distinction during World War II as a member of the Ghost Army special unit.
John was assigned to the Signal Company Special of the Ghost Army, a top-secret unit tasked with deceiving the enemy through elaborate tactical deceptions.
He was among the select few who landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, playing a crucial role in the Allied invasion of Normandy.
The contributions of John Williams and his fellow Ghost Army soldiers were kept classified until 1996.
Historians credit their unit of 1,100 men with saving an estimated 30,000 U.S. troops, and their work had a significant impact on the outcome of the war.
After the war, John returned to Missouri, where he and his wife, Barbara, raised a family and started a successful career at the University.
He remained dedicated to his community and country until his passing on January 19, 2010, leaving a legacy of courage, sacrifice, and service.
