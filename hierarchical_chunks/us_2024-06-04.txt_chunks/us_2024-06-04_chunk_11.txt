Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jimmy Williams for his dedication and initiative in continuing to offer his services to the community, surrounding areas and the MS Delta.
His collective contributions are truly inspiring and reflect the best of our shared values as citizens and neighbors.
