Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to SAGE Eldercare on its 70th Anniversary.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with you all.
Over the past 70 years, SAGE Eldercare has made a deep impact on the lives of older adults in our community.
Through delivering meals, restoring family heirlooms, providing companionship, and much more volunteers provide the support for older adults to live the most independent and active lives possible.
I am proud to have such dedicated volunteers and organizations committed to helping people in our community within the 7th Congressional District.
I look forward to watching them all flourish in the coming decades.
I wish SAGE Eldercare a wonderful anniversary.
May their next 70 years be filled with as much success as this one.
