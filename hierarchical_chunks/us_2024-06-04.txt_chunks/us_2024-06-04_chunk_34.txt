Mr. KELLY.
Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to honor the incredible career of Joy Lynn Alexander, who recently retired as a Colonel after thirty years of dedicated service in the military.
Colonel Alexander is a highly decorated officer who rose through the ranks of the Mississippi National Guard, eventually becoming the Commander of Camp McCain Training Site.
Throughout her career, Colonel Alexander completed all the necessary professional military education courses, including the U.S. Army War College.
Her numerous awards include the Legion of Merit and the Bronze Star Medal.
She served in various roles, from tactical to strategic positions, and even completed a combat tour in Iraq in 2009 through 2010, where I had the honor of serving alongside her.
Colonel Alexander spent countless days, weeks, months, and years traveling across Mississippi, the United States, and the world to support and lead critical missions.
Her dedication and hard work have taken her to many places, all in service to our country and state.
As one of the most influential leaders in the Army, Colonel Alexander always maintained the highest standards, even during some of the most challenging times in history.
She is a true American hero and a proud Mississippian.
We are deeply grateful for her unwavering commitment to our country and to Mississippi.
Her legacy of service and leadership will continue to inspire us all.
