We implemented the 5.5% pay award.
We absolutely recognise that pay is a really important part of ensuring we have the high-quality teachers that we need.
The starting salary for teachers is now at least £31,650 outside of London and at least £38,766 in inner London.
We are making progress; we are seeing the green shoots of more teachers joining the profession and staying in it, and we will continue to support that trajectory in any way we can.
My hon.
Friend has also rightly highlighted the vital work of support staff in schools.
The Government’s approach in that regard will be confirmed in this afternoon’s written ministerial statement, as will all the details that my hon.
Friend so keenly anticipates.
