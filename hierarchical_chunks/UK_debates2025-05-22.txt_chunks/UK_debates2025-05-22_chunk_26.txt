I thank the hon.
Lady for that answer.
Horribly and tragically, one of my constituents was a victim of abuse in the Church of England.
We must never forget that there are victims and survivors involved here, and they were dismayed when earlier this year the Church of England’s governing body rejected a fully independent safeguarding model to deal with abuse cases.
The Church should not fall behind other organisations on safeguarding.
The hon.
Lady has given me her answer already, but can she reassure me that she will continue to push for a fully independent body, as that must be our goal?
