The Secretary of State is in Japan for the world expo conference in Osaka, strengthening UK-Japan relations.
I know that she has written to you, Mr Speaker, to explain her absence.
The Government recognise the significant contribution that horseracing makes to the British economy.
In that spirit, I pay tribute to Rachael Blackmore.
She has had a fantastic impact on the sport and has enjoyed enormous success, and I wish her well with her retirement.
His Majesty’s Treasury leads on the consultation on the tax treatment of remote gambling.
The consultation is open till  21 July , and any impact assessment of any legislative changes will be a matter for that Department.
The racing industry is getting a bit tired of the warm words and lack of action.
At the last oral questions, the Secretary of State said that “we need to treat different forms of gambling differently”,—[Official Report,  3 April 2025 ; Vol. 765, c. 412.]
but the Government have since proposed a flat tax on all online gambling, which fails to distinguish between betting on sports like horseracing, which is limited by the number of races and requires knowledge and thought, and online casinos and gaming.
However, problem rates for bets on racing are about the same as for lottery scratchcards.
Will the Minister commit here and now to making sure that betting on sports like racing is not treated the same as betting on online casinos and gaming?
