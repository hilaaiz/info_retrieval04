I commend my hon.
Friend for all the work she is doing on this important issue, which affects many constituencies, and it was a pleasure to meet her and members of that residents association.
We all know that many managing agents behave in ways that are not fit for purpose.
It is absolutely right that we need legislation to deal with unscrupulous managing agents, because things cannot continue in the current vein.
I thank her for all the work she is doing.
What assessment the Church has made of the potential merits of implementing an independent safeguarding process.
At the General Synod in February, I called for a fully independent model for safeguarding.
Synod did not adopt that approach but did commit to undertaking some detailed work that would ensure it  could work towards that sort of model.
As I said earlier in my responses, it is vital that the Church seeks to begin to restore and rebuild trust and confidence in it.
