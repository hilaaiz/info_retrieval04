(Urgent Question): To ask the Secretary of State for Education if she will make a statement on whether the Government will be accepting the school teachers’ review body’s pay recommendation for 2025-26.
May I start by thanking our teachers, school leaders and school staff for all they are doing right now to ensure a successful exam season for students, and indeed for all their hard work throughout the year?
Rather than scaremongering with fantasy statistics, the Government are getting on and delivering.
We are already seeing positive signs that our plan for change is working.
Teacher recruitment is up, with 2,000 more people in training than last year.
Teacher retention is up, with thousands more teachers forecast to stay in the profession over the next three years.
This Labour Government are getting on and delivering.
Unlike the Opposition, who last year sat on the STRB report, hid from their responsibility and left it to Labour to sort out, this afternoon we will announce the teachers’ pay award, which will be the earliest announcement for a decade.
We understand the importance of giving schools certainty, giving them time to plan their budgets, and ensuring that they can recruit and retain the expert teachers our children need.
The Secretary of State’s written ministerial statement will be coming out this afternoon—[Interruption.]
It will show once again that this Labour Government— Order.
I have granted the urgent question, so please will Members on the Opposition Front Bench wait for the Minister to finish her answer.
I do not want you, Ms Trott and Mr O’Brien, to be a bad example of this school class.
The written ministerial statement is laid before the House and will be coming out this afternoon, showing once again that this Labour Government are getting on and delivering on our plan for change.
