Next month I will meet the Safeguarding Minister alongside my constituent and a group of survivors of abuse and safeguarding failure within the Church.
I thank my hon.
Friend  the Member for Battersea (Marsha De Cordova)  for the work she has been doing to push the case for fully independent safeguarding processes.
Will she continue to impress upon colleagues the need for full independence in terms of operations and oversight within the Church?
I reiterate that it is really important that Members, including my hon.
Friend, continue to raise this issue and hold the Church to account.
The Church  is undertaking detailed work to look towards seeking to go with a fully independent model.
In the meantime, the Church is getting on with setting up the external scrutiny body, which is likely to be on a statutory basis, in order to give it depth and may require legislation.
As I have said on many occasions in Church Commissioners questions, it is so important that the Church seeks to restore and rebuild trust, and that begins with ensuring that we have a credible model for safeguarding.
