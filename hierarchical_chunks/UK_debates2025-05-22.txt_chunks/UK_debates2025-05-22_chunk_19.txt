It is a pleasure to congratulate the work of faith groups in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, where there are good examples of different faith organisations coming together.
The Archdeacon of West Ham informs me that local churches are closely engaged with the London Boroughs Faiths Network, and local clergy work alongside local rabbis and imams to build closer links.
The local faith forum is hosting a walk of peace in my hon.
Friend’s constituency on  1 June , and I hope he will be able to take part.
Interfaith work is vital to our local communities up and down the country.
Does the hon.
Lady agree that leadership is important and that if the Church of England were to follow the Roman Catholic Church and appoint its leader in days rather than months, it would give a great boost to interfaith work?
Marsha, chair the conclave!
[Laughter.]
If only, Mr Speaker—though I do have the right colours on this morning.
The Cardinal for Battersea.
Oh my goodness!
The hon.
Member for Brigg and Immingham (Martin Vickers)  makes a really important point about the importance of interfaith working, and it happens at all levels—we have our local clergy but also faith leaders and advisers working across all different faiths to bring us together.
What happened last summer during the riots was a good example of how interfaith leaders work together.
What progress the National Church Institutions have made on improving safeguarding.
