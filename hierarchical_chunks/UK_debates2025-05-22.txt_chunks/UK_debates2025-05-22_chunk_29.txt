The hon.
Member for Battersea, representing the Church Commissioners, was asked— Whether the commissioners have made an estimate of the proportion of the Church’s assets that may have a link to historical involvement with slavery.
The forensic accounting research published in 2023 revealed that Queen Anne’s Bounty was linked with African chattel enslavement in two main ways: significant investments in the South Sea Company; and benefactions received from individuals whose income may have derived from slavery.
The fund for healing, repair and justice is the Church Commissioners’ response to these findings.
My hon.
Friend will be aware that there is a lot of interest in the relationship between the Church and the slave trade.
Is she able to say over what period the   Church made profits from the slave trade?
Is she able to specify the names of the companies that the Church invested in, or even the names of the slave plantations?
Is she able to quantify exactly how much money the Church made over the period when it was involved in the slave trade?
And is she able to say whether the Church’s profit from the slave trade is still part of its income today?
