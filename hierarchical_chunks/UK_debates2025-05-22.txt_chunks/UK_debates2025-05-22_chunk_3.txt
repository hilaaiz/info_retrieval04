I thank the hon.
Gentleman  for his question.
I am a big supporter of racing, and I appreciate how many jobs it contributes to the economy—according to the British Horseracing Authority, it is 85,000.
I know that racing is really important to rural areas and towns.
Of course, the consultation to which he refers is a Treasury lead.
It is open till  21 July , but I will reflect his comments to the Treasury.
