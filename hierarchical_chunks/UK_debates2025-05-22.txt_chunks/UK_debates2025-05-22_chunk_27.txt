Absolutely.
I was at that meeting of Synod and it was disappointing that my preferred model of full independence was not adopted.
We owe it to those like the hon.
Lady’s constituent, who was a victim and is now a survivor, to ensure that the Church works at pace towards a fully independent model for safeguarding.
The hon.
Member for Blaenau Gwent and Rhymney, representing the House of Commons Commission, was asked— Whether the Commission is taking steps to comply with the Supreme Court judgment in the case of For Women Scotland  the Scottish Ministers of 16 April 2025.
The House of Commons Commission is always concerned to comply with the law.
The policies and guidance of the House have been reviewed and it does not appear that any immediate changes are required as a result of the judgment.
However, we are keeping this under consideration.
We will be looking at the updated Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance following its publication in draft just two days ago.
I am grateful to the hon.
Member for his response, but the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care has said that we “can and must” uphold the “rights, the freedoms, the spaces for women as sex-based rights”.
I am therefore extremely concerned to hear reports that the House of Commons is not following the EHRC interim guidance that biological men should not be allowed to use women’s facilities.
Does the hon.
Member agree that the protection of female Members and women who work here is vital, and that the law, as clarified by the Supreme Court ruling, must be followed immediately?
