I thank my hon.
Friend for the time she spent with me and my constituents of the Hyde Park estate to discuss tackling some of the high service charges they are facing.
Does she agree that it is vital that the Government continue to make progress on the regulation of managing agents so that these high costs are clamped down on and there is more accountability for leaseholders?
