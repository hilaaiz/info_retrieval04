I thank my hon.
Friend for the work she is doing representing the Church Commissioners on this matter.
Ilford South is one of the most diverse constituencies in the country.
In central Ilford we have a mosque, a mandir, a church and a gurdwara just down the road.
Our faith groups build community resilience and exemplify the very best of humanity—they are our bedrock.
Will my hon.
Friend join me in celebrating the diversity of our faith groups in Ilford South, and what  conversations she has had with the Church Commissioners on how the Church continues to strengthen this interfaith work?
