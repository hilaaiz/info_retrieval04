I thank the Father of the House for his question.
He makes a truly important point: everybody should have the freedom to worship and nobody should be allowed to prevent that with impunity.
As he rightly says, it is up to us—the Church of England, the Catholic Church and all people of faith—to use our voices for the voiceless.
People should not be prevented from worshipping.
