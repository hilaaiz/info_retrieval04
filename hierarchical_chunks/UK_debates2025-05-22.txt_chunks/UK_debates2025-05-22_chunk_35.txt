Teacher pay is absolutely vital for the status of the profession, for the quality of life of teachers and for recruitment and retention of the vital skilled and qualified staff who are the backbone of our education system.
It is really important that the Government’s response this afternoon begins the work of restoring teacher pay after the last 14 years, when we saw, by any objective measure, a shocking erosion in teacher pay under the previous Government.
That has affected recruitment and retention and had a devastating impact on teacher morale.
Those on the Conservative Benches should take note of that, because we would all benefit from a little more humility in the context of the legacy that they left behind.
Can I press the Minister on the extent to which the pay award will be funded?
We know that there are already extensive pressures on school budgets, and schools are very anxious about that matter.
Also, will this afternoon’s statement include support staff pay, and will it begin the process of restoring that pay?
We know how vital our teaching assistants and other support staff in our schools are.
