I welcome the constructive nature of my hon.
Friend’s question, because regardless of any announcement this afternoon, we know that schools are working hard to deliver for children.
As a Government, we need to work our hardest—and we are—to support them to do so.
That means a whole range of productivity measures to support teachers with their workload, to support schools with their costs, and to ensure we grab the opportunity of technological developments so that  any teacher’s time is maximised with children in the classroom, helping them with their learning and being supported with technology to maximise children’s outcomes.
We will continue to work; we are very much looking forward, and unfortunately those on the Opposition Benches seem constantly to be looking back.
