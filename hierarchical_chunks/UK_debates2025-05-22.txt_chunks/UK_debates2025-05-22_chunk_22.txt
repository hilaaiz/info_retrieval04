I thank the Second Church Estates Commissioner for her response.
The churches should always be a place for those who seek help, assistance, support and comfort whenever things have happened that are completely against the teachings of the Bible.
For those who carry out these heinous crimes, there must be no excuses and no apologies; they must go to court to face the allegations that are made against them, and then when the crimes are proven, they must be sent to jail.
The Church’s foundation is God and the teachings of the Bible.
Those who carry out those crimes deserve absolutely no help within the Church whatsoever.
