I thank my hon.
Friend for her question, and for the work that she has done in this House over many years in scrutinising Government budgets and holding Governments to account.
We have  the highest respect for schools, for school leaders, and for the teachers and support staff who work in schools.
We recognise the challenges faced across the public sector to make sure that every penny of public money is spent in the most efficient way possible and maximises the public benefit.
We are working incredibly hard in the Department, as I know we are across Government, to get maximum output for public money.
Frankly, the public sector was neglected by the previous Government over 14 years.
We are picking up the pieces of that, and we will continue to work hard to do so.
