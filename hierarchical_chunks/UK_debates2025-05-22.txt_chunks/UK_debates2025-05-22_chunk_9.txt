I thank the Minister for his encouraging remarks about the progress of the UK-EU deal.
Does he agree that the changes that we are making will support the vitality of London’s west end, and provide a strong foundation for tackling the issue of carnets in our future negotiations with the EU, so that we can continue this great work?
