Three years ago, Sarah Everard was walking home when she was abducted and murdered by a serving police officer who should have been trusted to keep her safe.
As a father, I cannot imagine the pain her parents, her family and her friends are going through in this difficult anniversary week.
Lady Angiolini’s report exposes the appalling failure in police vetting and in misconduct processes, and I am very troubled by its conclusion that there is “nothing to stop another Couzens operating in plain sight”.
How can that be the case, three years on from this horrendous crime?
Can I first say that I am sure all Members of the House will have been thinking about Sarah Everard in recent weeks?
It was, as the right hon.
and learned Gentleman said, an absolutely shocking case, and the abuse of power in particular was appalling.
That is why we took action quickly to strengthen police vetting and strengthen the rules for rooting out officers who are not fit to serve, and conducted the largest ever screening of all serving officers and staff.
We are now ensuring that any officer who has been charged with a crime will be suspended from duty automatically until their case is concluded, and we will thoroughly consider all the report’s recommendations and respond in full.
