I thank my right hon.
Friend for his question on this important topic, which I know will be of great interest, not only to his constituents, but to many others across Northern Ireland.
The Government have set forward their plans to deal with the legacy of the past and will continue to engage with everyone in Northern Ireland, whatever their views, to set out the best way forward.
I can confirm to him that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has raised these specific issues directly with the Irish Government and will continue to do so.
I, too, spoke to the Taoiseach about this very matter.
We would hope to see further co-operation on Omagh and many other outstanding cases that involve Irish jurisdiction, because, like my right hon.
Friend, I want to give families as much information as possible.
