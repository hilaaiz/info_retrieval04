I thank my hon.
Friend for the question.
I understand the concerns that local drivers have over this ongoing TfL issue.
Although, we are doing everything we can to back motorists across the country, it is disappointing that the Labour Mayor and, indeed, Labour-run Wales are hammering drivers at every opportunity, whether that is with temporary speed limits, blanket 20 mph zones, or the ultra low emission zone expansion.
I will make sure my hon.
Friend has a meeting with the responsible Minister to discuss his concerns.
