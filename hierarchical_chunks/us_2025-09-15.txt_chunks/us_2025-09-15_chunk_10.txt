Mrs. Babb owned and operated Byers Beauty Shop in Paris, a business started by her mother, where she worked for decades as a beloved cosmetologist.
She took pride in her business and treated her clients like family.
In addition to the beauty shop, 
Mrs. Babb spent time as a representative for Mary Kay, where she strived to provide opportunities for her employees.
Throughout her life, she has been a dedicated and devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, striving to instill a strong faith and love of music in her grandkids.
In her free time, she enjoys cooking, playing piano, and recognizing every Western television and film actor.
Mrs. Babb credits her life to the Lord, her family, and loving her country.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of 
Mrs. Babb's incredible life and journey.
May God bless 
Mrs. Babb on 90 years of life filled with patriotism, faith, and joy.
