Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we welcome His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew back to Washington, D.C. and recognize his remarkable contributions as a global religious leader, peacemaker, and advocate for freedom.
His presence is a reminder of the enduring values of faith, dialogue, and human dignity.
