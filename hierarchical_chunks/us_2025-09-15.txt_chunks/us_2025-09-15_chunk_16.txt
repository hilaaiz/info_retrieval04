Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District of Michigan honors the life of Peter Mays, a dedicated and beloved member of the Trinity Health family for over 20 years.
Peter served in the Information Technology department, where he took pride in his work and was known for his reliability, generosity, and willingness to help others.
He continued working as long as his health allowed, retiring just one week before his passing.
When not working, you could find Peter riding his bike around the city.
During a Trinity Health Town Hall attended by more than 600 employees, colleagues paid tribute to Peter in a special Colleague Remembrance presentation.
His coworkers, many of whom became close friends, stood by him and his family through challenging years, offering hospital visits, home support, and heartfelt gestures of kindness.
Peter's service, friendship, and example will be deeply missed, but his impact will continue to inspire those who knew and loved him.
The 12th Congressional District of Michigan honors the life of Peter Mays and extends heartfelt condolences to all his loved ones and friends.
