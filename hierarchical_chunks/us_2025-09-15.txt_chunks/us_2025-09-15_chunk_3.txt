Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome to America one of our world's significant religious leaders--Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the Spiritual Head of Orthodox Christians, the second largest Christian Church in the world.
Around the world there are over 250 million Orthodox Christians.
In America there are well over a million Orthodox Christians with Churches in all 50 states.
Even in low population states there are numerous churches--like for example, four Orthodox Churches in the state.
After his visit in Washington, D.C. with our President at the White House and with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress, he will be traveling to New York City to receive the Templeton Prize.
That Prize is one of the world's leading recognitions of world leaders who make an exceptional contribution to the deepest questions regarding the universe and humankind's place and purpose within it.
Previous winners of that Prize have included Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa.
and Billy Graham.
His All-Holiness is also a recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest Congressional Award.
That Gold Medal had also been awarded to George Washington and to Abraham Lincoln.
The Congress emphasized that Gold Medal by having more Members of Congress asking to have their names added as co-sponsors of that legislation than any other bill introduced during the 105th Congress.
The Congressional Gold Medal recipients who were presented with the Award immediately before and immediately after Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, were Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela.
Within Christian Orthodoxy, an over 2,000-year-old religion, His AllHoliness is the longest serving Ecumenical Patriarch.
He is the 269th direct successor of Jesus Christ's first Apostle, Andrew.
Andrew's brother Peter carried his mission to what is today the Vatican.
Today's Pope Leo is the 266th direct successor of the Apostle Peter.
