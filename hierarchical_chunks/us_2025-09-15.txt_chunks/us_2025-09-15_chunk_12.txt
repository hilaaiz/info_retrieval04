Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent, Sergeant Donald ``Donny'' Grundhauser, who recently passed away after a courageous battle with cancer.
Sergeant Grundhauser joined the Saint Paul Police Department in 1994, proud to serve the area where he was born and raised.
Over the course of his 30-year career, he served in a wide range of demanding assignments, including SWAT, the Homicide Unit, the Gang and Gun Unit, ATF Federal Task Force, East Investigations as an Acting Commander and the Special Operations Unit.
In recognition of his outstanding contributions, Sergeant Grundhauser received three Unit Citations, three Medals of Commendation, two Unit Letters of Recognition, and five individual Letters.
Sergeant Grundhauser was deeply respected by his neighbors and colleagues for his courage, selflessness, and commitment to helping others.
Known to his fellow officers as ``Grundy,'' he was a mentor and friend to many, and he lived by the belief that it never cost anything to be kind.
His family carries on his legacy of service, with his son, Nicholas, and his two brothers, Mark and Keith, also serving in the Saint Paul Police Department.
I offer my deepest condolences to Sergeant Grundhauser's family--his wife, Kelly, and his children, Jacob and Nicholas.
Sergeant Grundhauser represented the best of law enforcement, and I thank him and his family for their service to our community.
