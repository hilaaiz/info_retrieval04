I have met Samantha Billingham, a local west midlands legend campaigning in this space, a number of times and I share my hon.
Friend’s shock at the lack of knowledge about coercive control.
All police, social workers and others in contact with victims of domestic abuse ought to be aware of coercive control and its insidious effects on the victim, and of course I would be delighted to meet her.

Sentences for murderers who used a weapon already available at the crime scene start 10 years lower than sentences for those who brought a weapon with them.
Does the Minister agree that this disparity must be tackled?
