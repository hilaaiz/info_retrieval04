I welcome the hon.
Member to her acting role—I am not sure how long she is acting for.
We have made clear what we believe the priorities should be for policing: neighbourhood policing and reducing serious violence on our streets, and that should be the case across the board.
We should have a common-sense approach to policing decisions in every area across the country.

We believe that its recommendations need to be taken immensely seriously by forces across the country.
