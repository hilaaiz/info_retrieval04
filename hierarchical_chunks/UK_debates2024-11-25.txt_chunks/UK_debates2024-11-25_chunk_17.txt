I thank the Minister for her response.
My constituent Samantha Billingham is a domestic abuse survivor who now runs training sessions on coercive control.
Coercive control is a thread that runs throughout all abuse, and I was shocked to hear that it does not form a core part of the training for the police, social workers or any other domestic violence training.
Will the Minister meet me and Samantha to ensure that coercive control forms a key part of domestic violence training?
