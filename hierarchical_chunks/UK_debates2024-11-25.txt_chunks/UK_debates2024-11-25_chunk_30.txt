I thank the shadow Home Secretary for his opening words.
I think he described his time in the Home Office as his best ministerial job ever.
Given that he was Chief Secretary to the Treasury under Liz Truss, we can perhaps wonder why.
He was also the Immigration Minister who, I remind him, told the Commons and the Select Committee that he would not rule out using giant wave machines as the way to stop small boat crossings.
We inherited record high levels of small boat crossings in the first half of this year.
We have taken action to fix the previous Government’s chaos.
