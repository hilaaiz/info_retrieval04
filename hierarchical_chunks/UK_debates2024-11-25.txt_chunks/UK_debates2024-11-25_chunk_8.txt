I thank the Minister for his response.
James Furlong, David Wails and Joe Ritchie-Bennett were murdered in the Forbury Gardens terrorist attack in Reading in 2020.
The coroner found major problems with intelligence sharing between authorities, which was underlined in the prevention of future deaths report published in May.
Alongside others, Gary Furlong, my constituent and the father of James, is demanding that this is not just another report that sits on a shelf gathering dust.
What action will my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary take to make permanent changes on the back of this attack?
Will she agree to meet Gary Furlong and me to discuss progress in due course?
