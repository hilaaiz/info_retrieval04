What steps her Department is taking to help prevent young people from becoming involved in violent crime.
The epidemic of knife crime that has grown over the last decade is devastating families and communities right across the country.
That is why this Government have set ourselves an unprecedented mission to halve knife crime over the next 10 years.
We are already taking action to get lethal blades off Britain’s streets and taking stronger action against illegal online knife sales.
We are also determined to stop young people being drawn into violent crime and county lines in the first place, which is why we are delivering a radical new young futures prevention programme, with targeted interventions to help at risk young people and a network of new youth hubs.
