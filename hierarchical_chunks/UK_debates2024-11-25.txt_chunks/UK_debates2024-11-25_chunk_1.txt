I thank my right hon.
Friend for his statement and for reminding the House about the first-time funding for coal tips.
I notice that the Plaid Cymru Member,  the hon.
Member for Ynys Môn (Llinos Medi) , mentioned coal tips, but she could not leave the Chamber quickly enough—she could not wait for the end of the statement.
