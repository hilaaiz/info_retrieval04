I thank my hon.

Our deepest condolences are with the loved ones of James, Joseph and David following their tragic deaths.
I assure my hon.

We will of course be happy to meet the families to discuss changes made, and I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend and her constituent to discuss the matter further.
