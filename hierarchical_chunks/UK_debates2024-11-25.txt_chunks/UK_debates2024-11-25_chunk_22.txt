It was a great pleasure to meet my hon.
Friend just last week to discuss this issue.
Organisations like the Joe Dix Foundation do amazing work to help keep people safe and keep young people out of county line gangs in particular, and through the Home Office county lines programme we are going after exploitative gangs and providing specialist support for children and young people.
Our young futures programme will establish those prevention partnerships in every local authority to identify children and young people at risk.
