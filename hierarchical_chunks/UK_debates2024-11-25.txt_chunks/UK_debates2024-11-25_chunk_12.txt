One of the best ways to help tackle retail crime is to put more police on the streets.
The last Conservative Government did just that—[Interruption.]
The last Conservative Government did just that, delivering record numbers of police, with more funding than ever before, but we were not stopping there.
This year, the Conservative Government increased frontline police funding by £922 million.
Will the Minister commit to matching or even improving that figure next year?
I do not know if it is just amnesia on that side of the House, but I think the Shadow Minister needs to reflect on what we actually inherited: PCSOs cut by 50%, specials down by two thirds and over 20,000 police officers cut under the Conservative Administration.
So a little bit of humility about what they have left us with would go down very well.
What recent assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme.
We are determined to honour our commitment to those who supported us in Afghanistan and who stood up for freedom and democracy, placing their own lives at risk.
To date, the Afghan schemes have brought over 32,000 people to safety in the UK, including thousands through the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme.
We aim to continue to relocate eligible individuals through our established schemes as quickly as possible.
A major issue of concern for Afghans who have been here since the opening of the scheme is that their residency permits are now up for renewal.
I am sure the Government do not want to render illegal those whom we welcomed to the UK.
Can we have some guidance from the Home Office about some of the questions that people have asked me: where do people go for renewal; how is the Home Office  responding to those who have had several changes of address; and if there is a cost, what happens to those who cannot pay?
