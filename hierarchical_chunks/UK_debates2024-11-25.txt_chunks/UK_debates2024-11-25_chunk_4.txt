I thank my right hon.
Friend for that helpful answer.
Many residents in my constituency flag up the real problems with antisocial behaviour in both Sheerness and Sittingbourne town centres.
Windows have been smashed in church halls, and shop windows were smashed when the Christmas lights were being put on—I am seeing this all the time.
Can she please tell me what help she is offering Kent police to support my residents facing this behaviour?
