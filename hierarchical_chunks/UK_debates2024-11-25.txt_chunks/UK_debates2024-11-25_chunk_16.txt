What steps her Department is taking to help tackle domestic abuse.
The Government have set out an unprecedented mission to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.
I say this on White Ribbon Day, and it is good to see everybody wearing their white ribbons.
We are determined to tackle the scourge of domestic abuse in all its forms.
From early 2025, Raneem’s law, which will embed domestic abuse specialist teams into 999 control rooms in order to improve the police response to domestic abuse crimes, will ensure that victims get a swift and specialist response when they call for help.
We will also, finally, launch the pilot of the domestic abuse protection orders and roll them out across the country, which the previous Government failed to do three years after the fact of the law changing.
So we will be providing stronger protections for survivors and ensuring that perpetrators are properly monitored and managed.
