I thank the Minister for meeting me recently.
As she says, too many young people are being drawn into county lines, suffering exploitation and violence.
This is a significant problem across the country, including in Norwich.
Many organisations are working hard locally to improve the situation, such as the Joe Dix Foundation, established by his parents after Joe’s tragic murder in 2022.
Can the Minister reassure me that the Government are investing all they can in preventive measures and set out what is being done to support organisations on the frontline?
