I am asking the Home Secretary about her record.
I am asking the Home Secretary why small boat crossings have gone up during her time in office.
Perhaps it is because, as the National Crime Agency said, we need a deterrent.
Yet she cancelled the Rwanda deterrent before it even started.
Now we hear Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission President, asking European member states to look at offshore processing.
Is that not why it has gone up?
Is that not why the Minister for Border Security and Asylum admitted last week that she is opening new hotels instead of closing them down?
Seriously, what a lot of chaos!
Highest level on record: that was the six months of the last Conservative Government, while the right hon.
Gentleman was in government.
In fact, the numbers since the summer are not the highest on record.
That, unfortunately, was his legacy.
While he was the Immigration Minister, he increased the number of asylum hotels by 500% and increased the number of people in asylum hotels by over 900%.
Seriously, he should not try to give lectures to anybody else at all.
Well, I am going to give a little lecture.
If you really want to attack each other, can you do it before we get to topical questions?
These questions are meant to be short and sweet, because otherwise other Members will not get in.
Specialist domestic abuse services, such as The First Step in Knowsley, are facing an increase in demand but are having to turn people away due to a lack of funding.
What more can Ministers do to support such services?
I have visited The First Step, and to say that it is run by brilliant Merseyside women would be an underestimation.
Specialist “by and for” services play an essential role and provide tailored support to victims and survivors.
We understand the challenges that the sector faces, in particular with the level of demand their services are currently facing.
All decisions on funding after March 2025 are subject to the spending review process.
