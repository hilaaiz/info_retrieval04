My constituent Dr Lubna Hadoura is an NHS consultant who desperately wants to be able to care for her 80-year-old mother, a refugee displaced from Gaza earlier this year who is now alone in Egypt and unable to care for herself.
Will the Minister assure me that her application for an adult dependent relative visa will be carefully, humanely and properly considered?
I am not quite sure that that is actually about the resettlement scheme, but okay.
