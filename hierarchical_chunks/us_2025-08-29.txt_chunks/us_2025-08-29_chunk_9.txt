A licensed beautician since the late 1960's, she has been serving her loyal clients for decades and has yet to fully retire.
In addition to her professional work, she operated an in-home daycare in the 1970's and 1980's and served as Site Manager for the Bolivar County Community Action Agency in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Throughout her life, 
Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett has demonstrated an unwavering dedication to children and families.
Whether through her daycare, her beautician chair, or simply her open-door policy for neighborhood children seeking help with homework, she has poured love, wisdom, and guidance into generations.
Her service to the community extends beyond her personal and professional life.

Known affectionately as ``the neighborhood Mother,'' her home has always been a safe haven, a place of encouragement and support.
With the election of a new city administration, 
Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett remains hopeful and engaged in shaping a brighter future for Shelby.
Her unwavering faith in God keeps her grounded and strong, as she continues to pray for the strength to do what needs to be done.
