and secure vulnerable nuclear materials.
Notably, this partnership resulted in the safe removal of over 1,300 pounds of highly enriched uranium from the Ulba Metallurgical Plant--strengthening global security and setting a model for future cooperation.
Today, as arms control architectures fray and nuclear dangers mount, that example takes on new urgency.
The world faces a moment of great peril: nuclear arsenals are being modernized, new technologies are emerging that could undermine strategic stability, and the norms against nuclear testing and proliferation are under strain.
The vision of a world free from nuclear tests and the spread of nuclear weapons, advanced by Kazakhstan through their decision to disarm and continued commitment to a world free from nuclear weapons, is more urgent than ever.
In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly designated August 29th as the International Day Against Nuclear Tests--honoring Kazakhstan's decision and reminding the world of the human costs of explosive testing of nuclear weapons.
Civil society, too, has helped illuminate what is possible.
The Nevada-Semipalatinsk Movement, a grassroots anti-nuclear weapons movement uniting citizens across continents, helped build the momentum to end nuclear testing.
We must draw on that same spirit today to reinvigorate arms control diplomacy, rebuild confidence in nonproliferation regimes, and press forward on treaties like the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
On this 15th Annual International Day Against Nuclear Tests, I urge my colleagues to reaffirm our Nation's leadership in arms control, recommit to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and materials, and ensure that the horrors of nuclear testing and nuclear weapons use are never repeated.
