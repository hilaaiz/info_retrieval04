Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, legacy, and voice of a Mississippi treasure--Mosie ``Mama'' Burks, gospel music legend and beloved member of the world-renowned Mississippi Mass Choir.
Born on June 17, 1933, in Forest, Mississippi, Mama Burks was one of ten children in a large migrant farming family.
Her roots were humble, her work ethic unshakeable, and her faith unmovable.
As a child laboring in the cotton fields under the scorching Mississippi sun, she experienced the hardship and perseverance that would later define her voice and testimony.
Delivered from field work after suffering from heat exhaustion, Mama Burks went on to serve her community in numerous ways, including a 24-year career in social work at Jackson State University.
But it was her powerful, soul-stirring voice and unwavering testimony of God's grace that would make her a household name in gospel music.
In 1993, Mama Burks joined the Mississippi Mass Choir and soon became the face and heart of the ensemble.
Her passionate renditions of ``When I Rose This Morning'' and other gospel staples brought joy and healing to audiences across the nation and around the world.
Her performances were more than music, they were ministry.
With every note, she reminded listeners of the enduring power of faith, love, and perseverance.
Mama Burks was not merely a singer--she was a vessel.
Through countless concerts, worship services, and personal testimonies, she embodied the best of Mississippi's rich gospel tradition.
She shared her gifts humbly and generously, always giving glory to God.
Now, therefore, as we reflect on her passing, we remember not just the voice, but the spirit.
A mother to many, a sister in faith, and a tireless servant of the Lord, she leaves behind a legacy that transcends music--a legacy of praise, perseverance, and purpose.
