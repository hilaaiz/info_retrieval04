Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious, loyal, and self-motivated leader--
Mrs. Doris HaywoodBridgett--a pillar of the Shelby, Mississippi, community and a devoted servant to Bolivar County for nearly a century.
Born in 1935 in Boyle, Mississippi, 
Mrs. Haywood-Bridgett recently celebrated her 90th birthday.
A lifelong resident of Shelby, she remains an active and driving force in her community.
Her tireless commitment and continued contributions serve as an inspiration to all.
