Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Thomas Durand, a dedicated and selfless leader in Michigan's agricultural community, on his induction into the Michigan Farmers Hall.
Thomas Durand has spent his life committed to Michigan agriculture.
A lifelong farmer, Thomas, began his journey in the fields of Sanilac County, working alongside his father.
In 1981, he established his own farm, where he continues to grow a diverse range of crops including sugar beets, black beans, wheat, soybeans, and corn.
A member of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, Thomas served four years on its board, including one year as president.
He also served nine years on the Corn Marketing Program of Michigan board, including two years as its president.
Thomas's advocacy has extended far beyond Michigan's borders.
He represented the U.S. Grains Council on a mission to Japan and has been a steadfast voice for Michigan corn growers in Washington, D.C.
His agricultural service doesn't stop at corn.
Thomas has served 18 years on the Michigan Sugar Company board, and seven years on the Greenstone Farm Credit board.
He is also a lifetime member of the Soybean Growers Association and an active member of the Michigan Farm Bureau.
Equally commendable is Thomas's commitment to community.
He has served as a township supervisor, school board member, high school basketball coach, and referee.
He has also spent years broadcasting local high school sports on WTGV in Sandusky, further strengthening community ties through his voice and presence.
In 2021, Thomas was honored with the Distinguished Service Award by the Michigan Corn Growers Association, a fitting recognition for his lifelong service and leadership.
