Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Riverside Neighborhood Parade on September 6, 2025.
This is one The Riverside Parade began in 1925, when the city first paved Harding Street and more than 10,000 neighbors gathered to celebrate.
Since that day, the parade has represented civic unity, community pride, and the rich cultural legacy of one of our city's oldest neighborhoods.
For generations, the Riverside community has come together every September to honor its history, celebrate its people, and look ahead with hope.
Riverside is more than just a neighborhood--it is a community built on resilience, service, and shared history.
With its early 20th-century homes and the newly completed promenade trail at Riverside Park, the area reflects the very heart and soul.
This year's centennial celebration not only marks a historic milestone but also begins a new chapter.
Under the leadership of Careena Jackson and the Riverside Civic League, the parade's planning and stewardship have returned to the neighborhood's hands.
Their dedication to preserving this beloved tradition while building its future is a powerful example of community leadership in action.
Featuring everything from marching bands and bike riders to school groups and local leaders, the Riverside Parade continues to inspire joy, connection, and civic engagement.
It serves as a reminder of what is possible when neighbors unite with purpose and pride.
