Mr. Speaker, Thomas Durand exemplifies the very best of Michigan agriculture and rural leadership.
His unwavering dedication to farming, advocacy, and community service make him a worthy inductee into the Michigan Farmers Hall.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Thomas on this well-deserved honor and thanking him for his lifelong contributions to Michigan's agricultural heritage.
