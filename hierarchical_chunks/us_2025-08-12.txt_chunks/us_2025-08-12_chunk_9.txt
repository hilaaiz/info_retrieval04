Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Mr. Lewis Brown--an exceptional scholar from my district.
He is a rising senior at Gar-Field High School located in Woodbridge, Virginia.
He is currently studying the extraction of bioethanol from crawfish and lobster shells, which is an innovative way to turn biological waste into renewable energy.
He shared his work with my office showing the shells of crustaceans such as crawfish, lobsters, shrimp, and crabs are rich in chitin, a long-chain polymer that is one of the most abundant biopolymers.
His work highlights both scientific curiosity and a commitment to sustainability.
But Lewis's dedication doesn't stop with his own education.
He has also developed a virtual tutorial program through the MST (Math, Science, and Technology) initiative, where he mentors fellow students in biology, chemistry, math, and English.
His passion for teaching and uplifting others reflects true leadership, service, and a deep commitment to both science and community.
He is also an active member of several prestigious organizations, including the National Honor Society, the American Industrial Hygiene Association, the American Chemical Society, and the Society of Toxicology.
His dedication to academic excellence and scientific advancement is clear.
