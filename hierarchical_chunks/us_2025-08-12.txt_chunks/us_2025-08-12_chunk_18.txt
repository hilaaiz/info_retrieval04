Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of Chicago LGBTQ+ activist, Lori Cannon.
For over four decades, 
Ms. Cannon--known as ``Chicago's AIDS Angel''--spearheaded some of the most important initiatives of Chicago's LGBTQ+ rights movement.
Motivated by the inhumane treatment of those with AIDS and affected by HIV, 
Ms. Cannon co-founded a meal delivery service, Open Hand/Chicago, in 1988, to ensure that those suffering from AIDS would not go hungry.
She then led Open Hand in its transition to a food pantry program known as ``Groceryland'', helping people in need obtain much needed nourishment.
Also in 1988, 
Ms. Cannon co-founded ACT UP/Chicago, a grassroots protest group which put the AIDS epidemic front and center during a time when the government was ignoring the community's devastation.
Ms. Cannon was instrumental in helping create the NAMES Project, bringing the Aids Memorial Quilt to Chicago in 1988, 1990 and 1994.
Then, in 2010, she co-founded the Legacy Project, an organization committed to honoring the cultural and civic contributions of LGBTQ+ individuals, including placing bronze plaques along North Halsted Street.
A pillar of the community she loved so much, 
Ms. Cannon was unrelenting in her commitment to the well-being of each individual.
When the government and the families of those affected by HIV/AIDS abandoned those who were suffering, 
Ms. Cannon stepped up to fill that void--organizing, volunteering, protesting, feeding, hugging, and loving each person when there was no one else.
As her longtime friend Sharyl Holtzman remembers, ``She took care of the whole universe.''
