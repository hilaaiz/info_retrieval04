Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Tammy Tome, recipient of Visiting Angels' 2025 National Caregiver of the Year award.
Visiting Angels is a national organization that provides in-home care to seniors.
Each year, they recognize one of their caregivers whose work exemplifies the mission of the organization.
With over 600 franchises across the country, the Caregiver of the Year award is both highly competitive and prestigious.
While 
Ms. Tome joined Visiting Angels in 2023, she has served as a caregiver for twenty-five years.
In this short time, she has made a profound impact on those she serves, consistently showing clients the compassion and dignity they deserve.
She visits clients in their homes, providing everything from assistance with daily needs to care for those facing terminal illnesses.
Tammy's clients and their families have noted the immense impact she has had on their quality of life.
One client's wife remarked, ``Tammy has given our family a sense of peace, stability, and a sense of hope.''
She is widely respected for her professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to those in her care.
I thank Tammy for her remarkable work and steadfast commitment to caring for seniors in our community.
Her compassion and service set an example for all, and I wish her continued success in the years ahead.
