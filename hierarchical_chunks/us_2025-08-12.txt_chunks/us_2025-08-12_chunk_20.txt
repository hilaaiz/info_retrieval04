Mr. TORRES.
Mr. Speaker, my heart goes out to the family, friends, and colleagues of Wesley LePatner, one of the victims of the tragic shooting in Midtown Manhattan.
A city is only as strong as its people, and Wesley LePatner represented the very best.
She left a lasting impact wherever she went: as a senior executive at Blackstone, a devoted congregant at the Altneu Synagogue, and a dedicated board member at the Heschel School.
Wesley lived as we all should strive to live: with civic purpose, compassion, and a commitment to something greater than herself.
She was a devoted spouse and parent, a distinguished professional, and a doggedly public-spirited New Yorker whose love for family and community was palpable to everyone she knew.
May her memory be a blessing.
