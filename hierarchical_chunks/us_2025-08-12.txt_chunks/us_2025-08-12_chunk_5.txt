Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the South Carolina Irmo Little League All-Stars baseball team, as they rallied to defeat defending champions, Lake Mary, in a game played in Warner Robins, Georgia.
This outstanding team is now heading to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to compete in the Little League World Series (LLWS).
The LLWS is an annual event featuring 20 teams, 10 from the United States and 10 from the rest of the world.
Irmo is just the fourth team from South Carolina to advance to the LLWS, and the first since a Taylors team in 2015.
The Irmo All-Stars team includes players, Ethan Bennett, Andrew Bogan, Brayden Gerard, Jacob Gibson, Joe Giulietti, Sutton Gravelle, Jake McQuilkin, Brody Miller, Palmer Steele, Ryder Tillitz, Preston Ware, and Brady Westbrooks.
Alongside the players is the talented team manager, Dave Bogan, and equally talented coaches Mike Beckworth and Pat Gravelle.
Having a winning record of 11-1 during the state and regional tournaments, the Irmo team is now preparing to face the New England region champion on August 14, 2025.
On behalf of all South Carolinians, congratulations to the Irmo AllStars on this impressive achievement and we wish them the best of luck as they represent Team South Carolina in the World Series.
This victory of the Irmo All-Stars Team is well-deserved, for the team, coaches, families, and community for all their hard work and support, making their dream come true.
