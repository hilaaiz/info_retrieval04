Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize and celebrate the 50th anniversary.
Located within Illinois' 16th Congressional District, Marquis serves as a cornerstone example of American entrepreneurship and energy leadership.
Founded in 1975, Marquis began as a grain merchandising business in rural Buda, Illinois.
Now, Marquis is the largest dry-mill ethanol facility in North America, producing clean, homegrown American biofuels and value-added coproducts that support thousands of farm families and strengthen America's energy independence.
Marquis is a consistent national leader in biofuel innovation.
Through their work and advocacy, Marquis continues to shape the future of clean energy and rural investment, advancing next-generation corn markets for producers and farmers alike.
