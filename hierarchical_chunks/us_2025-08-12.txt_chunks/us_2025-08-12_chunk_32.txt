Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Officer Terry Caldwell, who is retiring after an extraordinary 41-year career in law enforcement, including 28 years of dedicated service with the Grapevine Police Department.
Officer Caldwell began his distinguished career in 1984 with the Dallas County Sheriff's Department and, over the course of his service, earned multiple certifications and commendations, amassing more than 3,700 hours of professional training.
During his tenure with the Grapevine Police Department, Officer Caldwell served 25 of his 28 years as a School Resource Officer in the Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District, a role he considered his calling.
He was deeply committed to working alongside the young people of our community, serving as a trusted role model and mentor to thousands of students across elementary, middle, and high schools.
Officer Caldwell's unwavering dedication, professionalism, and service have left an indelible mark on the community he has faithfully served.
His career stands as a testament to the values of integrity, compassion, and commitment that define the very best of law enforcement.
On behalf of the 24th Congressional District of Texas, I congratulate Officer Terry Caldwell on his well-earned retirement and thank him for his decades of service to our community.
