Ms. Cannon was born and raised in West Rogers Park.
Her father, Lee Cannon, was a champion of Native American rights.
Her younger brother, J.H., was born with a defective heart, leading to a lifelong disability.
After her older brother Jules suffered a horrific motorcycle accident, she became the caretaker for both of her brothers, a precursor to her life of service.
When Lori Cannon passed away on Sunday, August 3, 2025, Chicago and its LGBTQ+ community lost a selfless champion.
Her legacy will live on in the community that she supported and loved so much.
I am forever grateful for her immeasurable contribution and impact on the City and its LGBTQ+ community.
