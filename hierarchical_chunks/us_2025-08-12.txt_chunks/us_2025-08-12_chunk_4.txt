From ethanol production to carbon capture, Marquis forges new opportunities that support American families and put our farmers first.
What started as a local operation grew into a prosperous company that has created over 450 jobs and purchases over 140 million bushels of corn annually.
Still today, the deep roots of family farming and a strong commitment to the agricultural community continue to be the foundations of Marquis' success.
As we commemorate this incredible milestone, I want to recognize Mark Marquis, Tom Marquis, the whole Marquis family, and their entire team for their entrepreneurial spirit, strong values, and unwavering commitment to their community and country.
Congratulations to Marquis on 50 years of American excellence.
May the next 50 years strengthen the values that make Marquis and rural America strong.
