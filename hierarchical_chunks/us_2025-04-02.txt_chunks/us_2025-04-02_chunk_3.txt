Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy 100th birthday to Mr. Howard Lee Davidson of Visalia, California, a veteran of World War II and a hero of our community.
Howard was born in Visalia, California on April 2, 1925.
With the entry of the United States into World War II, he proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army as Private First-Class Howard Lee Davidson.
Howard would soon brave the treacherous Atlantic Ocean aboard the RMS Queen Mary vessel to join the war in Europe.
On June 12, 1944, six days after the Normandy landings on D-Day, Howard was assigned to the U.S. Third Army, commanded by legendary General George Patton.
During this time, Howard served as an anti-aircraft gunner in which he was part of the offensive across France, Belgium, and all the way into Germany.
While advancing through the Ardennes Forest centered around Belgium and Luxembourg, Howard found himself in the Battle of the Bulge.
Often referred to as ``the greatest American battle of the war,'' Howard fought alongside British, French, and Canadian Allied forces to halt the final offensive bravery of Howard and others like him in the Third Army, the Allied offensive to liberate Europe would certainly have suffered deeply.
When he returned to the United States after serving in the war, Howard met his wife Stella Thrasher and the two were soon married.
The couple had three children--Kenny, Danny, and Vicky, who is Howard's loving caretaker.
Howard's grandson, also named Danny, followed his grandfather's dedication to patriotism and currently serves as Staff Sergeant at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.
In our country's proud history, it is so often the legacy of service among families which keeps our Nation safe and our Armed Forces strong.
I hope Howard looks back with pride on his years of service, not only for the great sacrifices and honor, but also the enduring legacy it fosters for our Nation.
