Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jaqua Realtors as they celebrate their 50th anniversary.
This achievement represents more than a half-century of service to the people.
In 1975, Jaqua Realtors began with a single office in Kalamazoo operated by Chuck Jaqua.
Since the doors first opened, Jaqua has opened thirteen more offices across Southwest Michigan.
As a small business owner myself, I can attest that the hard work and dedication of the whole Jaqua family is a true representation of the American Dream.
Marking half a century as a family-owned business.
Since their founding, ownership has remained in the family.
The business is currently under the leadership of Dan Jaqua, who sees the value of maintaining his late father's commitment to the community.
Jaqua Realtors is a prominent piece of the Southwest Michigan community.
They believe in a hands-on approach to community support and have been extensively philanthropic since their foundation.
Jaqua Realtors has contributed to groups such as the Kalamazoo Literary Council, Girls on the Run, and the Greater Kalamazoo United Way.
We would like to thank Jaqua Realtors for more than fifty years of outstanding dedication in Southwest Michigan.
This achievement is truly remarkable.
