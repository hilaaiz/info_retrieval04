Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Robert Ashe, whom I have named the California 4th District's 2025 Climate Crisis Champion of the Year for Sonoma County for his extensive volunteer efforts to restore and protect the Santa Rosa Creek and surrounding areas.
He exemplifies the power of grassroots environmental stewardship as seen through founding the Friends of the Prince Memorial Greenway.
