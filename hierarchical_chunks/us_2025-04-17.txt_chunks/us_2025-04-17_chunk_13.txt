Mr. MORAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Kilgore College Rangerettes and celebrate two extraordinary milestones: the 30th anniversary of the 54th line, the Class of 1995, and the 85th anniversary of this world-renowned team.
Founded in 1940 by Gussie Nell Davis, the Rangerettes were the first precision dance team to perform during a college football halftime show.
With their high kicks, jump splits, and iconic red, white, and blue uniforms, they have set a standard for discipline and excellence for over eight decades.
The Class of 1995 holds a special place in this legacy as the first to perform under Director Dana Blair and Assistant Director Shelley Wayne, whose leadership continues to shape the Rangerettes today.
Many of these teammates became dance and drill team instructors, passing on the discipline and artistry instilled during their time as Rangerettes.
Their sophomore year featured unforgettable moments, including performances in France, at the Texas State Fair Gala, and alongside legends like Willie Nelson.
Their finale performance to Donna Summer's ``Last Dance'' remains an emotional highlight, with one teammate saying, ``I could cry thinking about this song.''
As they often say, ``Once a Rangerette, always a Rangerette.''
For 85 years, the Rangerettes have been ambassadors of Texas culture, blending grace and precision to inspire generations.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Kilgore College Rangerettes, the Class of 1995, and their lasting legacy of excellence.
