Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Hartsville, South Carolina.
The history of Antioch is profound and deserving of the great celebration that is taking place on Easter Sunday.
The journey that has brought Antioch Church to this moment began in 1888 when the Church was established on the crest of a hill.
That year, a group of people with great faith in their hearts and each other, came together for one mission.
The Church's early founders--Shade Charles, Joe Coe, William Brunson, Ham Fountain, and the Reverend Jonas Muldrow decided to call their new church ``Antioch.''
These men and women were the first officers of the church with Reverend Jonas Muldrow as their first pastor.
In 1937, the structure of the Church was replaced, and it has gone through several renovations since, with the most recent taking place in 1984, when the church added two Sunday school classrooms and brick veneered the sanctuary.
Since its inception, Antioch Missionary Baptist Church and its congregation have served as a beacon of light within the community.
The programs and ministries initiated by the church have served as models-- for other churches of various denominations in the area.
The strength thrive through the years.
Its congregants diligently serve in several capacities--deacons, ministers, Sunday school teachers, missionaries, choir members, ushers, musicians, and so much more.
Churches like Antioch are significant parts of our history and their stories are anchors in the African American faith community.
