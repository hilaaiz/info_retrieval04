Mr. Speaker.
Gustavo Avina's leadership in sustainable farming and dedication to Napa Valley's farmworker community set a powerful example.
His leadership in carbon neutrality efforts, dry farming mentorship and farmworker education exemplifies the positive impact an individual can have on their industry and community.
Therefore, it is fitting that we honor him here today as Napa County's 2025 Climate Crisis Champion of the Year.
