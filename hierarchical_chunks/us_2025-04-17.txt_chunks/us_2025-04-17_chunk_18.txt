Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Justina Salinas, whom I have named the California 4th District's 2025 Climate Crisis Champion of the Year for Solano County in recognition of her visionary leadership in regenerative agriculture, habitat restoration, and environmental advocacy.
Born in Sacramento, California, 
Ms. Salinas graduated from the American School of London and earned her bachelor's degree from Santa Clara University, where she majored in both E-commerce and Studio Art, with additional minors in Entrepreneurship and Retail Management.
Inspired by her grandparents who immigrated to California from Guanajuato, Mexico, in the 1960s and worked in the fields with a profound respect for nature, 
Ms. Salinas founded Araceli Farms in 2017, a small lavender farm in Dixon.
What began as a family-run venture evolved into a model of environmental restoration for all.
Ms. Salinas has transformed her farm into a thriving native grassland meadow, prioritizing regenerative agriculture practices including soil health restoration, dry farming, biodiversity conservation, no till farming, integrated rotational grazing, natural pest management, and native plant reintegration.
Her farm has become a haven for the native species of our Solano County, with blue belly lizards, egrets, herons, red-tailed hawks, barn owls, and other species all thriving on the property.
By intentionally choosing not to disturb the soil, 
Ms. Salinas has fostered a living, nutrient-rich environment that has become a sanctuary for wildlife and a beacon of sustainable land stewardship.
