Mr. Speaker, Justina Salinas reminds us that farming is more than a profession, rather a relationship with the land and a call to stewardship.
Her resilience, kindness, and unwavering dedication to ecological justice make her a powerful role model in Solano County and beyond.
For these reasons and more, it is fitting and proper that we recognize her today as Solano County's 2025 Climate Crisis Champion of the Year.
