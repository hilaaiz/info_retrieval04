Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate WJBC as they reach a monumental milestone.
For 100 years, WJBC has been the voice of McLean County.
The hosts have dedicated themselves to providing residents of Central Illinois with timely and reliable news to keep the public informed.
Local radio station's are more important than ever.
They bring a unique, personal, and powerful form of communication to their audience.
WJBC serves as a bridge between communities, providing a unique space where local stories, issues, and voices can be heard.
WJBC has welcomed Presidents, governors, politicians, celebrities, and local voices to keep us informed about public events and connect our community.
The station has been home to legendary on-air personalities, including Don Newberg, Don Munson, Steve Vogel, Ken Behrens, Dick Luedke, Scott Laughlin, and current morning host Scott Miller, who have all enriched the lives of listeners and made significant contributions to the communities and organizations across Central Illinois.
This is a monumental moment for WJBC, and I congratulate them on their 100 years of success.
I look forward to listening to WJBC for many more years to come.
