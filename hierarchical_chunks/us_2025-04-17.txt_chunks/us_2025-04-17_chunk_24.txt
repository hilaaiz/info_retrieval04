recycling, composting and environmental responsibility, instilling in students a deep respect for sustainability.
In 2020, 
Mr. Ashe turned his passion for environmental care into action by volunteering at the Prince Memorial Greenway, a beloved but often overlooked natural space in our city.
What began as simple trash cleanups soon expanded into a comprehensive restoration effort.
Mr. Ashe currently dedicates an average of 25 hours a week to maintaining the Greenway and its surrounding parks, trails and creek areas.
His work includes vegetation management, graffiti removal, trail upkeep and clearing potential hazards, all critical efforts in helping the Greenway remain a safe and thriving space for residents and wildlife alike.
Recognizing the power of collective action, 
Mr. Ashe founded the Friends of the Prince Memorial Greenway, a volunteer group dedicated to the ongoing restoration and beautification of the area in 2023.
Under his leadership, the group contributes over 125 volunteer hours per month to cleaning and maintaining the Greenway.
With each passing season, the number of volunteers continues to grow as more community members are inspired to join the cause.
Beyond cleanup efforts, the Friends of the Prince Memorial Greenway advocates for the Greenway's role in connecting downtown residents and businesses, bringing people together through nature, art and sustainable transportation initiatives.
