Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Vacaville City Manager Aaron Busch, an esteemed member of our Solano County community.
His 37 years of public service and his tireless dedication to our community exemplify why he is being honored today.
Aaron Busch is a lifelong Californian, having studied geography with an emphasis in Urban Planning at Fresno State University before beginning a career in city planning.
His first role in local government was as an Assistant/Associate Planner with the City.
In 2017, 
Mr. Busch joined the City of Vacaville as Assistant City Manager, where he oversaw the Community Development and Parks and Recreation Departments and eventually rose to the rank of city manager where he has served since.
