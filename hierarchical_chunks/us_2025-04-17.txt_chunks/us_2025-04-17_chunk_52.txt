Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to pay tribute to this fine congregation for its dedication, endless faith, and the love it has shown to the community.
As we learn from Acts 11:26, Barnabas found Paul in Tarsus and brought him to Antioch where they spent a whole year assembling themselves with the church, and teaching and it was there that the disciples were first called Christians.''
I ask you and my colleagues to join me in congratulating Antioch Missionary Baptist Church and wishing its congregation God's blessings in the days ahead.
