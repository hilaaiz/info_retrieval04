Mr. TRAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a loving husband, devoted father, award-winning attorney, and good friend, Jon C. Teller.
Jon, a pinnacle in the Los Angeles trial attorney community, passed away much too soon this month after a courageous battle with cancer.
Jon was a celebrated Senior Trial Attorney at Wilshire Law Firm, known for his dedication to fighting large insurance corporations and holding them accountable.
His excellent work at Wilshire led to his nomination for both Attorney of the Year by Consumer Attorneys of California in 2020, and Trial Lawyer of the Year by Consumer Attorneys Association of Los Angeles in 2022 and 2023.
Perhaps most importantly, Jon maintained a reputation as someone who cared for those around him, always finding time to mentor fellow attorneys and share his knowledge and expertise.
Jon believed that assisting fellow trial attorneys would help the most injured people receive the justice they deserved, and he dedicated his life to that belief.
Jon was also a beloved husband and father and is survived by his wife Rachie and their children Jordan, Nicky, and Ally.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capital in recognition missed by his friends and family, and his legacy will continue in the minds of everyone who met him.
