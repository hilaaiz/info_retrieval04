I thank the hon.
Gentleman.
I learn something new every session.
I shall have to investigate the first half of his question, but he is absolutely right  to raise the plight of tenants who either are in unsuitable accommodation or are being exploited by their landlords.
The Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has done an enormous amount of work on that issue, both on building quality and ensuring that tenants are protected, and I shall ensure that he has heard what the hon.
Gentleman has said.
