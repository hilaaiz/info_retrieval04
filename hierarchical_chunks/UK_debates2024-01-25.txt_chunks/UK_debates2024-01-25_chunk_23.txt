Will the Secretary of State please confirm that this Government have no plans to alter the legislation on the marketing of infant formula and other breastmilk substitutes?
The hon.
Gentleman raises an interesting point.
I am very happy to write to him about it.
Royal Mail customers will have welcomed the Minister’s reassurance this week about ruling out a reduction to the current six day a week service.
However, many customers already feel short changed by what is often an inadequate service in their area.
Does the Minister agree that any proposed changes must protect the small businesses whose business models rely on the six-day service, and customers’ rights?
The hon.
Gentleman is right to raise this issue.
The service has not been satisfactory, and Royal Mail has been fined £5.6 million by Ofcom as a result.
It has employed 3,000 more postal workers to address those problems, and we are seeing some improvement, but he is right to raise the point about our six-day service being vital to businesses, particularly those in the magazine and greeting card industries.
What assessment has the Minister made of the results of private sector trials in relation to the introduction of a four-day week?
Will he meet me in due course to discuss the results of those trials?
