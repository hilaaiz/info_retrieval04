The Secretary of State has often stated her support for post-Brexit regulatory reform and divergence, and did so again in answer to an earlier question.
Is she in a position to deny reports in  today that the Government have pledged to introduce a requirement that all future regulatory change will be screened to ensure that extra barriers in the Irish sea are not created?
That could be a significant impediment to divergence from EU laws.
I cannot comment on the ongoing Northern Ireland political process, to which I am not a participant.
However, it is clear that we retain the ability to diverge.
I agree with my right hon.
Friend that if we are to seize the benefits of Brexit, we need to find that comparative advantage over the EU in our regulations, otherwise there would be no point.
I remind her that I was the Business Secretary who made sure that there was transparency, rather than an invisible bonfire, in what we were doing on EU regulations.
I ended the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice on  1 January .
We have a comprehensive deregulation programme, which I am pushing.
I understand her concerns, and I will speak to colleagues across Departments to ensure that they are raised at the highest level.
