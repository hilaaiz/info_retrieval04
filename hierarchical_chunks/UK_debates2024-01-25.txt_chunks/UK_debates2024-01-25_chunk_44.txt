Some time ago, the Scottish Government refused an instruction from the Information Commissioner to publish written evidence from the Hamilton inquiry into the conduct of the former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Last month, I attended the Court of Session hearing at which the Scottish Government were humiliated, at great public expense, in their attempt to reject the request.
Despite a unanimous ruling against them by the highest civil court in Scotland, the Scottish Government still refuse to release that information.
That extraordinary behaviour would appear to be in breach of the ministerial code, the civil service code and, indeed, the rule of law.
May I ask the Leader of the House whether the rule of law in Scotland is at risk and whether we can have a debate and a statement on this matter?
