The Secretary of State was asked— What steps she is taking with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to help increase access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Please may I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to pay tribute to Tony Lloyd?
I worked with him very closely on the all-party groups on poverty and fair business banking.
He was a thoroughly decent man.
On behalf of myself and the Department, I pass on our deep condolences to his friends and family.
The Government work with the British Business Bank to improve access to finance for smaller businesses through targeted programmes, such as the £12.4 billion of finance that is backing more than 90,000 businesses across the UK and the £1 billion in start-up loans for 105,000 small businesses since 2012.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for that reply.
Many SMEs and new businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to open a bank account and to then obtain the support and services that used to be available in the rapidly diminishing branch network.
What steps is he taking to address those challenges that SMEs are facing?
My hon.
Friend raises an important point.
Leading banks and alternative lenders are committed to the SME finance charter to help small businesses and start-ups.
We continue to work with the UK finance and banking industry to make sure that SMEs have the support from banking services that they require.
Many leading challenger banks, such as Metro, Aldermore and Starling, provide additional application support.
Banking hubs are also available for those without a bank on their high street to offer face-to-face support.
Thirty have already opened, and 70 more are in the pipeline.
