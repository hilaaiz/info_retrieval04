I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising that question.
The Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero made a written ministerial statement on  22 November  presenting the five revised energy national policy statements for parliamentary approval.
She deposited copies of all those documents in the Libraries of both Houses, and they were available on gov.uk.
She also sent a letter to all hon.
Members on  9 January  highlighting the scrutiny period of the NPS.
Following the expiry period of 21 days, no objections were received, and the Secretary of State designated them on  17 January .
I fully appreciate that while all the i’s have been dotted and the t’s crossed, my right hon.
Friend and other Members may feel they have not had the chance to discuss or offer their opinions on them.
She knows how to apply for a debate, but I will certainly ensure that the Secretary of State has heard her concerns.
