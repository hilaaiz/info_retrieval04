The Secretary of State for Education did not show up either.
She has had no legislation for months, yet the reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete in schools shambles drags on, and now we understand that the much-needed flagship childcare policy is in chaos.
Can the Leader of the House shed more light on this?
How many parents of two-year-olds who qualify and want to take up the offer of free childcare in April will not be able to access it?
And will the roll-out to nine-month-old babies go ahead in September, as promised?
Ministers seem unable to give those assurances, and providers are clear that the Government’s flagship roll-out is a sham.
Another week goes by with a failing Government who have run out of road, are out of ideas and are failing to deliver on their basic promises.
That is now the verdict of Conservatives as well , with the Prime Minister’s own pollster having concluded that they are not “providing the bold, decisive action required” and that “the Conservatives are heading for the most almighty of defeats.”
Those are his words, not mine, and many agree.
So can they just put everyone out of their misery, and get on and call a general election?
