I thank my right hon.
Friend for raising this matter and the disturbing issues surrounding it.
Although there is a debate about whether the court decision is binding or is binding in a particular way, we consider it to be a matter of accountability to the Scottish Parliament.
I am sure that the Scottish Parliament will be asking questions of their Government in relation to those very serious matters, which my right hon.
Friend has raised today.
