Small and medium-sized enterprises are a vital part of a thriving global economy, yet 49% of British SMEs say that they lack the time or resources to sell internationally.
They are being hindered by complex regulation, insufficient access to funding and inadequate Government guidance.
That is why Labour has launched the small business export taskforce with the Federation of Small Businesses to listen to business needs and address them head-on.
What is the Minister doing to support hard-working SMEs in navigating the Government’s complex web of regulatory requirements and help unleash this untapped entrepreneurial potential?
We agree with the hon.
Gentleman on the ambition, but he is probably behind the game a little in terms of what we are actually doing, not least in the 73 free trade agreements that we have agreed, including the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership that is coming down the track.
I hope that he will be supportive of that agreement.
He has probably also never heard of the export support service, the international trade advisers and the export champions, all of which help our SMEs export to other parts of the word.
