The hon.
Member raises a very important point.
It is something that we look at all the time, and certainly we have had discussions on the matter.
We already have programmes in place, including the £12.4 billion that we distribute through the British Business Bank that supports nations and regions funds.
Some of that will certainly help businesses to access finance to decarbonise.
We look at those measures all the time, and we are happy to work with him on future programmes that we might roll out.
