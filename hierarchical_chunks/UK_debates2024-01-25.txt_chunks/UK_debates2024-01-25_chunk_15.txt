I thank my hon.
Friend for all her work.
At one point we were co-chairs of the all-party group for whistleblowing, and she does a tremendous job in raising this issue time and again in the House.
We are currently reviewing the effectiveness of the whistleblowing framework in meeting its intended objectives.
Every scandal that I have talked about in this House over the years, from the Back Benches and the Front Benches, has come to light because of whistleblowers, who are hugely important.
We are reviewing that frame- work.
The research for the review is near completion, the Government will set out the next steps in due course, and yes, of course I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend to discuss that.
