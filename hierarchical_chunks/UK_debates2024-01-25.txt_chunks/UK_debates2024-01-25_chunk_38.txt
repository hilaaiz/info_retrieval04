Stratford market village in my constituency has provided space for more than 60 much-loved independent local businesses to ply their trade since about 1974.
They are the kinds of businesses that reflect the entrepreneurship, drive and diversity in Newham, but on  10 January , with no warning at all, the traders received an email telling them that the market village was closed with immediate effect.
The company that owns it is going into administration, leaving viable, much-loved businesses in limbo, out of pocket and without a home.
I thank our Assembly Member Unmesh Desai and Newham Council for their work on the matter so far, and I hope that it bears fruit, but I know that many similar communities have faced similar problems.
May we have a debate in Government time on whether our councils have the resources and powers they need to effectively step in and save much-loved local spaces and businesses when this kind of thing happens?
