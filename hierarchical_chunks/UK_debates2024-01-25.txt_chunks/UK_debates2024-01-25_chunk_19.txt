With many banks closing on high streets, the post office is picking up so much slack, but in rural areas the limits placed on the amount of cash that can be paid in at the post office is having a real impact on businesses.
For instance, pubs have a lot of cash but cannot pay it in because of the limits.
Can the Minister review that and ensure that the post office can take far greater volumes of cash from rural businesses?
