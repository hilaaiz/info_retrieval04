I thank my hon.
Friend again for her diligent work in speaking up not just for steel producers but for the users of those products.
It is incredibly important that we retain those sovereign capabilities.
I know that she takes every opportunity in this Chamber to champion those issues.
I am sure that she will apply for another debate on the matter, and my office stands ready to assist her.
