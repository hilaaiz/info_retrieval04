Postal workers are the bedrock of our communities, but they are being forced to work at unsustainable levels—something that, sadly, has not been recognised in Ofcom’s  report on the future of universal service obligations.
The input of postal workers is critical to a successful Royal Mail, so please can we have confirmation that their views will be considered in any future decisions?
That would make perfect sense.
We read the Ofcom report into the review of universal service obligations with interest.
Our clear position is that we will retain a six-day service for our citizens and businesses, but those views will be taken into account.
