I thank the right hon.
Lady for again diligently raising this matter.
I met the Paymaster General yesterday to get an update on progress.
Progress is being made, and I know that the Paymaster General will want to come to the House to make a statement on that.
I know that he will do so as soon as he has something substantial to say, but I can assure the House, which I hope knows my interest in this area, that he is working to ensure that justice is served as swiftly as possible.
