May I inform the Leader of the House that we already have a holocaust memorial centre at the University of Huddersfield at the heart of Huddersfield?
All Members hope that the new holocaust memorial centre at the heart of Westminster will happen soon.
Am I right in believing that an illustrious ancestor of hers—Raymond Postgate—wrote a book called, “The Common People”?
Is she aware that common people in my constituency and up and down the country are being dreadfully exploited via Rachmanite landlords?
They are being given a miserable life, with rack-renting or letting every room in the house as a bedroom.
What is going on in the rented sector is a scandal.
May we have a debate on that?
