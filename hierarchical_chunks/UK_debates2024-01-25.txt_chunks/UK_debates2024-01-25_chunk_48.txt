Energy national policy statements have a significant impact on my constituents.
I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend’s officials and her Parliamentary Private Secretary for finding some information in advance; I know that the statements were laid before Parliament on  22 November , and it was then declared in a written ministerial statement that they had been approved by Parliament.
Although I have returned to the Back Benches after many years, I remember that the Government in the past laid a resolution before the House, and I participated in that debate on  18 July 2011 .
I do not believe we have had a debate on these particular statements, so I would be grateful, even if we have gone past the legal deadline, if my right hon.
Friend found time for one.
