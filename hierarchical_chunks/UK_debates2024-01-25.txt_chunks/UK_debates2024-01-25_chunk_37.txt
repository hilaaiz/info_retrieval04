I thank my hon.
Friend for again diligently raising this important issue; I understand that the forums in which he can do so are limited, which is why he brings it to the Floor of the House each week.
He has put those points on the record, as well as his thanks to those survivors for their important intervention.
As the Secretary of State will not take questions until  4 March , I will again ensure that he has heard what my hon.
Friend has said.
