I thank the hon.
Lady for her helpful suggestion of a debate.
I am sorry to hear about the situation in her constituency.
Such markets are often a stepping stone for many businesses to getting additional premises of their own.
The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and its high streets team have been collecting good practice about where other people have faced such situations.
There are some good examples of what local authorities and other groups can do to ensure that continuity.
As the next question time is a little way off, I will ask officials in the Department to contact the hon.
Lady to see what more can be done to assist.
