I thank my right hon.
Friend for her question and remind the House that we had an urgent question on that matter on Monday.
We are rolling out the single largest expansion in childcare in England’s history, ensuring that working parents receive 30 hours of free childcare a week, starting at nine months and going all the way up to their child starting school.
She will know that we have increased hourly funding rates with a £204 million cash boost this year and more than £400 million next year to support the childcare sector to deliver this, but I know that hon.
Members will want to follow that progress very carefully.
