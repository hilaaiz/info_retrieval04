I thank the hon.
Gentleman for the constructive way he has engaged with us on this issue.
I know that the Justice Secretary spoke to the Leader of the Opposition this week on this very matter, and we are very keen to engage with the hon.
Gentleman too.
He is right to say the solution is imperfect.
We believe it is the least worst option, but of course we will engage with him and make sure that he feels the legislation is in the right place.
