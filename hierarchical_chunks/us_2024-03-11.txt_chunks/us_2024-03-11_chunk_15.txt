Mr. CARTWRIGHT.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the Borough of White Haven, Pennsylvania, in honor of its bicentennial celebration.
The Borough of White Haven is situated on the eastern edge of Luzerne County and borders the beautiful Lehigh River at the entrance of the Pocono Mountains.
White Haven was founded as a settlement in 1824, making it the oldest established community in this area.
Incorporated as a Borough in 1842, White Haven was named after Josiah White, an enterprising citizen and builder of the old-fashioned ``bear trap'' locks that made the Lehigh River navigable.
The early settlers could not have predicted the immense importance of White Haven in Pennsylvania's--and the nation's--economic growth and industrialization efforts.
By the 1840s, anthracite coal mining was booming in the nearby Wyoming Valley and White Haven would become a central trade hub.
A railroad was built from the Wyoming Valley to White Haven, where the canal system allowed the coal to be carried to market on barges.
The Borough also boasted Pennsylvania's busiest lumber depots at the time, producing 20 million feet of lumber annually at its peak.
Today, White Haven is a quaint town featuring a main street with shops and restaurants and lovely tree-lined streets.
It also serves as a recreational hub with the Lehigh Gorge State Park on its border and the Delaware and Lehigh Anthracite Trail in its downtown.
With its picturesque views, charming architecture, and friendly residents, it is easy to see why so many choose to call White Haven home.
White Haven played a critical role in Pennsylvania's history and the industrialization of our nation.
Over the past two centuries, the Borough has demonstrated a commitment to persistence and progress, a trend which will no doubt continue and contribute to the prosperity of this treasured community for centuries to come.
