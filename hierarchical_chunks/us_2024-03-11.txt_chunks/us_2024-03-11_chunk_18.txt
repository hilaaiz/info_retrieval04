Mr. Nelson joined the Port of Grays Harbor in 2000, when there were only 21 vessel calls handling 85,000 tons of cargo.
When 
Mr. Nelson stepped into leadership, the Port of Grays Harbor, like many other communities in my district, had fallen on hard times when the timber industry took it on the chin.
Some folks feared that good things couldn't happen in Grays Harbor County anymore.
But not Gary.
Under his visionary leadership over the last 24 years, the number of vessel calls increased nearly 500 percent, and the number of metric tons of cargo was up over 3 million in 2023.
During his tenure at the Port of Grays Harbor, 
Mr. Nelson oversaw the diversification of the Port's revenue streams and business ventures.
This includes the operations at Satsop Business Park and recreational facilities at Friends Landing.
He oversaw more than $275 million in private investment throughout Port facilities, as weII as millions of dollars in federal and state grants to modernize and improve the Westport Marina, Marine Terminals in Aberdeen, and the Bowerman Airport, positioning the Port to accommodate current and future economic growth.
Gary's leadership will continue to impact the entire region for years to come.
Put simply, because of Gary Nelson, there are people in Grays Harbor who now have jobs.
Because of Gary Nelson, there are families that can now put food on the table.
Because of Gary Nelson, the future for our region is brighter.
Beyond his local impact, 
Mr. Nelson is a nationally recognized leader in the industry.
He served as the Chair of the American Association of Port Authorities from 2019 to 2020, chaired the Washington Public Ports Association Legislative Committee, and served on the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association Executive Board.
