Mr. Speaker, I applaud and thank Gary Nelson for his amazing tenure.
Gary's passionate and caring stewardship of the Port of Grays Harbor has impacted the future of the community and shown that not only can good things happen in Grays Harbor County--great things can.
I wish him the best in his retirement.
He will be sorely missed.
I am pleased to recognize 
Mr. Gary Nelson in the United States Congress.
