Mr. Bennett is known as a loving, giving person.
He and his fellow veterans are true heroes.
As members of the ``Greatest Generation'', they willingly served to protect and defend the freedoms that we enjoy today.
I am humbled to honor 
Mr. Glendell Bennett and celebrate his 100th birthday before the United States Congress.
