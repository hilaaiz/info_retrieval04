Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in recognizing and honoring the careers, service and legacies of State 
Senator David E. Lucas and Commissioner Elaine Huckabee Lucas.
To God be the glory for the things they have done in support of humanity.
