Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great American, Major Jerome Kern Chisolm.
Major Chisolm was born December 5, 1950, in Moncks Corner, South Carolina and passed away on January 17, 2024, in Pensacola, Florida.
Growing up he graduated from my alma mater Mather Academy in Camden, South Carolina where he excelled as a student leader and athlete.
Major Chisolm also graduated from South Carolina State University and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army.
When he retired from the Army, he became principal of an alternative high school for at risk students known as Escambia Charter School in Pensacola, Florida.
Major Chisolm was a principal, but he wore many hats, such as teacher, mentor, and coach.
He was a strict disciplinarian but was committed to being a positive role model with an emphasis on education.
In 2014, his school won the National USA Today Weekend Make A Difference Award.
The award was given for community service volunteering.
In addition, the Escambia Charter School Board named a building in his honor, The Jerome K. Chisolm Building.
Throughout his life, Jerome Chisolm has been a humanitarian in his community.
He and his wife Barbara have helped so many people improve their quality of life.
