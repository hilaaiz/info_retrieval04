Mr. BEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of The Arc Nassau's founding.
On this remarkable milestone, we commemorate five decades of service and their commitment to enhancing the lives of adults with intellectual and developmental differences in Northeast Florida.
The Arc Nassau's vision of education and motivation is realized through life skills training, vocational opportunities, and long-term employment.
These programs provide the individuals with a sense of belonging in their community.
As we celebrate The Arc Nassau's impressive tenure, let us look towards the future with a renewed commitment to their mission.
In this spirit, I am pleased to announce that The Arc Nassau and Northeast Florida Advocates for Autism and Related Disabilities have merged to strengthen their long-standing services to the community, Northeast Florida, let us follow The Arc Nassau's example, and see the able, not the label.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing The Arc Nassau.
Here's to another fifty years of impact, progress, and transformation.
