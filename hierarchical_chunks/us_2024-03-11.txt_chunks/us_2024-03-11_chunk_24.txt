Mr. LAWLER.
Mr. Speaker, today I'm proud to recognize a remarkable young constituent, Thomas Cong from Ossining, New York, for becoming a top 40 finalist in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the Nation's premier science competition for high school seniors.
This achievement places Thomas among the brightest young minds in our country, continuing a tradition of excellence that has propelled alumni to the highest echelons of scientific honor, including Nobel Prizes and National Medals.
Thomas's success is a testament to his hard work, our community's supportive educational environment, and the potential of our youth to lead us into a better future.
Let's celebrate Thomas's achievement as an inspiration and a reminder Nation proud.
