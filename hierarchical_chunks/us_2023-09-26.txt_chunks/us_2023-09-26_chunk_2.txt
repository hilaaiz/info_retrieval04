Ms. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service and accomplishments of Kanko Zonou, my congressional staffer who has consistently served my office and the people of Florida's 24th Congressional District.
Kanko has proven to be a very articulate young woman and shows great promise for her future endeavors.
Kanko has assisted my office in various areas, such as legislative research, constituent outreach, and team management.
She had demonstrated an excellent drive and a continuous willingness to learn.
Kanko Zonou was born in Lome, Togo and raised in the state of Georgia, She is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Georgia State University where she earned her Bachelor's degree in Political Science.
At Georgia State University, she served as Women's Rights chair for the NAACP, and she received the Nell Hamilton Trotter Student Leadership Award for her service.
During her junior year, she presented two research projects centered around economic issues at the Southern Political Science Association's 2022 annual conference.
Kanko is currently a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated.
Her experiences have empowered her to advocate for human rights, as well as social justice.
Upon transitioning from my office, Kanko will continue to work in legislation as she fights for justice.
On behalf of Florida's 24th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Kanko Zonou for her exemplary character, dedication to teamwork, and willingness to learn.
