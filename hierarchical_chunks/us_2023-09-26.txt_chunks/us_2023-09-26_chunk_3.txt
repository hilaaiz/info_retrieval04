Mr. BEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize my constituent, Ms. Vera Punke, for turning 108 years old last month.
Vera was born on August 29, 1915.
She celebrated her birthday with friends and family around, along with an abundance of Arlington dignitaries.
Vera has been a highly successful businesswoman, community organizer, co-founder of the Woman's Youth League of Rhode Island, Den Mother, Brownie and Girl Scout Leader, Mother, Grandmother, and Great Grandmother.
She has been an exemplary volunteer at The Jefferson community and remains as active, engaged, energetic, and decisive as ever.
Vera always remains available to anyone needing a helping hand, a shoulder to cry on, a sympathetic listener to anyone just wanting to talk, and an inspiration to anyone who knows her life's story.
She lives by her personal motto: ``If I have helped ease one ache or pain, I have not lived in vain.''
Arlington is honored to celebrate her accomplished life and this milestone birthday.
