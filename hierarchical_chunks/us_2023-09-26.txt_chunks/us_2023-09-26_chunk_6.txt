Mr. DesJARLAIS.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize a cultural staple in Middle Tennessee that has left an indelible mark on the history of the Volunteer State for over a century.
Each year, communities across Tennessee unite in celebration of the rich tradition Championship.
The annual National Buckdancing Championship has recently experienced a change of venue, with the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association now shouldering the responsibility of commemorating this time-honored tradition.
Through their production of the Thomas Maupin Festival, affectionately known as MaupinFest, in Unionville, Tennessee, the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association has played a pivotal role in preserving this significant piece of American cultural heritage.
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the Uncle Dave Macon Days Association, who diligently oversaw the National Buckdancing Championship annually since 1986 when Congress entrusted them with this duty, up until 2019.
Since its inception in 2019, the Tennessee OldTime Dance Association has organized MaupinFest and has continued to bestow the title of National Buckdancing Champion on behalf of Uncle Dave Macon Days.
In light of this transition in production, the Uncle Dave Macon Days Association has expressed their desire to transfer the responsibility for the National Buckdancing Championship permanently to the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association.
MaupinFest aims to pay tribute to 
Mr. Maupin's dance style, which stands as the quintessential representation of traditional Tennessee rhythmic flatfoot buckdancing, distinct from the more common clogging.
Mr, Maupin's old-time buckdancing style merits preservation as a cherished Tennessee treasure.
Therefore, I proudly announce that henceforth, the title of National Old-Time Buckdancing Champion will be conferred by the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association.
This ensures that this historical American art form receives the recognition it so rightfully deserves.
