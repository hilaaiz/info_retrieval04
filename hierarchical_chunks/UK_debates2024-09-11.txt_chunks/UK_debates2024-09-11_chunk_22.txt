I thank the right hon.
Lady for her question, and concur with her remarks.
The Government are clear that the performance of Avanti West Coast has not been good enough.
Many times in this Chamber, we have heard about the appalling service—too many cancellations and too many delays.
This Government have required Avanti West Coast to improve its performance on services, and I discussed this matter with the Transport Secretary last week.
Ministers and officials are holding regular performance reviews with Avanti West Coast and Network Rail to hold them to account, closely monitoring compliance with contractual obligations and driving improvements using the contractual mechanisms.
