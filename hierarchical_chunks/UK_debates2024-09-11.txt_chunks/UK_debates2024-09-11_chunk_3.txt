I thank my right hon.
Friend for her answer; I am delighted to see her in her place.
I am pleased to say that the development of the skills needed for such projects is well under way in Clwyd North.
Creating Enterprise in Rhyl works with local social housing providers to develop energy-efficient housing solutions, and has partnered with Rhyl College to train local people in renewable energy, green heating and solar technologies, giving them the key skills needed for the green energy sector, and us the local trained workforce that we need.
Does my right hon.
Friend agree that green energy offers huge growth and employment potential for areas such as Clwyd North, and will she join me on a visit to Creating Enterprise the next time she is back home in north Wales?
