This Government were elected on a manifesto that stressed a partnership approach with local authorities and an intention to stabilise the funding system, moving away from wasteful competition.
Those are the principles we will seek to apply as we think about the future of local growth funding.
As with all Government decisions regarding funding beyond March 2025, it is ultimately a matter for the spending review.
