I welcome my hon.
Friend to her place.
As she quite rightly says, transport plays an essential role in driving economic growth across Wales.
My right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State met the Transport Secretary last week to discuss rail connectivity, including the performance of Avanti.
As the Secretary of State has set out, the Government are clear that the performance of Avanti has not been good enough, with too many cancellations and delays.
So Ministers and officials are now holding regular performance reviews with Avanti and Network Rail, and monitoring Avanti West Coast compliance with its contractual obligations, with the aim of securing better services for her constituents.
