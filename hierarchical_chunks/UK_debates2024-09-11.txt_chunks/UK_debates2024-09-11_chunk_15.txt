Today the Government are expected to unveil details of their steel plan for south Wales.
From what has been briefed to the press, it seems that the new deal is, at its core, the same deal—worth hundreds of millions of pounds—that was agreed by the last Conservative Government.
At the time, the Secretary of State and the Welsh Labour party appeared to rubbish the deal, and suggested that a better one was possible.
Does she now regret the Labour party’s previous criticism of the deal?
I do not recognise that characterisation of the deal on which the Business Secretary will make a statement later.
He will make that statement to the House—I do not want to pre-empt it, because we are a party and a Government who will always come to the House first to make major announcements—but I am confident that he will set out a sustainable future for steelmaking in Port Talbot, in Wales and across the UK.
The fact remains that key parts of the deal, as it appears in the press, appear to be largely unchanged from what was agreed before, including almost £100 million to help steelworkers who might lose their jobs.
In its negotiations with the last Government, Tata Steel was crystal clear that no other deal was possible.
Moving forward, it is crucial that funding to help retrain those who will lose their jobs reaches them swiftly, so will the Secretary of State lay out the detail of how and when the money will be sent to those impacted?
I refer the hon.
Gentleman to my previous answer.
We had the transition board in place for nearly 10 months under the last Government and not a single penny went out the door to businesses or workers affected.
Within weeks of my taking over chairmanship of the transition board, £13.5 million has been released to help supply chain businesses and workers.
That is the first tranche, with further funds to come.
