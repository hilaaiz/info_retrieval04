I welcome my hon.
Friend to his seat.
I had the privilege of visiting the port of Milford Haven energy cluster in Pembrokeshire with him and the Deputy Prime Minister in August.
I really value the critical role that the port plays in securing the UK’s energy supply, and I am proud that the region is pioneering new green technologies.
We have established Great British Energy to drive investment in those technologies, which will deliver sustainable skilled jobs in Pembrokeshire and across Wales.
