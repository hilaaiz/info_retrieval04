Sadly, it seems that between the Welsh Government and Labour in government here in the UK, that service in north Wales is not a priority—we see that in the rate of on-the-day cancellations.
The truth is that the railways are broken, and Labour’s plan fails to address the chronic underfunding that is the cause, particularly in Wales.
In 2022, the Secretary of State—then shadow Secretary of State—said that it was “utterly illogical” to designate HS2 as an England and Wales project, and called on the Conservatives to “cough up” the billions owed to Wales.
Will she cough up now?
We cannot go back in time and change the way that project was commissioned, managed and classified by the previous Conservative Government.
They need to accept responsibility for the chaos, delay and waste on their watch.
What we can do, though, is work closely with our Senedd and local authority colleagues to develop and invest in transport projects that improve services for passengers right across Wales.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to help improve transport infrastructure in Wales.
I was pleased to meet with the Transport Secretary last week to discuss our approach to rail in Wales.
She is reviewing the previous Government’s transport infrastructure commitments and will report in the autumn.
We will deliver rail improvements that will make the services more accountable to the people who use them through the Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Bill, which completed its Commons stages last week, and Great British Railways, which was launched in shadow form earlier this month.
It is great to see my right hon.
Friend in her place.
Connections between my constituency of Wirral West and north Wales are many, they are deep, and they are valued on both sides of the border.
Sadly, though, our transport connections are lagging behind.
Could she please set out what conversations she is having with Ministers and stakeholders to improve those connections?
