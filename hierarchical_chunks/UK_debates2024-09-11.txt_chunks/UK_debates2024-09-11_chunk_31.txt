The Prime Minister was asked— If he will list his official engagements for Wednesday 11 September.
This weekend we remembered the late Queen and her enduring legacy of service and devotion to our country, and I was proud to announce a new national monument located at St James’s Park to honour her memory.
I know that the whole House will join me in sending our best wishes to the Princess of Wales as she completes her treatment.
This afternoon we will introduce the Renters’ Rights Bill.
After years of inaction, this Government will oversee the biggest levelling up of renters’ rights in a generation, and I urge the whole House to get behind it.
Later this week, I will visit Washington to meet President Biden for a strategic discussion on foreign policy.
