Mr. Reaser then enlisted in the United States Navy after attending one year of college.
He served for four years in the Navy, from Africa to Saudi Arabia, playing his trumpet for the Navy Band.
Upon Mr. Reaser's return from his service overseas, he landed two teaching jobs as band director for two different high schools, notably without a college degree--a testament to his skill and talent.
By 1968, 
Mr. Reaser earned his undergraduate degree from Morris Harvey College (now University of Charleston) in Charleston, West Virginia.
This same year, his former high school band director, Mr. Farley, who had been working at Andrew Lewis High School in Salem, VA, reached out to 
Mr. Reaser asking for him to apply to the Band Director job there.
After landing the job one year later, 
Mr. Reaser joined a team that would shape his career for the next 30 years.
With Mr. Reaser's directing style closely mirroring what he had learned from the United States Navy, the award-winning Andrew Lewis High Band was widely known for their student-led governance with emphasis on excellence and hard work.
When Andrew Lewis HS closed and its students were merged into Salem High School (Salem, VA), he became the band leader there.
