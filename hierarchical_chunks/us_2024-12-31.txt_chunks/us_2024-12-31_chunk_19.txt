Mrs. CARTER.
I rise today to honor three remarkable educators from the 18th Congressional District of Texas whose dedication and impact inspire students and strengthen our community.
From KIPP Texas-Houston who serve over 21,000 students, I would like to recognize: Caleb Thomas, a third-grade math teacher, engages students with hands-on activities and real-world connections, igniting a love for learning.
His teaching philosophy centers on creating an engaging and inclusive learning environment that ignites a passion for learning.
He prioritizes student engagement through a blend of hands-on activities, technology, and real-world connections, ensuring that learning is not only enjoyable but also impactful.
Dr. AiMee Morant the proud school leader at KIPP Mosaic Primary.
She leads through her strong belief in foundational literacy and numeracy and believes deeply that students must craft their own narrative through a rich understanding of themselves and their culture.
Dr. Khalilah Campbell-Rhone, Deputy Superintendent of Transformation, has transformed underperforming school into thriving educational hubs, leaving a lasting legacy.
She has also turned around campuses in Houston ISD including Sam Houston High School, Thomas Middle School, Worthing High School, and Wheatley High School.
These educators remind us that teaching is not just a profession, but a calling to shape future generations.
Their unwavering commitment to excellence deserves our gratitude and continued support.
I thank these educators for their tireless dedication to our children and communities.
