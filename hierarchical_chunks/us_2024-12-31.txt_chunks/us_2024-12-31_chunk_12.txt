Mr. Reaser was born on July 28, 1940, in Nitro, West Virginia.
His parents, Artie Lda Shomo and Marvin Dennis Reaser, Sr., raised him in St. Albans, West Virginia, with a very modest family lifestyle.
Music remained a necessity for the Reaser household, with piano lessons being a requirement for 
Mr. Reaser, his sister, Sally, and his brother, David.
During his tenure at St. Albans Jr. High, 
Mr. Reaser played in the High School Band, which was directed by Alan Farley.
Mr. Farley saw something remarkable about 
Mr. Reaser's musical ability and would not soon forget his four-year impact on the school.
