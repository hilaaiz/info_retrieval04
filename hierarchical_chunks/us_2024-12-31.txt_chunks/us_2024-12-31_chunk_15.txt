Mr. Reaser retired for good in 2015 and spent the remainder of his life composing and arranging music, playing in community bands and surrounding himself with his family and friends.
Mr. Reaser unfortunately was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in his final seven years, but always stayed ahead of his disease, averaging five to ten thousand steps per day instead of allowing the symptoms to overcome him.
While I was never a member of the Andrew Lewis High School marching band as a student there, I was proud to know 
Mr. Reaser and admired his work both with the marching band and all the other programs, particularly the annual Opus.
