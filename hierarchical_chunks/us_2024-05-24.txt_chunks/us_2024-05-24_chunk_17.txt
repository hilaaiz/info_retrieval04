During the past three years, the Defund the Police movement and anti-police policies have led to a surge in violent crime across the country.
In the U.S. House of Representatives, we recently celebrated National Police Week and honored America's law enforcement heroes by passing legislation to support our men and women in blue.
Some of the bills that I voted for to support our police officers include bills that would: Require ICE to detain illegal immigrants who are arrested, charged or convicted with assaulting a law enforcement officer or other first responder.
Make sure officers can protect themselves and others by allowing concealed weapon possession in more areas open to the public.
Direct the attorney general to report to Congress on how the border crisis affects law enforcement at various levels.
Make sure there is adequate data collection to address the rise of attacks on police officers.
While this year's police week might be over, I will continue to back policies that support America's law enforcement officers who risk their own lives to protect and serve citizens day after day.
