Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the solemn anniversary of George Floyd's untimely passing--a moment etched in history that shook our Nation to its core and reverberated across the globe, igniting a resounding call for justice.
As we reflect on this time, we cannot overlook the profound pain and anguish endured by George Floyd's loved ones and the countless individuals whose lives have been unjustly cut short by police violence.
Yet, within this sorrow lies hope--a hope fueled by a resilient movement that refuses to relent until systemic change is realized.
This movement, driven by tireless activists, organizers, and everyday citizens, rejects the status quo that devalues Black lives and perpetuates injustice.
As lawmakers, we bear a solemn responsibility to heed the impassioned cries for reform and to enact meaningful change.
That is why I implore my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House and Senate to swiftly pass the reintroduced George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
This crucial legislation transcends mere policy; it serves as a beacon of hope for a more just and equitable future, holding accountable those who betray the trust bestowed upon them and empowering law enforcement with the necessary tools to serve communities with fairness and integrity.
Currently, with over 18,000 police departments operating under varying standards, our Nation faces a disjointed approach to policing that breeds inconsistency and erodes public trust.
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act addresses this patchwork of pain, ushering in meaningful reforms to root out systemic racism and police brutality and prioritizing the sanctity of human life.
Though the passage of time may dull the immediacy of George Floyd's tragic death, the urgency for meaningful change remains undiminished.
Let us honor his memory not with fleeting tributes, but with unwavering commitment to enact reform and forge a society where every individual is treated with dignity and respect under the law.
