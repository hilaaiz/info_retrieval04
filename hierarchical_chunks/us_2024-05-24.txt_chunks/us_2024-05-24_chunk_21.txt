Our economy continues to suffer due to this administration's fiscal policies.
Inflation was at 1.4 percent when Biden took office and has risen nearly 20 percent since then.
High prices are forcing Americans to spend more than $12,000 more a year to afford the same basics compared to three years ago.
From my seats on the House Appropriations and Budget Committees, I am pushing to change how Washington works so that we can restore fiscal responsibility in our government, improve America's economic outlook and allow Western North Carolinians to keep more of their hard-earned dollars in their wallets.
