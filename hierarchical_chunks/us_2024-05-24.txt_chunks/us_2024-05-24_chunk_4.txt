Mr. Heymann's life reads like the All-American story.
Born on June 2, 1934, to Florence and Russel Heymann, Ron grew up in New Jersey where he attended Phillipsburg-Easton High and Rutgers University.
After graduating from Rutgers in 1956, Ron served his country in the Army Reserves in El Paso, Texas and at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
On June 22, 1959, Ron married his sweetheart, Barbara.
They will soon celebrate their 65th wedding anniversary.
Ron and Barbara are blessed with two children, Carol and Ron Jr., and a daughter-in-law Raegan.
After his service to our country, 
Mr. Heymann spent most of his career working for Bell Telephone.
He left the telecommunications world for a stint in politics, working for Governor William Cahill of New Jersey, as the Director of Motor Vehicles, and as a consultant to President Richard Nixon's administration.
Ron often says he did such a good job eliminating bureaucracy at the New Jersey DMV, the Heymann cars never passed another vehicle inspection until the family moved to the free state of Florida upon Ron's retirement in 1991, taking up full time residence on Amelia Island.
Since that time, Ron has been very active in the Fernandina Beach community.
He worked as a docent at the Amelia Island Museum of History, directed traffic at the Presbyterian Vacation Bible School, and is an avid supporter of local charities.
Of course, he has also spent hours shuttling his three grandchildren Megan, Kate, and Jack around the Island.
On behalf of the Fourth Congressional District of Florida, I thank him for his support to the community, his leadership in the Republican Party, and his dedication to his family.
