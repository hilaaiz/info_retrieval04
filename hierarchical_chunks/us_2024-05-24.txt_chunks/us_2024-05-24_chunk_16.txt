President Biden released a framework to evaluate the establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which can be used as a surveillance tool and weaponized against the American people.
In China, the Communist Party has been using a CBDC to track the spending habits of its citizens and we cannot allow this level of financial surveillance in America.
That's why I cast NC-11's vote for the CBDC AntiSurveillance State Act.
This bill protects Americans' right to financial privacy by halting unelected bureaucrats from issuing a CBDC and is the first anti-central bank digital currency legislative effort ever introduced in Congress.
