Mark your calendars for Thursday, June 20 to join my next in-person town hall in Graham County.
The town hall will take place from 6:00-7:30 p.m. at the Graham County Courthouse, 12 N. Main St., Robbinsville, NC.
I'm looking forward to sharing an update about legislative priorities in Congress and answering questions about the issues that matter to you.
With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member.
