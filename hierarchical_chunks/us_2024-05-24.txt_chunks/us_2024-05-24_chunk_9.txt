Crypto is the currency of choice for our foreign adversaries, terrorist groups, drug and human traffickers, child sex abusers, and ransomware attackers.
These bad actors chose to use crypto because they know the industry does comply with securities laws and regulations, allowing the groups to circumvent regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement regimes.
Congress should be considering legislation that will make it harder for these bad actors to access currency, not allowing loopholes to persist.
We must ensure to be sure that crypto is not used as the black market for bad actors.
Crypto asset platforms, where customers buy and sell crypto assets, are known to use vertical product and service integration, creating conflicts of interests for the platforms.
Some crypto asset platforms blend exchange, brokerage, market making, and clearing agency functions in their platform.
This vertical integration of products and services has long been prohibited in traditional markets because it leads to risks for investors.
We saw this loophole exploited in 2022 when FTX's CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, used its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research, as a market maker, allowing FTX to transfer billions of dollars in customer accounts to Alameda.
Sam Bankman-Fried is now serving a 25-year prison sentence for defrauding consumers.
H.R. 4763 bakes in these existing conflicts of interest, allowing crypto asset platforms like FTX to continue to work against their customers' best interest for their own gains.
Rather than putting forward a bill that would severely undermine the functioning of our capital markets, Congress should instead consider a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto that will promote the responsible development of these digital assets while protecting American consumers and investors.
I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 4763.
