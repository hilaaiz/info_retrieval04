One of the most important duties and greatest honors of representing the 11th district of North Carolina is selecting nominees among those who are seeking appointments to our nation's military service academies.
I had the great pleasure and excitement of hosting an event to celebrate the following students whose exceptional leadership, hard work and patriotism made them stand out from a competitive pool of applicants and were accepted into their respective service academies.
Cedric Gordon, alumnus of Asheville High School: U.S. Air Force Academy William ``Liam'' Lawing, student at Nesbitt Discovery Academy: U.S. Air Force Academy Joshua Morgan, alumnus of Asheville Christian Academy: U.S. Air Force Academy Michael Puzerewski, student at Holy Innocence Academy: U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Anita Zavyalova, student at A.C. Reynolds High School: U.S. Naval Academy
These students represent the best of America, and I want to extend my congratulations once again for this life-changing achievement.
