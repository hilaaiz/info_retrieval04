Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4763, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.
While I am opposed to this bill, I am not opposed to the concept of crypto itself.
But I have concerns about how crypto is currently regulated and believe that H.R. 4763 falls short of creating an effective regulatory framework.
H.R. 4763 would also result in the massive deregulation of the securities market, not just for crypto but for traditional securities as well.
This deregulation would remove protections provided by existing securities law to protect crypto investors and consumers and remove disclosure requirements that are designed to help investors make informed decisions.
Additionally.
H.R. 4763 would preempt state laws, disarming state regulators in Minnesota who are often on the frontlines against fraud.
H.R. 4763 lacks necessary protections for crypto consumers and investors.
As of today, the crypto asset industry does not comply with existing securities laws and regulations, allowing consumers to be defrauded.
In fact, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) received more than 8,300 complaints related to crypto between 20182022.
Roughly forty percent of those complaints were reporting frauds and scams.
This bill will only exacerbate this issue.
We must reject H.R. 4763 and work to create a regulatory framework that will protect everyday investors and consumers.
