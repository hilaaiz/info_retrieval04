Dear Friend, It's been more than a year since the House passed H.R. 2.
the Secure the Border Act, the strongest border security bill in history.
H.R. 2 would reimplement President Trump's effective border policies and end this administration's border crisis, which continues to jeopardize our national security and sovereignty.
In fact, a record-breaking number of nationals from our adversary, China, are illegally crossing our border.
In April, the Customs and Border Patrol found that in this fiscal year alone, they have encountered 27,583 Chinese nationals, a nearly 8,000 percent increase from fiscal year 2021.
With the rising threat of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), border security is paramount to national security and I will not relent in the fight to secure America's borders.
I recently spoke on the House floor about how the fentanyl pouring in through our borders has taken lives in our own communities in the mountains and urged that this administration put the American people first and close our southern border once and for all.
