Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the citizens of Washington's Fifth Congressional District, I extend my deepest gratitude to Keirsten Lyons for her extraordinary devotion.
May her work continue to remind us that the legacy of a hero does not end on the battlefield--it lives on in the stories we tell, the memories we preserve, and the gratitude we hold.
