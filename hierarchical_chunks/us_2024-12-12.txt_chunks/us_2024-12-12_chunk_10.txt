Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Janet Williams on her retirement as Mayor of the City.
Janet was born and raised on a dairy farm in Savage, Minnesota.
She attended Burnsville High School, where she graduated as the valedictorian.
After completing her undergraduate degree at the College.
Teresa in Winona, Minnesota, she came back home to Savage.
For 30 years, Janet served as Scott County's Library Director.
In this role, she was responsible for running all Scott County libraries while supporting library expansion projects.
In 2004, Janet was elected as a Savage Councilmember and just four years later, Janet became the first woman Mayor.
She has held this office for over 17 years.
As Mayor, Janet pushed for investments in mental health programs, including those offered to first responders.
She founded the Dan Patch Historical Society and championed various local projects, including key redevelopment projects and infrastructure improvements.
Under her leadership, she also promoted the importance of partnering on key initiatives with nearby community leaders and partners.
I'm proud to have worked with Janet since I first came to Congress in 2019.
Her commitment to the community of Savage is unparalleled and I have greatly appreciated her partnership and guidance, especially with concern to local priorities.
I thank Janet for her years of service to our community.
