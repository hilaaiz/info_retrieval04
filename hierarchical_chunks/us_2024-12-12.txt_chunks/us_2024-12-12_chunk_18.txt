Mrs. RODGERS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Keirsten Lyons, Director of the Washington State Fallen Heroes Project, a woman whose life's mission exemplifies the enduring power of love and remembrance.
Her dedication to her son's memory and to the families of our Nation's Fallen Heroes is a profound testament to the enduring sacrifices made in defense of our freedoms.
Keirsten's journey is one of love, resilience, and a mother's unyielding commitment to ensure her son's sacrifice is never forgotten.
On January 1, 2014, her beloved son, Marine Sergeant Jacob Michael Hess, gave his life during a deployment to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
Sgt.
Hess was a dedicated Marine, a cherished husband, son, brother, and friend who embodied the highest ideals of service and honor.
Though her loss is unimaginable, Keirsten has transformed her grief into a powerful force for good, ensuring that the legacy of her son and so many others lives on.
As the Director of the Washington State Fallen Heroes Project, Keirsten has committed herself to a sacred mission, to honor those who raised their hand to serve and made the ultimate sacrifice, to support the families who carry the weight of their loss, and to engage communities in never forgetting the price of freedom.
Her work serves as a rallying call to all of us, reminding us that the freedoms we hold dear were secured through unimaginable sacrifices.
Under Keirsten's leadership, the Project has expanded its reach and impact.
Events such as the March for the Fallen, Ruck, Run, or Walk have created spaces for families and communities to come together in shared remembrance.
For Keirsten, these gatherings are deeply personal.
By sharing their stories, families transform grief into connection, ensuring their loved ones remain alive in the hearts of those who learn their stories.
Through initiatives like the Illuminating Courage Memorial and the Heroes Garden, Keirsten has built a legacy of remembrance in the Eastern Washington community that will endure for generations.
Her tireless efforts have provided comfort and healing to Gold Star families, creating a community where grief is shared, and the sacrifices of the Fallen are eternally honored.
She reminds us that behind every Fallen Hero is a family who has borne the cost of freedom.
