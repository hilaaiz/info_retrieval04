Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I was unable to be present in the chamber on Wednesday, December 11, 2024, due to a family medical emergency.
Unfortunately, the final version of the FY2025 NDAA includes a misguided provision preventing the dependents of service members from receiving the medical treatment they need and deserve.
Further, the bill callously stripped provisions that would have given more service members and their partners the ability to start a family through IVF.
However, as the Ranking Member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, I fight every day to improve the quality of life of our service members and their families and on balance, this bill does that.
Among many meaningful investments, it includes a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted and a 4.5 percent pay raise for all other service members while eliminating contraceptive copayments for TRICARE beneficiaries.
I will continue to fight for all service members and their families to receive the benefits and care they deserve.
Had I been present, I would have voted YEA on Roll Call
No. 499 and YEA on Roll Call No. 500.
