Representative Cori Bush is and will continue to be a fearless voice for justice and equity.
Her advocacy for working families, Black and brown people, the LGBTQ+ community, and all marginalized groups has made a lasting impact on her constituents not only on her district but our Nation.
Her commitment to her values has shaped the direction of this Congress and inspired others to join the movement for change.
I thank her for her incredible service and leadership, and I wish her well in this next chapter.
