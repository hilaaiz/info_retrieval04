Mr. ADERHOLT.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recognize the incrredible legacy of my colleague, and friend, Congresswoman Kay Granger.
I have had the pleasure of working alongside many dedicated public servants, but few have shown the consistent leadership, integrity, and commitment to their constituents that Kay has demonstrated over her incredible career in public office.
She has represented the Twelfth Congressional District of Texas with unwavering dedication in her nearly three decades in Congress.
From being the first woman elected to represent Texas' Twelfth District, to her trailblazing work as the first woman to chair the House Appropriations Committee, Kay has always set new standards of excellence in her time in Washington.
I not only serve with her as a fellow member of the Appropriations Committee, but I also had the privilege of being elected in the same class as Kay.
During that time, I have witnessed the skill and dedication Kay displays first-hand.
A staunch supporter of our Nation's military, a champion for infrastructure, and a force behind national security efforts, her goal has always been to advance the interests of the American people.
Kay's legacy will go far beyond the legislation.
Her mentorship of countless members of this body will outlast even her biggest legislative accomplishments.
Through her deep understanding of the issues, and willingness to work with both sides of the aisle, she will be remembered for putting service to the American people before partisanship.
