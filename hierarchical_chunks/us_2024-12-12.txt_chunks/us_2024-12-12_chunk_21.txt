Mr. HILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary Arkansan, my friend, Jim Shenep.
It is unbelievable that three decades after we started working together, it is time for him to retire.
I want to say how thankful I am for our three decades of friendship, and Martha and I treasure our relationship with him and his family.
It has been such a privilege to watch his continued success, starting when we were at First Commercial, then Regions, then Delta Trust, and now at Simmons.
He has always put his customers first, and that was at the heart of what we tried to build at Delta Trust, and I know it is at the heart of Simmons Trust Company.
I wish him well in his retirement and I wish I could be there with him in person to celebrate, but I wanted to thank him for his dedication to his customers and our friendship.
