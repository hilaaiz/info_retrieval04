Ms. Gomez has maintained her roots in Fresno County and is a member of the Fresno State School of Engineering Advisory Council, Vice Chair of the Fresno State Alumni Association, and Board Member for the Fresno State Transportation Institute.
Her other professional affiliations include serving on the Board of Directors for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and she is a member of Women in Transportation (WTS) and founder of the WTS Central Valley Chapter.
I call on my colleagues to join me in celebrating the exceptional career and lifetime achievements of Diana Gomez, and to congratulate her on her well-deserved retirement.
