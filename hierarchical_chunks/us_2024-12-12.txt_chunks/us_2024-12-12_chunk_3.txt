Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the outstanding interns who have dedicated their time and talents to serving the 20th District of California this fall.
These bright and committed young people, working from both our Washington, D.C., and Clovis, California offices, have brought fresh perspectives, unwavering enthusiasm, and a shared passion for making a difference.
At a time when many young people are questioning the role of public service, their dedication inspires confidence in the leaders of tomorrow.
As their fall internships come to a close, I want to express my deepest gratitude to Grace Lee Delgado, Elijah Lidgett, and Tristan Wertanzl for their contributions to our Washington, D.C., office and to Jake Dowell for his service in our Clovis, California office.
Their hard work has been instrumental to our efforts, and I trust that the skills and educational experiences they have gained will guide them toward continued success in their future endeavors in public service.
