projects, expanded health care opportunities and much more.
With the formation of SOAR, Bill Estep showed up once again with his iconic yellow notepad and a recorder to get the story right.
From day one, he made sure there was an entire section in the Herald Leader featuring the work of SOAR, and he has remained committed to following our progress, our goals and our challenges.
Throughout his career, it has been clear when Bill used his opinion in an effective way, advocating for a larger spread in the urban Lexington-based statewide newspaper to help feature stories in Eastern Kentucky that the rest of the state should care about.
I imagine that he didn't win every battle with his editors over the years, but I know that Bill believed in the value of southern and eastern Kentucky for the rest of the Commonwealth.
He was bold to ask tough questions, patient enough to listen to the response, and determined to conduct necessary research before writing a story.
Upcoming and current reporters should take notes from Bill, and proceed with unbiased questions, an open mind, and a relentless dedication to facts over opinions and click-bait.
Our rural Appalachian region has largely remained in the shadows of Kentucky's bigger cities, playing the national media's role of the impoverished, forgotten people who need a savior.
Thanks to courageous journalists like Bill, we have had the opportunity to fight the stereotypes and tell the real story taking place in Eastern Kentucky, where resilient and innovative people are stepping up to shape a brighter future for the next generation through aerospace, medical science, engineering and much more.
As Bill begins a new chapter of retirement to focus on his family's story and new traveling adventures, I hope it is filled with great pride in the work he has accomplished and the light of hope that he has helped shine on Eastern Kentucky.
