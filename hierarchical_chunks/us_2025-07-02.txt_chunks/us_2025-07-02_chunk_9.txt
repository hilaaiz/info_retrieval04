Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to recognize Cheyenne Peckne, a 911 operator whose instructions helped coach a wife to give CPR to her husband who had suffered a heart attack.
An often-overlooked role in the first responder community is that of our 911 operators.
While not as visible as other first responders, they are the first line of contact and convene the proper authorities during an emergency.
They receive calls from distressed individuals and have to act fast with limited information.
Cheyenne is an 18-year-old from York, PA, who started her role as a 911 operator only a few weeks ago.
On May 8, 2025, the Red Lion Area Ambulance Association and Laurel Fire Company received a call for a health emergency.
Cheyenne picked up the call, and on the other end, a woman whose husband had suffered a cardiac arrest.
Over the next few minutes, Cheyenne comforted the women and assured her that help was on the way.
Cheyenne then began to instruct the women on how to give CPR to her husband.
This would continue until first responders were able to reach the home and transport the man to the hospital.
While this interaction only took a few minutes, it was crucial to saving the man's life.
In a reception a few weeks after the incident, Cheyenne had the opportunity to meet the family and be recognized for her actions.
She stated, ``The wife did an amazing job... she is the one who saved her husband.''
I thank Cheyenne for her remarkable work and commitment to serving the public in this role.
We can take comfort in knowing that she will continue to help members of our community in times of crisis.
