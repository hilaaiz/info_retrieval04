Mr. Speaker, 
Mr. Ray Fletcher's contributions to his country and community reflect the very best of American values.
I am proud to represent such a distinguished citizen in the 26th Congressional District.
On behalf of a grateful community, I thank him for his selfless service and wish him continued happiness in his wellearned retirement.
