Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sheriff's Office and Emergency Medical Services.
On September 27, 2024, Hurricane Helene slammed into Western North Carolina, leaving a trail of devastation and destruction.
While Clay County was largely spared from the storm's most severe effects, its first responders did not return to business as usual the following day.
Instead, the Clay County Sheriff's Office and Emergency Medical Services immediately sprang into action to assist counties in desperate need.
This spirit of service is what makes Western North Carolina truly special.
It is exemplified by neighbors showing up in times of crisis, ready to lend a helping hand and stand together during the darkest of days.
The Clay County Sheriff's Office deployed officers and resources to Haywood, Buncombe, Avery, and Mitchell counties, providing critical manpower and support to these Helene-affected areas.
At the same time, Clay County Emergency Medical Services coordinated efforts to deliver much-needed medical personnel and essential supplies to communities in need.
