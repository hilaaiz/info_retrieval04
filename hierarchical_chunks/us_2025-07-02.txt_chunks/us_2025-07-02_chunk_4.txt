Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Des Plaines Theatre, a cherished landmark in the heart of Illinois' arts community.
For a century, the Des Plaines Theatre has brought people together through performance, film, and culture, serving as a vital space for artistic expression and civic engagement.
Since its opening on August 9, 1925, the theatre has hosted hundreds of performances, welcomed countless community events, and stood as a gathering place for generations.
Over the years, it has transformed from a vaudeville stage to a movie house and now a fully restored performing arts center.
It has endured a fire, undergone multiple renovations, and has emerged stronger each time, continuing to inspire new audiences.
I am proud to congratulate the Des Plaines Theatre on its 100 years unite communities, celebrate local history, and enrich lives.
I look forward to its continued contributions for many years to come.
