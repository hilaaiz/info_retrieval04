The Clay County Sheriff's Office and Emergency Medical Services were flooded with donated supplies from area churches, local businesses, and citizens.
Once transported to the affected areas, these supplies were received by first responders with great relief and deep appreciation.
Let it be recognized and remembered that, in a time of great need, Clay County stood tall--not only for its own residents, but for its neighbors across the region.
