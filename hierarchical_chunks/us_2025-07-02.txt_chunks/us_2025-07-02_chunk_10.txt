Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Mr. Charles Jameson of Culpeper County, Virginia--a veteran, educator, historian, and lifelong servant to our community.
Although his education, military service and extensive career took him all over, 
Mr. Jameson, has remained a lifelong resident of Culpeper and still lives across the street from his childhood home.
He began his journey at George Washington Carver Regional High School, where he and many other African American students from Culpeper, Orange, Madison, and Rappahannock counties were educated during segregation.
He went on to attend Virginia Union University before transferring to Virginia Commonwealth University, where he earned his degree in 1970 in pursuit of his lifelong dream of becoming a teacher.
However, before he could begin his teaching career, 
Mr. Jameson was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to Vietnam, where he served with honor and distinction.
He received advanced artillery training and was awarded for his courage and three Bronze Star Medals, a Purple Heart, and two Army Commendation Medals.
Before returning home, he joined his father, Saint Jameson, in the construction business.
When his father retired, Charles took over his role, eventually rising to the position of Project Superintendent and later construction manager.
After nearly four decades in the field, he retired in 2010.
In retirement, 
Mr. Jameson redirected his time and energy into meaningful community service, becoming a driving force behind numerous local initiatives.
He worked closely with fellow Carver High School alumni on scholarship programs, served on the boards of the Carver 4County Museum and the Museum of Culpeper History, and played an active role in organizations such as the Carver Agriculture Research Board, the Culpeper Minutemen, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW).
He also holds a leadership position in the local chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, where he helps organize Culpeper's annual July 4th Patriotic Presentation--an event that honors the region's rich historical legacy.
His extensive service and leadership have earned him numerous accolades, including the Culpeper Colonel Award, the MLK Dreamkeeper Award, Aging Together's 5 Over 50 Award, the NAACP Activism Award, and the Neighborhood Watch Amazing Citizen Award.
I want to personally thank 
Mr. Jameson for his lifelong dedication to service, education, and the preservation of our shared history.
Today, he continues that legacy by focusing on his extensive research into African American participation in the Revolutionary War.
