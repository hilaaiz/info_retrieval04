moral integrity.
The Order's motto, ``Dieu et les Dames,'' meaning God and the Ladies, reflects its core values.
For over 150 years, its members have committed themselves to cultivating character and serving their communities with distinction.
Today, KA's across the country continue to make a meaningful impact through ongoing charitable work, campus leadership, and a lifelong commitment to honor and duty.
The Order's presence in our local community is a point of pride, and I applaud their continued contributions to the betterment of our society.
