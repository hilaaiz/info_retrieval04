Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District in honoring the life and legacy of 
Mr. Willie James Watkins, in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends and all who mourn his loss.
Moreover, I pray that we will all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead.
