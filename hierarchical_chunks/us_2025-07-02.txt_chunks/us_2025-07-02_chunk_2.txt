Mr. WILSON.
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize Watchmen Broadcasting on 30 years of ministry.
In 1995, Dorothy and Russell Spaulding felt a calling to begin a Christian television station in Augusta, Georgia.
Now, 30 years later they have transformed the ministry from broadcasting locally with 1,000 watts of power to internationally with 150,000 watts of power, increasing potential viewership.
It is through faith that the Spaulding family and Watchmen Broadcasting have helped tens of thousands of people reach Salvation and have prevented more than 8,000 suicides.
Without the generosity of ministries like Perry Stone, Channel 55 in Orlando, and local Networks, Watchmen Broadcasting would not be the meaningful success it is today.
The Spauldings are a true testament to faith; starting with less than one hundred dollars and a hotel room as an office, Dorothy and Russell have touched the lives of many.
Their ministry continues to represent that God uses small beginnings for big impact.
Best wishes and prayers for their continued success in faith and ministry as they continue to influence lives and follow the plan God has for them.
