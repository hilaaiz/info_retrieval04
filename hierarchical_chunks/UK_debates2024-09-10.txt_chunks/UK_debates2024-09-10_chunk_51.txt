The Secretary of State spent the last Sunday of the election campaign in Prestwick, near our town’s world war two Polish war memorial.
Within days, he was in Odesa and has stepped up and sped up the support that the UK is delivering.
Does he agree that we have started as we mean to go on and that this Government will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes?
Yes, I do.
It is a real pleasure to see my hon.
Friend in his place.
He brings expertise from a very wide field of foreign-policy affairs.
I know that he will make a big contribution to this House, and if I made a small contribution to his election campaign, then I am doubly pleased to see him.
