The Secretary of State spoke of Russian artillery outfiring Ukraine by 3:1, and he knows the crucial importance of industrial output.
That being so, does he recognise that we must urgently fire up production across our own defence sector by committing to 2.5% as soon as possible?
Finally, one lesson from Ukraine is the vital importance of maintaining air superiority in battle.
In relation to our future combat air capability, I asked the Secretary of State a set of written questions on  29 July  on the sixth-generation global combat air programme spending, and he has to date answered only the questions on historical spend, not those on the current financial year.
Will he therefore confirm whether his Department will be deferring any spending on GCAP planned for the current financial year?
