I thank the Secretary of State for her answer.
My constituency of Wrexham is home to one of the UK’s largest prisons.
It is well known that if an offender has fixed and secure accommodation to go to, they are less likely to reoffend.
What steps is she taking to ensure that those released today under SDS40 will have accommodation on release, including in Wrexham?
