I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his comments and for his welcome to me.
I note the points that he makes.
On the point about my not announcing anything new, I just say to him that I did so on Friday last week.
This is my first opportunity to update the House on the announcements of extra aid not just last week, but in the weeks over the summer recess—and, indeed, the package in our first week in office.
This is the fourth sitting week since the election, and I hope that he will be reassured by my personal undertaking to ensure that I update the House on developments in Ukraine on a regular basis.
