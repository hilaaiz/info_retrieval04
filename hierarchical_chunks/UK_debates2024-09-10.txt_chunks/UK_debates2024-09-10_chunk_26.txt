I am meeting the women imminently to discuss this further, and the Government have committed to a thorough sentencing review.
What recent assessment she has made of the adequacy of the time taken for cases to progress through the criminal justice system.
What steps she is taking to help reduce the time taken for criminal cases to be heard at court.
We are committed to ensuring the swift delivery of justice for victims at all stages of the criminal justice system, and we are working closely with various partners involved to achieve that aim.
In relation to the courts, we plan to sit more than 105,000 working days in the Crown court this financial year, and we continue to hear criminal cases at Nightingale courts.
We are also considering other measures to speed up justice for victims, and we will make further announcements in due course.
