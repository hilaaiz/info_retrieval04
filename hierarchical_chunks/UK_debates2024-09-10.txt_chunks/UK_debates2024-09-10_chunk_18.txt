I thank my hon.
Friend for that important question.
Video links are available in all courts to help vulnerable and intimidated witnesses give evidence.
We have recently invested £50,000 to transform witness facilities and upgrade video link rooms in 10 Crown courts.
Pre-recorded evidence is also available in all Crown courts for eligible victims to spare them the trauma of giving evidence at a live trial.
