On UK leadership, I have set out to the House my determination to maintain that leadership in the support for Ukraine, and demonstrated how we stepped that up in the first week, in the weeks that followed and last week at Ramstein.
In terms of the lessons for drones, their deployment and our work with Ukraine, we are learning those lessons.
We need to speed that up.
Given  the hon.
Gentleman’s previous job, he will be well aware of the implications for the way in which we procure and contract for capabilities, both for export and for our stockpiles.
On stockpiles, we have—as he will also know—so far spent £1 billion in the UK on replenishment.
We have plans to build that, because we need to boost not just production, but the productive capacity of UK industry, so that we are capable of demonstrating that it can be scaled up in the face of future threats in a way that is not apparent at present.
The hon.
Gentleman asks about long-range missiles.
I have to say that only Putin benefits from an open debate about those sensitive issues, and I will not comment on operational discussions.
There has been no change in the UK’s position.
We continue to provide military aid to Ukraine, as I have set out, to support its clear right to self-defence and in line with the operation of international humanitarian law.
On the question of 2.5%, we will increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP.
The last time the UK spent 2.5% of GDP on defence was in 2010, when I last stood at this Dispatch Box as part of the previous Labour Government.
In 2010, the Conservatives cut defence spending: they never matched 2.5% in any of their 14 years in office.
My priority will always be to ensure that this country is well defended.
In the face of growing threats, we will do more to make Britain secure at home and strong abroad.
