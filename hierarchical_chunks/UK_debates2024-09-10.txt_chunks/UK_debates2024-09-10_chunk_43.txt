I have said that Ukraine is my first-order priority, and I was in Odessa on my second day in the job.
I have now had the privilege of meeting President Zelensky four times while in post, and I have met his Defence Minister six times.
Like the previous Government, we consistently try to respond to the needs that Ukraine says it has for systems and ammunition.
At the moment, above all, it needs new supplies of ammunition and stronger air defence systems capable of taking down Russian missiles and drones at different distances.
While the US made a commitment at Ramstein last week to an extra $250 million in air defence systems, we made a commitment of an extra £160 million through a short-range modern air defence system—650 LMMs, with production under way—the first of which will be delivered to Ukraine before the end of the year.
We are stepping up the support that we pledged for Ukraine and speeding up the support that we deliver to Ukraine.
