Many will be watching with horror the extraordinarily disturbing case unfolding in France, in which drugs were allegedly used to facilitate the abuse of a woman by her husband and over 70 men.
Like many across the House, I have received communication from victims of spiking in my town of Weston-super-Mare.
They and I are keen to know what steps the Minister is taking to crack down on the devastating crime of spiking here in the UK.
The case in France is truly shocking, and we have all looked on in horror as the details have unfolded.
I commend the victim for her bravery in coming forward and making it public so that we can see the full aspects of the trial.
Spiking is a despicable crime.
We have committed to introduce a new criminal offence of spiking and we are considering how best to implement it.
To be clear, in England and Wales, having sex with a person who cannot consent is rape, and spiking with intent to engage in sexual activity is a specific offence, with a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
Ten years ago, Jack and Paul Sykes, aged 12 and nine respectively, tragically lost their lives at the hands of their abusive father, who set their house on fire.
Their mother, my constituent Claire Throssell, is a powerful campaigner against presumptive contact—a legal principle that allowed a known domestic abuser to access Jack and Paul.
Will the Minister meet Claire and me to discuss how we can properly protect children from domestic abuse in our family court system?
