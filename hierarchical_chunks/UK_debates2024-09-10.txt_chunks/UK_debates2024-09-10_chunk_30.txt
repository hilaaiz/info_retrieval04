I am grateful to the Secretary of State for her previous answers on substantive questions about accommodation for prisoners released early.
Further to that, have the Government contracted any specific hotels for potential use by early release prisoners?
I have authorised probation directors in areas to make appropriate provision, if that proves to be needed—at this point, it is not definite that it will be required—to ensure that there is no gap in provision for offenders being released under the SDS40 scheme.
I think the Secretary of State said that none has been contracted at this time.
If they are at any point, further to the point made by  the hon.
Member for Reading West and Mid Berkshire (Olivia Bailey) , will she be open and transparent with the House, local authorities and the public about how many, at what point and, in broad terms, where they will be located?
Yes, I will.
