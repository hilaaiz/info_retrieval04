I thank the hon.
Gentleman for his support, his tone and his commitment to continuing to back further military aid to Ukraine, including the £160 million contract for lightweight multi-role missiles that I announced last week.
He talked about the “mass sacrifice” of Russian personnel, and he is right.
President Putin is a leader who shows contempt for the lives of his own soldiers.
