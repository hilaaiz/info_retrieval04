I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the awful state our criminal justice system was left in by the previous Government.
We are committed to ensuring swift delivery of justice for victims at all stages of the criminal justice system, and we are working closely with various partners to achieve that aim.
We know that due to the complexity of their cases, rape victims often wait disproportionately long periods for their trial compared with victims of other offence types.
Reducing waiting times for victims is a priority for me and this Government, which is why we have committed to fast-tracking rape cases through the justice system.
I recently saw at first hand at Bristol Crown court how that can be done, and how our judges are working tirelessly to make it happen.
