I welcome the Defence Secretary’s statement, especially what he said about the deepening military and industrial strategy between the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
There is clearly a growing alliance building between Russia and Iran, united in undermining democracy and risking further proxy wars.
Will the Defence Secretary give his assessment on how the UK Government seek to influence Iran?
