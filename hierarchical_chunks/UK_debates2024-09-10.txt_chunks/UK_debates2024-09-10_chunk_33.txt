The Secretary of State has said that she will review her prisoner early release scheme after 18 months, but will she go further and commit to ending it then, and if not, to returning to this House for a fresh vote on it?
I have committed to the review, because that is the appropriate way, and I will not make early promises that might not be kept.
I have committed to both transparency and a review.
We will publish all the data on a quarterly basis and I will return to the House with the results of the review and the approach that we will take at that point.
