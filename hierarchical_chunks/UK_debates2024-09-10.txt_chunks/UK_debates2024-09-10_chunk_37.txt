With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on Ukraine, but may I first reflect on last week’s dreadful news of the death of Royal Naval pilot Lieutenant Rhodri Leyshon?
On behalf of this House, I pay tribute to him.
He was a consummate professional to his colleagues and was dearly loved by his family.
He will be sorely missed by so many, and the thoughts of this House are with them today.
