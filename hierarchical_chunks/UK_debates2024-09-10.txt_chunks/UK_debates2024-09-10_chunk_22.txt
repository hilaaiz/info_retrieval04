I welcome the question from my hon.

He will know that His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service keeps the court estate under regular review to ensure that it meets operational requirements.
I am afraid there are currently no plans to reopen Hartlepool magistrates court, but I would be happy to meet my hon.
Friend alongside officials from HMCTS to discuss his concerns.
The reasons behind the increased caseload in our criminal courts are complex and multifaceted, but the number of courtrooms available is not the main constraint we currently face.
