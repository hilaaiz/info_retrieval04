I thank my hon.
Friend for that question.
I recognise the vital work that Survive in York does to support victims and survivors in her area.
I fully appreciate the importance of notifying police and crime commissioners and providers about future funding as early as possible to effectively commission, plan and deliver those services.
As I have indicated, it would be wrong of me to pre-empt the current spending review.
We know that current providers are concerned about the cliff edge in March 2025.
I fully appreciate that and I would be delighted to meet her to discuss that further.
