I thank the hon.
Member for his question.
He will know that this Government have a mission to tackle violence against women and girls.
As I have said, that vision pulls together Departments across Whitehall, including the Department for Education—I recently had a meeting with an Education Minister to discuss exactly that issue.
I have been clear that sex with anyone who cannot consent is a crime, and we are working across Government to tackle it.
