I thank the right hon.
Gentleman for his statement.
Even though he has announced nothing new today, I very much welcome that he is keeping this matter at the top of his and the nation’s agenda.
Although he may be able to say little about this, will he forgive those of us  who can speak for continuing to press for the west to untie the hands of our Ukrainian allies, so that they can strike back at those who are striking at them illegally and without justification?
We know that that probably does not apply to this Government, but will he confirm that there are discussions with our allies about this matter?
May I wish him every success in helping us to deliver the freedom and security of the world by breaking the stalemate in Ukraine that will overwhelm the west if we allow it to continue?
