The Secretary of State was asked— What steps her Department is taking to increase prison capacity.
What steps her Department is taking to increase prison capacity.
Today is the day that those on the Opposition Benches always knew was coming.
The legacy of the previous Government was a prison system on the brink of collapse, which left us with no choice.
Today, around 1,700 offenders have had to be released a few weeks or months early by changing their automatic release point from 50% to 40% of their sentence.
Had we not done so, we faced courts unable to hold trials, police unable to make arrests and a total breakdown of law and order.
This is not the long-term solution—there is more that we must do—but it was the necessary first step that we had to take following the disgraceful dereliction of duty of the previous Government.
I refer hon.
Members to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests.
One way to reduce pressure on numbers is to treat more offenders with drug and alcohol addictions outside the prison estate.
That reduces prisoner numbers and reduces reoffending, which means fewer victims and fewer people returning to prison.
Such a system is operating successfully in many parts of the country, but it requires the highest quality treatment.
It also requires probation to work well, otherwise magistrates are limited in their choices.
May I encourage the Secretary of State to get hold of Dame Carol Black’s internal review of treatment and recovery of drug-dependent people in the secure estate if she has not already done so?
I have not seen it, obviously, but I am certain that it will contain many excellent recommendations.
