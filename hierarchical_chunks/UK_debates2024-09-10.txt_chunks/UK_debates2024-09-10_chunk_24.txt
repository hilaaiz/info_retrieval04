Domestic violence at its most severe becomes murder.
Domestic murder is often the most shocking and brutal.
With that in mind, what assessment has the Minister made of the Killed Women campaign?
I am aware of the Killed Women campaign.
I have liaised closely with it in opposition and now in government.
Its aims are admirable.
Any woman murdered by domestic homicide in this country is one woman too many.
We know that sadly three women a week are being murdered.
That is a shocking statistic that this Government are hoping to tackle.
