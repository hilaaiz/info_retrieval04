My hon.
Friend follows these matters closely and speaks with authority in the House on these things.
We have been warning—in fact, the previous Government were warning too—about the deepening security alliance between Iran and Russia.
Part of the declaration, made alongside international partners, at the NATO summit in Washington warned Iran that any transfer not just of drone technology, but of ballistic missile technology to Russia would be regarded as a significant escalation.
The House can take a broader lesson from my hon.
Friend’s point: Iran’s destabilisation is not a malign influence that is simply felt throughout parts of the middle east, but has wider repercussions, which is why Iran is one of the most serious threats to this country in the future.
