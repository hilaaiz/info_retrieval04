Every 30 seconds, a domestic abuse-related call is made to the police.
It is positive to see that the number of domestic abuse cases referred from the police to the CPS has increased, but those numbers are still well below the level seen over the past five years.
Will the Secretary of State address the delays in domestic abuse referrals from the police to the CPS and acknowledge the unique risks that they pose?
As I have stated, this Government were elected with a landmark mission to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.
To do so, we must improve the justice system’s response to these crimes, including domestic abuse.
We must relentlessly target the most prolific and harmful perpetrators, better support victims and survivors, and ensure timely and effective justice.
We will put domestic abuse experts in 999 control rooms and strengthen the use of protection orders, and we will strengthen the tools available to manage domestic abuse offenders.
Over the weekend, Lord MacDonald, the former director of public prosecutions, warned that court backlogs and the complexity of any trials that may arise from a CPS decision in 2026 about the victims of the Grenfell fire may further delay justice.
Could the Minister give us and the victims reassurance that the criminal justice system will not further delay justice for those victims?
As I said to  the hon.
Member for Wimbledon (Mr Kohler) , we will do everything we can to ensure swift justice for the victims of Grenfell.
We plan for the Crown court to sit for at least 105,000 days this financial year, and we will do more to increase the speed with which cases are heard in the Crown court.
