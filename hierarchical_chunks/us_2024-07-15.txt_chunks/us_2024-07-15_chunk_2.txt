Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the Village of Franklin in Michigan's 12th District as they celebrate their bicentennial anniversary.
Established in 1824, the Village of Franklin is a very special place in our community.
The village grew out of increased travel through the region after the completion of the Erie Canal, and its first residents were practical tradespeople skilled in smithing, carpentry, and masonry.
To this day, Franklin residents embrace and preserve its beautiful, rural landscape, fondly calling it the ``Town That Time Forgot.''
Because of its numerous original 19th-century properties, Franklin was designated as Michigan's first Historic District, and is listed on the National Register.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in celebrating the Village of Franklin's 200th birthday.
