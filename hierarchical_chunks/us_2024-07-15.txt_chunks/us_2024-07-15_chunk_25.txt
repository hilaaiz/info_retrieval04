parts of the Washington, D.C. metro area began to join.
To accommodate their growth, they incorporated Victory Christian Ministries International of Woodbridge, Virginia in July 2005.
Over the years, VCMI has grown from a single church to an international ministry with several locations across our nation and in Europe.
This growth is a testament to the positive influence and transformative power of their message.
Since its establishment, the Woodbridge branch of VCMI has been a beacon of hope and a source of strength for many in the community.
Through their dynamic Sunday services and engaging weekly activities, they have offered spiritual nourishment and guidance to countless individuals and families.
VCMI's commitment to youth development is particularly noteworthy.
Their Chrisma Teens program has provided a safe and nurturing environment for our young people from all walks of life to explore their faith, develop leadership skills, and give back to their community.
As we commemorate this 19th anniversary, we celebrate not just the longevity of an institution, but the countless lives that have been touched, the families that have been strengthened, and the communities that have been enriched by their work.
