Mrs. KIGGANS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Grassfield High School Softball team on winning the Class 6 Region A Championship.
As their Congresswoman, I am proud of these young athletes and their recent achievement.
Located in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Grassfield High School Grizzlies were able to bring the Class 6 Region A Championship back home to their fellow students, faculty, families, and friends through their hard work and dedication to their team.
They are a group of strong women who had a near-perfect record going into their state championship game.
They have not won the regional championship game since 2018 and assistant coach, Larry Murphy, led these women to a four to one victory.
As a former athlete myself, I want each of these young women to know Virginia's 2nd District is extremely proud of their accomplishment and applauds them on their well-earned victory.
Again, congratulations to the Grassfield High School Softball team on winning the Class 6 Region A Championship.
