Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Major General David F. Wherley, Jr., District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Program Act.
This bill would permanently authorize funding for the Major General David F Wherley, Jr., District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Program, which provides financial assistance for higher education to members of the D.C. National Guard, which is an exclusively federal entity.
This program and bill are named for Major General David F. Wherley, Jr., former Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard, who, along with his wife, Ann, and seven others were tragically killed when Metro trains collided on the Red Line on June 22, 2009.
I named this bill for Major General Wherley because he worked tirelessly with me for many years to get funding for this program, and because of his devotion to D.C. youth and to the D.C. National Guard.
This program was recommended by Major General Wherley and his successor at the D.C. National Guard, Major General Errol Schwartz, to stem the troublesome loss of D.C.
National Guard members to other units, including National Guards in surrounding states that offer financial assistance for higher education to their members.
I am grateful that Congress has consistently provided funding for this program, most recently $600,000 in fiscal year 2024.
Permanently authorizing this program will help ensure
that members of the D.C.
National Guard receive the same benefits as members of other National Guards and help the D.C. National Guard recruit and retain members.
This program not only benefits D.C.
National Guard members, the great majority of whom live in Maryland or Virginia, but also helps the D.C. National Guard to maintain the force necessary to protect the federal presence in D C. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
