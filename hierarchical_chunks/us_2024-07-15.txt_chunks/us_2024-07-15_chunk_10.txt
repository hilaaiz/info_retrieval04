Mr. DeSAULNIER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of James ``Jim'' Hatch.
Jim was dedicated to serving our community and was always kind and helpful.
Included in his long career, he assisted with former Congressman George Miller's campaign and the Youth Fund.
Additionally, Jim was incredibly hardworking and was a skilled handyman.
He also enjoyed traveling the world and was a proud dog parent to Minnie the Pooch.
Jim will be remembered for his optimism, positivity, and the impact he's had on countless lives.
Jim is survived by Carol, his loving wife of 60 years, and his children Suzanne (Rob) and Jill (Steve), grandchildren Sophie (Joshua), Sarah (Rick), Matthew, Lauren, Kristi (Ben) and Sarah (Jason Henry), great grandchildren Olivia and Cameron, his sister Sandra, brother Robert, and bonus daughter and grandsons Tomoko, Hiro, and Akira Tamura.
Please join me in honoring my friend Jim Hatch.
He will be remembered for his outstanding character and his commitment to his community.
