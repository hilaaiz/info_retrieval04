Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, in extending our sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Bishop Reginald Thomas Jackson upon his departure from Georgia as the Presiding Prelate of the Sixth Episcopal District of the AME Church.
May God continue to bless his ministry and service on behalf of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
