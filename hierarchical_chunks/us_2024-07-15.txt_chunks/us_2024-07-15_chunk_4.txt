Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Judge Robert O. Bowen of the Marshall County Superior Court No. 1 as he prepares to retire from serving on the bench.
A 1974 graduate of Indiana University, Judge Bowen obtained his Juris Doctor from Valparaiso University in 1977.
In addition to his service on the bench, Robert also served as a Legislative Assistant in the Indiana General Assembly.
Since his tenure on the Marshall County Superior Court No. 1 began on January 1, 1995, Judge Bowen has dedicated himself to advancing the principles of justice and ensuring that Hoosiers get a fair shake before the law.
The Rule of Law tradition we have inherited helps secure individual liberty and promotes the conditions necessary for human flourishing.
It is incumbent on us to do our part to make sure these principles of justice and Rule of Law precepts are passed seamlessly from one generation to the next.
That mission is one Judge Bowen has embraced wholeheartedly and worked tirelessly to advance.
While serving on the Court, Judge Bowen has also demonstrated his steadfast commitment to the local community, most especially in his church membership where he taught adult education over the years.
Additionally, the Sagamore of the Wabash Award he has been honored with is another testament to Judge Bowen's leadership abilities and his civic-oriented nature.
As Judge Bowen's career comes to a close, I have no doubt that the Marshall County community is better off because of his service.
I know that Robert's wife Patty and their three children--Andrew, Chris, and Betsy--are all very proud of him, and I am too.
I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our gratitude to Judge Robert O. Bowen for his service and in wishing him a very happy retirement and all the best going forward.
