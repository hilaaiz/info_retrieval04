Congratulations, Jessie Frank, for winning our DC office's first ever Green Thumb Award.
These DC Longworth building offices are drab.
To add a little life, spirit, and ambiance to our office, for the past 90 days our team was challenged to keep the area around their workspace green and vibrant.
I appreciate my entire team's enthusiasm and light-hearted competition to make our office green and alive.
Jessie received the award, but we all benefited with a more pleasant place to work.
With my warmest regards, Chuck Edwards, Member.
