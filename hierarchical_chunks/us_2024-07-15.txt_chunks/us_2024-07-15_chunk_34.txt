Nansemond-Suffolk Softball team on winning the 2024 VISAA DII State Championship.
As their Congresswoman, I am proud of these young athletes and their recent achievement.
Located in Suffolk, Virginia, the Nansemond-Suffolk Saints were able to bring the VISAA DII State Championship back home to their fellow students, faculty, families, and friends through their hard work and dedication to their team.
The Nansemond-Suffolk Softball Team is celebrating their fifth straight state championship title with their head coach, Brittany Thornburg, leading her team to victory.
As a former athlete myself, I want each of these young women to know Virginia's 2nd District is extremely proud of their accomplishment and applauds them on their well-earned victory.
Again, congratulations to the Nansemond-Suffolk Softball Team on winning the 2024 VISAA DII State Championship.
