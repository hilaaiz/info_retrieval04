Mrs. KIGGANS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Greenbrier Christian Baseball team on winning the 2024 VISAA DII State Championship.
As their Congresswoman, I am proud of these young athletes and their recent achievement.
Located in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Greenbrier Christian Gators were able to bring the VISAA DII State Championship back home to their fellow students, faculty, families, and friends by their hard work and dedication to their team.
The Greenbrier Christian Baseball Team has fifteen State Championship titles under their belt.
In the beginning of the year this team was unranked and quickly became unstoppable averaging 8.9 runs per game.
This reflects not only their athletic capabilities, but also their steadfast determination to excel.
As a former athlete myself, I want each of these young men to know Virginia's 2nd District is extremely proud of their accomplishment and applauds them on their well-earned victory.
Again, congratulations to the Greenbrier Christian Baseball Team on winning the 2024 VISAA DII State Championship.
