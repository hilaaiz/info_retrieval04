Mrs. KIGGANS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the Great Bridge High School Boys' Soccer team on winning the Class 5 Region A Championship.
As their Congresswoman, I am proud of these young athletes and their recent achievement.
Located in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge High School Wildcats were able to bring the Class 5 Region A Championship back home to their fellow students, faculty, families, and friends through their hard work and dedication to their team.
The Great Bridge Boys' Soccer team is undefeated this season, and goalie, Griffin Thomas, recorded a shutout in the net, and Carson Danner scored the game winning goal to secure their championship.
As a former athlete myself, I want each of these young men to know Virginia's 2nd District is extremely proud of their accomplishment and applauds them on their well-earned victory.
Again, congratulations to the Great Bridge High School Boys' Soccer team on winning the Class 5 Region A Championship.
