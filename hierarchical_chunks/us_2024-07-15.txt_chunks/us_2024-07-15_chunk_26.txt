Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Victory Christian Ministries International's Woodbridge branch on their 19th anniversary.
I applaud Pastors Tony and Cynthia Brazelton as well as the entire VCMI community for their contributions to Prince William County--guided by the values of love, compassion, and community service.
