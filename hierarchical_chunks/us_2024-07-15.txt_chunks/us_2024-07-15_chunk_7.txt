Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, shifting the balance of power in the Senate.
Because of this seismic shift, historic legislation to improve lives and communities was signed into law, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act, Historic Funding for HBCU's, as well as the appointment of an African American woman to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In 2022 and now in 2024, he is leading an historic partnership with the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to energize and mobilize minority voters for the 2024 elections.
Now, after 8 years in Georgia, Bishop Jackson will be leaving for assignment to another Episcopal District where he will no doubt share his vision and wisdom in service to God's people.
While his departure will be a great loss to Georgia, I am certain that his impactful leadership will be a catalytic gain to those in his new region of responsibility.
Bishop Jackson has accomplished much in his life, but none of it would have been possible without the grace of God and the love and support of his wife, Attorney Christy Jackson, who has served along side him as Supervisor of the Sixth Episcopal District, and their children Regina and Seth.
Georgia, our Nation and the world, are better because of Bishop Jackson's ministry and service.
To God Be the Glory.
