The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act that I co-sponsored and helped the House pass protects and preserves the right of American citizens to vote.
This legislation would require states to obtain proof of citizenship in person when registering an individual to vote in federal elections and requires states to remove non-citizens from existing voter rolls.
Foreign election interference is made possible because of our lax voter registration laws that allow noncitizens to register and vote in federal elections.
With the ongoing crisis at our southern border, this piece of legislation is essential to safeguard the integrity of American elections.
The SAVE Act will close the loopholes that allow noncitizen registration, and thereby voting, to improve election security, minimize the risk of foreign interference and restore Americans' confidence in U.S. elections.
