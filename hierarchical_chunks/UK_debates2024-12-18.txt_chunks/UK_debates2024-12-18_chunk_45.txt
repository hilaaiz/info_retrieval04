I have a deep respect for the hon.
Gentleman.
As I have said a number of times, the Government deeply regret the way that Chagossians were removed from the islands and treated thereafter.
We have always been clear on respecting the interests of Chagossian communities.
I have engaged, and will continue to engage, with Chagossian communities.
Their interests are at the heart of the deal, from the trust fund to the ability to resettle on and visit the islands, and a series of other measures that we have taken here in the United Kingdom.
I am confident that their interests are being respected.
The Government were elected on a mandate of change, to deliver a new era of economic growth and national renewal, and reverse the years of failure and decline that we inherited.
Through the tough decisions that we took in the Budget, we prevented a return to austerity while protecting working people’s payslips.
The plan for change that the Prime Minister unveiled earlier this month is the next stage on the journey of reform—a plan to kick-start growth and get Britain building again, putting more money in people’s pockets and delivering 1.5 million new homes, good jobs and opportunities for all.
Just this week, we announced our plans to rebuild and reform local government, and to empower local leaders to deliver that change so that the benefits are felt in every community.
We cannot do this alone.
We need strong, empowered local government to work with us, as equal partners in a new relationship.
Public service is our collective duty, but after a decade of cuts, fiscal mismanagement and the failure of the previous Government to fix the foundations, it is a fact that councils of all political stripes are in crisis.
The broken local audit system in England and the scandal of the unacceptable backlog that led to the recent whole of Government accounts disclaimer further illustrate the dire straits of the system and the legacy that we must reconcile.
