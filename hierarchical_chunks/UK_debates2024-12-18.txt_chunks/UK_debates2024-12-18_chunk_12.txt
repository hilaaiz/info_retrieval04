Hear, hear!
It is always nice to get a cheer, Mr Speaker.
As a former treasurer of the Oxford Union, I was disgusted that three weeks ago a debate descended into a mess of antisemitism, when a majority of the students voted that they would not have reported Hamas’s plans if they had known of them prior to the  7 October  attacks.
Will the Minister write to the Oxford Union and say that antisemitism has no place in our society, especially not in our universities?
The Government could not have been clearer about our position on antisemitism: there is no place for antisemitism in our society, nor for any form of racism.
That applies whether it is in educational settings or in any other part of our society, and that has been made very clear indeed.
