Can I send my warmest wishes to our armed forces at home and overseas, to the emergency services, and to everyone who will be working over Christmas?
Can I wish you, Mr Speaker, the House staff and all Members of this House a very merry Christmas?
For years, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet played politics with the WASPI women—the Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign.
The Deputy Prime Minister said the Conservatives were stealing their pensions.
She promised to compensate them in full—another broken promise.
Now, they admit that we were right all along.
But let us ask about another group of pensioners whose trust was broken.
Since the Chancellor cut winter fuel payments, how many extra people have applied for pension credit?
The No. 1 job of this Government was to put the finances back in order after the last Government lost control.
They left a £22 billion black hole and we had to take tough choices.
We made sure that the most vulnerable pensioners do get the winter fuel payment, and we have been encouraging them, driving up eligibility for pension credit and people signing up to their entitlement.
The Leader of the Opposition should join that campaign.
Here is the difference: because we have stabilised the economy, we can commit to the triple lock.
That means that next April pensioners will get another £470.
Here is the difference: two weeks ago, the shadow Chancellor said that the triple lock is “unsustainable”.
Their position is that pensioners would lose out under the Tories yet again.
