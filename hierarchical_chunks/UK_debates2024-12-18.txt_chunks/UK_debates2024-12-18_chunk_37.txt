Can the Minister enlighten us as to the attitude on the deal of the incoming Trump Administration?
Does he know, or shall I ask  the hon.
Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage) ?
We very much welcome, as I have said before, the election of President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Vance.
During the transition period, there are restrictions on what conversations can go on.
As I have said repeatedly in the House, we are confident that when the full details of the deal are provided by the US national security apparatus, any concerns will be allayed.
I know that the Minister is a strong supporter of the overseas territories, as are the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister.
Despite this being documented already in the House and in Gibraltar, to avoid any doubt or further scaremongering, and for Members on the Opposition Benches, will the Minister once again confirm that this Government are completely committed to supporting the right of self-determination for the people of Gibraltar and the Falklands?
