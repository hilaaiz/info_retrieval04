The Minister did not seem to answer the questions raised by the shadow Foreign Secretary, so may I ask this just one more time: from which budget do the Government plan to make the annual payments that he is proposing to the Mauritian Government?
I have been very, very clear—[Laughter].
Conservative Members can guffaw all they like, but I will give the answers that relate to the facts here and that relate to the national security interests of this country.
The previous Government were involved in 11 rounds of negotiations and they failed to achieve a deal.
We achieved that deal.
We will provide further details in due course.
Yet again, this new Labour Government rushed into an ill-judged and regrettable policy decision: to cede the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius, against expert advice and with no regard to the wishes of Chagossians in this country and elsewhere.
It is like the Government’s awful policies on scrapping the winter fuel payment for pensioners, the heartless family farms tax, and their jobs tax.
Will the Government show some leadership, admit that they have got this wrong, scrap the deal and keep this vital territory under British control, to protect UK interests, the marine environment and ultimately global security in an increasingly unstable and dangerous world?
I gently suggest that the hon.
Gentleman spends a bit more time reflecting on the failures of his Administration on this and a series of other issues, from the public finances to our national security.
This Government are clearing up the mess that his party left behind on not only this issue
but so many others.
