I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
Jim Callaghan was a giant of the Labour movement and a great public servant.
He left school at 17 and served in our Royal Navy before becoming Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor and, of course, finally Prime Minister.
I am sure that he, as a proud son of Portsmouth, would be honoured to be remembered in such a way.

Happy Christmas.
