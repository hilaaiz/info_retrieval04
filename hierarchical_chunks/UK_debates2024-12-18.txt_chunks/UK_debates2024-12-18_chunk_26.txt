I thank my hon.
Friend for drawing attention to the people of Syria and to the health workers of all backgrounds who do vital work in our NHS.
The fall of Assad’s brutal regime is to be welcomed and should be welcomed, but we must be cautious about what comes next.
We have provided £50 million of extra support to vulnerable Syrians and I have spoken to G7 leaders to work towards a Syrian Government that respects international law, universal human rights and protects all citizens across all sectors.
