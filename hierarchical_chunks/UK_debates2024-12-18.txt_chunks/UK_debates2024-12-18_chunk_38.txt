I thank my hon.
Friend for her important work on Gibraltar, as I thank you for yours, Mr Speaker.
I have said this before and I will confirm again that we are absolutely and resolutely committed to the sovereignty and self-determination of Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands.
Indeed, I enjoyed meeting our overseas territories family at the Joint Ministerial Council just a few weeks ago.
