I thank the hon.
Gentleman for raising that issue on behalf of his constituents.
We are, as he knows, committed to fixing the foundations of local government and keeping taxes as low as possible for working people.
The Budget announced a real-terms increase for local government, with over £4 billion of added funding.
We will put that support in place, and he is right to raise that issue.
