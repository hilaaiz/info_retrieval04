Order.
Let me just say to Mr Mayhew that I keep hearing you.
I heard you the other week when you were sat to my side, and I am hearing you again over there.
It not a good time to push your luck.
I call the leader of the Liberal Democrats.
I join the Prime Minister in his praise and best wishes for our armed forces and emergency services, and I join others in wishing you, Mr Speaker, a happy Christmas, along with all the staff of the Commons and everyone across the House [Hon.
Members: “Sing it!”
] I will sing in a minute.
I have had the great joy of spending time recently with some amazing young people from the Bath Philharmonia young carers choir.
They are a brilliant example of the power of music to make a difference in young people’s lives.
One member, Caitlyn, has even developed a special new project to spread the joy of music to young people in our schools and communities.
Will the Prime Minister meet Caitlyn to hear more about her exciting project, and will he work with us and others to support music in our schools and communities?
