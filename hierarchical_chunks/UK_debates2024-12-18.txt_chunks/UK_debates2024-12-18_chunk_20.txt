I welcome the right hon.
Gentleman’s comments.
As he will know, today we are introducing the landmark Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill to enable all children to succeed, including young carers.
We increased pupil premium funding to over £2.9 billion, which can be used to support pupils, including carers, with identified needs.
As he knows, now that young carers are on the school census—and have been since 2023—they have greater visibility, and schools will be better able to identify and support them.
