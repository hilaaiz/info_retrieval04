I welcome the Minister’s announcement on the Green Paper on the future of the Post Office.
It is also welcome that the Government are taking additional  steps towards financial redress for the postmasters who suffered such horrendous treatment in that scandal.
I am concerned that this new deal for postmasters comes at the expense of post office branches across the country, including at Kensington Park in my constituency.
Does he agree that there should not be a choice between giving postmasters a fair deal and losing essential high street services?
Will he please meet me to discuss that further?
