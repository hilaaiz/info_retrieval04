I thank the right hon.
Lady for her question.
We welcome yesterday’s reiteration by Prime Minister Ramgoolam of his willingness to conclude a deal with the UK.
We are confident that the agreement is in both sides’ shared interests, and we will continue working with the new Mauritian Government to finalise the deal.
Prime Minister Ramgoolam’s comments follow his commitment to completing the negotiations, following his election, in an exchange of letters with the Prime Minister.
