I thank the hon.
Lady for raising this important issue on behalf of her constituents.
It underlines the critical nature of the NHS workforce plan that we will deliver next summer to ensure that the expert workforce is in place and get the NHS back on its feet.
I am proud that we are investing an additional £22.6 billion to fix our NHS.
I will of course ensure she gets a meeting with the relevant Minister to deal with the issues of concern to her constituents.
