Mr. NEWHOUSE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for two reasons: to honor the crew members who served aboard the USS Triton (SSRN-586) submarine, and to commend the Port of Benton for commissioning a new commemorative wall honoring the Triton and her crew.
Commissioned in 1959, the USS Triton holds a special place in the history of the U.S. Navy.
Powered by two nuclear reactors, the Triton was the first submarine to complete a submerged circumnavigation of the globe.
During the Cold War, the Triton was a vital part of the Navy's defense strategy as a leader in peace and security around the world.
The members who served aboard her were at the forefront of this mission, often enduring long months of isolation and unpredictable conditions aboard the vessel.
But their shared dedication and expertise led them to achieve one of the most groundbreaking missions in naval history.
The USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park was formally dedicated in Richland, Washington, on November 10, 2011, to commemorate the submarine and her crew.
Central Washington is proud to be home to this piece of our Nation's history, and I thank the Port of Benton for honoring the crew members and preserving their legacy.
