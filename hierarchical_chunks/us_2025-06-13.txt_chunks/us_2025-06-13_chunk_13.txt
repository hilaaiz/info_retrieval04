Her commitment to service extends well beyond the kitchen.
Marlene is among the first to volunteer for community events, including Caribbean American Heritage Month celebrations, Mother's Day initiatives, and cultural festivals.
She approaches every act of service with humility, never seeking recognition, but always delivering excellence.
Marlene's impact is also felt through her efforts to pass on cultural traditions to the next generation.
She devotes time to teaching young people how to prepare and appreciate authentic Caribbean dishes, ensuring that the flavors, stories, and values of our shared heritage endure.
It is my distinct honor to recognize Marlene Henry this Caribbean American Heritage Month.
Her deep compassion, cultural pride, and unwavering service enrich our community and inspire us all.
