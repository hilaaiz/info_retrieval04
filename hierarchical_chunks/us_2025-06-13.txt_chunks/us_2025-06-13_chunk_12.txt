Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from Rochester, New York: Marlene Henry.
As the owner of PeppaPot Catering, Marlene Henry is far more than a business owner--she is a quiet but powerful force for good in our community.
Time and again, she has offered her culinary talents in service of others, often at her own expense.
Whether providing food at no cost to those in need or offering discounted services for community events, Marlene exemplifies the spirit of generosity that defines Caribbean American heritage.
