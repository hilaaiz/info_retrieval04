Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a school from my district, the Okaloosa Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medical (STEMM)
Academy, on achieving the remarkable milestone of being recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School.
Okaloosa STEMM Academy is one of only 13 schools from the State of Florida to earn this distinction and one of only 353 nationwide in 2023.
This achievement is a testament to the teachers and staff's dedication to student success and their pursuit of excellence.
The Okaloosa STEMM Academy is an innovative middle school that provides a free and public education to sixth through eighth grade students in Okaloosa County with a curriculum focused on academic rigor and excellence.
The STEMM Academy was established in 2012 as part of the Okaloosa STEMM Center.
The curriculum has been specifically designed to enable students to transition to high school having completed numerous high school courses, including Algebra I Honors, Geometry I Honors, Physical Science Honors, Fundamentals of Web Design, and Earth Space Science Honors.
I am proud that Northwest Florida is home to a multi-faceted academy for students interested in pursuing STEMM careers.
I, along with all of Northwest Florida, thank Principal Scheree Martin, the teachers, administration, and staff at Okaloosa STEMM Academy for their hard work and dedication to their students, families, and this community.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am privileged to recognize Okaloosa STEMM Academy on this incredible achievement.
