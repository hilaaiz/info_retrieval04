Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of James C. ``Sam/Sammy'' Bradford.
Sammy was born on July 11, 1942, in Memphis TN.
Mr. Bradford started trying to make a difference early in the NAACP youth chapter.
In March of 1961, he became the youngest of the ``Tougaloo Nine'' to desegregate the Jackson Municipal Library System.
It was during that selfless act of service he created the concept ``You can recognize what's the right thing to do... because the right thing is rarely comfortable, convenient or popular''.
Sammy graduated from Douglass High School and began his freshman year in 1960 at the esteemed Tougaloo College in Tougaloo, MS where he studied music.
His love for music and beautiful tenor voice is what joined him with the love of his life, his wife, Shirley Ann Faulkens.
In December of 1969, Sammy married Shirley Ann Faulkens.
They were married for 53 years and 10 months and had two children together, Ako and Pili.
