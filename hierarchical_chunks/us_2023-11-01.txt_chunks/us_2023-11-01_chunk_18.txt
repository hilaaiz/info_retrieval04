Mr. Speaker, as conflicts around the world show us every day, the U.S. and its allies are constantly under attack from new and more sophisticated enemies.
If we are going to continue protecting our citizens and our allies, we need to ensure that our fighting men and women have the best technology possible.
The men and women who worked on the ALL deserve our deepest appreciation for what they accomplished to keep this country safe and, as the ALL logo states, give us all ``Peace Through Light.''
