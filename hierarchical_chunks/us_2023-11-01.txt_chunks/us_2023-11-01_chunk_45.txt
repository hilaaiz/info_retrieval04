Mr. Speaker, we are grateful that good men like Jim Gorman dedicate their lives to the service of others, enriching countless lives and giving back so much more than they receive.
On behalf of the people of Ohio's Fourth Congressional District, I offer his family my condolences as they continue to reflect on this pillar of the community and his contributions to Mansfield and Richland County.
