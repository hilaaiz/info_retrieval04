Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Hermit Woods Winery and Eatery, a New Hampshire small business that was recently nominated to the 2023 America's Top Small Business Summit.
For 13 years Hermit Woods Winery and Eatery has embodied our state's values of determination and innovation, heightened consumer experiences with high-quality, locally-sourced products.
This recent recognition by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a testament to Hermit Woods Winery and Eatery's impact on our local economy and involvement in the community.
The next generation of New Hampshire business leaders will look to Hermit Woods for inspiration.
Hermit Woods is an industry leader and a trusted community partner.
Its model of brewing with the fruits, flowers, and vegetables grown by local farmers and foragers showcases its culinary creativity and commitment to fostering community connections.
Each bottle at the Winery is brewed with the spirit of community that defines the work at Hermit Woods.
The Granite State is thankful for these small businesses that provide quality products, build relationships between neighbors, and strengthen the economy.
I look forward to seeing all that Hermit Woods accomplishes in the years to come, and I am confident that it will continue to serve as a guide for other business leaders in the state.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I applaud Hermit Woods for its commitment to the values of business innovation and community compassion.
I wish Hermit Woods continued success in its future endeavors.
