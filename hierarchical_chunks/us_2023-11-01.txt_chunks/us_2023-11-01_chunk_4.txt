Mr. Hage worked closely with former governor Jeb Bush in developing charter school legislation in Florida, opening the first charter school in the state.
He has diligently worked with legislative representatives on both sides of the aisle to create equitable student learning opportunities.
He has provided high-quality educational options for more than 95,000 students in Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.
Furthermore, 
Mr. Hage is a veteran who served in the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret.
He is committed to supporting the military community through hiring practices that recruit, maintain, and promote veterans from all military branches.
Additionally, where permitted by each school's charter agreement, students from military families are given enrollment preference.
These commitments helped a Florida school receive the Florida Purple Star School of Distinction, recognizing schools that support the unique needs of military families and provide resources for military-connected students when transitioning to a new school environment.
I am pleased to honor 
Mr. Jonathan Hage and Charter Schools USA for their continued commitment to student excellence by providing an educational environment that builds strong minds and good hearts to ensure a brighter future for all.
