Mr. NORMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding citizen, 
Mr. Barry Chastain, a remarkable individual who has devoted over 38 years to federal service.
Currently serving as the Area Port Director for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in North Carolina, Mr. Chastain's contributions to the Carolinas and our Nation are immeasurable.
In his capacity as the Area Port Director, 
Mr. Chastain shoulders the responsibility of overseeing six international ports of entry in North Carolina, where he manages a workforce of more than 150 dedicated employees.
These ports collectively process over 3.5 million passengers and handle over 4 billion dollars in imported goods annually.
Under his vigilant leadership, the seamless flow of legitimate trade coexists with stringent security measures to safeguard our national interests.
Mr. Chastain serves as the senior CBP representative to all federal, state, and local law enforcement partners in North Carolina.
His ability to foster cooperation and collaboration among these agencies is integral to the safety and wellbeing of our citizens.
