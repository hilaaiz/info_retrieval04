Mr. THOMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a breast cancer hero, 
Mrs. Rhonda Givens Boles.
Rhonda Boles was born on March 1, 1972, in Clarksdale to Roger Givens and Jamie Sharkey Givens.
She has two amazing sons, Preston II--a freshman pre-veterinary medicine major at Mississippi State University, and Matthew Jamison--a junior at Pillow Academy.
Rhonda was a 1990 graduate of Greenwood High School and completed a Bachelor of Science degree at Jackson State University in 1994.
She completed her master's degree at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.
Obtaining both a Bachelor and Master of Science in nursing before becoming a board-certified family nurse practitioner.
She is also a member of Delta Sigma Theta, Incorporated.
Rhonda married Dr. Preston Boles of Greenwood after moving back to Mississippi from Nashville, and they have enjoyed 21 years of marital bliss.
Rhonda has a love for her New Zion Missionary Baptist Church Family and has served in many capacities: as speaker, advocate, and facilitator for health-care discussions during the months of October and February, where she educated the congregants on breast cancer awareness and other health-related topics.
Rhonda was named The Greenwood Commonwealth's 2023 Mother of the Year in May.
The title she proudly claimed was being her two sons' biggest cheerleader who did not carry pom-poms and was often heard giving the quick retort when asked why something had to be done.
