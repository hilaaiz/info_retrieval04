Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the impressive and impactful career of Manchester Police Chief Allen Aldenberg as he retires.
Throughout his life, Chief Aldenberg dedicated his efforts to serving others.
In a military career spanning 30 years, he commanded from the company to the brigade level and deployed in support of key operations to combat terrorism and protect our Nation after 9/11.
He was awarded a Bronze Star medal for his service in Iraq from 2009 to 2010.
As a law enforcement officer for 27 years, including the last four years as Manchester Police Chief, Chief Aldenberg has worked with officers, department staff, city leadership, and community members to make Manchester safer and stronger.
His commitment to public safety and securing a bright and safe future for the Queen City is evident through his investment toward improving the Manchester Police Department.
Through his leadership, Chief Aldenberg spearheaded the Manchester Police Department's strategic goals to focus on data-driven approaches to public safety, invest in high-quality training and development, put more well-trained officers on the street, and enhance community engagement.
Under his leadership, Chief Aldenberg also strengthened the Manchester Police Department's Mental Health and Wellness Program, which serves as a standard bearer across New Hampshire for other departments to emulate.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to extend my gratitude to Chief Allen Aldenberg for his exceptional service in New Hampshire as a law enforcement officer.
I join all Granite Staters in thanking Chief Aldenberg for his leadership, professionalism, and contributions to making the community safer.
I wish Allen, his wife Emily, and his children all the best as he retires from a career in law enforcement.
I congratulate Chief Aldenberg on a job very well done.
