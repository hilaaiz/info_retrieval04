Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate Claire Seiffer, who is celebrating her 100th birthday on November 21st of this year.
Mrs. Seiffer has spent her entire life in the State of New Jersey, where she was a longtime public-school PE teacher.
Her service to the state and nation was complemented by that of her husband, a World War II veteran.
Mrs. Seiffer met her husband at the school that they worked at together after he returned from his military service.
Mrs. Seiffer has fond memories of iceboating on their hand-built boat with her husband on New Jersey's famous Lake Hopatcong.
Going into her 100th birthday, she continues to maintain an active lifestyle, and her friends and family enjoy her vivacious spirit and sharp mind.
lt is my distinct pleasure to celebrate 
Mrs. Seiffer today, as she continues to be the embodiment of American and New Jerseyan commitment to public service, health, and prosperity.
