Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, I am proud to pay tribute to Frederick P. Kessler today.
He has changed the lives of so many people, including my own constituents.
The people of the 4th Congressional District, the State of Wisconsin, and the United States join me in thanking him for his legacy of service and commitment to the public good.
