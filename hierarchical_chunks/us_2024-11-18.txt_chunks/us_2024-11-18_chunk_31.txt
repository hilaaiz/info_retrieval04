I have long admired Fred's dedication to improving the world around him.
His legacy is one of selfless service, a steadfast pursuit of justice, and a profound care for others.
Fred's life was defined by his compassion, his integrity, and his unwavering belief in the power of public service to make a meaningful difference in the lives of others.
Fred was always a voice for the voiceless, a champion of fairness, and an advocate for those who needed it most.
