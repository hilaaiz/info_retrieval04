Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognized The Arc of Warren County for its 70 years of service to the 7th Congressional District.
By assisting families in addressing the challenges associated with the lifelong care of relatives with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The Arc of Warren County has created an environment where those they serve are accepted and respected in the community.
Currently serving over 1,100 individuals annually, The Arc strives every day to ensure that all those associated with the program are able to achieve independence, make friends, and contribute to society.
I am honored to have such an amazing organization working to strengthen the lives of New Jersey residents, and I look forward to seeing all that they will achieve in the future.
