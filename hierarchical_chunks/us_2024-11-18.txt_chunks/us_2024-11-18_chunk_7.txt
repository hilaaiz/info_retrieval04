Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sergeant First Class Clayton McGraw of Sulphur Springs, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
SFC McGraw honorably served in the United States Army during the Korean War.
During the Korean War, SFC McGraw was drafted into the Army.
In one incident, he successfully rescued a fellow soldier from drowning during a dangerous river crossing and was recognized for his quick thinking and bravery.
For distinguishing himself through an act of heroism, SFC McGraw was awarded the Soldier's Medal.
After retiring from the Army, SFC McGraw continued to make a positive impact in our community.
He is the founder and Chairman of the Hopkins County Veterans Memorial Committee to advocate for and support veterans across North Texas.
SFC McGraw also served for eight years on the Sulphur Springs Planning and Zoning Board and was a member of the First Baptist mission team in Longview, Texas.
His outstanding leadership has undoubtedly made a difference in the lives of so many people throughout the years.
I am proud of SFC McGraw's contributions to our community and his dedication to serving our great Nation.
I am honored to represent SFC McGraw in Texas' 4th Congressional district.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and the people of North Texas.
