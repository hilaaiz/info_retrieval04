Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize First Lieutenant Corbett Howard of Celina, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
1LT
Howard honorably served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War.
As a young man, 1LT Howard was inspired to follow in his family's footsteps and serve his country.
In December 1968, he commissioned into the U.S. Army serving in Military Intelligence.
After completing Combat Intelligence school, 1LT Howard deployed to Vietnam in the following year and served as an Intelligence Officer in Kien Giang Province.
He was one of thirty four American advisors to the South Vietnamese Army and was responsible for training its troops.
During the war, he also flew 108 combat missions in a Huey helicopter and participated in numerous Swift boat operations against the enemy.
For his outstanding service, 1LT Howard was awarded the Bronze Star, the Air Medal, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry with bronze star.
After he retired from military service in 1970, 1LT Howard has continued to be an active member of our community through his public service and volunteer efforts.
Since 2012, he has served as a board member for the Military Warriors Support Foundation to help provide homes to wounded veterans and Gold Star families.
Under 1LT Howard's exceptional leadership, they have given over 930 homes and 175 vehicles for veterans in need.
Moreover, he has helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the organization to support veterans and ensure they can keep their homes for many years to come.
I am proud of 1LT
Howard's contributions to our community and his dedication to serving our great Nation.
I am honored to represent 1LT Howard in Texas' 4th Congressional district.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and the people of North Texas.
