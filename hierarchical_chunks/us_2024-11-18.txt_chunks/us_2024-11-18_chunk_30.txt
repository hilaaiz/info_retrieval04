Representatives.
By the time he was 20 years old, Fred had been elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly.
Throughout this time, he played a pivotal role in achieving compromise during Wisconsin's redistricting battles of the 1960s.
Fred used his position to advocate for equal education, election reform, civil liberties, and fair housing.
In the midst of his public service, he earned both a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a law degree from the University.
Following the end of the legislative session in 1972, Fred was appointed to a judgeship in Milwaukee County.
After working on the Wisconsin Legislative Council Committee on Court Reorganization in 1978, Fred was appointed as a circuit judge for Milwaukee County.
He served with distinction for 10 years, upholding the law and administering justice to the people.
In 2004, Fred returned to the Wisconsin State Assembly for 14 more years.
During this period, Fred once again championed critical reforms in Wisconsin's criminal justice system, elections, and federal relations.
Fred's dedication to justice will be dearly missed.
His unwavering commitment to public service fills me with honor in recognizing his incredible career and passion for creating a more equal and just nation.
