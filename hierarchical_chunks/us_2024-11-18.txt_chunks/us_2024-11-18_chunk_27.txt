Mr. SCALISE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my fellow Louisianan, Barry Melancon, who is retiring after 30 years from his role as President and CEO of the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and CEO of the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants.
Barry Melancon has dedicated his 41-year career to the accounting profession, 
Mr. Melancon began his role in 1995 at the age of 37, which made him the youngest CEO in the organization's history and now the longest serving CEO of AICPA.
Mr. Melancon's professional career began in Louisiana where he practiced as a CPA, eventually leading the Society of Louisiana CPAs before beginning his leadership role at AICPA.
