Mrs. SPARTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable career and retirement of 
Mr. Syd Loomis, a lifelong Hoosier, dedicated professional, and beloved member of the Noblesville community.
Born in Waukegan, Illinois, to Joseph ``Jay'' and Marlene ``Mitzi'' Loomis, Syd grew up with strong family values that would guide him throughout his life.
A 1978 graduate of Noblesville High School, he married his wife Jeanine in 1982, and together they raised three wonderful children--Caryn, Amy, and Spencer.
Today, Syd is the proud grandfather of four granddaughters, who bring him great joy and who affectionately know him as a devoted supporter of their softball games, dance recitals, and family traditions.
Syd's career in banking has spanned over 45 years.
Beginning in 1980 as a teller at American National Bank, he went on to serve with AmeriTrust, Society, Key Bank, Metro, First Indiana, First National, BMO Harris, and, for the past 15 years to the day, The Farmers Bank, where he served as Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager.
Syd was not just a banker, he was a mentor to young professionals, a trusted advisor to countless customers, and a friendly face who treated everyone like family.
His service was recognized with numerous honors, including induction into the Indiana Bankers Association's 40-Year Banker Club, the Community Pride Award in 2011, and the Keep Noblesville Beautiful Award in 2013.
Beyond his professional career, Syd has always given generously of his time and talents to his community.
He has served on the boards of the Noblesville Chamber of Commerce, the Shepherd Center of Hamilton County, and the Hamilton Heights Youth Assistance Program.
He is also well known for his love of the arts, beginning community theatre in 1998 and performing in beloved roles such as George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life, Daddy Warbucks in Annie, and the Tin Man in The Wizard audiences across Hamilton County.
Syd also shared his love of music in the choir of First Presbyterian Church, where his faith and voice have lifted others for decades.
Syd is affectionately known by many as the ``unofficial mayor of Noblesville,'' a fitting title for a man who never met a stranger and always left a lasting impression.
I am personally grateful to have worked alongside Syd, who was my boss when I was a bank teller.
His kindness, humility, and encouragement left a deep impression on me, as I know they have on so many others.
