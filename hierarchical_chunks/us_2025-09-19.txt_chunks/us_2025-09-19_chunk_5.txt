Ms. PELOSI.
Mr. Speaker, the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk was reprehensible.
Members of Congress pray for Charlie's wife, Erika, their two young children, and all who loved him during their time of mourning and grief.
We also extend our prayers to all who were present on the Utah Valley University campus at the time of this tragedy, who will carry the trauma of that day with them forever.
In recent years, a disturbing and unacceptable pattern has emerged: individuals being targeted for their role in public life or for their association with political discourse.
Violence of this nature is not an attack on one person alone--it is an assault on democracy itself, meant to silence debate, sow fear, and tear at the fabric of our civil society.
We remember the assassination attempt on Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, which left her critically injured and six innocent lives lost.
We remember the shooting at a Congressional baseball game practice, which seriously wounded Congressman Steve Scalise and injured five others.
We recall the chilling plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
We will not forget the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6th, which resulted in the deaths of five law enforcement officers and shook the very foundations of our democracy.
My own family still lives with the trauma of a near-deadly attack on my husband, Paul, in our home by an individual seeking to kidnap me--an act of violence that underscored in the most personal way the escalating threats that public officials and their loved ones endure.
We have also seen assassination attempts on the life of President Donald Trump; the arson targeting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence and family; the heartbreaking assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the attempted assassination of State 
Senator John Hoffman and his wife.
And now, we are horrified by the murder of Charlie Kirk, targeted while exercising his right to speak freely on a college campus.
All of these incidents must be denounced unequivocally and without qualification.
Violence has no place in our political process, in our communities, or in our country.
At the same time, we have a solemn responsibility to act.
Congress must work with state and local leaders, law enforcement, and communities to ensure the security of Members, staff, and constituents alike--so that all Americans may fully participate in civic life without fear.
That also means we must address the epidemic of gun violence in our country to keep our children and their families safe.
Let us be clear: political differences must be resolved at the ballot box and through dialogue, never through the barrel of a gun or the threat of violence.
The strength of our democracy lies not in unanimity, but in the peaceful contest of ideas.
Together, we must recommit to protecting that principle and the American
