Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Afghan American Community Organization on the celebration of their tenth anniversary on September 20, 2025.
For a decade, the Afghan American Community Organization has served as a trusted, compassionate partner to Afghan and Afghan American families--strengthening civic participation, expanding opportunity, and celebrating a rich cultural heritage that is now a vibrant part of my district and the American story.
Whether it has been English language and citizenship classes, youth mentorship and college readiness, small business advising, or workforce development, the Afghan American Community Organization has opened doors for thousands in the Afghan American community.
Its legal and resettlement clinics have helped newcomers navigate complex systems with dignity.
The mental-health and women's empowerment initiatives have provided care and community, and its cultural events have fostered understanding between neighbors.
When Afghans arrived in large numbers following the fall of Kabul, Afghan American Community Organization mobilized volunteers, partnered with faith and civic groups, and worked together with local, state, and federal agencies to secure housing, enroll children in school, connect families with health care, and ensure that no one was left behind.
On this milestone anniversary, I congratulate the Afghan American Community Organization Board, dedicated staff, volunteers, and community partners whose steadfast efforts made this achievement possible.
Their work reminds us that welcoming the newcomer and lifting our neighbors are enduring American values.
I congratulate them on ten years of service, and wish the Afghan American Community Organization continued success in the decades ahead.
