The Government are leading international efforts for a peace plan.
That involves the release of hostages, a ceasefire and the huge humanitarian response needed to prevent further death and destruction.
The recognition of Palestine as a state is an important step towards that, which is why the Prime Minister set out those plans as we approach the UNGA later this month.
I have personally long supported the recognition of Palestine, including last time Parliament was asked to give a view on the matter.
On Monday, in a two-hour  statement to the House, the Foreign Secretary updated Members on the steps we are taking to recognise the state of Palestine and made clear that unless the Israeli Government take urgent steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza and commit to a long-term peace, we will make that assessment before the leaders meet at the UN in New York.
We will, as ever, ensure that the House has a full opportunity to continue to discuss and scrutinise these very important decisions.
In February, my constituent’s son, Paul Holborn, won the men’s section of the 777 world marathon challenge.
That is seven marathons in seven continents in seven days.
He topped that off by then running the north pole marathon in July, and achieving grand slam status.
Paul is now preparing for his next challenge.
He plans to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in January, and then to pull a sled for 293 miles across the Arctic frozen tundra in February.
Throughout his journey, Paul has raised thousands for local charities, including £4,000 for Age UK in Sunderland.
Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Paul on his bravery and determination, and in wishing him the best of luck for his upcoming endeavours, where he will do not just the north-east proud, but the whole UK?
I absolutely join my hon.
Friend in congratulating Paul on his extraordinary achievements.
Quite honestly, I am exhausted just listening to what he is doing, let alone doing it myself.
