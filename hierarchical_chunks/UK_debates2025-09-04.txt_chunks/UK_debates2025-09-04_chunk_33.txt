I thank my hon.
Friend for her question.
She has been a resolute and steadfast champion for the Hillsborough families, and indeed for the justice she referred to.
As she knows, the Government, including the Prime Minister, have been working closely with the families, and I can confirm that the draft Bill will include a statutory duty of candour for public servants, with criminal sanctions for those who do not comply, and measures to decisively tackle the disparity between the state and bereaved families at inquests.
As to timing, I know that everyone is working extremely hard to get the legislation right.
The Government hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill to Parliament very soon.
