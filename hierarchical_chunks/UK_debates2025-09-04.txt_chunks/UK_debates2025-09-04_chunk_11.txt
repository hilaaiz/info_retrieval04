I welcome the fact that the rolling reporting of dry-day spills has become mandatory under our Government, but it has unfortunately laid bare the track record of South West Water, which is among the worst offenders on dry-day spills.
What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that companies such as South West Water feel the full force of the law with regard to dry-day spills?
