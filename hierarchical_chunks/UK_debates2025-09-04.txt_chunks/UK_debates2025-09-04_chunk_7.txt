I join  the hon.
Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Alison Hume)  in paying tribute to the firefighters, farmers, gamekeepers and everybody who has taken part in fighting the moorland fires in North Yorkshire, just over the border from my constituency.
Does the Minister agree about the huge importance of managing moorland?
Managed burning of moorland not only improves the ecological status of the moorland, but reduces the threat of wildfire.
I absolutely agree with the hon.
Gentleman and that is why the consultation has been taking place.
These are complicated issues, and sometimes controversial, but we all want to get those moorlands into a state where we are not subject to these dreadful fires.
