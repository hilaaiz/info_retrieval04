I thank the hon.
Lady for her important question, and I share her concern about the risks that microplastics may pose to the environment and human health.
That is why we are looking at all sources of pollution that enter our rivers, lakes and seas, but there is obviously more work to be done to improve our understanding.
The Environment Agency is collaborating with different sectors, including the water industry and National Highways, to increase our evidence base and knowledge of these materials.
