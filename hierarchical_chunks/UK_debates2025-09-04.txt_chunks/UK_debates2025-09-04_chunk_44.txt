In addition to business in the Chamber, there will be a debate on the hydrogen supply chain next Tuesday in Westminster Hall.
On  Thursday 11 September , there will be two debates: one on improving regulations for non-surgical aesthetic and cosmetic treatments, and one on consumer affairs.
On behalf of the Backbench Business Committee, I ask for early notice of the business we will be allocated in the week when we come back after the conference season, so that we can allocate time for many of the debates that are waiting.
Next week the London underground network is likely to grind to a halt, as the trade unions are calling out individual sections throughout that week.
The last time the unions went on strike, the Labour Mayor of London had to find £30 million to buy them off.
The Transport Secretary has long experience, having been Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, but as far as I am aware, she has not uttered a single word about what will happen next week.
Will the Leader of the House encourage the Transport Secretary to come to the House and let us know what will happen in London next week if the strike goes ahead?
I know we have Transport questions next Thursday, but frankly that is too late.
