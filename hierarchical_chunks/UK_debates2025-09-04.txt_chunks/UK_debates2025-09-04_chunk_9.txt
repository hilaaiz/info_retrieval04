I thank the Secretary of State for his answer and for his two visits to Bournemouth.
People still talk happily about his visit to the Hengistbury Head Outdoors centre.
I met recently with constituents in Bournemouth East who are calling for nationalisation as a way to improve accountability and investment in the water industry.
How does the Secretary of State see a path towards nationalisation sitting within his wider efforts to protect our waters?
