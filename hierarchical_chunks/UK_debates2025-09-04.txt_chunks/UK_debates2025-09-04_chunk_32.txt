Last year, 446 Crown court trials were ineffective because the prosecutor failed to attend.
Given that the Government are getting to grips with the backlog they inherited by increasing sitting days and through Brian Leveson’s proposals, is the Solicitor General concerned that the CPS also needs to step up to the plate?
What is she doing to ensure that that happens?
The CPS is indeed stepping up to the plate to play its role in reducing the backlog.
In line with the Government’s manifesto commitment, the CPS is exploring options for expanding the role of non-legal resources to support the system.
It has also set up the surge team that I referred to.
I can also confirm that the CPS is working with the judiciary, His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and other criminal justice system stakeholders on a range of local initiatives, including a trial blitz, case resolution courts and weekly listing meetings.
What steps she is taking with Cabinet colleagues to introduce a duty of candour.
I know how much work my hon.
Friend has been doing to support justice for Hillsborough families and indeed to push for a Hillsborough law.
As she knows, I am unable by convention to disclose whether the Law Officers are advising the Government—nor, of course, the content of any advice—but I know that colleagues are working to bring forward a Hillsborough law as soon as possible.
The families have been campaigning for a Hillsborough law for 36 years, and their demand has always been clear: a law with a duty of candour at its heart.
There have been too many broken promises and missed deadlines.
Can the Solicitor General tell me when the Government will bring forward the Hillsborough law?
Will it honour the promises made to victims of state cover-ups and finally deliver justice for the 97?
