I thank the Solicitor General for what she is personally trying to do, and indeed the rest of the Government.
If we are to prosecute people smugglers effectively, we need global action.
May I focus her attention on the Republic of Ireland?
We have a porous border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the people smuggling gangs are using that without any inhibitions whatsoever.
What has been done with the Republic of Ireland to ensure that that does not happen?
