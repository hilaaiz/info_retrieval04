I thank the Solicitor General for that answer.
The courts system and all the associated IT have been left in the most catastrophic state by the previous Conservative Government.
It is shocking that £2 billion was spent on a civil courts IT system that cannot even handle litigation where there is more than one claimant or defendant, which is basic and normal.
The particular issue that worries me today, though, is the Legal Aid Agency and the state of its IT system; as she will know, it was the subject of a cyber-attack in the spring.
Could she update us on that situation and on any potential plans to build back better?
