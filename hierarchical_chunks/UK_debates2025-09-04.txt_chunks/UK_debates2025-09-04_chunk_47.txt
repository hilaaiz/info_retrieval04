I thank the hon.
Lady for raising the issues around fair funding.
I know this is a really important matter for a number of colleagues.
She will be aware that the Deputy Prime Minister has ensured a record local government funding settlement, but the hon.
Lady is absolutely right: the devil is in the detail and we need to ensure that funding follows need.
I will certainly arrange for her to have a meeting with the Minister.
