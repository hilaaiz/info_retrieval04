The Secretary of State has inadvertently advanced the same argument that he did on  21 July  on “Channel 4 News”.
Will he clarify that pollution levels under publicly owned Scottish Water are substantially better than those under privately owned English water companies?
Will he recognise that Scottish bill payers pay lower bills and that Scottish Water’s borrowing is sustainable and consistent with the value and quality of Scotland’s water?
The hon.
Gentleman is showing why the problem persists—if the SNP does not recognise the problem, there is no way that it can fix it.
I have published the data and I stand by it: pollution under the SNP in Scotland is even worse than it was under the Tories in England.
He should be thoroughly ashamed of what he is doing to the beautiful countryside of the country that he represents.
