I thank my hon.
Friend for her powerful contribution.
I join her in expressing sympathy for all those who have been affected and I thank all those involved in fighting those fires.
This is a cross-governmental issue.
Wildfire and fire and rescue services are the responsibility of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but my hon.
Friend will be aware that we have been consulting on ending locational burning to improve moorland resilience to wildfire.
We know that restoring peatlands with diverse plant species prevents the over-dominance of heather and molinia, which dry out peat and increase the risk of fire.
Frankly, recent wildfires show just how degraded our peatlands have become.
