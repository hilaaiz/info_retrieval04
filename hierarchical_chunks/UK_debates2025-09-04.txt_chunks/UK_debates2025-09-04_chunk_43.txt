I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the Backbench Business for next week.
She will know that 50 Back Benchers were frustrated on Monday that they were not able to debate transport inequalities.
Obviously there were important statements—we understand that—but will she consider giving that debate protected time next week, so that all those who wish to contribute can do so, rather than being confined to about 30 seconds each if the debate is squeezed in next week?
