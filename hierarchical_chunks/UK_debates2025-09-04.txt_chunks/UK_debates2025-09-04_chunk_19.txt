I welcome the Government’s steps to deter people smuggling and end the exploitation of vulnerable people.
I also want to highlight the work that Wolverhampton City of Sanctuary does in my constituency to help refugees rebuild their lives.
As the Home Secretary confirmed only this week, one of the Government’s major reforms is developing controlled and managed routes for genuine refugees.
Does the Solicitor General agree that having safe and legal routes for asylum seekers is a crucial step in undermining the business model of the people smuggling gangs?
