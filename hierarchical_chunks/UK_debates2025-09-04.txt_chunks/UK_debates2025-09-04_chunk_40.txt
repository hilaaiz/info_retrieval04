Yesterday at Prime Minister’s questions, the Prime Minister told the leader of my party, my right hon.
Friend  the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Ed Davey) , that the situation in Gaza was “horrifying” and “a man-made famine”.
We agree.
More than 60,000 Palestinians are estimated to have been killed in the conflict.
Just yesterday, five adults and a child were reported to have died of malnutrition, as a direct consequence of the Israeli Government’s man-made famine and illegal restrictions on aid entering the strip.
It has been the deadliest war ever for journalists, with at least 192 killed by Israeli forces, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and 20 Israeli hostages are still thought to be alive and brutally held by Hamas terrorists.
Across the House, we have begged the Government to do more to help end the conflict, to save the lives of the hostages and Gaza’s civilians.
Indeed, it is something that constituents write to me and undoubtedly all Members about on a daily basis, yet action has been excruciatingly slow.
In July, the Prime Minister set a deadline for further action.
He said that “the UK will recognise the state of Palestine by the United Nations General Assembly in September unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term, sustainable peace”.
That deadline is fast approaching: the UN General Assembly convenes in less than a week.
The House should surely have the right to debate and vote on this important step.
Recognising that Parliament will break for conference recess in less than two weeks, will the Leader of the House grant a full debate in Government time before then to show the strength of support for the recognition of the state of Palestine in this House?
