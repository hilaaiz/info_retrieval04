I gently say to my hon.
Friend the Minister that some kinds of offences can and should be singled out.
Actually, that is exactly what we have done with the strategy on violence against women and girls, with the landmark Domestic Abuse Act 2021, because we have to recognise that sexual offences against women have a particular personal, traumatic impact, and we need to do more.
However, I was pleased to hear her single out Avon and Somerset police, and I pay tribute to Chief Constable Sarah Crew, who is the most amazing woman and has spearheaded efforts in that police force to ensure victims are treated sensitively, appropriately and swiftly.
The same cannot be said about every police force.
We are now some four months or so on from the Casey review into the Metropolitan police, and too many women still say to me that they do not want to report a crime against them to the Met because they have no confidence that it will be treated fairly and properly, and that they will not end up being the ones on trial.
What more can my hon.
Friend the Minister do to instil, as she put it, “confidence to report crimes”, when it comes to our capital’s police force?
I am grateful to my right hon.
Friend; I know she does great work in this area.
I too have been thoroughly impressed at my many meetings with Sarah Crew.
She really is a breath of fresh air and I put a lot of hope in the way that she has managed to roll out new ideas about how to police this area.
Of course these are heinous crimes and very special offences.
In relation to the Metropolitan police, I have met the commissioner and the deputy commissioner, and I sense there is a change.
The oil tanker is moving.
At the moment, it is moving too slowly; it needs to move faster.
I am optimistic about the new training that new officers are receiving.
The emphasis on specialist trained officers is encouraging and I am sure we will see progress.
