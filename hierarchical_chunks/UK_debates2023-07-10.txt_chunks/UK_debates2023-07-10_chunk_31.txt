I thank the right hon.
Lady for her incisive questions.
I suggest that the issue is about specialism, rather than specialist units.
All police forces have different operational ways of working.
She will recall the evidence of Sarah Crew, who said that there is no quick fix for each particular force.
She said that every force must look closely at the way they are operating.
However, specialism of training is key.
The National Police Chiefs’ Council is very firmly looking at what will  be rolled out.
The modules in relation to domestic abuse and to rape and serious sexual offences are being updated.
The right hon.
Lady is quite right to point to training, as that is important.
She mentions data, which is also very important.
We are improving and collecting more data—far more than has been collected previously, as far as I am advised.
I am optimistic that we are working together.
Her Committee plays a vital role in assisting the experts and informing the way that they work.
