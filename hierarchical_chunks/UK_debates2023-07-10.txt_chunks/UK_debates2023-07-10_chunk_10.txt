I thank my hon.
Friend very much for her question.
She is an absolutely superb advocate for her constituents and the city of Wolverhampton.
I am pleased to tell her that the investment zone programme is under way; a shortlist of eight places in England selected for inclusion in the programme was announced in the spring Budget, and the west midlands is one of them.
We are co-developing proposals, and we will look very carefully at her proposal, for the reasons that she set out.
