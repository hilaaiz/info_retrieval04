I thank my hon.
Friend for bringing this vital issue to our attention on the Floor of the House.
Of course, we expect local authorities to work together to tackle homelessness and to alleviate those pressures on the most vulnerable people.
It is right for his Labour council to work with any other council that has responsibility for that.
