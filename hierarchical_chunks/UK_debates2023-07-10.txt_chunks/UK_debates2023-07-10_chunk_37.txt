On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
After a Westminster Hall debate on  4 July , in which the House reasserted its commitment to never forget the genocide of Srebrenica and the need to  safeguard the Dayton agreement, I was deeply alarmed to see that my hon.
Friend  the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns) , the Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was threatened by the President of Serbia, who said in response to her speech: “we are already conducting an investigation against you to see what you are doing, to see who is paying you, and to see why you are putting the Republic of Serbia in such a position.
If the Government of Great Britain is not willing to react, it is not a problem; we will be forced to react.”
That is an unacceptable statement from a Head of State.
It is not just a threat to my hon.
Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton but an intimidation tactic against all MPs.
Can you reassure me, Mr Speaker, that no pressure brought to bear outside this place, especially by foreign Governments, will ever endanger the security or privacy of MPs, and that the full weight of Parliament will be used to prevent and dissuade bullying tactics and ensure that MPs can speak the truth?
Do you believe, Mr Speaker, that this is a moment at which the Serbian ambassador should be called to explain that position and that statement?
