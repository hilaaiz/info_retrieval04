What assessment he has made of the strength of the Union.
The Union, and support for the Union, is strong, and I was delighted to note that, in the most recent opinion polls, support for independence in Scotland is plummeting.
That is a very interesting definition of “plummeting”, when that support consistently remains higher than it was in the independence referendum of 2014.
We were told during that campaign and afterwards that Scotland would have one of the most powerful wee devolved sub-state legislatures in the entire world, if not the universe, so what is the Government’s baseline for that?
Can the Secretary of State give us some examples of Parliaments that are more or less powerful than the Scottish Parliament?
I would just note that, at the referendum to which the hon.
Member refers, support for independence was at 45%, but it is currently at 37% in the polls, and 37 is eight less than 45.
More broadly, the Scottish Parliament has significant powers.
It is a pity that the Scottish Government do not use them and, unfortunately, as a result Scotland’s people are let down when it comes to education, where Scotland is tumbling down.
Scotland, sadly, does not have the reforms that we have had in England, which have seen us rise up international league tables.
It used to be the case that Scotland’s education system was the pride of the globe, but it is now England that has the best readers of the western world.
