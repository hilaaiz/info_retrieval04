I thank the hon.
Lady for those comments.
I am afraid that I do not accept that the work has been piecemeal.
This is a sea change in how the model is being operated.
I have done some research, my civil servants have done some research, and I have spoken to the academics and the people who meet victims all the time.
There is no other country in the world, that I can find, that has a similar operating model.
Over 50 academics have worked tirelessly with some excellent officers.
This is not piecemeal; this is a sea change, but there is a lot more to do.
