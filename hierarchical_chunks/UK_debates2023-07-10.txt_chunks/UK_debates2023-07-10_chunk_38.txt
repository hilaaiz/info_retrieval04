I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving notice of his point of order.
It is fundamentally a constitutional principle that MPs should be able to speak freely in proceedings of this House.
Threats to Members doing their jobs are totally unacceptable, whoever makes them.
Beyond that, I remind him that we do not discuss operational security matters in public, and he would not expect me to go further than that, but I will say that, of course, we take this seriously, and Members should, no matter their position—be they a Back Bencher or a Chair of a Select Committee—be able to speak out openly and freely without intimidation.
