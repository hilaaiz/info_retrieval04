I thank the hon.
Gentleman for giving notice of his point of order.
As he says, people are entitled to make their views known inside and outside this House, but threats to Members are very real, and those who comment should consider the potential effects of their words before posting injudiciously, rather than afterwards.
I take this very seriously.
When he texted me on Friday, I also spoke to people about security issues.
I will not go into that part of it, but he can rest assured that we will defend Members on both sides of the House.
Nobody should be threatened as they carry out their duties.
We will certainly not forget those who were murdered carrying out their duties.
