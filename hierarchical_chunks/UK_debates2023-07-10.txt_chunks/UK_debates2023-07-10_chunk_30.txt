I associate myself with the words of the Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee,  the right hon.
Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) .
I agree with everything that she just said.
More than a year ago, the Home Affairs Committee recommended that all police forces should establish specialist rape investigation teams.
We know that they produce better decision making, can address delays and improve communication with victims and the CPS.
We also urged the Government to collect and publish data on the number of police officers in each force with specialist rape and serious sexual offence training.
Can the Minister explain why specialist rape investigation teams are still not in place in every police force and what she will do about that?
Can she confirm how many serving police officers, as of today, have received specialist training on rape and serious sexual assault?
What proportion of the 20,000 new recruits will also receive that specialist training?
