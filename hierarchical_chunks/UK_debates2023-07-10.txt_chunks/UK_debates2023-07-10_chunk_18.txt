Do the Government realise how absurd all of this sounds?
Their own flagship Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill, which is currently making its way through the House of Lords, has measures in it to block new homes from being built, and yet the Minister stands here berating councils for getting in the way.
All of this is happening because Conservative Back Benchers have more control of housing policy than their Government.
So when the local Conservative MP in Cambridge says that his latest scheme “will not happen”, he is probably right, is he not?
I do not quite know how to give that a serious response.
I have just set out in huge detail all the work backed by public funding—taxpayers’ money—going into delivering the houses that people need up and down the country.
As far as I can see, the only people blocking housing development are those such as the hon.
Lady, who is objecting to developments in her own constituency.
It is literally in the Government’s own Bill—they are trying to block new houses from being built.
They have had 17 housing Ministers and three planning overhauls, and house building is at its lowest level for a generation.
Which clause?
