I thank the Minister very much for her responses.
One of the key issues is for urgent planning decisions to be made.
The Minister has a keen interest in Northern Ireland, where the population has risen by about 100,000 up to 1.9 million.
One thing that needs to be done is on infrastructure decisions, which need to be made here nationally, not regionally.
What discussions has she had with the Northern Ireland Assembly to ensure that those decisions can be made to the benefit of all of us in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?
