I thank my hon.
Friend for highlighting the reckless behaviour of his Liberal Democrat-run council.
I completely agree that it is a disgraceful state of affairs.
The council should be using that funding secured to deliver the affordable housing that his residents rightly need and deserve.
As he suggested, Homes England will definitely not be contributing to backfilling that need.
