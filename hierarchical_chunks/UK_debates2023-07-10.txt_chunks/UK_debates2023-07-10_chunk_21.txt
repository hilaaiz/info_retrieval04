The Secretary of State said that he had the noble aim of abolishing the feudal leasehold system.
Could he update the House on his progress on the abolishment of that feudal system?
It will be in the King’s Speech, God willing.
The A38 is the main route to the largest city on the Devon and Cornwall peninsula.
This nationally significant  route needs substantial work between Carkeel and Trerulefoot in my constituency.
What work is the Department doing with the Department for Transport to make that a reality?
My hon.
Friend highlights the importance of nationally significant infrastructure programmes all across the country.
It is vital that we speed up those projects and make sure that they deliver for local people more quickly.
My hon.
Friend is a champion for the A38; I know that she will be talking to the Department for Transport, and I am happy to do so as well.
