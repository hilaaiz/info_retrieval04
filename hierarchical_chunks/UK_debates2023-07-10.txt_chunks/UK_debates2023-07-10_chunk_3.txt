The Minister understands that regeneration of our high streets is key to the levelling up of our communities, yet she is aware that in Gosport that is being paralysed by unfair council tax being slapped on houses in multiple occupancy—very high-quality ones that are key to the future regeneration of our high street.
As part of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Bill, the Secretary of State launched a consultation to address that question, but it concluded weeks ago and we still have not had the result.
When will it be published?
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend for her engagement with me and the Secretary of State on that vital issue.
Unfortunately, I cannot give her a specific date right now, but I will meet her as soon as we have the result in place, because I realise it is a vital issue that we need to address.
I am grateful to my hon.
Friend and to my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for recent visits to Mansfield and the east midlands to support the many levelling-up projects we have going on in our region, from freeports to development companies, integrated rail plans, investment zones and levelling-up and towns fund projects, including in Mansfield.
All that amounts to billions of pounds.
What impact does my hon.
Friend think that will have on my constituency?
My hon.
Friend has done a great job of highlighting the incredible level of support going to Mansfield and the wider east midlands.
A lot of that is down to great local leadership from him and his colleagues.
That will have an enormous impact on the people living in the east midlands and on their opportunities to get on in life, which ultimately is what levelling up is all about.
