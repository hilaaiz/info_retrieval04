Robert Willard was born in Batavia, New York and raised in the Town of Attica in Wyoming County, New York, and began his service as a volunteer in 1973 with the Attica Fire Department.
Throughout his years with the Attica Fire Department, he has responded to countless numbers of ambulance and fire responses.
His excellent service has earned him the title of Fire Chief along with numerous other positions within the department.
Robert worked for Westinghouse until its closure and spent his later years working for the Village of Attica before his retirement.
Along with his passion for the fire department, Jay enjoys traveling in his spare time.
Robert is a true family man.
He is married to his wife Kathy, and they have two children and three grandchildren.
When he is not spending time with his family, Robert enjoys hunting and camping.
I thank Robert Willard for his incredible volunteer service providing protection to local homeowners, farmers, businesses, and schools in Wyoming County, New York.
His many years of dedication have made the community a better place to live, and I wish him all the best in his many more years serving in the Attica Fire Department. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Texas College in Tyler, Texas commemorating its 130th anniversary.
Founded in 1894, Texas College was formed by ministers of the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church to educate African-American students excluded from the university system of Texas at the time.
Since its eventual charter in 1907, Texas College has aimed to form the next generation in theology, music, teaching and commercial training as well as agricultural and mechanical sciences.
Today, Texas College inspires intellectual, spiritual, moral, and social development, empowering graduates to engage in life-long learning, leadership, and service.
For generations, the college has formed upright, intelligent citizens who honor God through their knowledge, work, and families.
I am proud to see the many accomplishments that Texas College has made since its inception.
I am equally grateful to have Texas College as an integral part of the Tyler community and broader East Texas region.
I look forward to another 130 years of success from the faculty and staff at Texas College as they celebrate their anniversary this month. ____________________

KAREN HOSLER ______ of minnesota in the house of representatives Mr. PHILLIPS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Karen Hosler, a distinguished Baltimore Sun correspondent whose beats included Congress and the White House.
Karen died on February 1 of this year, and it is an understatement to say that Karen lived life to its absolute fullest during her 75 years on this earth.
Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet Karen, but I wish that I had.
Those that worked with and knew her said, ``Karen always brightened up a room with her cheerfulness, her wonderful laughter, her joy for life and her deep commitment to first-rate journalism done the right way . . .
She loved reporting on politics, be it Annapolis city government, the governor and General Assembly or the White House and Congress.
Ms. Hosler earned a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1970 from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she was on the staff of The Diamondback, the campus newspaper.
