Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor State Senator Betty Holzendorf, a Jacksonville native who dedicated her life to improving the lives of all Northeast Floridians.
At the age of 84, Senator Holzendorf passed away on February 29, leaving behind legions of supporters and friends who were lucky enough to have known her bright spirit.
A mainstay of Florida politics whose long career spanned across both chambers of the legislature, Senator Holzendorf was a true woman of the people who never stopped fighting for her constituents.
One of Senator Holzendorf's greatest passions was fundraising for universities and scholarships in Northeast Florida.
As a science teacher, Betty knew that Florida is only as strong as its youth, so she championed education as an avenue to brighten the minds and futures of her constituents.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the long and fruitful life of Senator Holzendorf, along with offering our deepest condolences to her friends and family. ____________________
