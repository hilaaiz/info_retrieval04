Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to include in the Record the eulogy of a great American, Raymond Noel Ramsey, who epitomized what a citizen who gives back to his community, state, and Nation is all about.
On behalf of Peg, Noele, Kelly, Melanie.
and the entire Ramsey family, thank you for being here for Ray.
How about that obituary and the prayer card!
Ever the fashion statement, wasn't he, with those bright pastels and those shirts, that were a reflection of his personality.
Yesterday was quite an afternoon and quite a tribute.
It was good to see old East Hartford on display--the outpour of love and respect for a man who lived it.
Now we know he had a great reception committee up there with Billy Mud, Fred Kurtz, Fred Leone, and Jimmy Deleo singing--I'm sure--as he entered the gates of Heaven.
As Ray would often remind the faint of heart, life is not a dress rehearsal.
He embodied both the right attitude and the appetite for a life well lived.
Talking with several of you at the wake, and over the past few days, about stories of Ray and what he would want this service to be--Father, I have to start with a disclaimer here--Craig Jordan, Kevin Brown, and numerous others want to be clear that the funniest Rammer stories are not suitable for church or in mixed company.
I think it's safe to say he was a guy's guy.
It was abundantly clear from all, that he would want an upbeat sendoff on his next journey.
First and foremost, and most of all, the shared empathy, respect, and love for Peg and his three angels, Noele, Kelly and Melanie.
At the wake it was hard viewing and watching them hold back the tears, the grieving and the mourning and with each person.
A memory of a man whose actions were bigger than life, knowing even in this difficult moment, what Ray would want is to celebrate his journey and the relationships he shared with all of you.
I know I'm stating the obvious, as so many of you have spoken of his lifelong love and relationship with Peg.
Many of you have attested that they were the quintessential couple.
They simply go together well, Ray and Peg.
Peg and Ray.
No gathering was complete without them--and you talk about opposites!
Yet there was a greater bond that held them together, certainly Noele, Kelly, and Melanie, but it was their great faith and devotion to each other that always resonated.
Many of you said Ray was always there for you, no matter how trivial or important.
How many of you can recall being with Ray into the wee hours of the morning,

partaking in the elixirs of life and thinking--as I have--there's no way after this that he gets up and takes Peg to mass in the morning-- only to be astonished again by him being there for her and their faith, dependable and rock solid.
That's love and devotion.
That's Ray and Peg.
Comradery is a great term about a gathering of friends, and as Nick Olivia pointed out, with Ray, those gatherings were always punctuated by having fun and enjoying one another's company, whether at the Hose Club, the Dirty Dozen, the F&L Dinners, or innumerable political events, Ray and a good time were synonymous.
He was always a doer, never a complainer and put everyone else first.
His last trip to Ireland is an epic example.
A trip he had planned for some time with Nick and Vita, Bruce and Wendy, and he and Peg.
