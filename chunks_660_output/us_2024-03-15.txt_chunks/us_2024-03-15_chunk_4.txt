Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pine Ridge Baptist Church in Kountze, Texas, on its 150th year of ministry to the families and residents of Hardin County.
Pine Ridge Baptist Church was chartered in 1874 by Rev. D.M. Jordan and his wife, Becky; W.J. Jordan; George B. Jordan and his wife, Sultana; Jessie Jordan and his wife, Missouri; Jordan Daniels; Rev. J.W. Teel and his wife, Milley; Mandy Jordan Shaw Cotton; Mary Jane Jordan Teel; Aletha Laird Herrington; and Thomas Laird.
Land for the new church was donated by Rev. D.M. Jordan and constructed out of rough pine lumber.
In its early years, homemade benches lined the walls for seating, handmade quilts were placed on the floor so children could relax or sleep during longer sermons, and church baptisms were held in Little Pine Island Bayou.
Following Rev. Jordan's death in 1906, his son-in-law, Rev. J.W. Teel, took on the role, and Pine Ridge has been led by many devoted pastors since.
The church congregation has also grown exponentially over the past 150 years, with membership currently at 240 believers.
Pine Ridge owes much of its preserved history to a man named Nathan G. Jordan, who joined the church in the late 1890s.
While serving as the church's second clerk, Nathan's meticulous recordkeeping is responsible for the many documents, obituaries, meeting minutes, and biographical information of the area's early settlers and church members still available today.
Over the past 150 years, the church and its congregation have been unwavering in their commitment to sharing the good news of salvation with all who seek to know God.
With its long history of service and leadership to the community, Pine Ridge Baptist Church continues to uphold the ideals and traditions of its founders.
I offer my most sincere congratulations on this significant milestone and wish them continued prosperity as they keep to their mission of serving the community as the hands and feet of Jesus Christ. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7521, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.
I agree with my colleagues that we must do more to protect personal information online, safeguard national security from foreign adversaries, and protect our electoral system from foreign interference, but this bill is far from the comprehensive approach our increasingly connected world needs.
I also have serious concerns with the scope of the legislation and open constitutional questions about the path forward for its implementation.
Targeting only one foreign adversary-controlled application will not fully protect consumers' data in our nation.
Energy & Commerce Committee Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers and Ranking Member Pallone have already advanced bipartisan, comprehensive data privacy legislation, and the Biden Administration has issued an Executive Order to Protect Americans' Sensitive Personal Data.
