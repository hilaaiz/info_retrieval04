Mr. Speaker, the Isle of Eight Flags, Fernandina Beach, Florida is home to many great things, whether it be the beaches, parks, or our pirate legacy; now we are also home to a wrestling state champion.
I rise today to celebrate Enzo Gamba, a Fernandina Beach High School Pirate from my hometown of Fernandina Beach who recently won the Florida High School Athletic Association wrestling championships.
Enzo, just like the Fernandina Beach pirates of old, went for the treasure and brought home gold.
Competing in Class 1A at the 157-pound division, Enzo won the final by decision, 8-4.
Not only did this victory win him a state championship, but it also capped off an undefeated season for Enzo.
Fifty-four matches, Fifty-four victories.
Enzo was phenomenal all season long and winning the state championship firmly lands him on the map as one of the all-time great Pirate athletes.
We are exceptionally proud of this young man.
The Pirates team, led by Coach Eric Kubatzke, brought home four individual state medals in total at the wrestling championships.
All of Fernandina Beach High School, under the leadership of Principal Chris Webber, played a role in this success.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Fernandina Beach and Florida's 4th Congressional District, I ask that my colleagues in Congress join me in congratulating Enzo on this remarkable achievement. ____________________

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res.
1065, Denouncing the Biden administration's immigration policies.
House Republicans have again brought to the House Floor a partisan messaging resolution that does nothing to begin to fix our broken immigration system.
If House Republicans were serious about solving the problems at our southern border, they would negotiate and work to pass bipartisan legislation that could be approved by both the House and the Senate and be signed into law by President Biden.
Instead, they continue to attack the current administration to gain cheap political points.
As I've said many times this Congress, House Republicans continue to waste our time and resources on messaging bills like this do-nothing resolution, instead of working together with Democrats to solve problems for the American people. ____________________
