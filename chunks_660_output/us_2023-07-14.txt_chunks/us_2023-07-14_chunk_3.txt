GREGORY A. SUTTON ______ HON.
SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
of georgia in the house of representatives Mr. BISHOP of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an outstanding mentor, dedicated servant leader, faithful servant of God and dear friend of longstanding, the Reverend Dr. Gregory A. Sutton.
Dr. Sutton will be honored for his 53 years of faithful service at Jackson Memorial Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on Sunday, July 16, 2023, at 10:30 am.
Dr. Sutton was born in Atlanta, Georgia.
He was raised among great educators, philosophers, and theologians.
Dr. Sutton was always concerned about the welfare of others and used his voice to speak out on pressing issues of the day.
He began to preach the Gospel at the young age of 16.
This would lay the blueprint for his ministry and his destiny--the boy, the preacher, the man, and the visionary.
Dr. Sutton began preaching the Gospel while he was still in high school and accepted the calling to preach a growing church called Jackson Memorial at the age of 18, where he has pastored for 53 years.
Through his leadership, the church has continued to expand its membership and physical footprint.
Dr. Sutton has seen the expansion of the church's membership to over 6,000 members and he has overseen the construction of 2 new edifices for the church.
Dr. Sutton's ministry is indeed a global ministry and reaches people where they are across the world.
The scripture tells us in Proverbs, ``that the people perish where there is no vision.''
Dr. Sutton is indeed a visionary and has used his ministry to reach people beyond the church walls.
He has dedicated himself to the awareness, protection, and spiritual development of youth.
Dr. Sutton was the originator of the phrase, ``Stop the Violence, Save the Youth.''
Cementing his commitment to young people and their spiritual futures, Pastor Sutton was the first pastor in the Atlanta area to open his church for prayer for students before school.
He also reaches out and incorporates the needs of his elderly parishioners in his ministry.
Dr. Sutton has a complete ministry that attempts to reach many different groups for Christ to include those that are in prison, the homebound, the homeless, the low income and the disenfranchised.
He uses his Weekly Television Broadcast, ``Now is the Time,'' to reach those who would not otherwise be reachable.
Dr. George Washington Carver once said that ``How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young; compassionate with the aged; sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life you will have been all of these.''
Dr. Sutton is acutely aware that for the Kingdom of God to be manifested in this world, it is imperative that

people from all walks of life be brought into the fold and be made to feel that they matter and that Jesus Loves them.
Dr. Sutton's ministry is truly a Matthew 25 type of ministry.
Even amid his various ministerial duties, Dr. Sutton finds time to serve his community at large.
It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we occupy here on this earth.''
Dr. Sutton has paid his rent and he has paid it well.
He serves on the board of directors of many social and civic organizations to include the Board of Ministers of Morehouse College.
