Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice (NABCJ) on their 50th Anniversary.
The mission of the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice is to act upon the needs, concerns, and contributions of African Americans and other people of color as they relate to the administration of equal justice.
This milestone of NABCJ advancing justice for 50 years signifies decades of positive change and a commitment to criminal justice as a fundamental aspect of our democracy.
At the heart of NABCJ is its dedicated members, who consist of criminal justice professionals including those in law enforcement, corrections, courts, social services', academia as well as religious and community leaders.
They work diligently to research relevant legislation and focus attention on improving law enforcement and our criminal justice system through evidence-based policies.
Their strong commitment to respect the dignity of all humans contributes to the NABCJ's rich history of excellence and integrity.
The 400 Years African American History Commission, created by Congress in 2017, has been heavily engaged with NABCJ through 11 student chapters of the organization at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
Additionally, the National Alliance of Faith and Justice, first formed as a committee of the NABCJ, was founded and has successfully grown over the last 20 years.
The establishment of these relationships have helped pave the way for African Americans and other people of color to receive equal justice under the law.
The National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice has a long history of promoting evidence-based strategies that more effectively address crime and keeping America's communities safe.
I was grateful for NABCJ's support of my Youth Prison Reduction through Mentoring, Intervention, Support and Education (Youth PROMISE) Act, which I first introduced in 2007 to help communities develop and implement evidence- based strategies to reduce youth violence and delinquency.
Provisions of the Youth PROMISE Act were ultimately enacted in the Juvenile Justice Reform Act of 2018, and it would not have been possible without the work and support of organizations like NABCJ.
Mr. Speaker, NABCJ embodies what it means to fight for ``liberty and justice for all.''
It is my pleasure to congratulate the National Association of Blacks in Criminal Justice on the many hard-fought battles won since its inception 50 years ago and wish the organization many more years of success. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the lives of the Oddo brothers, 6 men who courageously served their country as naval seamen following the outbreak of WWII.
Their father, Charles Oddo, was a Sicilian immigrant who settled in Bellevue, Ohio with his wife Mary.
They raised their sons to acknowledge the prestige and privilege of being American citizens.
Richard, William, Charles, Samuel, Carl, and James Oddo all faithfully served their nation, and are believed to be the largest set of siblings to serve in the U.S. Navy.
Thankfully, all 6 brothers returned home safely to start their lives in their hometown after their honorable service, where the Oddo family still gathers today.
Saturday, they will be honored with a plaque at the Dr. Jackson Commemorative Plaque Wall within the Navy memorial.
More than 2 dozen family and friends will be in attendance to pay tribute to their heroism.
Ohio salutes these exceptional men, who continued to serve their families, neighbors, and communities throughout their lives. ____________________
