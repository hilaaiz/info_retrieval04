Mr. Speaker, I rise today to posthumously honor Mr. Robb Lally, a dedicated public servant and volunteer for more than 35 years.
Robert (Robb) Lally entered the seminary at a young age and as a deacon, served in a Catholic Parish.
After finishing seminary school, Mr. Lally continued to help and aid those in need through his work with the Franciscans at Arch Street, and later for the Salvation Army.
In 1988, Robb Lally headed to San Diego to work with the founder of the Alpha Project, a non-profit human services organization that serves over 4,000 men, women and children daily.
As director, he empowered individuals, families and communities by providing work, recovery and support services to those who were motivated to change their lives and achieve self-sufficiency.
During his tenure, Robb was instrumental in the overall mission and growth of the organization and had assisted with over 1,000 apartment units that were preserved and created.
On June 7, 2023, Robb's life and legacy were honored at a Celebration of Life in San Diego, CA.
On behalf of the residents of California's 52nd Congressional District, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family of Robb Lally.
His legacy is felt, and his presence will be greatly missed. ____________________
