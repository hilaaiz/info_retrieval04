It has been said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we occupy here on this earth.''
Dr. Sutton has paid his rent and he has paid it well.
He serves on the board of directors of many social and civic organizations to include the Board of Ministers of Morehouse College.
Reverend Dr. Gregory Sutton has achieved much in life, but none of it would have been possible without the grace of God and the love and support of this wife, First Lady Gail Sutton; his children, Theresa, Tony, Keisha, and LaQuay; his 3 grandchildren and other family members.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join my wife, Vivian, and I; along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in honoring and commending the Reverend Dr. Gregory A. Sutton for 53 years of dedicated service to his God, Jackson Memorial Baptist Church and humankind.
Moreover, we pray God's continued blessings upon him, his ministry, and his family in the weeks, months, and years ahead. ____________________

JOHN HARRIS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. John Harris for his incredible contributions to the Central Valley and to wish him a very happy 80th birthday.
A native of Five Points, Mr. Harris has dedicated his life to California's agricultural industry.
Following his graduation from Bullard High School, Mr. Harris earned a degree in Agricultural Production from the University of California, Davis and served for 2 years as an artillery officer in the U.S. Army.
Mr. Harris returned to his family farm where he would dedicate the next 5 decades to building Harris Farms into one of the largest agribusinesses in the nation.
Mr. Harris and his family's leadership in the agricultural industry spans more than 100 years--a true testament to their commitment to their work and community.
After his father Jack Harris' passing in 1981, John Harris became the owner and Chief Executive Officer of Harris Farms.
Under the leadership of his grandfather, father, and now Mr. Harris, Harris Farms has become a staple of the Central Valley.
Under Mr. Harris' leadership, the family operation has grown to span over 17,000 acres and produces a wide variety of crops annually--including lettuce, onions, garlic, almonds, pistachios, wine grapes, cotton, and citrus.
Perhaps the most well-known undertaking by Mr. Harris throughout the Central Valley is Harris Ranch Beef Company, California's largest fed cattle processor that produces nearly 200 million pounds of beef a year.
In addition to its impressive ranch and farming operations, Harris Farms has also become a popular destination for travelers and locals alike with its restaurant, butcher shop, and hotel.
Mr. Harris is also an accomplished horse breeder.
Harris Farms Horse Division has produced numerous champions including Eclipse Award Horses of the Year California Chrome and Tiznow.
Harris Farms has raised and campaigned 100s of top racehorses over the last 60 years.
