Mr. Jasper is the son of Samuel and Louise Jasper, devoted husband of Florence Harrell for 74 blessed years, and has reared three children, Gwendolyn Jasper Barnes, Nedra Jasper Alcorn, and the late Rev. Glenn Thomas Jasper.
He is the proud grandfather of six grandchildren and doting great-grandfather of eight great-grandchildren.
Mr. Jasper is a mighty man of service, and today, he continues to serve as my purpose-driven mentor and father figure.
He has encouraged me through all of my dreams throughout my career.
He is genuinely a patriarch to many who continue to cross his path and will always be a part of my journey as I lead the constituents of the 2nd Congressional District of Louisiana.
He is my dear friend and mentor, and I hope to be the mentor to others as he has been for me.
On this day, I wish my dear friend a Happy and Blessed Birthday, and may he see many more. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the massacre of hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly, Azerbaijan.
On February 26, 1992, Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people--including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly people--and left less than 2,000 survivors.
Hundreds more became disabled due to their injuries.
More than 100 children lost a parent and 25 children lost both parents.
At least 8 families were entirely killed.
This was the largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict Although a cease-fire was negotiated in 1994, it is my hope that Armenia and Azerbaijan can come together and find peace.
Long-term peace, security, and regional cooperation would greatly benefit the region and the world.
As Azerbaijanis throughout the world commemorate the massacre and continue to grieve the loss of loved ones, I hope they can find peace amidst this tragedy. ____________________
