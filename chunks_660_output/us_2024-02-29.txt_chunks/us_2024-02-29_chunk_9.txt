Wasting no time after graduation, Jay married his wife, Emily, and they took an active role in their community.
Jay became General Manager of Phil Long Ford in 1975 and rose up the ranks to President and CEO of the Phil Long Family of Dealerships.
Throughout his time in the automobile industry, Jay lived out the exemplary values of community and customer service as no one had done before him.
This emphasis on community service was the basis for how Jay used his time to make and do better for everyone around him.
Jay invested in the economic growth of his hometown of Trinidad as well as his adopted home of Colorado Springs throughout his time at Phil Long Ford.
Whether it was bringing automobile dealerships to new communities, creating academic scholarships, or helping build community-focused buildings, Jay took great pride in providing new opportunities and services for others.
Perhaps Jay's most impactful initiative was his creation of Mt. Carmel Health, Wellness and Community Center, Mt. Carmel Center of Excellence of Colorado, and Mt. Carmel Veterans Service Center which provides access to medical care and career change resources to our community and specifically our veterans.
Jay truly modeled for all of us how to properly serve in the most caring and generous way for those who have served our nation.
Jay and his wife Emily of more than fifty-five years enjoyed the blessings of their four children and eight grandchildren.
The legacy of the Cimino family continues to have an impact in the Pike Peak region following in the steps of Jay's vision and passion.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in Congress join me in honoring and celebrating the exemplary life of Jay Cimino whose fingerprints on the Pike Peak region will remain for the rest of time. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the Ulster County Chamber of Commerce's Leap of Kindness Day, on February 29, 2024.
Leap of Kindness Day was started in 2016 by the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce and has taken place on February 29th each Leap Year since.
The goal of the day has always been to spend the extra day we are given every four years doing acts of kindness.
This initiative has spread throughout the U.S., Canada, and Ireland to help those in need.
Leap of Kindness Day offers community members a chance to do something kind for someone else.
It motivates organizations, businesses, and communities to donate clothing, food, and money to local not-for-profit organizations.
This day keeps communities rooted in their values and spreads love to neighbors.
Growing up in Ulster County, I have seen how giving, dedicated, and kind my neighbors in the Hudson Valley are to those around them.
I hope that everyone can take part in such a great initiative, participating alongside their communities to help others, not just today but every day as we all work to spread more kindness.
I want to recognize Ward Todd and Jess Davis, President and Vice President of the Ulster County Regional Chamber of Commerce, for their work to make Leap of Kindness Day such a meaningful day for our community. ____________________
