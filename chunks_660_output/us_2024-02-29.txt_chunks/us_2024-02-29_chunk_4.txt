Date: 2024-02-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 37 Pages: E199 - E200 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E199-E200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING INDIANA STATE REPRESENTATIVE RENEE PACK ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Indiana State Representative for House District 92, Renee Pack.
Prior to joining the Indiana General Assembly, she served in the United States Army for five years, where she trained and served as a behavioral specialist and was also certified in drug and alcohol counseling.
Her training in the Army led her to a lifetime of service in our local schools, as a small business operator and now at the Indiana Statehouse.
Since being elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in 2020, Renee Pack has led with courage and strength.
She has become a champion for a more equal, and just environment for residents of her district and all Hoosiers.
Her service in the Army has led her to where she is today, serving as the Ranking Member on the Veterans Affairs and Public Safety Committee.
She also serves on the Committees on Commerce, Small Business and Economic Development, and Children and Human Affairs.
She has invested her years in public service to uplift those in need, strengthen veteran services in Indiana, and advocate for equality under the law.
Her service and training in the Army still have a lasting impact on her public service today.
Her collective experiences inspired her to author Indiana House Bill 1188, prohibiting lifetime limitations for Medicaid recipients receiving treatment for substance abuse and addiction.
Each month, our office recognizes women veterans who are often overlooked and underrepresented, especially women of color.
