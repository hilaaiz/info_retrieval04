Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the God-honoring life and generous impact of a Pikes Peak community stalwart--Gerald ``Jay'' Cimino, who died of natural causes on February 24, 2024, at the age of 87.
Jay truly was a pillar of the Pike's Peak region, both as a well- known business innovator in the automobile industry as well as a beloved and visionary community builder.
Jay's leadership of the Phil Long dealerships impacted the automobile industry across the state of Colorado and his love for others led to the creation of numerous veteran-focused groups such as Mt. Carmel Veterans Service Center.
Born in Trinidad, Colorado, Jay joined the Marine Corps out of high school.
Following his service to our Nation, he moved back to Trinidad and attended Trinidad State Jr College and finished his bachelor's degree in business administration at the University of Denver in 1960.
Wasting no time after graduation, Jay married his wife, Emily, and they took an active role in their community.
Jay became General Manager of Phil Long Ford in 1975 and rose up the ranks to President and CEO of the Phil Long Family of Dealerships.
Throughout his time in the automobile industry, Jay lived out the exemplary values of community and customer service as no one had done before him.
