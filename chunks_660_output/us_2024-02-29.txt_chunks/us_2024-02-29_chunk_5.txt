Her service and training in the Army still have a lasting impact on her public service today.
Her collective experiences inspired her to author Indiana House Bill 1188, prohibiting lifetime limitations for Medicaid recipients receiving treatment for substance abuse and addiction.
Each month, our office recognizes women veterans who are often overlooked and underrepresented, especially women of color.
African Americans have a long history serving our country, as the National Museum of African American History and Culture recognizes ``From the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, African Americans have served in the United States military.
In defending their country, they hoped to earn freedom and citizenship and contribute to a changed America where racial equality was possible.''
On this last day of Black History Month, I am proud to honor State Representative Renee Pack for her service to our country by giving her the Shelia Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero Award.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing State Representative and Hoosier Women Hero, Renee Pack.

Date: 2024-02-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 37 Pages: E196 - E197 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E196-E197] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF BISHOP CARLTON PEARSON ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. KHANNA.
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the selfless life of Bishop Carlton Pearson who passed away last November at the age of 70.
Bishop Carlton Pearson was an evangelist, ministry leader, author, and award- winning singer.
He was raised in San Diego, California with five siblings.
He is survived by them, his wife, and his two children.
An expert in many crafts, his congregation often praised his diverse passions and the limitless communities impacted by his work.
He preached what he called a gospel of inclusion.
He saw all human life as an integral part of a broader community.
He was welcomed in Synagogues, Islamic groups, Atheist and Agnostic organizations, and a variety of other spiritual communities.
He felt a mandate to strive for peace through an emphasis on inclusion in spirituality and interfaith fellowship.
I commend him again today and emphasize his teaching that we don't have to go along to get along.
That we can mind many of the same things without necessarily having the same mind about everything.
We honor the life of Bishop Carlton Pearson, the legacy he left won't be soon forgotten.
I include in the Record this Rolling Stone Magazine memoriam about how he has inspired generations to come.
How Bishop Carlton Pearson Inspired a Generation of Singers and Gospel Artists (By Meagan Jordan) Bishop Carlton Pearson, a renowned preacher, singer and composer, known for his Live At Azusa albums, died on November 19 after a battle with cancer in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
His theology, known as the ``gospel of inclusion,'' preached against homophobia and embraced the LGBTQ community, but cost him his congregation and approval within the evangelical community.
However, his message of inclusion and his denial of hell has become a model, and his impact in gospel music continues to inspire new generations of artists.
``He has an album of hymns that people would sing in the Black church for communion like `I Know it Was The Blood,' or his version of `Precious Memories.'
gospel artist and former Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams tells Rolling Stone, referring to Pearson's Live At Azusa 2: Precious Memories album from 1997.
``He amplified those songs and made them mainstream for church.''
Pearson was born and raised in San Diego, California, where his father and grandfather were preacher men in a storefront ``heaven or hell'' Pentecostal church.
After graduating high school, he attended Oral Roberts University, an evangelical Christian University, where Oral Roberts, a white preacher who had the leading religious television broadcast in the Seventies, was the school's founder.
Roberts mentored Pearson as he navigated the ministerial realm.
