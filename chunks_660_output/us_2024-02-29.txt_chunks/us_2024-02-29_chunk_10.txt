Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember U.S. Air Force General Earl T. O'Loughlin, who passed away November 10, 2023, at the age of 93 years old.
General O'Loughlin was a distinguished four-star general, who commenced his military journey during the Cold War in 1951.
An exceptional pilot, he navigated various aircraft, ranging from the B-29 to the KC-135.
Over the course of his career, he accumulated approximately 6,000 flying hours, including 224 combat hours.
Beyond his military achievements, Earl was a devoted husband to Thelma Bentley, a loving father to his daughter, Kris Rudin, brother, grandfather, great-grandfather, uncle, and a cherished friend.
The general emphasized the mantra ``freedom isn't free'' throughout his entire life.
Among his numerous accolades are the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, and Air Force Commendation Medal adorned with four oakleaf clusters.
In the hearts of the Tucson community and the residents of District 6, General O'Loughlin remains a true hero.
We extend our gratitude for his dedicated service, and I am eternally thankful for his contributions. ____________________
