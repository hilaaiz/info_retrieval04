Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an important milestone in my district.
Today, El Paso Electric is unveiling Newman Unit 6--a cutting edge, 228 megawatt natural gas combustion turbine generating power plant.
This state-of-the-art facility will replace three older, less-efficient units with a robust energy supply equipped to meet the growing needs of the El Paso region.
Situated at the Newman Power Station in El Paso, TX, this project exemplifies El Paso Electric's dedication to enhancing energy reliability and minimizing wasteful practices.
By utilizing modern natural gas technology, this project will optimize gas usage and reduce water consumption by an impressive 600 million gallons annually.
Additionally, alongside maintaining a robust natural gas power supply, this initiative makes significant investments in renewable energy.
Such diversification is integral for fostering a resilient power grid fit for the demands of the 21st century.
Supporting a strong energy sector is a key priority of mine in this Chamber.
I fundamentally believe that energy security is national security and that safeguarding jobs, such as those generated by this project, is paramount.
Witnessing the fruition of this development fills me with pride.
I applaud El Paso Electric for their unwavering commitment to bolstering energy reliability and security in the El Paso region.
Their tireless efforts ensure that our energy grid remains strong and can keep our lights on around the clock. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the distinguished life and extraordinary military career of General Edward Greer, a remarkable individual whose legacy has left an indelible mark on our nation, as he approaches his 100th birthday.

However, his education was interrupted by World War II, leading him to serve in the 777th Field Artillery Battalion, an all-Black unit.
By the war's end, he had risen to the esteemed rank of Master Sergeant.
Returning to civilian life, General Greer resumed his studies at West Virginia State College, where he met and married Jewell Means.
Their union, forged on May 31, 1948, endured for more than 72 years.
Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army in 1940, General Greer sought stability in the military, serving with distinction for 33 years.
His early assignments in Japan coincided with the outbreak of the Korean War, where he earned the Silver Star for valor.
Promoted through the ranks, General Greer's military career traversed Germany.
Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Pentagon, witnessing the Army's integration and earning promotions to Major, Lieutenant Colonel, and Colonel.
His family grew to include three children: Michael, Kenneth, and Gail.
In 1970, Colonel Greer served in Vietnam before becoming a trailblazer in military history.
Selected for promotion to Brigadier General in 1972, he joined an esteemed group of Black officers, contributing to the integration of the Army's general officer ranks.
Retiring in 1976 after 33 years of dedicated service, General Greer made El Paso his home.
With his beloved wife Jewell, he became an active member of the community, engaging in real estate sales and contributing to various civic boards.
The Greers' post-Army life was a testament to their commitment to service and community.
