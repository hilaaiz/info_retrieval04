Date: 2023-09-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 147 Pages: E831 - E832 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E831-E832] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE INDONESIAN COMMUNITY CONNECT FOR A DECADE OF CELEBRATING INDONESIAN CULTURE ______ of new hampshire in the house of representatives Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Indonesian Community Connect in New Hampshire as they celebrate a decade of promoting Indonesian culture.
This also marks the sixth anniversary of ICC's initiatives as a non-profit organization and the second year of the momentum of the Little Indonesia Project.
The Little Indonesia Project, the first of its kind in our Nation, embodies art, culture, and opportunity, forging connections between Indonesian culture and New Hampshire, directly contributing to the revitalization of the Downtown Somersworth business district.
ICC, a non-profit organization headquartered in New Hampshire, has dedicated itself to showcasing the rich diversity of Indonesian culture while fostering mutual understanding among various cultures and values.
Operating from Somersworth, NH, the ICC team has diligently linked the Indonesian community with the Granite State and its support services.
They have gone the extra mile in assisting the Indonesian community with accessing local resources, including healthcare, education, food, festivals, and much more.
This team serves as a bridge that connects Indonesian culture with neighboring communities, offering a wide array of resources.
They have established a food pantry to address food insecurity within the Indonesian Community and provide support for career building, particularly for those affected by the pandemic, thereby promoting economic mobility in New Hampshire.
Additionally, they offer document translation services to help community members navigate in-person, virtual, and phone interactions, enhancing English language proficiency.
The ICC is not only committed to sharing its culture externally but also nurturing cultural enrichment for children and serving as a hub of resources for stakeholders, including the local government and valued collaborators in Indonesia.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District I extend my warmest congratulations and heartfelt thanks to the passionate volunteers at ICC, both in New Hampshire and Indonesia for a decade of work that embodies the spirit of collaboration and teamwork that we deeply value in New Hampshire.
I wholeheartedly appreciate the heartfelt work of this team in fostering the rich tapestry of Indonesian culture over the past 10 years.
As the representative privileged to serve the home base of the Indonesian Community Connect in Congress, I eagerly anticipate witnessing the continued success of this celebration in the years to come. ____________________
