The Little Haiti Cultural Center has become the mecca for the global Haitian Diaspora, a destination for arts, culture, and entertainment.
And the Manno Sannon Stadium is home to the championship-winning Little Haiti Supreme Football Team.
December 12, 2022, marked the 50th anniversary of the first documented arrival of Haitian refugees fleeing Haiti by sea.
This anniversary marks the beginning of an incredible journey that has transformed South Florida's social, cultural, and political landscape.
History-making events have since followed, impacting federal jurisprudence, local advocacy efforts for immigrant justice, and the treatment of asylum seekers in healthcare, education, employment, and housing.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the legacy of the Haitian boat people. ____________________
HONORING THE PROMOTORES Y PROMOTORAS OF LATINO HEALTH ACCESS; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
147



Date: 2023-09-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 147 Pages: E833 - E833 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE PROMOTORES Y PROMOTORAS OF LATINO HEALTH ACCESS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievements of Latino Health Access, an organization that works tirelessly to uplift communities, promote health equity, and create sustainable change.
Latino Health Access (LHA) has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to these ideals through its mission, which partners with communities to aid through education, services, consciousness-raising, and civic participation.
Latino Health Access's mission is multifaceted, encompassing the delivery of culturally appropriate health-related services and programming to address pressing health concerns, as well as engaging individuals in low-income, low-opportunity areas to transform their environments and effect positive, concrete changes in their homes and communities.
Since its establishment in 1993, Latino Health Access has been a trailblazer in the field of public health by pioneering the Promotor de Salud/Community Health Worker (CHW) model in the United States, recognizing the potential of individuals from within communities to advocate for better health and living conditions.
The Promotores y Promotoras, who are integral to the Latino Health Access approach, are community members themselves, living within the very neighborhoods they serve, and are dedicated to promoting, connecting, and linking their communities with vital health services while also advocating at local, county, and state levels for policies that enhance overall living conditions.
Today, equity lies at the heart of the Promotor Model, which contributes to building healthier and more resilient communities by providing systems navigation services, surmounting barriers to access, and amplifying community leadership and participation, while simultaneously advocating for policy, systems, and environmental changes that address the social determinants of health.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the profound impact of Latino Health Access and its Promoter Model. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON AN OPEN SOCIETY WITH SECURITY ACT OF 2023; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 147 Pages: E831 - E831 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON AN OPEN SOCIETY WITH SECURITY ACT OF 2023 ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the United States Commission on an Open Society with Security Act of 2023, which would create a commission to investigate how we can maintain our democratic traditions while actively responding to the real and substantial threats posed by foreign and domestic terrorism.
The impetus for this commission was the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, its importance grew after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and has reached peak urgency since the insurrectionist attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The succession of tragic events endured by our Nation has led to a series of sweeping security increases that are deemed both necessary and temporary in the moment but create lasting security infrastructure that is difficult to dismantle and infringes on our open, democratic society.
