Security is not only about reducing lives lost and costs.
It is also about safeguarding the institutions, freedoms and values that anchor our country, not only for ourselves but for future generations.
The social compact between government and the people should not be the result of a series of hostage negotiations.
We must resume reasoned and deliberative decision-making, beginning with a high-level commission composed of experts from diverse disciplines charged with developing a new course that will protect both our people and our precious democratic institutions and traditions. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record remarks submitted at the request of a Virginia Beach constituent, Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman of Temple Lev Tikvah, and are a reflection of his views: RABBI ZOBERMAN'S POEM--JERUSALEM'S GOLDEN SILENCE These days there is a golden silence Overcoming the shouts of the prophets Of old and new, ``peace, peace'' And there is no peace But the silence of sealed echoes Of hope in holy crevices where Shalom's doves find shelter at the Wall where wailing has not abated, The silence of the cloud of glory Encircling God's city like an embracing Wedding canopy.
The voice of the groom And the voice of the bride Whose rejoicing is Jerusalem's signature, Are ever preserved under the heavy silence Of immovable rocks hiding millennial Prayers refusing to concede victory to A spirit bespeaking not the contrition Of sacrifice brought here from near And afar to placate the One Who only pardons those seeking The promising power of peace.
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is founder and spiritual leader of Temple Lev Tikvah, and Honorary Senior Rabbi Scholar at Eastern Shore Chapel Episcopal, both in Virginia Beach.
He is a member of the Virginia Beach Human Rights Commission. ____________________

GLAVY ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. HIGGINS of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant General Matthew G. Glavy, who serves his country with the pride and honor befitting the highest ranks of the United States Marine Corps.
Born in 1963 at Mercy Hospital in Buffalo, New York, Lieutenant General Matthew Glavy grew up with his 3 siblings under the name ``Jerry.''
Calling Western New York home, Lieutenant General Glavy finds comfort in Buffalo style wings, the Buffalo Bills, and the cold winter climate of Western New York.
As a child, Lieutenant General Matthew Glavy was an avid sports fan, having played youth league football in his childhood, later lettering in cross country and track in high school before graduating in 1981.
Lieutenant General Glavy exemplifies every aspect of courage, determination, and service denominated in the timeless motto of the Marine Corps, ``Semper Fi.''
having served in all 3 designations: the operating forces, the supporting establishment, and in the headquarters.
As a member of the operating forces and supporting establishment, Lieutenant General Glavy served ``at the heart of the Marine Corps'' in various assignments, including as an aircraft maintenance officer, weapons and tactics officer and embark officer, and current operations officer, eventually climbing the ranks to commanding general and U.S. Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command and Space Command.
General Glavy also supported his troops, his country, and his family, in the USMC Headquarters, where he served, among many impressive assignments, as platoon commander, White House liaison officer, and presidential command pilot.
