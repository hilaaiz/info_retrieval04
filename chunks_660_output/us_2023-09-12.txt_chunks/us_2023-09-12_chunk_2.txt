Date: 2023-09-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 147 Pages: E833 - E834 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E833-E834] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING HAITIAN BOAT PEOPLE ______ of florida in the house of representatives Ms. WILSON of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary landing of the first boat carrying Haitian refugees to South Florida.
On December 12, 1972, the first report of Haitian refugees, often called ``Haitian Boat People,'' fleeing to the United States, was documented.
Between 1972 and 1981, over 55,000 refugees arrived in Florida and have continued to thrive thanks to community champions who supported the Haitian migrant population.
Today, the South Florida Haitian refugee population has accomplished many firsts, becoming mayors, councilmembers, and state representatives.
Miami's historic Lemon City became the first neighborhood officially called Little Haiti.
Central streets were named after Haitian cultural icons such as Felix Morisseau-Leroy and heroes of Haiti's independence.
A statue of Toussaint Louverture stands guard on Plas Kamoken in Little Haiti.
Toussaint Elementary was home to the first Haitian American principal, and Morningside Elementary became the first international language magnet in the country to offer Haitian Creole.
The Little Haiti Cultural Center has become the mecca for the global Haitian Diaspora, a destination for arts, culture, and entertainment.
And the Manno Sannon Stadium is home to the championship-winning Little Haiti Supreme Football Team.
December 12, 2022, marked the 50th anniversary of the first documented arrival of Haitian refugees fleeing Haiti by sea.
