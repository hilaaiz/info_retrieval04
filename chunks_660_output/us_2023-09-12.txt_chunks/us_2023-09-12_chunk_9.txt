A generous donation of land and finances by Captain Charles Schreiner in 1917 made this possible.
He served with distinction in the Texas Rangers.
Capt.
Schreiner outlined his vision for the Institute as ``facilities for high grade instruction and military training for boys and young men as preparation for college and university work.''
James J. Delaney served as the first president of Schreiner Institute.
From the beginning, it has been committed to the Reformed tradition of the Presbyterian Church.
The first class of female students was admitted during World War II.
Formal military training ended in 1971, and the Institute became fully coeducational.
In the year 2000, Schreiner's governing board voted to change the school's name to Schreiner University.
The years immediately following the name change saw various renovations and new buildings take shape on campus.
Online classes started in 2014 and have expanded since then, now including a full online master's program.
Recently, Schreiner introduced their Military Academy Preparatory School to provide paths for students into military service.
In its 100th year, Schreiner University is proud to bring back a pastime from its early days, football.
Other sport disciplines for students include soccer, wrestling, equestrian, shooting sports, and tennis.
Today, Schreiner University president Charlie McCormick oversees a campus that offers over 30 different degree options.
I am proud that the Hill Country is home to a university the caliber of Schreiner.
Congratulations on 100 years of helping students achieve more. ____________________
WELLSTON 150TH ANNIVERSARY; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
147



Date: 2023-09-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 147 Pages: E832 - E832 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELLSTON 150TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of ohio in the house of representatives Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the Village of Wellston, Ohio.
Since its founding in 1873, the Village of Wellston has been an important industrial and historical center of Southeast Ohio for nearly 2 centuries.
Harvey Wells, a Civil War veteran and Ohio native, used part of his Jackson County property to establish Wellston.
Wellston was officially incorporated as a Village in 1876 with the hopes of being the ``New Pittsburgh of the West.''
With the construction of numerous blast furnaces, the Village of Wellston solidified itself as an important industrial and mining town in Southern Ohio.
Wellston also played an important role in the Underground Railroad system acting as one of the first stops in the North and became the settling point for several freed slaves.
Throughout its history, the Village of Wellston has been a beacon of prosperity and freedom for Southern Ohio, and I am honored to represent a town with such a rich history and strong sense of community.
Again, I want to congratulate the Village of Wellston on celebrating its 150th Anniversary and recognize their importance to Jackson County and all of Southern Ohio.
May they continue to prosper over the centuries to come. ____________________
