HONORING MR.
PATRICK MORAN'S SERVICE

HON.
TONY WIED

Mr. WIED.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional

community leader, veteran, and volunteer, Mr. Patrick Moran.
In recognition of Mr. Moran's selfless service and steadfast

leadership, he is the recipient of the 2025 De Pere Community Silver

Knight Award.
Since 1968, the De Pere Community Silver Knight Award has

been bestowed upon outstanding individuals nominated by De Pere service

clubs, civic organizations or members of the community.
Mr. Moran's decades of service are truly remarkable.
It is evident

that Mr. Moran has dedicated his life to serving others and has

undoubtedly played an instrumental role in the success of several

organizations throughout Brown County and Northeast Wisconsin.
From his

time serving as a Cub Scout Leader and Soccer Coach in De Pere to his

over 50 years with the De Pere VFW Post 2113, Mr. Moran's unwavering

support and guidance deserves our highest admiration.
In addition to Mr. Moran's community service, his most important role

has been a supportive husband to his wife Linda and father to three

children, Phillip, Renee, and Nickolas.
Throughout his children's

upbringing, Pat was a leader that you could always count on--serving as

a Cub Scout Leader, Lost Dauphin 4H leader, Soccer Coach, and member of

the MBX Motorcycle Club and the West De Pere Snow Owls Snowmobile Club.
I commend Mr. Moran's unwavering commitment to Northeast Wisconsin.
Mr. Moran's decades of guidance, support, and leadership in his

community deserve the highest degree of recognition.
I ask my

colleagues to join me to congratulate Mr. Patrick Moran on receiving

the 2025 De Pere Community Silver Knight Award.
I am proud to represent

such incredible men and women who call Northeast Wisconsin home.

HONORING PAUL ECKSTEIN

HON.
GREG STANTON

Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Paul Eckstein, a giant in

Arizona law and a stalwart public servant, on the remarkable occasion

of his 60th work anniversary at Perkins Coie LLP.
Paul worked on many consequential legal disputes in Arizona history

that shaped the state's legal and civic landscape.
He brought a rare

combination of trial skill, appellate judgment, and moral clarity.
Time

and again, he shows Arizonans that the law can correct course and

restore trust.
As lead counsel for the Arizona House of Representatives in the 1988

impeachment of Governor Evan Mecham, he tried the case with rigor and

restraint--cross-examining the governor, arguing the evidence, and

reminding Arizona that no one is above the law.
The Senate's verdict

confirmed the point, and renewed public faith that our Constitution has

teeth when it must.
Early in Paul's career, he represented Navajo leader Tom Shirley in

Shirley v. Superior Court, securing a decision that affirmed Native

American citizens living on reservations are fully entitled to hold

public office in Arizona.
He defended voter-driven reform by helping

ensure Clean Elections reached the ballot.
He stood up for independent

redistricting when it mattered most, supporting the reinstatement of

the Independent Redistricting Commission's chair.
And he defended

Arizona's merit-based judgeship selection, fending off efforts to

politicize the bench.
Across these battles runs a common thread: Paul

used the law to safeguard the people's voice and the independence of

our courts.
What sets Paul apart is not only what he has done, but how he has

done it.
He takes the lawyer's oath seriously--so seriously that he

chooses principle over convenience, even when it costs him.
He demands

candor.
He proves, by example, that zealous advocacy and impeccable

ethics go hand in hand.
Paul's extraordinary impact extends well beyond the courtroom.
He

taught constitutional law at Arizona State University, and his students

now serve across our state.
