Its ReStore, run largely

by volunteers, diverts

usable materials from landfills, offers low-cost household goods, and

directly funds housing initiatives, demonstrating innovation,

stewardship, and community partnership.
For 35 years, volunteers, churches, businesses, and civic

organizations have come together under one mission: to build stability,

dignity, and hope.
Blue Water Habitat for Humanity stands as a

testament to what can be achieved when a community serves alongside one

another in common purpose.
Mr. Speaker, on this milestone anniversary, I ask my colleagues to

join me in honoring Blue Water Habitat for Humanity--its leadership,

volunteers, donors, and partner families, for three and a half decades

of faithful service.
May their example continue to inspire service,

personal responsibility, and the belief that stronger homes build

stronger communities.

HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AURORA ACTIONAIRES

HON.
BILL FOSTER

Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th

anniversary of the Aurora Actionaires, a remarkable milestone for an

organization that has stood as a beacon of service, leadership, and

community empowerment in Aurora, Illinois, for half a century.
Since its founding in 1975, when three friends, Donna Williams,

Martha Hickling, and Caroline Johnson, met at Hoi Peng Restaurant in

Aurora on New Year's Eve, 1974, and decided to form a social club, the

Aurora Actionaires has consistently demonstrated what committed civic

engagement can achieve.
What began with a group of eighteen

enthusiastic friends wanting a better community quickly evolved into a

force for service and empowerment under their guiding motto: We Care .
. .
We Act . . .
We Serve.
Over these five decades, the Aurora Actionaires have lived that motto

through their tireless dedication to education, community development,

youth mentorship, and numerous charitable endeavors across the region.
They have awarded more than $200,000 in scholarships to high school

seniors and provided assistance to college students in need.
They have

hosted workshops for parents and students on completing scholarship and

financial aid applications and supported eighth-grade graduates

attending the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy's SEAMS Summer

Enrichment Program, helping young people pursue academic excellence and

opportunity.
On their golden anniversary, we reflect on the many lives touched,

the students who would not have pursued higher education without their

support, families whose neighborhoods have been strengthened through

their volunteerism, and civic institutions that have benefited from

their leadership and investment.
The Aurora Actionaires have built

bridges across generations, across neighborhoods, and across divides

and have always modeled the belief that progress is shared when we lift

others.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have the Aurora Actionaires as part of

Illinois' 11th Congressional District.
They have demonstrated what it

means to transform compassion into action and service into lasting

impact, and I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on

their golden anniversary and thank them for their unwavering dedication

to building a stronger, more vibrant community for all.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CARLOS ALBERTO LOPEZ RIVERA

HON.
PABLO JOSE HERNANDEZ

Mr. HERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory and

legacy of a remarkable public servant, Carlos Alberto Lopez Rivera,

better known to his beloved community simply as ``Carlitos.''
Born on September 14, 1958, in Dorado, Carlitos grew up with the

values of hard work, service, and loyalty instilled in him by his

parents, Pedro Lopez Maldonado and Ana Rivera.
After graduating from

Jose S. Alegria High School and earning a degree in Business Management

from the University of Puerto Rico, he could have chosen many paths.
But his heart was rooted in Dorado, and he devoted himself to serving

the very place that had shaped him.
That calling led him to the mayor's office, where on August 3, 1987,

he was sworn in as the mayor of Dorado.
What followed was nothing short

of historic.
