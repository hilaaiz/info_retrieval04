He proves, by example, that zealous advocacy and impeccable

ethics go hand in hand.
Paul's extraordinary impact extends well beyond the courtroom.
He

taught constitutional law at Arizona State University, and his students

now serve across our state.
At his alma mater, Pomona College, he and

his wife, Florence ``Flo'' Eckstein, endowed a scholarship for refugee

and forcibly displaced students, opening doors for those whose lives

were upended by conflict or catastrophe.
Paul served for decades on the board of Phoenix Children's Hospital,

including as Board Chair.
At Arizona State University, the Flo Eckstein

Endowment supports students focused on children, youth, and families,

and the Albert & Liese Eckstein Scholar-in-Residence brings leading

voices in Jewish studies to our community each year.
For more than

three decades, the Ecksteins stewarded the Jewish

News of Greater Phoenix, preserving a vital forum for community life

and donating archives that keep history alive.
Their philanthropy is

practical and personal: it meets people where they are and lifts them

up.
Paul also lives his values through pro bono work.
He stands with

those without a voice and no means--most recently as part of a team

recognized by the federal court for advancing a prisoner civil-rights

case to trial.
He has served with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil

Rights Under Law, lending Arizona's steady voice to the cause of equal

justice.
Mr. Speaker, Arizona is a better place because of Paul Eckstein.
He

has defended our Constitution in court and in public life; he has

protected fair elections and independent courts; he has fought for a

free press and for equal justice; and he has invested his time, talent,

and treasure to care for children, and educate the next generation.
On behalf of the people of Arizona, I congratulate Paul on 60 years

of distinguished service at Perkins Coie.
I thank him for his example

of courage and integrity, and I ask my colleagues to join me in

celebrating a lawyer, teacher, and citizen whose life's work has

strengthened our state.

HONORING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF BLUE WATER HABITAT FOR HUMANITY

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate

the 35th Anniversary of Blue Water Habitat for Humanity, a remarkable

organization serving the people of St. Clair and Sanilac Counties with

integrity, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to strengthening

our communities through the power of homeownership.
Founded on the belief that every individual deserves a safe, decent,

and affordable place to live, Blue Water Habitat for Humanity has never

given away homes--it has built opportunities.
Through its ``hand-up,

not a handout'' model, it has empowered hardworking families to achieve

independence by requiring sweat equity, responsible financial

preparation, and a sustainable mortgage.
This principled approach has

helped countless families put down roots and build brighter futures.
Blue Water Habitat is a community institution.
It is locally funded,

locally operated, and deeply invested in the well-being of the people

it serves.
While affiliated with Habitat for Humanity International and

Habitat Michigan, every dollar donated stays right here, supporting

neighbors and revitalizing neighborhoods across Port Huron, St. Clair,

and Sanilac County.
Beyond new home construction, Blue Water Habitat provides critical

home repair programs, ensuring seniors, veterans, and families facing

hardship can maintain safe living conditions.
Its ReStore, run largely

by volunteers, diverts

usable materials from landfills, offers low-cost household goods, and

directly funds housing initiatives, demonstrating innovation,

stewardship, and community partnership.
For 35 years, volunteers, churches, businesses, and civic

organizations have come together under one mission: to build stability,

dignity, and hope.
Blue Water Habitat for Humanity stands as a

testament to what can be achieved when a community serves alongside one

another in common purpose.
