Isabella overcame

the challenges posed by intense competition in her effort to win the

Division I One-Meter Dive State Championship.
In pursuing the State Championship, Isabella defeated her opponent in

the finals of the one-meter dive classification.
Her hard work and

dedication in achieving this accomplishment is truly outstanding.
She

has accomplished an impressive season record, bringing pride to her

school and community.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute

to Isabella Pfeil of Avon Lake High School.
On behalf of the people of

the Fifth Congressional District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this

great achievement.
