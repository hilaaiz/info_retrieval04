CELEBRATING THE PRESERVATION AND PERPETUATION OF THE HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE

HON.
JILL N. TOKUDA

Ms. TOKUDA.
Mr. Speaker, Hawaii's constitution recognizes two

official languages: English and Hawaiian.
Each February, we celebrate

Mahina `Olelo Hawai`i, or Hawaiian Language Month.
It's time for us to

honor and promote the use of Hawaiian language, and to achieve this, we

must create opportunities and environments where it can be celebrated

and utilized.
`Olelo Hawai`i is more than a language, it is a

connection to a history and a culture that must never be forgotten.
That is why it was so important to me to speak it today on the House

floor.
Long live the Hawaiian language.
Therefore Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the translation in the

Hawaiian language:

Aloha e ka luna h`omalu,

Ke hoia`i`o nei ko Hawai`i kumukanawai i na `olelo kuhelu `elua: ka

Olelo Pelekania me ka Olelo Hawai`i.
I kela me keia Pepeluali, e

ho`omaika`i makou i ka Mahina `Olelo Hawai`i.
`Okeia ka manawa kupono a

kakou e ho`ohanohano a e paipai aku i ka `Olelo Hawai`i.
I mea e ho`oko

ai i ia hana, he ko`iko`i no ho`i ka `olelo a ho`olaule`a mau `ia o ka

`Olelo Hawai`i ma na wahi like `ole, ma na `ano po`aiapili like `ole, a

ma na `ano hanana like `ole`O ka `olelo Hawai`i, `a`ole ia he `olelo

wale no.
`O ia no he pilina i na mo`olelo me ka mo`omeheu, 'o ia no

ho`i kahi mea e poina `ole ai.
`O ia ke kumu no ka`u `olelo `ana i keia

la ma ka papahele o ka Hale o na Lunamaka`ainana ma ka `Olelo Hawai`i.
E ola ka `Olelo Hawai'i.

EULOGY FOR RAYMOND NOEL RAMSEY

HON.
JOHN B. LARSON

Mr. LARSON of Connecticut.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to include in

the Record the eulogy of a great American, Raymond Noel Ramsey, who

epitomized what a citizen who gives back to his community, state, and

Nation is all about.
On behalf of Peg, Noele, Kelly, Melanie.
and the entire

Ramsey family, thank you for being here for Ray.
How about

that obituary and the prayer card!
Ever the fashion

statement, wasn't he, with those bright pastels and those

shirts, that were a reflection of his personality.
Yesterday

was quite an afternoon and quite a tribute.
It was good to

see old East Hartford on display--the outpour of love and

respect for a man who lived it.
Now we know he had a great reception committee up there

with Billy Mud, Fred Kurtz, Fred Leone, and Jimmy Deleo

singing--I'm sure--as he entered the gates of Heaven.
As Ray

would often remind the faint of heart, life is not a dress

rehearsal.
He embodied both the right attitude and the

appetite for a life well lived.
Talking with several of you at the wake, and over the past

few days, about stories of Ray and what he would want this

service to be--Father, I have to start with a disclaimer

here--Craig Jordan, Kevin Brown, and numerous others want to

be clear that the funniest Rammer stories are not suitable

for church or in mixed company.
I think it's safe to say he

was a guy's guy.
It was abundantly clear from all, that he would want an

upbeat sendoff on his next journey.
First and foremost, and

most of all, the shared empathy, respect, and love for Peg

and his three angels, Noele, Kelly and Melanie.
At the wake

it was hard viewing and watching them hold back the tears,

the grieving and the mourning and with each person.
