Over the ensuing years, Bentley High School was expanded multiple

times to accommodate the changing needs of a growing student body.
The

school proudly boasted an extensive library, wood shop, auto shop,

swimming pool, and music rooms.
Due to declining population, Bentley

High School was closed in 1984, though it lived on a community center

until 1999.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in recognizing

Bentley High School, as the community of Livonia and alumni celebrate

the legacy and memories of this historic place.
