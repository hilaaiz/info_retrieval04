From Ricardo Samaniego, our El Paso County

Judge, Alberto Almanza, an Olympian who competed in 1960 and 1964, and

numerous of veterans and servicemembers who have served in all branches

of the military in pursuit of liberty and justice.
Jefferson has a

saying `once a fox, always a fox'--and Jefferson students and alumni

are always proud of their community and where they come from.
I would also like to recognize all the teachers, faculty, and staff

of students, empower them to become productive citizens, and leaders in

their communities.
It takes a village to educate and raise children and

without their work, Jefferson High School would not be able to operate.
I ask all Members to join me today in honoring Jefferson High School

for their 75 years of educational excellence and its profound impact on

the lives of countless students, families, and the broader community.
Long live Jeff (Viva la Jeff).

HONORING THE LEGACY OF CONGRESSMAN BILL PASCRELL

HON.
MIKE CAREY

Mr. CAREY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Congressman Bill

Pascrell, who passed away last month after serving nearly three decades

in Congress.
It was a privilege to serve alongside Bill on the Ways & Means

Committee.
Though we sat on different sides of the aisle, Bill's

warmth, humor and dedication to his constituents can be a source of

inspiration for all of us.
Bill was born in Paterson, New Jersey.
America's first industrial

city.
Through the years he saw his community grow and change, but like

the city's great falls, he remained a steadfast engine for progress.
I got to know Bill during events with the Italian American caucus,

where we could talk about our shared heritage over glasses of Primitivo

and Montepulciano.
In the spirit of those days, I would like to share a

message in memory of this great man and his legacy:

``My friend, you will not be forgotten. (
Amico mio, non sarai

dimenticato).''

RECOGNIZING FLORIDA'S 16TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT FIRE AND RESCUE EMS

AWARD RECIPIENTS

HON.
VERN BUCHANAN

Mr. BUCHANAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize fire, rescue and

EMS personnel who have provided distinguished service to the people of

Florida's 16th Congressional District.
First responders, fIre

departments and emergency medical service teams are summoned on short

notice to serve their respective communities.
Often, they arrive at

scenes of great adversity and trauma, to which they reliably bring

strength and composure.
These brave men and women spend hundreds of

hours in training so that they are prepared when they get ``the call.''
Twelve years ago, I established the 16th District Congressional Fire

and Rescue and EMS Awards to honor officers, departments, and units for

outstanding achievement.
