GREGORY ARMENIAN CHURCH ______ of massachusetts in the house of representatives Mr. NEAL.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate a milestone of profound significance--the 90th anniversary of St. Gregory Armenian Church in Indian Orchard, Massachusetts.
For nearly a century, St. Gregory has stood as a beacon of faith, unity, and community, enriching the lives of its members and serving as a cherished cornerstone of Armenian heritage throughout the Greater Springfield community.
As the crossroads of New England, Springfield is home to a unique diaspora of different cultures and ethnicities, including a strong Armenian commnunity with roots going back to the early 20th century.
As a great number of Armenian populations immigrated and settled in the Springfield area during the early 1900s, the need for a church and community center was quickly realized.
Since its founding in 1934, St. Gregory has been a pillar of hope and support throughout our region, giving back not only to the community in western Massachusetts, but also providing humanitarian assistance to Armenians throughout the world.
Their commitment to improving the lives of others is inspiring and has left an indelible mark on countless individuals and families.
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to congratulate the members of the St. Gregory Armenian Church as they mark 90 years of upholding the sacred traditions, values, and teachings of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
As we reflect on the countless blessings bestowed upon St. Gregory, and the blessings bestowed upon the community they serve, we look to the future with great optimism and renewed vigor.
I wish them much growth, spiritual enlightenment, and enduring unity for the next 90 years and beyond.
Congratulations from the United States of America. ____________________
