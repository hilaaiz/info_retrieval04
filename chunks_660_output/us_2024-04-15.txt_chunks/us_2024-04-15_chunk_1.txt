Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate my friend Charles Hursey of Hursey's Bar-B-Q on being inducted into the inaugural class of the North Carolina Bar-B-Q Hall of Fame.
With all the divisiveness and partisanship impacting our nation today, it is refreshing to see the new North Carolina Bar-B-Q Hall of Fame bringing together all sides of the great divide--Eastern and Lexington style barbeque.
Very few things exemplify North Carolina more than barbeque, and last month the North Carolina Bar-B-Q Hall of Fame inducted its first class.
I was thrilled that Charles Hursey, owner of the legendary Hursey's Bar-B-Q, is part of this esteemed class.
As a frequent patron of Hursey's Bar-B-Q, I can personally attest to the quality of the food and friendliness of the employees of this great North Carolina institution.
Hursey's Bar-B-Q was founded by Sylvester and Daisy Hursey, Charles' parents.
In fact, Hursey's Bar-B-Q was one of the first barbecue wholesalers to ever be licensed by the state of North Carolina back in 1949.
As he grew, Charles began learning the business and, in 1966, took over the family's Burlington location.
Eventually, Charles would go on to run the whole operation.
Charles maintains this role today and, following the Hursey family tradition, continues to operate four restaurant locations and a catering facility alongside his wife, children, and grandchildren.
In North Carolina, barbeque is one of our most cherished and almost sacred traditions.
It is a labor-intensive art that requires great skill and hard work on the part of the pitmaster.
At the same time, it is an art that stresses the importance of family and passing down practices and recipes from one generation to the next.
I cannot think of anybody who embodies these attributes better than Charles.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Charles Hursey on being named to the North Carolina Bar-B-Q Hall of Fame.
Let's Eat. ____________________
