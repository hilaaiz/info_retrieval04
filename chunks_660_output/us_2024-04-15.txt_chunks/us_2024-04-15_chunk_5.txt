Pastors Don and Susan Nordin have led the church since November 4, 2001.
Throughout the last 23 years, Community Transformation Church has started five campuses that were gifted away, given millions of dollars to mission efforts across the world, and much more to show the love of Christ across the region they serve.
Community Transformation Church has also started eight residential drug and alcohol treatment centers and created a 38-acre ranch for rescued girls who have been trafficked.
Over the past century, it is evident the Lord has used this historic church to demonstrate the love, kindness, and generosity of Jesus Christ in the surrounding community and worldwide.
May God continue to bless Community Transformation Church and its members for many years to come. ____________________
