Under his guidance, Denton Enterprise Airport grew significantly, rising from 7th busiest airport in Texas as he arrived, to become the 5th busiest airport in Texas and among the top 60 nationwide, with over 212,000 operations in 2023.
Mr. Gray's strategic vision and strong analytical skills have been instrumental in the airport's growth and success.
He oversaw significant milestones, including the delivery of the airport's second runway in 2019 and the expansion of the main runway in 2021.
These achievements not only enhanced the airport's operational capacity, but also contributed to its standing as a vital regional transportation hub and ensured its place as an economic generator into the future.
Furthermore, Mr. Gray's leadership extended beyond Denton Enterprise Airport.
As the President of the Texas Airports Council, he tirelessly advocated for the betterment and benefit of general aviation airports across Texas.
His commitment to advancing the interests of the aviation community has left a lasting impact and has been widely recognized and appreciated.
Despite his departure from Denton and return to Arizona as the Aviation Director at the Buckeye Municipal Airport, Mr. Gray has remained an invaluable resource and mentor to others in the aviation profession.
His willingness to share his extensive knowledge and expertise reflects his genuine passion for the industry and his dedication to supporting his colleagues.
Mr. Gray possesses the wide range of knowledge and competence that exemplifies a top-notch general aviation airport manager.
His remarkable achievements and unwavering commitment to excellence make him truly deserving of the Airport Professional of the Year Award.
I am honored to commend Mr. Gray for his outstanding contributions to the aviation community and extend my warmest congratulations on this well- deserved recognition. ____________________
HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATION CHURCH; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 64 Pages: E350 - E350 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATION CHURCH ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. BABIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Community Transformation Church on its centennial, which fell on April 14, 2024.
Community Transformation Church is based in Houston, Texas, and has eight satellite campuses located across Texas and Arkansas.
The Community Transformation Church that exists today started with two different churches: Magnolia Park Assembly of God and Oaklawn Assembly of God.
Magnolia Park Assembly of God was founded around 1924 by Rev. Jimmy McClellan.
Two years later, in 1926, Rev. E.M. Yeats became the pastor and served until his retirement in 1976.
In addition to Magnolia Park, Rev. McClellan also organized the Oaklawn Assembly of God.
During the years leading up to the 1976 merger, Revs.
Worth Williams, Hardie Weathers, Cleddy Keith, and O.C. Bates all served as church pastors of Oaklawn.
After the two churches came together, they took on the name Christian Temple Assembly of God and met at the old Magnolia Park location.
Thanks to the significant growth, a 10-acre plot was eventually purchased on Almeda Genoa Road, and the church began a million-dollar building campaign for a new sanctuary that opened on Easter Sunday 1983.
Rev. Bates was the first pastor of Christian Temple, where he served for 25 years.
In June 2023, the church once again took on a new name: the Community Transformation Church.
Pastors Don and Susan Nordin have led the church since November 4, 2001.
Throughout the last 23 years, Community Transformation Church has started five campuses that were gifted away, given millions of dollars to mission efforts across the world, and much more to show the love of Christ across the region they serve.
Community Transformation Church has also started eight residential drug and alcohol treatment centers and created a 38-acre ranch for rescued girls who have been trafficked.
