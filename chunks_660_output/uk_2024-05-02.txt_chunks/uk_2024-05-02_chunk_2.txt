She combined the Minneapolis and Saint Paul

campuses into one unified campus in Saint Paul and completed numerous

infrastructure improvements across campus.
In 2022, it was a privilege

to partner with her and the university to provide critical federal

funding for technology and equipment upgrades for Mendel Hall to

enhance student learning and research opportunities for women

undergraduate students in STEM fields.
She also successfully recruited

a diverse senior leadership team and led the development of a new 10-

year strategic plan that has grown enrollment and strengthened its

financial position.
Prior to returning to her alma mater as president, Roloff

distinguished herself in the business world as a senior vice president

at American Express Financial Advisors, held leadership positions at

Pillsbury Company, and was a grain merchant for Cargill.
She has served

on the boards of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., the Minneapolis

Downtown Council Executive Committee, and Allina Health.
The commitment to social justice and community service that was

instilled in Becky as a student at St. Kate's led her to serve in

leadership of an organization with a social mission, becoming Chief

Executive Officer of the Minneapolis YWCA from 2005 to 2016.
During

this time, the organization became the largest non-profit provider of

high-quality, nationally accredited early childhood education in

Minnesota.
Upon the conclusion of her tenure, the board chair wrote:

''YWCA Minneapolis is tremendously grateful to Becky for her leadership

over the last 11 years.
She leaves a legacy of community impact, and a

resilient, strong organization.''
In addition to earning her bachelor's degree from St. Kate's, where

she graduated cum laude in 1976, Becky went on to earn a Master of

Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1982.
Throughout her academic life and career, Becky has exemplified the St.

Kate's values of liberal arts education and its emphasis on

intellectual curiosity and social justice.
while working to empower

women and make a difference in the world.
As an alumna and as a Member

of Congress, I celebrate her impressive career and wish to express my

gratitude to Becky for her immeasurable contributions to St. Kate's.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in this well-deserved tribute to Ms.

ReBecca Koenig Roloff, the 11th President of St. Catherine University

in Saint Paul, Minnesota.
