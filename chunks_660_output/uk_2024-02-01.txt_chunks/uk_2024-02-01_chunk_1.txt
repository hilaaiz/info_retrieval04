CATHOLIC SCHOOLS WEEK

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Catholic Schools Week

across the Nation, we come together to recognize and honor the profound

impact of Catholic education.
On January 31st, we marked National

Appreciation Day for Catholic Schools, a day that acknowledges the

enduring commitment of these institutions to educate not only the mind

but also the soul.
Catholic Schools, like St. Ann's in Wilmington,

Delaware where my grandchildren attend, instill faith, academic

excellence, and service in their students.
Together, we are not just

celebrating a week; we are celebrating the noble mission of Catholic

education, to educate the whole child and transcend the boundaries of

traditional learning.
God bless our Catholic Schools and God Bless the

United States of America.
