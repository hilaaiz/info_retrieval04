According to her, by the time she was in high school, she was truly

addicted to learning as much as she could about what was going on in

the world around her.
So, it was no great surprise when she graduated

from Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, with a

Bachelors degree in TV News.
Shortly after graduation, Lisa started her career as a general

assignment news reporter at KODE-TV in Joplin, Missouri.
She spent four

years at KODE and then moved to KY3 in 1984 as the evening news anchor.
During her time at KY3, she saw TV news reporting change as advanced

technology allowed for live field reporting for the first time.
Portable backpacks and satellite trucks became the norm as KY3 stayed

ahead of the curve in broadcast news.
Now a single individual can do

what used to take a satellite truck, an engineer, a photographer, and a

reporter to deliver a live report.
From technology to techniques in

news gathering, the station has been a leader in television news and

Lisa has been there every step of the way.
Lisa and her husband, Randy, have three children and three

grandchildren.
For more than four decades, she has been a trusted and

familiar voice in our community where she's brought professionalism,

warmth, and a little humor into homes all across the Ozarks.
I'd like

to congratulate Lisa on her retirement, and thank her for her service

to the community.
She will be missed.

HONORING THE BRAVERY OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD

HON.
MICHAEL CLOUD

of texas-

Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary

bravery and service demonstrated in response to the devastating

flooding across Central Texas.
Over the past several days, catastrophic flooding along the Guadalupe

and Colorado Rivers has shaken communities across the Texas Hill

Country.
Lives have been lost, others are still missing, and boots

remain on the ground--searching, rescuing, and doing everything

possible to bring families back together.
On July 4, 2025, as the floodwaters surged near Hunt, Texas, the

United States Coast Guard launched a rescue crew out of Air Station

Corpus Christi at 5:30 a.m. Despite severe weather and three aborted

attempts, the crew aboard an MH-65 Dolphin helicopter pushed through.
That crew--Aircraft Commander Lieutenant Ian Hopper, Co-Pilot

Lieutenant Blair Ogujiofor, Flight Mechanic Petty Officer Seth Reeves,

and Rescue Swimmer Petty Officer Scott Ruskan--is a team of American

heroes who carried out one of the most consequential rescue operations

this country has ever seen.
Petty Officer Ruskan was lowered into the flood zone and coordinated

rescues for more than three hours, working with state, local, and

military partners across three landing zones.
In his first rescue

mission, he helped save 165 lives--15 of whom were airlifted directly

by the Coast Guard crew.
This mission was one part of a larger operation, powered by 54 Coast

Guard personnel rotating day and night to keep rescue efforts moving

across the region.
Every hour, lives are being saved by men and women

who step into harm's way so others can make it home.
In the face of

tragedy, we're reminded of what makes this country strong:

selflessness, courage, and Americans willing to step into danger to

protect others.
Texans are known for their resilience, but no one overcomes disaster

alone.
I thank every Coast Guardsman, first responder, and local

official who acted swiftly and selflessly to help their neighbors.
May God strengthen those still searching, comfort those who mourn,

and bless the brave men and women who ran toward the rising waters.
God bless Texas, and God bless the United States of America.
