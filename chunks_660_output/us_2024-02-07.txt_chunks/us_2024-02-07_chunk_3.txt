Mr. Speaker, I would like to shine a light on the incredible accomplishments of a member of the Michigan State University jazz community: Associate Professor of Jazz Piano, Xavier Davis.
It was 1994 and Xavier Davis, then a college student from Grand Rapids, Michigan, was performing with a small ensemble at a convention in Boston when his tunes caught the ear of the legendary jazz vocalist Betty Carter, a native of Flint.
Carter scooped him up and brought him to New York, hiring him to work exclusively as the pianist for her jazz trio.
Davis spent many years in New York, cultivating his talent, learning from and playing with some of the greatest names in jazz, including Carl Allen, James Williams, Billy Hart, Regina Carter, and Wynton Marsalis.
He served as musical director for the Boy's Choir of Harlem during its 1999-2000 season, played keyboard for the television series ``Cosby,'' and has been featured on more than 50 albums, including a Grammy-winning collaboration with Christian McBride in 2012.
We're so fortunate that after six years of teaching at the famed Juilliard School, Davis brought his talents back home and has been teaching jazz piano at Michigan State University since 2014.
In addition to the many students who have benefited from his instruction, Davis has also dedicated himself to uplifting his adopted hometown of Detroit through his music.
Supported by a grant from Michigan State University's Humanities and Arts Research Program, Davis began composing music about Detroit, which eventually became a powerful album titled ``Rise Up Detroit.''
Through his music, Davis focuses on the role Detroit has played on the lives of African-Americans and on the world at large, highlighting the Underground Railroad, the Great Migration, and the boom days of the auto industry.
Professor Davis is a gifted composer, arranger, and producer of music, and widely recognized as one of the most accomplished jazz pianists in the world.
He is also a proud Michigander, continually giving back to the community and the state that put the music in his soul.
While he is the recording artist, it is my distinct pleasure to record his accomplishments and convey my gratitude for his contributions here. ____________________
HONORING CINDY MACHADO; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 22 Pages: E126 - E126 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CINDY MACHADO ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cindy Machado upon her retirement from the Marin Humane Society (Marin Humane) after 40 years of extraordinary public service.
A longtime Northern California resident, Cindy has been fighting for the rights and welfare of animals with Marin Humane since 1984.
At that time, the animal service officer role was dominated by men, but Cindy's knowledge of animal science, equines and livestock made her an effective enforcer of animal control and cruelty laws.
She was quickly promoted to Field Services Sergeant in 1985 and assumed the role of Animal Services Director in 1996, a position she held until her retirement.
Cindy's impeccable leadership was critical to establishing Marin Humane as a highly respected organization locally, and at the regional, national, and international levels.
She was instrumental in creating the Animal Law Enforcement Academy, a program hosted by Marin Humane through Santa Rosa Junior College, in partnership with the California Animal Welfare Association (Cal Animals).
She also served the Academy as an instructor on issues including animal cruelty investigations, animal hoarding, and inspections, and managed an annual Advanced Academy program for almost two decades.
