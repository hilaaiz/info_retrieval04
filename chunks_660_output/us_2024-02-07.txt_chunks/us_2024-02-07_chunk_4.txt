Cindy's impeccable leadership was critical to establishing Marin Humane as a highly respected organization locally, and at the regional, national, and international levels.
She was instrumental in creating the Animal Law Enforcement Academy, a program hosted by Marin Humane through Santa Rosa Junior College, in partnership with the California Animal Welfare Association (Cal Animals).
She also served the Academy as an instructor on issues including animal cruelty investigations, animal hoarding, and inspections, and managed an annual Advanced Academy program for almost two decades.
From pet shops and cock fighting rings to circuses and amusement parks, Cindy has worked tirelessly to end animal cruelty.
She has led investigations, testified in court, and participated in many legislative hearings.
Her influence has been far reaching as an advocate and educator, leading trainings and workshops on behalf of Marin Humane across the world, including at the Brazilian Animal Welfare Congress in 2000, in Taiwan with the Humane Society of the United States in 2001, and in Mexico with Compassion Without Borders in 2005.
Cindy has also been an animal advocate in preparation and response to natural disasters.
She co-founded the Marin Horse Council's Equine Evacuation Committee in 2006, represented Marin Humane with Marin's Emergency Operations Center since 1996, and spearheaded a Marin County Veterinary Medical Association and Marin Humane joint committee to educate the community on impacts on animals.
When a disaster hit, Cindy was always quick to act.
She deployed to Houston during Hurricane Katrina to assist with animal evacuations, the 2009 Cosco Busan oil spill in San Francisco Bay, and nearly every wildfire in the region.
Among her numerous commitments, Cindy is a member and former chair of the Marin Humane Advocacy Committee, member and trainer of the CalAnimals Training Committee, Advisory Member of the Big Cat Sanctuary Alliance, and co-founder of the Marin County Hoarding Alliance Taskforce.
Cindy was also pivotal in creating a non-lethal predator control model in collaboration with Marin's Agricultural Commission and Project Coyote, which remains in use today.
Mr. Speaker, I have personally witnessed Cindy in action and can attest to her knowledge, skills, and commitment to animal welfare.
As

Cindy Machado retires after 40 years of service, she leaves an indelible legacy of good deeds for animals in Marin County and the extended region.
I respectfully ask that you join me in expressing heartfelt gratitude to Cindy for her generosity of spirit, innumerable achievements and in sending her best wishes on her next endeavors. ____________________

He received his bachelor's and a master's degree in Economics/Environmental Economics from San Diego State University.
Jim served as Contra Costa County's Redevelopment Director for 35 years where he spearheaded efforts to improve traffic congestion and quality of life throughout the region until his retirement in 2011.
Jim has worked tirelessly to implement transit-oriented development at the Pleasant Hill BART Station Area.
Jim led efforts to develop office spaces, high density residential spaces, and initiate improvements to greenspaces and trails.
This effort supports many quality jobs and features affordable housing units and convenient retail shops along the 680 Corridor.
The high-quality housing in proximity to recreation and transit also attracts workers from San Francisco and other job centers along the BART line.
Jim played a vital role in overseeing this project and helping to achieve this goal.
