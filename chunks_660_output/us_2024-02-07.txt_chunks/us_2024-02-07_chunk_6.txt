Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mrs. Debra Martin Berkoski and her husband, Steven Berkoski, for their combined successes at the 108th Pennsylvania Farm Show.
The week contains a multitude of meanings for her, including her birthday.
Debra began attending the Farm Show at 10 years old, showing sheep.
This year, as she turned 57 years old, she and Steven won a combined 89 ribbons out of the 100 competitions they entered, 22 of them being first place prizes.
Most notably, Debra took home first prize in Pennsylvania's Greatest Whoopie Pie contest with her pumpkin whoopie pie.
Anyone from our Commonwealth knows that whoopies pies are essential desserts at any Pennsylvanian event.
Throughout the week, the Berkoskis commuted over 500 miles between the Harrisburg Expo Center and their home.
In order to produce all of their entries, they used a total of 360 eggs, 60 pounds of sugar, 55 pounds of flour, and 25 pounds of butter.
Mr. Speaker, it is the dedication of people like the Berkoskis that honor Pennsylvania's rich agricultural traditions.
In addition to being active participants in the Farm Show, the Berkoskis operate a 200-year- old family farm in Conestoga.
I want to congratulate the Berkoskis on their success at this year's Farm Show and thank them for their tireless dedication to honoring our community's rich agricultural heritage and sharing their skills and passion with the thousands of individuals who attend the Farm Show each year. ____________________

Madam Speaker, I rise to address the ongoing challenges that too many families in America face coping with poverty and income inequality.
I thank my dear friend, Congressman DeSaulnier, for hosing this Special Order hour, and for his tireless work on these issues.
In the richest country in the world, poverty is a policy choice.
In early 2023, the poverty rate in California rose to 13.2 percent, and the child poverty rate to 13.8 percent.
You cannot disentangle poverty and inequality from systemic racism.
Latinos remained disproportionately poor.
Latinos comprise about half of poor Californians, but only around 40 percent of all Californians.
Additionally, about 13.6 percent of African Americans and 11.5 percent of Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders lived in poverty in California at the beginning of 2023 compared to 10.2 percent of white residents.
That is why I reintroduced legislation calling for the establishment of the first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation.
This Commission will examine the effects of slavery, institutional racism, and discrimination against people of color, and how our history impacts laws and policies today.
But while poverty has a disproportionate impact on people of color, poverty afflicts millions of people in America of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.
