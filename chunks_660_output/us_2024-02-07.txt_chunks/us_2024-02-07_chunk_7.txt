That is why I reintroduced legislation calling for the establishment of the first U.S. Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation.
This Commission will examine the effects of slavery, institutional racism, and discrimination against people of color, and how our history impacts laws and policies today.
But while poverty has a disproportionate impact on people of color, poverty afflicts millions of people in America of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.
That is why I have worked with the Poor People's Campaign to introduce a resolution calling for a Third Reconstruction to fully address poverty from the bottom up.
A Third Reconstruction would prioritize the needs and demands of the 140 million people in America who are poor or one emergency away from economic desperation, with policies focused on healthcare, welfare, water, public education, and housing.
Across the country, rents and home prices continue to rise much faster than income, exacerbating housing instability during an affordable housing supply crisis.
A staggering 78 percent of extremely low income renters in California are severely cost burdened.
meaning they spend more than half of their income on housing and utilities.
This is unacceptable when we have the power and tools to eliminate poverty entirely.
Access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of income, is a human right.
I am proud to sponsor the DEPOSIT Act, which would provide security deposit assistance to low-income renters.
As Chair of the House Democratic Caucus Poverty Task Force.
I won't stop fighting until we pass comprehensive legislation to eradicate poverty, economic inequality, and racial injustice.
There is a strong correlation between U.S. poverty reduction initiatives and declining poverty rates.
We must work to ensure that the Child Tax Credit is restored to American Rescue Plan levels, which cut child poverty in half.
We must ensure the House remains focused on combating poverty in all forms and creating economic opportunity for all Americans.
Together, we can work to reduce disparities and

secure justice for those struggling to put food on the table. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PASTOR GREGORY CHRISTOPHER; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-02-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 22 Pages: E124 - E124 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PASTOR GREGORY CHRISTOPHER ______ of washington in the house of representatives Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my dear friend Pastor Gregory Christopher and to recognize his decades of service to Tacoma's Shiloh Baptist Church and the greater Pierce County community.
Pastor Christopher was called to the Ministry in 1989 and studied under the Pastoral leadership of Pastor Lonnie Brown at The Body of Christ Christian Church in Tacoma, Washington.
He began his tenure with Shiloh Baptist Church in Tacoma's Hilltop neighborhood in 1993.
where he is the Senior Pastor, and will be retiring this February 2024.
In his 23 years on the pulpit, Pastor Christopher has created a legacy that puts him on hallowed ground.
His dedication to his community and his faith places him in the same breath as the legendary Black faith leaders of Tacoma, including the late Rev. Earnest Brazill, who was Pastor Christopher's mentor at Shiloh Baptist Church.
In addition to his congregational leadership, Pastor Christopher also serves on the Tacoma Ministerial Alliance, and is an At-Large Board Member of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. Pastor Christopher has been a fierce and tireless leader outside the Church as well.
He is a compassionate advocate for folks experiencing homelessness, a champion for racial representation, and a catalyst for policy solutions to improve the lives of African Americans in Tacoma and throughout the greater Puget Sound region.
His work has been demonstrated through his service as the President of the Tacoma branch of the NAACP, his membership in the Tacoma Pierce County Black Collective, and his past service on the board of the Tacoma Urban League.
