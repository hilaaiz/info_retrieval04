This effort supports many quality jobs and features affordable housing units and convenient retail shops along the 680 Corridor.
The high-quality housing in proximity to recreation and transit also attracts workers from San Francisco and other job centers along the BART line.
Jim played a vital role in overseeing this project and helping to achieve this goal.
Jim is an active member of the community, having formerly served as President, Executive Director, and Board Member of the California Redevelopment Association.
He also served on the board of the Kennedy- King Memorial Scholarship Fund from 1987 to 2023 and currently serves on the Eden Housing Board of Directors (2013-Present).
He is also a founding Co-Executive Director of the Pleasant Hill BART Leasing Authority.
The Village Green--the connection between the Iron Horse Trail and the Town Square/Fare gates of the BART station--will be named the ``Jim Kennedy Village Green'' in honor of Jim's critical work.
This is a fitting tribute to his vision and hard work.
Please join me in recognizing Jim for his many contributions to our community and devoted service to Contra Costa County. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 22 Pages: E126 - E126 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.
HOWARD MAUTNER ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mrs. CAMMACK.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Florida's Third Congressional District, we wish Mr. Howard Alan Mautner a very happy 100th birthday.
Howard was born in Rockford, Illinois, on April 28, 1924.
When Howard was eight years old, his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin.
He lived there until he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in October 1942 at age 18.
Howard was inducted into the military at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, and went to recruit training at what is now known as Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi.
He was then assigned to radio school in what is now Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, Illinois.
He learned Morse code and radio training.
After schooling, he served several months at Marshall Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Riley, Kansas.
He then reported into an overseas duty staging area at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro, North Carolina.
In September 1943, Howard headed to Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, where he boarded a Liberty ship for the port of Casablanca (Morocco).
Howard served in Naples, Italy between September 1943 and December 1944 before heading onto Venice, Italy from December 1944 to May 1945.
By August 1945, the war was over, but Howard was sent to Vienna, Austria, as part of the occupational force.
Howard was especially grateful to have visited Vienna, as that was his father's birthplace in the late 1880s.
In December 1945, he was transported back to America aboard the USS Randolph, landing at Fort Dix in New Jersey, where he was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant.
For the last several decades, Howard has lived in Ocala, Florida, and has been a treasured member of the Marion County veterans' community.
We are honored to wish him a happy 100th birthday and to thank him for his dutiful service to our Nation.
Congratulations to Howard on this milestone.
We are elated to celebrate with him. ____________________
