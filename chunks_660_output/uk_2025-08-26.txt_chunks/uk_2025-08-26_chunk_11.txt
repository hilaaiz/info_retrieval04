Mead's dextri-maltose was the

first clinically supported infant feed product in the U.S. Today, the

Enfamil family of formulas developed in Evansville support infant

nutrition across the globe, and Enfamil is the top infant formula brand

recommended by pediatricians in the U.S.

Mead Johnson has hired thousands of people in and around Evansville

throughout their history and currently employs nearly 800 employees

working across 25 departments.
Nearly 20 percent of their employees

have been with the company for 15 or more years, showing how much

people value being a part of the Mead Johnson mission.
Mead's R&D

strength comes from a deep bench of diverse experts working across

disciplines to advance infant nutrition.
New scientific discoveries made in Evansville have allowed Mead

Johnson to innovate and evolve their products.
One of the heritage

innovations is the addition of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid that is

critical for infant brain and eye development.
Mead Johnson was the

first in the U.S. to introduce DHA into infant formula in 2002 which is

now widely recognized as a standard of care in infant nutrition.
I

commend Mead Johnson and the important work their team accomplishes in

advancing pediatric nutrition and nourishing the world's children,

starting in Southern Indiana.
