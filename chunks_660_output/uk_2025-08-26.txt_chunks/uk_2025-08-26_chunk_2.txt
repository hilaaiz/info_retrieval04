Morale depended on it.
They were given six months.
They did it in three.
The work of the Six Triple Eight went far beyond mail--it was about

dignity, hope, and connection.
For soldiers far from home, a letter

meant everything.
Kate and her fellow women knew that, and their

determination lifted the spirits of our fighting forces in Europe.
Kate earned multiple military honors for her service, and when the

war ended, she returned home to Texas, married, raised a beautiful

family, and continued a life of service to her community.
Born in Vidor and raised in Sour Lake, Kate was a trailblazer in

uniform and a leader at home.
She lived a life defined by faith,

perseverance, and love for family and country.
And now--decades later--the women of the Six Triple Eight have

finally received the Congressional Gold Medal.
Though the recognition

came late, it is highly deserved.
Their bravery, sacrifice, and

determination are part of our Nation's story, and Southeast Texas is

proud to claim PFC Kate Pate-Walker as one of our own.
Mr. Speaker, may her memory and legacy of service continue to inspire

future generations of Americans to answer the call of duty with

courage.

HONORING MRS.
MONZOLA RANDLE ROSS

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a

lifelong educator, community matriarch, and steadfast servant leader,

Mrs. Monzola Randle Ross of Cruger, Mississippi.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, once said, ``Longevity has its place.''
That truth finds a shining example in the remarkable career and impact

of Mrs. Ross, who faithfully served 41 consecutive years with Central

Mississippi, Inc. Head Start, shaping the lives of more than 2,400

children across Holmes County.
Mrs. Ross began her journey in early childhood education as a part-

time secretary at the

Holly Grove Head Start Center.
Through her dedication and love for

children, she rose to become a teacher, then head teacher, and

eventually center manager.
Even after the closing of Holly Grove, her

commitment never wavered.
She continued to serve with excellence at the

Goodman Head Start Center until her recent retirement.
More than an educator, Mrs. Ross was a life-mentor.
From her handmade

brown-paper-bag puppets ``Mr. Do'' and ``Mr. Don't,'' to the life

lessons she instilled in every classroom, she taught not only ABCs and

123s, but discipline, respect, and purpose.
Her former students have

gone on to become teachers, entrepreneurs, ministers, realtors, health

professionals, farmers, public servants, and even Head Start managers

themselves.
In every one of their stories, her legacy endures.
She holds a national Child Development Associate credential and has

received numerous awards throughout her career.
Yet, her greatest

reward came from the joy of watching children grow, thrive, and

succeed--and from the unwavering support of her late husband, Mr.

Albert Ross, her daughters Rose Berry, Lawanda Ross, and Pamela Wiley,

and her beloved grandchildren.
Even in retirement, Mrs. Ross remains a pillar of the Mt. Olive

Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi, where her

celebration drew nearly 100 well-wishers--friends, family, and former

students who came from as far as the West Coast and Chicago.
The event

featured touching tributes, musical performances, and reflections from

those whose lives she touched most deeply.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and

celebrating Mrs. Monzola Randle Ross for her extraordinary devotion to

early childhood education, her love for her community, and her enduring

legacy of compassion, excellence, and service.
Mississippi is better

because of her.
