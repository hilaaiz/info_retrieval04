As a high school

science teacher and coach in the Mount Diablo Unified School District,

he saw firsthand the transformative power of education.
His early

experience in education shaped a lifelong commitment to ensuring that

every child could learn, grow, and succeed, regardless of their

background or zip code.
Recognizing the broader systemic challenges facing education, Mr.

Torlakson entered public office to expand his impact.
He served on the

Antioch City Council and the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors,

where he advocated for stronger schools, safer communities, and greater

opportunities for all residents.
His leadership in local government

paved the way for his election to the California State Assembly and

later the California State Senate, where he continued to be a leading

voice on education and public health policy.
During his tenure in the California Legislature, Mr. Torlakson

authored significant legislation that fundamentally improved the lives

of millions.
Among his many accomplishments, he was instrumental in

establishing California's system of after-school programs, the largest

after-school program system in the nation, providing students with

safe, enriching environments after school hours.
He also spearheaded

the Quality Education Investment Act (SB 1133), securing billions of

dollars in critical funding to support the state's most challenged

schools and reduce educational inequities.
In 2011, Tom was elected as California's 27th State Superintendent of

Public Instruction, a position he held with honor and distinction until

2019.
As superintendent, he championed initiatives to close the digital

divide, address achievements gaps, reduce dropout rates, and promote

innovative programs such as the State Seal of Biliteracy, recognizing

students who achieved proficiency in multiple languages.
His leadership

was key in preserving vital resources for schools and safeguarding

educational opportunities for California's six million students,

despite the state's budget challenges.
Beyond policy achievements, Tom's tenure was marked by his

compassionate nature, which underscored his belief that the future of

our communities, our economy, and our democracy depends on how we

nurture and educate our young people.
He worked collaboratively with

educators, parents, and policymakers to foster a culture of inclusion,

innovation, and excellence.
Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we recognize Tom Torlakson today not

only for his extraordinary record of public service but also for the

profound and positive difference he has made in countless lives.
His

steadfast commitment to education and public welfare stands as an

enduring example to us all.
Please join me in honoring Tom Torlakson

for his lifetime of service, leadership, and dedication to the people

of California.
