1999 to 2002, and as Secretary to the City Manager from 2002 to 2009.

serve as Fredericksburg's Clerk of Council, a groundbreaking

achievement that broke barriers and paved the way for future

generations.
In her years of service, Mrs. Lacey received several professional

accolades including her Certified Municipal Clerk (CMC) certification

and Master Municipal Clerk (MMC) certification.
Mrs. Lacey repeatedly

demonstrated her commitment to excellence in effort and actions when it

processing and managing 797 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests,

and in documenting the factual record with over 7,617 pages of City

Council meeting minutes in the historic record of Council.
As Clerk of Council, Mrs. Lacey guided our community by keeping the

community informed about the operations performed by the government.
She worked with the Mayor, Vice-Mayor, and City Council, keeping

official records, responding to citizen inquiries and keeping citizens

informed about City Council actions.
She acted as the Freedom of

Information Officer (FOIA) and Records Manager for the City of

Fredericksburg, which was a vital position in the continuity of

transparency and public access.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to personally thank Mrs. Lacey for her

remarkable 33 years of service in our community.
We are grateful for

her tireless efforts to ensure that our government operates smoothly

and that our citizens are well-served.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO REQUIRE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES

PERFORMING ACTIVE SERVICE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN RESPONSE TO AN

ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT WHICH RELATES TO CRIME OR CIVIL DISTURBANCE IN

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM SUBSTANTIALLY

SIMILAR TO THE BODY-WORN CAMERA PROGRAM OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE

DEPARTMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would require

members of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard, deployed in

the District of Columbia in response to an order of the President

relating to crime or civil disturbance in D.C. to participate in a

program substantially similar to the body-worn camera program of D.C.'s

police department, the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).
This bill

would apply to the current deployment of troops and any future

deployment.
The use of body cameras by troops during deployments related to crime

or civil disturbance in D.C. would promote transparency in the troops'

interactions with the public and protect the public and the troops.
MPD

has a well-established program for the use of body cameras, as well as

for the preservation and disclosure of body camera footage.
The Trump administration has deployed more than 2,000 National Guard

troops in D.C. This deployment is a raw assertion of power over the

more than 700,000 disenfranchised D.C. residents, a majority of whom

are Black and Brown; a politicization of the military; a disservice to

the members of the National Guard and their families, unwarranted, and

possibly unlawful with respect to both the D.C. National Guard and the

state National Guards.
I have urged the administration to remove these

troops immediately.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING CAMPBELL: THE NATURE OF TRUTH, ODESSA AMERICAN

HON.
AUGUST PFLUGER

Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to include in the Record an

opinion column from the Odessa American titled ``Campbell: The Nature

of Truth,'' published May 1, 2025.
In it, the author reflects on how

society grapples with competing claims of truth and encourages readers

to return to foundational and verifiable sources--a theme with deep

implications for both our civic culture and the way we approach

legislation.
