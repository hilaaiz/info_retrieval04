Mr. LUCAS.
Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong Oklahoman, Jimmy Emmons has

spent years working around the state and across the country promoting

innovative and voluntary conservation practices.
Having someone like Jimmy in a position to lead farm policy isn't

just beneficial for Oklahoma, but the entire country and the world.
I am proud of my longtime friend and fellow Oklahoman for his

willingness to serve the Nation at the Natural Resources Conservation

Service and his commitment to the American farmer.

HON.
JACK BERGMAN

Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Mary

Vollink, an exceptional resident of Traverse City, Michigan, for

receiving the Distinguished Service Award from the Traverse Connect

Board of Directors.
Since 1929, this prestigious honor has been awarded

to outstanding individuals for their significant contributions to

social, economic, and

cultural improvements within the Traverse City area.
Currently, Ms. Vollink serves as the Office Manager and Volunteer

Coordinator for the Salvation Army in Traverse City, where her

dedication to public service has made an immeasurable impact on

Northern Michigan.
Her tireless efforts have both helped countless

individuals in times of need and undoubtedly strengthened the community

across Grand Traverse County.
Ms. Vollink's selection for this award

speaks volumes about her character and her commitment to improving the

lives of others.
Mary's work with the Salvation Army began nearly 40 years ago in

Holland, Michigan.
After relocating to Traverse City in 1988, Ms.

Vollink joined the Traverse City Salvation Army while simultaneously

working for the TCAPS Transportation Department as a school bus driver

for elementary students and students with special needs--a role she

held until 2010.
In addition to serving as the Office Manager and

Volunteer Coordinator for the Salvation Army, Ms. Vollink works as an

Emergency Disaster Services Coordinator for the region.
Throughout her

continued commitment to public service, she has formed lasting bonds

with countless Northern Michigan families.
Mr. Speaker, Mary Vollink exemplifies the spirit of selfless service

that strengthens communities across Michigan's First District.
Her

selection for the Distinguished Service Award is well deserved, and I

ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mary Vollink on this

outstanding achievement and thanking her for her decades of exemplary

service to the people of Traverse City and Northern Michigan.

HONORING 75 YEARS OF EXCELLENCE AT MISSISSIPPI VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and

celebrate the remarkable 75-year legacy of Mississippi Valley State

University (MVSU), an institution that has profoundly impacted the

Mississippi Delta and the state of Mississippi as a whole.
Founded in 1950 as Mississippi Vocational College, MVSU began with a

mission to train teachers for rural and elementary schools and to

provide vocational training.
Over the decades, it has evolved into a

comprehensive university offering a diverse range of undergraduate and

graduate programs, including degrees in environmental health, criminal

justice, business administration, and education.
MVSU's commitment to

academic excellence and community service has remained steadfast

throughout its history.
Under the leadership of its eighth and current president, Dr. Jerryl

Briggs, Sr.,
MVSU continues to advance its mission with the mantra:

``ONE GOAL.
ONE TEAM.
ONE VALLEY . . .
IN MOTION.''
The university has

expanded its reach through off-campus centers such as the Greenwood

Center and the Greenville Higher Learning Center, enhancing access to

education in the Mississippi Delta.
As we commemorate this significant milestone, let us recognize the

contributions of MVSU's students, faculty, alumni, and administration.
Their dedication and hard work have ensured that Mississippi Valley of

State University remains a beacon of opportunity and a catalyst for

positive change in our community.
