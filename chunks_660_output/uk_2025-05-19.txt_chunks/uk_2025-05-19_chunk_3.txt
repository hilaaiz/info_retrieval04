expanded its reach through off-campus centers such as the Greenwood

Center and the Greenville Higher Learning Center, enhancing access to

education in the Mississippi Delta.

Their dedication and hard work have ensured that Mississippi Valley of

State University remains a beacon of opportunity and a catalyst for

positive change in our community.

RECOGNIZING DELAYNIE BOWLEY, GOLD AWARD GIRL SCOUT

HON.
MARK E. AMODEI

Mr. AMODEI of Nevada.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues

to join me in congratulating Delaynie Bowley.
Delaynie is a member of

Girl Scouts of the Sierra Nevada, Troop 188, and has exemplified

extraordinary leadership, innovative problem-solving, and a

demonstrated commitment to making a lasting, positive impact, by

earning the most prestigious award in Girl Scouting, the Gold Award.
Gold Award Girl Scouts are recognized as trailblazers who are willing

to tackle the most pressing challenges facing their communities and the

world with measurable, sustainable, and far-reaching results.
To earn

the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify

and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead

a team of experts and community members to implement a project that

produces lasting change.
Over the course of 1 to 2 years, Gold Award

Girl Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and

leadership, distinguishing them from their peers.
Through their

resourcefulness and perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to

truly make the world a better place.
For her Gold Award project, Delaynie Bowley created ``Pet Safety

Patrol'' to tackle the widespread issue of pet poisoning, which affects

more than 401,500 animals annually in the U.S. Recognizing a gap in pet

owners' knowledge about household hazards and essential pet first aid,

Delaynie assembled and distributed pet first aid kits at Desert Hills

Animal Hospital.
She educated more than 50 people in one-on-one

meetings about common dangers in their own homes.
She provided each

participant with a pet first aid kit, which included a pamphlet with a

link to her website, which offers additional resources and a

customizable pamphlet for animal hospitals and veterinarians to use

nationwide.
On behalf of the 2nd Congressional District of Nevada, I congratulate

Delaynie Bowley for achieving the highest distinction in Girl Scouts,

the Gold Award.
We thank Delaynie for her leadership and for making

such a positive, lasting change in our community.
