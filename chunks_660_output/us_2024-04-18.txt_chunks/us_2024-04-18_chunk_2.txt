Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mayor David Helms, who passed away on March 20th, at the age of 83.
Mayor Helms was born on October 11, 1940, in Glade Spring, Virginia.
Upon his graduation from Glade Spring High School, he studied elementary education at Emory & Henry College.
Later, he received his master's degree in education from Radford University.

He served in his role as Principal until his retirement from education in 2000.
From 1990-2000, Mr. Helms served on the Marion Town Council.
He became Marion's Mayor in 2000.
In public office, Mayor Helms pursued projects to revitalize downtown Marion and improve his community.
Mayor Helms was a fierce advocate in recognizing veterans for their contributions and sacrifices.
He worked closely with the Marion VFW chapter and the East Tennessee Chapter of Rolling Thunder.
Mayor Helms also played an instrumental role in promoting Marion's Memorial Day activities.
Marion's Memorial Day parade is one of the most patriotic festivities in the Ninth District of Virginia.
I have loved being in the parade with Mayor Helms.
It receives widespread praise across the Commonwealth and the region every year.
Also, Mayor Helms was an active member of the Glade Spring Volunteer Fire Department.
He admitted that firefighting and rescue services were in his blood.
Mayor Helms is survived by his wife Sue Winsett Helms; brother-in- law, Clyde Hoots; many cousins, nieces, nephews, and their families.
I had the pleasure of working with Mayor Helms over the years.
His love for Marion and Smyth County was evident.
As a public-school teacher, principal, and town council member, Mayor Helms exhibited some of the finest qualities of a public servant. ____________________
