The latter was considered the best such structure in Northwest Ohio at that time.
With rail and telegraph came opportunities for trade and development, leading to ``vibrant economic growth of the 1800's and 1900's, through to the diversified local economy of today,'' according to the history.
Today, Williams County is home to 2,399 businesses including 111 manufacturing companies offering solid employment and good wages for a diverse and skilled workforce.
Famously, Williams County is home to Ohio Art--and Etch-A-Sketch--and Spangler Candy which originated and produces Dum Dum lollipops and other nostalgic treats.
Williams County, Ohio is made up of hardy farmers and pleasant towns including Alvordton, Blakeslee, Bryan, Edgerton, Edon, Holiday City, Kunkle, Lake Seneca, Melbern, Montpelier, Nettle Lake, Pioneer, Pulaski, and Williams Center: lovely communities all.
Well known to most Ohioans is the late Ohio State University football coach Woody Hayes.
Coach Hayes said, ``I speak at a lot of banquets in small towns, because small towns have so many great people.''
I couldn't agree with him more.
I have been privileged to represent Williams County and can attest to the character and kindness of its people.
As they take a peek at yesteryear during a weekend of ceremonial and enjoyable events, I know they also look to the future with hope and celebration.
We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and we build the community forward together.
Onward. ____________________
