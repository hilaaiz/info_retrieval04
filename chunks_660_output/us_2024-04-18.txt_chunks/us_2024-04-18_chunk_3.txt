Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a local Green Bay celebrity and Jeopardy champion, Dr. Ben Chan.
In the Spring of 2023, Ben captured the attention of Jeopardy viewers nationwide.
He went on a nine-game winning streak and won more than $250,000 on the trivia show.
While he was competing, the fans were charmed by his positive attitude; oftentimes, he could be seen ``raising-the-roof,'' and he always placed an exclamation point after his name.
He shared stories about his dogs, Ruthie and Chester, who he plans on spending a portion of his winnings on.
Although Ben's winning streak ended over a controversial rule, he was invited back to compete in the Tournament of Champions.
Ultimately, Ben has won over $350,000 on Jeopardy.
While Ben has an extensive fan-base nationwide, some of his most loyal fans reside in his hometown of Green Bay.
Ben is an assistant professor of philosophy at St. Norbert College in De Pere.
The college community continues to embrace Ben and his success on Jeopardy.
When he is not on campus, Ben can be found greeting fans in the community.
Recently, he hosted public watch parties for his appearances on Tournament of Champions.
Wisconsinites flocked to local restaurants and breweries to cheer him on.
In addition to these events, Ben uses his platform to promote Northeast Wisconsin organizations.
Appleton's Minor League Baseball Team, the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, invited Ben to throw out the first pitch last summer.
He even had the opportunity to shoot the famous Bratzooka cannon, which launches brats into the stands.
When he competed in the Tournament of Champions, he highlighted one of Green Bay's main attractions, Bay Beach Amusement Park.
Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincerest congratulations to Dr. Ben Chan.
He is a trivia genius who is making monumental impacts in the Green Bay community.
I, along with many Wisconsinites, will miss seeing Ben compete on the show.
I look forward to seeing what Ben accomplishes next. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL OF WILLIAMS COUNTY, OHIO; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
68



Date: 2024-04-18 Volume: 170, Issue: 68 Pages: E368 - E368 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL OF WILLIAMS COUNTY, OHIO ______ of ohio in the house of representatives Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a very historic occasion for the people of Williams County, ``nestled in the extreme Northwest corner of Ohio.''
The community will begin a weekend of celebration to commemorate the milestone.
Williams County was named for David Williams, a Revolutionary War hero involved in the capture of British officer Major John Andre.
Originally encompassing a larger area of Northwest Ohio, Williams County was part of territory set aside for Native American people in the Treaty of Greenville.
Part of the territory was also disputed between Ohio and Michigan, a dispute settled in 1836 which placed the county in Ohio.
The land was part of the ``Great Black Swamp'' and was the last in Ohio to be settled.
Because it was swampland, the earliest settlers faced severe hardship with travel, farming, and insects.
Towering native trees blocked sunlight, and conditions were harsh.
Yet these hardy Ohioans persevered, turning this corner of Northwest Ohio into an abundant fertile watershed.
The Williams County Courthouse, today on the National Registry of Historic places, was completed in 1891.
It replaced an original log structure and one completed in 1845.
The latter was considered the best such structure in Northwest Ohio at that time.
With rail and telegraph came opportunities for trade and development, leading to ``vibrant economic growth of the 1800's and 1900's, through to the diversified local economy of today,'' according to the history.
Today, Williams County is home to 2,399 businesses including 111 manufacturing companies offering solid employment and good wages for a diverse and skilled workforce.
