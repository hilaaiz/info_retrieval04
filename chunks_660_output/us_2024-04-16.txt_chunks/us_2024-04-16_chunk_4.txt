These dedicated emergency responders are treating our friends and neighbors amidst their darkest hours, and I am proud to recognize their community service and high level of professionalism in the line of duty.
On behalf of Congress and the 23rd Congressional District, I commend the men and women serving as part of the Lancaster Volunteer Ambulance Corp.
