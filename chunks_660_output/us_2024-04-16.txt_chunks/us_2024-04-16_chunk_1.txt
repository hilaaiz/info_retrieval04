Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Abilene Baptist Church in Georgia's 12th District.
Established near Augusta, Georgia and founded by the pioneering Baptist minister Daniel Marshall, the centuries-long history of Abilene continues to bring hope and unity of God's word to our communities.
As we reflect on 250 years of faith, fellowship, and service, we also remember the journey that has brought us to this moment--through the many challenges, countless blessings, and cherished milestones.
This anniversary is not just a marker of time, but a testament to the unwavering dedication and commitment of each member of this congregation.
One of my favorite passages in the Bible is God's instructions to Joshua in Joshua 1:8: ``Do not let this book of law depart from your lips, be careful to do what it says, meditate on it day and night, and you will be prosperous and successful.''
This anniversary is undoubtedly a celebration, but also a reminder that God has used this congregation in a powerful way and continues to do so.
I express my deepest gratitude to those who have contributed to the years of success of Abilene Baptist Church.
May God bless each and every one of them. ____________________
