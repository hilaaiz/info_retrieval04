Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, Joe Marina, who is a valued volunteer with several community organizations and has been a long-time employee of our community's electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative.
In this capacity, he has served as the face of the organization in the community, presenting millions of dollars of credit refunds to local governments and school boards.
Mr. Marina embodies the heart of a true public servant, lending his expertise, passion, time and energy into all he has been involved with.
He has served in key leadership roles on the Board of Directors for United Way of Pasco, the Pasco Economic Development Council, the Boys and Girls Club, the Vincent House and several other local nonprofits.
Mr. Marina doesn't just lend his name to a cause; when he commits to something, he goes ``all-in''--above and beyond to make a lasting imprint on the lives of those his work touches.
For more than 25 years, whenever there has been an unmet need in the community, Mr. Marina has stepped up to the plate to make sure the job is done, and done right.
He has worked tirelessly on countless large-scale community projects to enrich the lives of the people of Pasco County and to create opportunities for future residents.
He has helped to transform Pasco from a bedroom community to one in which people can truly live, play and work.
His compassion and his desire to empower others to realize their full potential knows no bounds.
As he embarks upon his well-deserved retirement, he leaves behind a legacy of selfless service, commitment to others, and humble leadership.
His shoes will be big to fill.
It is clear that Mr. Marina has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, Mark McClarty, who has been a volunteer with the non-profit, People Helping People (PHP) since 2023.
Mark stepped up to manage the organization's Weekend Blessings program which provides four meals per weekend to children facing food insecurity.
The program also feeds these children throughout the summer.
Careful coordination with the Hernando County School District and other organizations is required to make this initiative successful, and Mark works tirelessly to get the job done.
Mark's background in finance and his people skills are so incredibly valuable.
He continually finds innovative ways to lower the costs while increasing value of the food PHP purchases for the program.
Under his leadership, the Weekend Blessings initiative has grown, as it now serves an additional 150 needy children each week.
The efficiencies he has implemented for this initiative have also been replicated within PHP's senior feeding program.
His positive attitude is infectious.
It is clear that Mr. McClarty has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service.
