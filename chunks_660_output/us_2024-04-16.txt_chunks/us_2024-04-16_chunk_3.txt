Mr. Speaker, for many of the folks I represent in the Upper Cumberland Region of Middle Tennessee, this year feels a lot like 1989.
That's the last time the Pickett County Lady Bobcats were named TSSAA girls basketball state champions.
They reclaimed that title last month, when they defeated the Moore County Lady Raiders, 56-45, in the Class 1A final.
And this championship, Mr. Speaker, was a family affair.
Lady Bobcats Guard Zoe Nicholas now joins her aunt and grandmother in having been members of a Pickett County state championship team.
It doesn't stop there.
Nicholas' cousin, Callie Reeder, is also on the winning team and was even named tournament MVP.
The coach that led the team to victory, Brent Smith, has a brother named Barry, who happened to coach the last winning team 35 years ago.
It's important to note that even though this is the first state championship in a while, the program does very well every season.
It's also important to note that each time the Lady Bobcats have made it out of the quarterfinals and advanced to the state championship, they've won.
I want to congratulate the current champions for keeping that now six-time winning streak alive.
I am proud to represent Pickett County, and many places like it, that take so much pride in their families, communities, and their home team.
I would now like to recognize everyone who carried the team to victory.
Players included: Senior Allie Amonett, Senior Ella K. Keisling, Junior Emmy Lowe, Junior Callie Reeder, Junior Kaylee Tompkins, Sophomore Addison Lowe, Sophomore Zoey Nicholas, Sophomore Kylie Wood, and Freshman Emma Tompkins.
Managers included: Senior Nikki Gunter, Junior Addie Keisling, and Junior Ava Keisling.
I'd also like to recognize Head Coach Brent Smith and Assistant Coach Rochelle Mason for the win.
Again, congratulations to the Pickett County Lady Bobcats, the 2024 TSSAA 1A Girls Basketball State Champions. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate this week's Hometown Hero, Leticia Ferrer.
During last week's solar eclipse, Leticia's lifelong fascination with the movement of the sun and the moon gave her the opportunity to lead a project in North Texas funded by NASA.
Leticia's passion for things out-of-this-world started in childhood and she's dedicated her life to documenting and filming eclipses across the globe.
Collecting data on the sun throughout her viewings, last week the Farmer's Branch native had the opportunity to work with the Citizen CATE project as a coordinator of scientific viewing teams of the eclipse at home in North Texas.
The Citizen CATE project works with NASA and the National Science Foundation to collect data on the magnetic structure and energy of the sun's corona.
Leticia helped lead four teams of North Texans through the process of properly collecting the necessary data and using telescopes to gather images to be studied for years to come.
I'm inspired by Leticia's dedication to the advancement of solar science and thankful for her outreach in North Texas during the total solar eclipse. ____________________
