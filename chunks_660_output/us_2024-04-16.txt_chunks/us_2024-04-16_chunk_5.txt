Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents, David Gonzalez, who is a valued volunteer with several community organizations in Hernando County and has been a long-time employee of our community's electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative.
In this capacity, he has served as the face of the organization in the community, presenting millions of dollars if credit refunds to local governments and school boards.
Mr. Gonzalez has also served in key leadership roles on the Board of Directors for several non-profits in Hernando with the highest levels of dedication, including: the Hernando Chamber of Commerce, Hernando Education Foundation, Hernando Economic Development Council, Oak Hill Hospital Board, and the United Way of Hernando Board.
Whenever there has been a need, Mr. Gonzalez has stepped forward to address it, without concern for who gets the credit.
A truly humble problem-solver, Mr. Gonzalez embodies the concept of servant leadership and has made a lasting impact on the organizations and communities he has served.
While we wish him all the best in his upcoming retirement, we know that his departure from the cooperative will leave behind a void that will not easily be replaced.
It is clear that Mr. Gonzalez has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Ms. Janine Kell.
Ms. Kell is an engaged and dedicated volunteer with Warrior 321, an anti- human trafficking awareness group.
Most recently, Janine was instrumental in hosting the community's second annual Light Up the Night Hernando event to bring awareness about human trafficking to the county.
Janine never sleeps and has truly dedicated her life in every way to fighting on behalf of the vulnerable.
In addition to her work to prevent the horrific crime of human trafficking, Janine regularly speaks at local schools, educating students on the Monique Burr curriculum.
The Monique Burr curriculum is a comprehensive, evidence-based program for kids in grades K-5.
It empowers children and relevant adults with information and strategies to prevent, recognize, and appropriately respond to bullying, cyberbullying, abuse, and digital abuse dangers.
Beyond advocacy, Janine will often work directly with children who have been victims of abuse to help ensure they get the support they need to fully recover.
Her compassion and empathy know no bounds.
It is clear that Ms. Kell has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with.
I am grateful for her service. ____________________
