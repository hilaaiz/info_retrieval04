Julie was

my Budget Director, overseeing the entire budget--a huge responsibility

that she handled for me.
Like everything that Julie did, she did well,

and I never had to worry about a thing.
From helping tens of thousands of Idahoans navigate complex federal

issues to managing my entire state schedule, to personally attending

meetings and events representing me, Julie has been far more than an

asset--she has been family.
As she enters retirement, Julie will enjoy some well-deserved time

with her husband, and their children, Kris and Cole Anderson, Brad

Tensen, Hannah Purdy, and their grandchildren, Max, Jacq, and Maggie.
I will miss Julie, the rest of my staff will miss Julie, and so will

the Idahoans that she so faithfully served for the last two decades.
Mr. Speaker, I offer my sincere gratitude to Julie's husband, John,

for sharing his amazing wife with Team Simpson for all these years.
And

I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and honoring Julie Tensen

for her decades of outstanding public service to the people of Idaho

and this great Nation.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DIANE LUND-MUZIKANT

HON.
MAXINE DEXTER

Ms. DEXTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of

Diane Lund-Muzikant--a fearless journalist, a tenacious truth-teller,

and the founder of The Lund Report, Oregon's pioneering nonprofit

dedicated to health care reporting.
Diane passed away on Saturday, July

26, 2025, at the age of 86, leaving behind an indelible mark on

Oregon's media and public health landscape.
Before I was elected to serve in this body, I spent more than two

decades as a physician.
I saw firsthand how opaque, inequitable, and

profit-driven our health care system can be, and I also saw the vital

role of journalists who were willing to peel back the curtain.
Diane

was one of those few.
She understood that behind every headline about

health care policy are real people--patients, families, and

communities--impacted by decisions made in boardrooms and back rooms.
She made it her mission to hold those in power accountable.
Diane began her reporting career covering local government and

community issues before turning her focus to health care in the 1980's.
Her work with the Medical Society of Metropolitan Portland helped

illuminate the growing dysfunction in our health care system, a story

too often ignored or misunderstood by the broader media.
She went on to found the Oregon Health Forum to convene critical

dialogue around health policy, and then, at age 70, launched The Lund

Report, a nonprofit news outlet that quickly became the gold standard

for health care journalism in Oregon and across the Pacific Northwest.
Relentless in her pursuit of truth, Diane asked hard questions, chased

hard facts, and never shied away from hard truths.
She built a legacy

that will long outlive her.
Diane Lund-Muzikant embodied the best of what journalism can be:

independent, courageous, and grounded in service to the public good.
Her work strengthened Oregon's health care system and made our

communities more informed, more compassionate, and more just.
As we continue to witness the erosion of local news and independent

media, Diane's example reminds us why supporting journalists--and

especially those committed to covering complex systems like health

care--is essential to our democracy.
We owe her our gratitude.
May her memory be a blessing, and may her

legacy continue to inspire the next generation of truth-tellers.
