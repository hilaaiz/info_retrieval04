HONORING THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF RICO BRIGGS; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 141 Pages: E805 - E805 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE HEROIC ACTIONS OF RICO BRIGGS ______ of tennessee in the house of representatives Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend and recognize the extraordinary bravery and quick thinking of a precious young man, Mr. Rico Briggs of Bluff City, Tennessee.
On the morning of August 20th, at just 4 years old, Rico found himself in a critical situation that would test the limits of his courage and maturity.
At approximately 6:15 a.m., a structure fire began at 4988 Bluff City Hwy.
When emergency responders arrived at the scene, they found residents of the apartment building outside, clutching their possessions, with smoke rising from the building.
Upon further investigation, it was discovered that it was Rico Briggs who, upon seeing smoke in his own room, promptly alerted his mother, Ms. Moriah Briggs.
Despite the overwhelming fear and chaos such a situation would induce, Rico's swift actions ensured that his mother could notify all the tenants in the building's other apartments, allowing them to safely evacuate.
Their escape was particularly crucial given the failure of the building's smoke alarm.
It is no exaggeration to state that the actions of Rico Briggs were lifesaving.
Without his immediate response, the outcome could have been gravely different.
Such valor and presence of mind in a child so young are truly exceptional and worthy of the highest commendation.
Moreover, in acknowledgment of Rico's heroic act, the Town of Bluff City has proclaimed August 26th as ``Rico Briggs Day,'' as a testament to the profound impact of his actions on our community.
On this day, every year, we will be reminded not only of the bravery exhibited by this young boy, but also of the importance of looking out for one another and the strength that lies in community bonds.
It is sincerely my hope that as we celebrate Rico Briggs Day annually, it will inspire others, young and old alike, to act with the same courage and selflessness in times of crisis.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the courage of Rico Briggs.
His actions are a testament to the spirit of our community in Tennessee and the values instilled in our youth.
Today, we celebrate Rico, and may we all be inspired by his courage and the profound impact 1 individual can make, regardless of age. ____________________
