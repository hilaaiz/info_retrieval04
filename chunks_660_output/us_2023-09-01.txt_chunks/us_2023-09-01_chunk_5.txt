As a dedicated citizen and voter, of this wonderful country, as he publicly states, Rev. Gomez brings to us an extraordinary plethora of history that he has encountered.
Rev. Gomez was born in Puerto Rico on September 3, 1923.
He attended the University of Puerto Rico and after his graduation made a decision to dedicate his life to ministry and furthered his education at the Seminary of Puerto Rico.
Once graduated he moved to New York City and married his wife, Efigenia Gomez in New York City on August 1, 1954.
While his wife continued raising two daughters and furthering her education to achieve her Degree in Education, Rev. Gomez became pastor of The First Reformed Parish in New York City, later was transferred to Chicago and finally settled into a parish in Philadelphia.
At this parish, Rev. Gomez along with his wife began a Senior Center, Lady Steppers Marching for Parades, an after school program, and with the assistance of volunteer dentists, a dental facility for the community was added onto the parish.
He takes pride in his three grandchildren: Thomas, Ronald & Daniela.
After retirement and the passing of his wife, he moved to Bucks County in Fairless Hills, PA.
Rev. Gomez has truly achieved much in his 100 years of life, and we are appreciative for the dedication he has given throughout his years to the many lives he has touched with his ministry.

Date: 2023-09-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 141 Pages: E807 - E807 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE OF SHIELA D. CORLEY ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shiela D. Corley for receiving a 2023 University of Kentucky Alumni Association Distinguished Service Award.
This prestigious award is presented to those who have provided extraordinary leadership, dedication, and have a history of diligently serving the UK alumni and community.
Shiela grew up on a farm in the small town of Greenville, Kentucky.
She followed her dream of attending the University of Kentucky, where she received both her bachelor's and master's degrees.
After graduate school, Shiela began her career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a dedicated public servant with the National Agricultural Statistics Service and later the Food and Nutrition Service.
I am pleased that she is currently serving on a detail assignment from USDA to the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I chair.
While living in Washington, D.C., Shiela has been an active member of the University of Kentucky's Nation's Capital Alumni Club, serving as vice president from 2004 through 2009.
She currently serves on UK's Alumni Leadership Advisory Council and is active in the Washington, D.C. community as a member of the Junior League and other non-profits, including the Kentucky Society of Washington.
In 2017, Shiela and her family established the Corley Family Endowment in memory of her sister Shannon, who was also a UK alum and avid Wildcat fan alongside Shiela.
The endowment provides support to a member of their hometown community to attend the University of Kentucky.
To date, they have awarded five scholarships, with the first recipient graduating this past May.
Through this endowment, Shiela and her family help others realize their dream of attending the University of Kentucky while also memorializing and celebrating the life and Wildcat spirit of Shannon.
It is my distinct honor to recognize Shiela D. Corley for her outstanding servant leadership to the University of Kentucky, USDA, and as part of the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee team. ____________________
