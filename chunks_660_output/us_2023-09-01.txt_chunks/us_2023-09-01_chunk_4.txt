Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of a local hero, Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Terryson Jackson, who sadly passed away on August 28, 2023, in the line of duty.
Battalion Chief Jackson proudly served the people of Broward County for 19 years.
He began his fire rescue career in March 2004 in Deerfield Beach and joined the Broward Sheriffs Office (BSO) in October 2011.
Chief Jackson joined the Air Rescue 85 team as a flight medic in July 2013, and on February 24, 2016, he was promoted to Captain.
Broward County has acted to posthumously promote Chief Jackson from the rank of Captain to the rank of Battalion Chief.
As a flight paramedic, he impacted the community daily, providing critical patients with the highest prehospital care.
He consistently showed an unmatched passion for the job.
He always provided expert care, compassion, and reassurance to those during their most significant time of need.
He is survived by his parents, son, daughter, and siblings.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in remembering the life and service of Chief Terryson Jackson.
May his memory bless his family, friends, and the Broward County community to whom he dedicated his life in service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of Leona Yost, an incredible mother, grandmother, great- grandmother, and Wisconsinite from Oconto.
Leona Yost was born on July 28, 1923.
She was the daughter of Herbert and Mary Whiting, and she grew up on their family farm.
Leona graduated from Lena High School in the year 1941 and after her graduation, she worked at the egg factory in Oconto and later the Grant Store in Green Bay.
In 1943, Leona married George Yost and they proceeded to work together on the George's family farm in Lena.
Leona and George welcomed five beautiful children who went on to bless them with seven grandchildren, and 17 great grandchildren.
Leona is noted for having an amazing memory and a deep interest in coin collecting and coin history--she loves to share these passions with her grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Potentially of most importance, she is known throughout Oconto for her delicious potato salad.
Leona has always been an active member of the community.
She was an Oconto County 4-H leader for 37 years working for the Meadow Brook 4-H club.
She also worked for several years for the town of Stiles as an election poll worker.
Leona is a truly selfless woman who has worked hard her entire life to give back to others.
She has lived an incredible life and has now reached a very rare milestone.
I would like to ask all my colleagues to join me in wishing Leona Yost happy 100th birthday. ____________________
