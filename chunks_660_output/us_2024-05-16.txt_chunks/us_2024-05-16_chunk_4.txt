I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in honoring Zell Steever's service and spirit.
His loss is felt deeply across the state and Nation.
He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, two sons, John and Scott, two stepsons, Jonathan and Gabriel, six grandchildren, and his brother Sanford.
His resolute mission to protect the planet we call home and his devoted service to his communities will serve as a lasting legacy in the hearts and minds of Connecticut's future environmentalists and conservationists as they continue the work he dedicated his life to. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, yesterday I mistakenly voted Yea on Roll Call No.
202, passage of H. Res.
1210, the Resolution ``Condemning the Biden border crisis and the tremendous burdens law enforcement officers face as a result.''
I intended to vote Nay, as I've consistently done on similar politically-charged, non-binding resolutions that play politics instead of work to achieve a bipartisan solution to the border.
I regret the error. ____________________
