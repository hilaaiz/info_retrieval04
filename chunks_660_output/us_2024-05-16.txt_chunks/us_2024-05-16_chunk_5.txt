Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the service of one of my constituents, Communications Officer Michael Whitaker, of the Citrus County Sheriff's Office.
On Friday, Dec. 8, 2023, Officer Whitaker was working in the Communication Section as an Intake Operator when a constituent called 911 to advise that his 3- month-old daughter, Harmonie, was choking and could not breath.
After de-escalating the parent and helping him become calm enough to follow instructions, Officer Whitaker proceeded to provide lifesaving instructions on how to clear the baby's airway.
The father followed all the instructions and was able to clear her airway.
With Harmonie able to breathe fresh oxygen again, EMS arrived on scene and transported her to a nearby hospital for observation.
Thanks to Officer Whitaker's swift actions, professionalism, and composure, Baby Harmonie is doing great today.
This is just one example of the hard work, dedication, eagerness to help, and servant leadership that Communications Officer Whitaker exhibits every day when he goes to work.
Officer Whitaker is a shining example of what it means to be a Citrus County First Responder.
His work ethic should be a benchmark for which other first responders should strive to attain.
It is evident that Officer Whitaker has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and is qualified to be recognized as a First Responder of the Year for Florida's 12th Congressional District. ____________________
