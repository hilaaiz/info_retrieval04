HONORING MR.
SYD LOOMIS

_____

HON.
VICTORIA SPARTZ

Mrs. SPARTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable career

and retirement of Mr. Syd Loomis, a lifelong Hoosier, dedicated

professional, and beloved member of the Noblesville community.
Born in Waukegan, Illinois, to Joseph ``Jay'' and Marlene ``Mitzi''

Loomis, Syd grew up with strong family values that would guide him

throughout his life.
A 1978 graduate of Noblesville High School, he

married his wife Jeanine in 1982, and together they raised three

wonderful children--Caryn, Amy, and Spencer.
Today, Syd is the proud

grandfather of four granddaughters, who bring him great joy and who

affectionately know him as a devoted supporter of their softball games,

dance recitals, and family traditions.
Syd's career in banking has spanned over 45 years.
Beginning in 1980

as a teller at American National Bank, he went on to serve with

AmeriTrust, Society, Key Bank, Metro, First Indiana, First National,

BMO Harris, and, for the past 15 years to the day, The Farmers Bank,

where he served as Assistant Vice President and Branch Manager.
Syd was

not just a banker, he was a mentor to young professionals, a trusted

advisor to countless customers, and a friendly face who treated

everyone like family.
His service was recognized with numerous honors,

including induction into the Indiana Bankers Association's 40-Year

Banker Club, the Community Pride Award in 2011, and the Keep

Noblesville Beautiful Award in 2013.
Beyond his professional career, Syd has always given generously of

his time and talents to his community.
He has served on the boards of

the Noblesville Chamber of Commerce, the Shepherd Center of Hamilton

County, and the Hamilton Heights Youth Assistance Program.
He is also

well known for his love of the arts, beginning community theatre in

1998 and performing in beloved roles such as George Bailey in It's a

Wonderful Life, Daddy Warbucks in Annie, and the Tin Man in The Wizard

of Oz.
His performances earned several Encore Awards and brought joy to

audiences across Hamilton County.
Syd also shared his love of music in

the choir of First Presbyterian Church, where his faith and voice have

lifted others for decades.
Syd is affectionately known by many as the ``unofficial mayor of

Noblesville,'' a fitting title for a man who never met a stranger and

always left a lasting impression.
I am personally grateful to have

worked alongside Syd, who was my boss when I was a bank teller.
His

kindness, humility, and encouragement left a deep impression on me, as

I know they have on so many others.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Indiana's 5th Congressional District, I

wish to extend my sincere appreciation to Mr. Loomis for his many years

banker, the kind of which we need more.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF CHARLES ``CHARLIE'' JAMES KIRK

speech of

HON.
NANCY PELOSI

Ms. PELOSI.
Mr. Speaker, the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk was

reprehensible.
Members of Congress pray for Charlie's wife, Erika,

their two young children, and all who loved him during their time of

mourning and grief.
We also extend our prayers to all who were present

on the Utah Valley University campus at the time of this tragedy, who

will carry the trauma of that day with them forever.
In recent years, a disturbing and unacceptable pattern has emerged:

individuals being targeted for their role in public life or for their

association with political discourse.
Violence of this nature is not an

attack on one person alone--it is an assault on democracy itself, meant

to silence debate, sow fear, and tear at the fabric of our civil

society.
We remember the assassination attempt on Congresswoman Gabby

Giffords, which left her critically injured and six innocent lives

lost.
