From legislative advocacy in Washington to youth programs like

Cornhusker Boys State, Landkamer's commitment to service has never

wavered.
His work on national committees including--Americanism, Homeland

Security, and Veterans Preference--demonstrates his steadfast

commitment to our veterans and Nation.
Jerry Landkamer embodies the very spirit and service of the American

Legion.
I'm honored to recognize his election to National Vice

Commander and know his family and community share in the same pride of

this well-earned achievement.

WELCOMING HIS ALL-HOLINESS ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW

_____

HON.
JOSH GOTTHEIMER

Mr. GOTTHEIMER.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to welcome the Ecumenical

Patriarch of Constantinople, His All-Holiness Bartholomew, to

Washington, D.C. this week, and to congratulate him on receiving the

distinguished Templeton Prize.
His All-Holiness has been a steadfast leader for the Orthodox Church,

and especially for my constituents in New Jersey.
He continues to

encourage us all to reach toward peace, to love and respect our

neighbors, and to uphold our values as a Nation.
At a time when hate and intolerance are surging across the country,

His All-Holiness's focus on religious freedom is a powerful reminder

that we must work together and respect one another.
In the greatest

country in the world, there should be no room for intolerance or hate

of any kind.
As His All-Holiness Bartholomew has said, ``We have it in our power

either to increase the hurt inflicted on our world or to contribute

toward its healing.
The choice is ours.''
Together, we must work toward

a world filled with healing and hope.
