Its legal and

resettlement clinics have helped newcomers navigate complex systems

with dignity.
The mental-health and women's empowerment initiatives

have provided care and community, and its cultural events have fostered

understanding between neighbors.
When Afghans arrived in large numbers following the fall of Kabul,

Afghan American Community Organization mobilized volunteers, partnered

with faith and civic groups, and worked together with local, state, and

federal agencies to secure housing, enroll children in school, connect

families with health care, and ensure that no one was left behind.
On this milestone anniversary, I congratulate the Afghan American

Community Organization Board, dedicated staff, volunteers, and

community partners whose steadfast efforts made this achievement

possible.
Their work reminds us that welcoming the newcomer and lifting

our neighbors are enduring American values.
I congratulate them on ten years of service, and wish the Afghan

American Community Organization continued success in the decades ahead.

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

_____

HON.
JACK BERGMAN

Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize and honor Camilla

``Cam'' Williams for her extraordinary dedication, service, and

unwavering commitment to the Republican Party and to our shared

conservative values.
For well over a decade, Cam has been a faithful Republican precinct

delegate and a constant presence in efforts to support Republican

candidates at the local, state, and national level.
She has given

countless hours of her time to ensure that our Party's message is heard

and that our candidates have the support they need to succeed.
Cam has set records in the State of Michigan for the most phone calls

made in support of Republican candidates, an achievement that

demonstrates not only her dedication, but also her determination to

connect with voters and strengthen our Nation through grassroots

engagement.
She has given thousands of hours of volunteer service,

never asking for recognition or reward.
Her work has been marked by

passion, humility, and humor.
Through her vigor and tireless spirit,

she has shown us all what it means to serve faithfully.
Cam embodies the very best of what it means to be a Patriot, someone

who works not for personal gain, but out of love for her community, her

country, and the values that have guided generations of Americans.
The

positive impact of her service is felt across Michigan and beyond and

will continue to inspire future leaders in our movement.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Michigan's 1st Congressional

District, I thank Camilla Williams for her service, her leadership, and

her enduring commitment to the conservative cause.
