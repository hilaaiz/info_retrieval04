In recent years, a disturbing and unacceptable pattern has emerged:

individuals being targeted for their role in public life or for their

association with political discourse.
Violence of this nature is not an

attack on one person alone--it is an assault on democracy itself, meant

to silence debate, sow fear, and tear at the fabric of our civil

society.
We remember the assassination attempt on Congresswoman Gabby

Giffords, which left her critically injured and six innocent lives

lost.
We remember the shooting at a Congressional baseball game

practice, which seriously wounded Congressman Steve Scalise and injured

five others.
We recall the chilling plot to kidnap Michigan Governor

Gretchen Whitmer.
We will not forget the storming of the United States

Capitol on January 6th, which resulted in the deaths of five law

enforcement officers and shook the very foundations of our democracy.
My own family still lives with the trauma of a near-deadly attack on

my husband, Paul, in our home by an individual seeking to kidnap me--an

act of violence that underscored in the most personal way the

escalating threats that public officials and their loved ones endure.
We have also seen assassination attempts on the life of President

Donald Trump; the arson targeting Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's

residence and family; the heartbreaking assassination of Minnesota

House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the

attempted assassination of State Senator John Hoffman and his wife.
And

now, we are horrified by the murder of Charlie Kirk, targeted while

exercising his right to speak freely on a college campus.
All of these incidents must be denounced unequivocally and without

qualification.
Violence has no place in our political process, in our

communities, or in our country.
At the same time, we have a solemn

responsibility to act.
Congress must work with state and local leaders,

law enforcement, and communities to ensure the security of Members,

staff, and constituents alike--so that all Americans may fully

participate in civic life without fear.
That also means we must address

the epidemic of gun violence in our country to keep our children and

their families safe.
Let us be clear: political differences must be resolved at the ballot

box and through dialogue, never through the barrel of a gun or the

threat of violence.
The strength of our democracy lies not in

unanimity, but in the peaceful contest of ideas.
Together, we must

recommit to protecting that principle and the American

people, to lowering the temperature of political rhetoric, and to

honoring the dignity and humanity of every person engaged in public

service.

HONORING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AFGHAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

ORGANIZATION

_____

HON.
ERIC SWALWELL

Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Afghan American

Community Organization on the celebration of their tenth anniversary on

September 20, 2025.
For a decade, the Afghan American Community Organization has served

as a trusted, compassionate partner to Afghan and Afghan American

families--strengthening civic participation, expanding opportunity, and

celebrating a rich cultural heritage that is now a vibrant part of my

district and the American story.
Whether it has been English language and citizenship classes, youth

mentorship and college readiness, small business advising, or workforce

development, the Afghan American Community Organization has opened

doors for thousands in the Afghan American community.
Its legal and

resettlement clinics have helped newcomers navigate complex systems

with dignity.
The mental-health and women's empowerment initiatives

have provided care and community, and its cultural events have fostered

understanding between neighbors.
When Afghans arrived in large numbers following the fall of Kabul,

Afghan American Community Organization mobilized volunteers, partnered

with faith and civic groups, and worked together with local, state, and

federal agencies to secure housing, enroll children in school, connect

families with health care, and ensure that no one was left behind.
