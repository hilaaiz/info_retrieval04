His consistent philanthropy and his tireless efforts in supporting our community's conservation efforts are worthy of commendation.
Tim is a native Ann Arborite who attended Pioneer High School, where he is in their Athletic Hall of Fame for his accomplishments as a member of both the football and basketball teams.
To this day, Tim is an active booster of the Pioneer Football Program and started the Pioneer Academic Athletic Fund.
His own athletic talents on the field earned him a position on the University of Michigan Football Team, a premier educational institution which he would graduate from with a bachelor's degree in economics and a Master of Business Administration degree.
Tim is not only a former Chief Executive Officer, board member for major business organizations, and longtime supporter of our community's educational institutions, but has also contributed significantly to our state's natural resources conservation.
As Chair of the conservation group, ``The Wolfpack'', Tim was instrumental in leading various conservation and environmental groups to accomplish the organization's goals.
The Wolfpack is composed of some of our state's leading organizations in environmental work, but Wolfpack's impact has also extended past local efforts to advocate that Congress take action to protect our land and waterways from contaminants, to support wildlife, and to preserve our Great Lakes.
As Chair, Tim was responsible for leading this coalition that continues to do invaluable work for our natural at areas.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Timothy Wadhams for his dedication to conservation, philanthropy, and community development in the Ann Arbor regional area.
I thank Tim. ____________________
