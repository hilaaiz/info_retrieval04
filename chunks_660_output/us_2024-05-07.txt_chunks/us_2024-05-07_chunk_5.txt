RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF KELLY LUNGREN McCOLLUM; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-05-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 79 Pages: E461 - E461 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF KELLY LUNGREN McCOLLUM ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Kelly Lungren McCollum, my Chief of Staff since my election to Congress in 2010.
Kelly is retiring from Capitol Hill today, having served several Members of Congress for more than twenty-five years.
The daughter of former U.S. Congressman Dan Lungren, Kelly was born in Long Beach, California.
Upon her father's first election to Congress, her family moved to the Washington, DC area in 1979.
Raised in Vienna, Virginia, Kelly attended Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic School.
Kelly graduated from high school in three years and started at Santa Clara University.
Shortly thereafter, Kelly began a career in August of 1994 as a Congressional staffer for then-U.S. Representative James Inhofe, who at that time was running for Oklahoma's open U.S. Senate seat.
During Kelly's time in Congress, she held every position in my district and D.C. offices, other than Legislative Director.
After her service to the Sooner State, Kelly returned to Capitol Hill and entered a new chapter of her professional life, serving as Chief of Staff to U.S. Congressman Jeff Fortenberry.
Around the same time, she would meet her loving husband, Jason, whom she has been married to for nearly eighteen years.
Kelly would continue in Congress, dedicating a period of time to the legislative team of U.S. Representative Louie Gohmert before the beginning of a thirteen-and-a-half-year career as my Chief of Staff.
As my Chief of Staff, Kelly will be best remembered as a true professional, a dedicated servant to the people of Virginia's Ninth District, and a source of responsible leadership for my staff, colleagues, and family.
More importantly, she has been a great friend.
Congratulations to Kelly on her remarkable career.
Her institutional knowledge, loyalty and leadership are qualities that will be missed by my office and many others.
I wish her nothing more than the absolute best. ____________________
