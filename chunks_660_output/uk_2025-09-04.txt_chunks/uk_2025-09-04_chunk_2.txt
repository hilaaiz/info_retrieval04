HONORING PENINSULA FAMILY SERVICE AND COMMEMORATING ITS 75TH

ANNIVERSARY

HON.
KEVIN MULLIN

Mr. MULLIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Peninsula Family Service and

commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the founding of this impactful

nonprofit, and its unique history and significance to my district.
Peninsula Family Service was founded on April 24, 1950, responding to

a need to provide counseling for veterans who had returned from World

War II and their families.
The San Francisco Bay Area has evolved over

many decades, and Peninsula Family Service has been there every step of

the way--providing support, caring for neighbors, and becoming a deeply

trusted part of our community.
Peninsula Family Service is well-known

for its ability to adapt and respond to local needs, and it provides

support to program participants at every stage of life, from children

and families to adults over 100 years young.
The organization has more

than 45 programs, sites, and services, reaching 10,000 of our neighbors

in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties in California.
Today these

services are more relevant than ever.
The priority program areas for

Peninsula Family Service are early learning, employment services,

financial empowerment, and older adult services.
The scope of Peninsula Family Service programs is broad: Older adults

can participate in any one of numerous exercise classes, including Tai

Chi and Zumba, or get a nutritious lunch, which is provided each day at

the organization's Fair Oaks Adult Activity Center in Redwood City.
The

Fair Oaks Center is part of the Peninsula Family Service's

comprehensive approach to health, wellness and overcoming isolation for

our older adults, all key components of its Overcoming Loneliness

Initiative, through which the organization is a San Mateo County

leader.
Parents of children from birth to 5 years old are served at

Peninsula Family Service early learning centers, of which there are

soon to be eleven around San Mateo County.
