NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable

landmark of our history from my hometown of South Dayton.
For 150

years, the South Dayton Depot has been a center of connection, culture,

and community spirit.
Since its founding in 1875, the South Dayton

Depot has welcomed generations of travelers and neighbors, serving

first as a vital hub for freight and passenger service, and now as a

museum where history is preserved for generations to come.
The South Dayton Depot has not only preserved our community's

railroad heritage, but has also become a gathering place where

neighbors connect and visitors experience the rich story of our region.
From its role in major motion pictures like The Natural and Planes,

Trains and Automobiles, to its continued service through the Movie and

Rail Museum, the South Dayton Depot stands as a living link between our

past and present.
On September 6, 2025, the Village of South Dayton will celebrate the

South Dayton Depot's 150th anniversary with a community celebration

that honors both its historic legacy and its enduring role as the heart

of the village.
Thanks to the dedication of local leaders,

volunteers, and preservation groups, the South Dayton Depot continues

to thrive as a source of pride for the entire region.
I ask that the United States House of Representatives join me in

honoring the enduring legacy of the South Dayton Depot and congratulate

them on this important milestone.

WELCOMING HIS ALL-HOLINESS ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW

HON.
WILLIAM R. TIMMONS IV

Mr. TIMMONS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome to Washington,

D.C., His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual

leader of Orthodox Christianity worldwide.
As Archbishop of

Constantinople--New Rome, His All-Holiness is recognized as the ``first

among equals'' of Orthodox Primates and shepherds more than 300 million

faithful across the globe.
Since his election in 1991, Patriarch Bartholomew has been an

unwavering advocate for peace, interfaith dialogue, religious freedom,

and environmental stewardship, earning him the title of ``Green

Patriarch'' and international recognition for his vision of

reconciliation and unity.
He has convened historic gatherings of

Orthodox leaders, fostered dialogue with other Christian traditions,

and extended a hand of friendship to leaders of the Jewish and Muslim

faiths.
In South Carolina's 4th District, the Greek Orthodox community has

been a vital part of our religious and cultural life.
Families in

Greenville and Spartanburg have shared their faith and traditions for

generations, strengthening the bonds of community and enriching the

fabric of our state.
On behalf of my constituents in South Carolina's 4th District,

including the faithful at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in

Spartanburg, I extend a warm welcome to His All-Holiness Ecumenical

Patriarch Bartholomew.
His presence in Washington is a reminder of the

enduring bonds of faith, freedom, and shared values that unite people

of all backgrounds.
