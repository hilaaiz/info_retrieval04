It quotes James Madison, who said ``this power

over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and

effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate

representatives of the people.''
I urge my colleagues to hear this

message today.
This resolution is endorsed by more than a dozen public interest and

legal advocacy organizations, who stand united in reasserting the

essential roles of the legislative and judicial branches and in

declaring unequivocally that no individual--especially the President--

is above the law.
This resolution affirms what should be nonpartisan truths: that the

separation of powers is vital for a functioning republic, that Congress

controls the public purse, and that the rule of law and the protection

it affords are for everyone.
In the face of escalating threats to our

constitutional order, Congress must not remain silent.
This resolution

is a declaration of principle and a call to action.
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to cosponsor this

important resolution.

RECOGNIZING LAKE COUNTY SCHOOLS ON EARNING AN ``A'' RATING FROM THE

FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

HON.
DANIEL WEBSTER

Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to

recognize Lake County Schools in Lake County, Florida, for their

outstanding achievement in earning an ``A'' rating from the Florida

Department of Education for the 2024-2025 school year.
Lake County Schools currently operates 49 schools, serving students

from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, with approximately 48,285

students and 2,696 teachers.
This marks the first time since 2008 that

the Lake County School District has earned this prestigious

distinction, reflecting the district's unwavering commitment to

academic excellence, student achievement, and community support.
Under the leadership of Superintendent Diane Kornegay and the

dedicated members of the Lake County School Board, the district earned

this ``A'' rating by achieving a high percentage of points based on

student performance across a wide range of academic indicators.
These

include standardized assessments in English Language Arts, Mathematics,

Science, and Social Studies, as well as learning gains in English

Language Arts and Mathematics.
Among the most notable improvements were a 15 percent increase in

Algebra 1 proficiency, a 7 percent increase in English Language Arts

for grades 9 and 10, a 4 percent overall increase in English Language

Arts scores, and a 4 percent improvement in Civics end-of-course exam

performance.
Additionally, the district proudly reports a high school

graduation rate of 93 percent, a significant achievement that speaks

volumes about the commitment of the students, educators, and families

of Lake County.
I am pleased to join our community in congratulating the teachers,

administrators, support staff, and especially the students of Lake

County Schools for their hard work, diligence, and determination in

making this achievement possible.
I thank them for their continued

pursuit of educational excellence.
