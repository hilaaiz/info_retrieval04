Jim began his judicial career as a law clerk to Illinois Supreme

Court Justice Robert C. Underwood before serving as an Associate

Circuit Judge for 3 years and as a Circuit Judge for 8 years.
In 1986,

Judge Knecht was elected to the Illinois Fourth District Appellate

Court.
Currently, he is the longest serving judge in Illinois court

history and an accredited leader within the Illinois law community.
He

is a member of the Illinois State and McLean County Bar Associations,

the American Judicature Society, the Illinois Judges' Association, the

Appellate Lawyers Association, and is a fellow of the Illinois Bar

Foundation.
Outside of the courtroom, Judge Knecht is heavily involved in our

Illinois communities and within his alma maters.
He serves on the

Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council and on the National

Advisory Board of the Corporate Alliance to End Partner Violence.
Additionally, he spent time as an adjunct professor at both Illinois

State University and the University of Illinois College of Law.
At

Illinois State University, his time as an adjunct professor lasted

nearly three decades and he is a recipient of their Distinguished

I want to congratulate Judge Knecht on this momentous achievement and

thank him for his continued service to the state of Illinois.
I wish

Judge Knecht, his wife Ruth, their children and grandchildren many

years of happiness and success in the future.

HONORING CORPORAL DENNIS C. ZAVADA

HON.
VICTORIA SPARTZ

Mrs. SPARTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Dennis C.

Zavada USMC

(Ret.),
a proud United States Marine, Vietnam veteran, and the devoted

parent of a U.S. military veteran.
Mr. Zavada has served his country

not only in uniform, but also through his unwavering dedication to

preserving the Fallen Hoosier Heroes Memorial in Westfield, Indiana.
Since 2009, Mr. Zavada has volunteered his time and labor to care for

this living tribute to 210 Indiana service members, who lost their

lives in the wars following September 11.
The Memorial was founded by

fellow Vietnam Veteran Command Sergeant Major Donald E. Peed, who

initially placed white crosses on his property to honor the fallen.
What began as a few simple crosses grew each year, becoming a powerful

community landmark.
The first cross honored Marine Sergeant Jeanette

Winters, the first woman killed in combat during Operation Enduring

Freedom.
The most recent cross honors Marine Corporal Humberto Sanchez,

who was killed outside the Kabul airport in Afghanistan during the 2021

withdrawal.
Mr. Zavada has devoted hundreds of hours to maintaining the Memorial.
He mows the grass, clears snow in winter, salts the walkways, replaces

worn flags, and commissions plaques for newly fallen heroes.
Beyond

upkeep, he has become a steward of memory--sharing the stories behind

each cross and ensuring that every name is remembered with dignity.
Each spring, local elementary school students visit the Memorial,

where Mr. Zavada teaches them about the service and sacrifice

represented there.
Through his words and care, young people learn the

deep cost of freedom and the value of honoring those who gave

everything.
Local businesses support his work anonymously, providing funds for

flagpole upgrades, flowers, and supplies.
The Carmel VFW also

contributes to maintenance and expenses, helping preserve this hallowed

ground.
On behalf of Indiana's 5th District, I thank Corporal Dennis Zavada

for his honorable service in Vietnam, his continued care for the Fallen

Hoosier Heroes Memorial, and his lasting contributions to the community

and the country.
