preservation, tirelessly advocating for the restoration and

conservation of our town's most treasured landmarks.
She has played a

crucial role in securing grants and funding for preservation projects,

working closely with local government and historical societies to

ensure that our community's history remains intact.
Her leadership in

restoration initiatives has not only beautified our town but has also

increased public awareness about the importance of preserving our

collective heritage.
Through her efforts, several historic buildings

that were once in danger of demolition have been revitalized,

contributing to the town's unique character and charm.
Beyond her work

in historic preservation, Andrea is a dedicated volunteer who has given

countless hours to various community projects.
She has been

instrumental in organizing events that celebrate our local heritage,

including historical walking tours, educational workshops, and town-

wide clean-up efforts.
Her ability to bring people together and inspire

civic pride has strengthened the community's appreciation for its past

while fostering a sense of unity and belonging among its residents.
Andrea's service extends beyond preservation efforts.
Andrea

consistently demonstrates a deep commitment to the well-being of

others.
Her selflessness and drive to create positive change make her a

role model for all who know her.
Her leadership and generosity have

earned her are admiration of both peers and community members.
Andrea

is not one to seek recognition for her contributions; she simply

believes in making a difference.
Her work has inspired many to take an

active role in preserving the town's history and engaging in

volunteerism, creating a ripple effect that will be felt for years to

come.
Andrea Read's tireless efforts in historic preservation, her

unwavering dedication to volunteerism, and her commitment to community

service make her a truly deserving recipient of the Local Hero Award.
Her passion for preserving the past, coupled with her devotion to

improving the present, has left a lasting legacy in Brooksville.
