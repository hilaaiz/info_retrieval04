CELEBRATING BOBBY STEPHEN'S ANNUAL ST.
PATRICK'S DAY EVENT

HON.
CHRIS PAPPAS

Mr. PAPPAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Bobby

Stephen's Annual Saint Patrick's Day event in Manchester, New

Hampshire.
Since its inception in 1978, this cherished tradition has

brought together the community in a celebration that goes beyond mere

festivity.
Over the years, Bobby's event has become a cornerstone of

charitable giving in our state, raising funds to support educational

opportunities for disadvantaged youth throughout New Hampshire.
The origins of this event can be traced back to Bobby's restaurant,

the Vault, where a small gathering of friends and patrons first came

together to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day.
What began as a modest

celebration has evolved into a significant fundraiser, drawing hundreds

of attendees each year.
Through the Bobby Stephen's Fund for Education,

the proceeds from this event have provided scholarships to New

Hampshire citizens, enabling them to further their career goals through

postsecondary education.
Bobby's unwavering dedication to this cause

has made a tangible difference in the lives of countless students and

their families.
As we mark the grand finale of this event in its ``sunset'' year of

2024, it is fitting to reflect on the enduring legacy that Bobby's

Saint Patrick's Day celebration has created.
Across four decades this

event has not only raised over $500,000 in scholarships, it has also

fostered a deep sense of community among its participants.
The funds

raised have empowered students, supported educational advancement, and

reinforced the values of generosity and service that Bobby has

championed throughout his life.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional

District, I want to extend my gratitude to Bobby Stephen for his

exceptional commitment to our community.
We thank Bobby for his

tireless efforts and for creating a tradition that has touched so many

lives.
As this event comes to a close, its legacy will continue to

inspire us all to join together in support of our youth and the future

of our community.

CELEBRATING JAMES T. SANDORO'S 80TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate James T. Sandoro

on his 80th birthday.
A respected historian, vehicle appraiser, and

proud Buffalo booster, Mr. Sandoro has made an indelible impact on the

Buffalo community.
Born on September 9, 1944, Mr. Sandoro is a lifelong Buffalonian.
He

attended St. Joseph's Grammar School and graduated from Bennett High

School in 1962.
He continued his education at the University at

Buffalo, where he studied business education and graduated in 1971.
In 1962, Mr. Sandoro became the proprietor of Buffalo Motor Car, a

licensed New York State Auto dealer.
Mr. Sandoro collects, restores,

and deals automobiles, motorcycles, and collector vehicles.
He has

appraised thousands of vehicles for community members, museums, and

collectors from around the world, earning numerous national awards for

his vehicle frames.
Further, in 1997, Mr. Sandoro and his wife, Mary Ann, founded their

nonprofit organization The Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum.
The museum opened in 2001 and is located on 263 Michigan Avenue in

downtown Buffalo.
Mr. and Mrs. Sandoro have donated their extensive

vehicle collection, curated over five decades, to the museum.
The

Sandoro collection, which includes many automobiles that were once

produced in Buffalo, is regarded as one of the most unique collections

in the world.
The Pierce-Arrow Museum is also home to the 1927 Buffalo Filling

Station, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
The station, which was

intended to be developed in Buffalo but never came to fruition, was

built as an extension to the museum in 2024.
Throughout his career, Mr. Sandoro has been honored by numerous

national publications for his work in car collecting.
