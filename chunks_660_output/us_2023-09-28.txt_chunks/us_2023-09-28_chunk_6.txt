Formerly the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the 988 Lifeline has helped connect millions of individuals across the country with support and resources in their darkest hours.
Since its transition to the 988-dialing code from the longer, 10-digit hotline in July of 2022, the Lifeline has received almost 5 million contacts (through calls, chats, and texts).
Vibrant Emotional Health, the administrator of the Lifeline, estimates that this number could reach 9 million in the next fiscal year (FY24).
We must ensure that anyone in crisis--regardless of the time of day, or where they are--has someone to talk to, someone to respond, and a safe place to go.
Continued federal investment is critical for the 988 Lifeline to sustain the crisis care continuum and build out the call centers, as well as mobile crisis response teams and crisis stabilization facilities.
Suicide does not discriminate and impacts all communities, with some populations being at increased risk.
For example, between 2018 and 2021, increases in age-adjusted suicide rates were highest amongst Native Americans (26 percent), with Blacks (19.2 percent) and Hispanics (6.8 percent) also experiences significant increases.
Other disproportionately impacted populations include Veterans, people living in rural areas, LGBTQ people, middle-aged and older adults, tribal populations, and youth.
Vibrant estimates that about 80 percent of chat and text contacts are initiated by youth and young adults.
We must meet children and adolescents where they are and ensure that chat and text capacity is strong enough to meet this great demand.
To address mental health challenges among our youth, I will be reintroducing the Peer-to-Peer Suicide Prevention Act, which would help young people support their mental health byestablishing a competitive grant program for middle and high-schools to facilitate student-led suicide prevention programs.
A study from Pew Charitable Trusts earlier this year revealed that only about 13 percent of adults in the US are aware of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
The 988 Lifeline represents a chance to change how

our country supports those in crisis; it cannot reach its potential if most people are unaware of its existence, and of its numerous resources and supports it can offer them when they need them most.
A coordinated, national suicide prevention public awareness campaign is necessary to educate people across the country of what 988 has to offer.
That's why I will be reintroducing the Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act to support culturally competent advertisements across the lifespan.
Suicide prevention has long been an important issue to me.
I encourage all of my colleagues to join me this month in raising awareness and supporting legislation that promotes mental health and suicide prevention to help save lives.
TRIBUTE TO REP.

DAVID MACK III ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a passionate civil rights advocate, trusted community voice, and humble public servant.
South Carolina State Representative David James Mack III transitioned from this life on September 20, 2023, in Charleston, South Carolina.
He will be well remembered and sorely missed.
David Mack III was born on December 13, 1953, in Charleston, South Carolina to David J. Mack, Jr. and Dorothy Mack.
Representative Mack attended Charleston public schools and pursued higher education at Howard University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975.
There he joined Omega Psi Phi, my own fraternity, which he credited with having played a pivotal role in shaping his values and his work throughout his life.
He embodied the cardinal principles he learned as a proud member of our Omega brotherhood: Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift.
The value of community service was instilled in Representative Mack early in his life.
