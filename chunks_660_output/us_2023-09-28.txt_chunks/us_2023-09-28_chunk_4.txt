HASC HEARING ON EXAMINING IRREGULARITY IN THE STRATEGIC BASING PROCESS FOR U.S. SPACE COMMAND; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
158



Date: 2023-09-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 158 Pages: E906 - E906 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HASC HEARING ON EXAMINING IRREGULARITY IN THE STRATEGIC BASING PROCESS FOR U.S. SPACE COMMAND ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, America is grateful for the leadership of Chairman Mike Rogers of Alabama for his vision and persistence to support the creation of U.S. Space Command along with President Donald Trump.
This recognizes the threats of dictators, war criminal Putin and the CCP who have developed capabilities in space to threaten American families--we can achieve peace through strength.
It is sad when political interference controls basing, not first the priority of national security.
In South Carolina, we experienced this as the Charleston Naval Base was re-located to New Hampshire.
The obvious advantages of Charleston with a temperate climate of unlimited operations was ignored as the then Senate Majority Leader was from Maine with his constituents commuting to New Hampshire.
Congressman Austin Scott is correct.
Now Politics determines where the missions go.
This is a dangerous game, with national security to suffer. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I take this time to honor Ms. Beth Wrobel and wish her well upon her retirement as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HealthLinc.
For her lifelong commitment to providing quality health care to communities throughout the region, she is to be commended.
In 2002, Ms. Wrobel became CEO of HealthLinc.
At the time, HealthLinc was a single, free medical clinic serving the local community.
Under her direction, HealthLinc expanded its medical services to include pediatrics, women's health, and prenatal care, while also adding service lines including dental, optometry, behavioral health, substance abuse, podiatry, chiropractic, clinical pharmacy, health insurance enrollment, medical legal partnership, and more.
The organization continues to grow and is comprised of twelve clinics across Northern Indiana, as well as two school-based telehealth clinics, one mobile medical and dental clinic, and a team of more than 490 employees.
As CEO, Ms. Wrobel has worked tirelessly to ensure the accessibility of affordable, quality care to countless individuals and families who are underinsured, uninsured, or unable to pay.
For her outstanding dedication to the people of Northern Indiana, especially those most in need, Ms. Wrobel is worthy of the highest praise.
In addition to her noteworthy career, Ms. Wrobel has offered her time and support to numerous foundations and organizations throughout the years.
Among her many leadership roles, Ms. Wrobel has served on the board of directors for the National Association of Community Health Centers, and she currently serves as trustee for Ivy Tech Community College's Valparaiso Campus.
She is also a member of the board of directors for the Indiana Primary Healthcare Association.
Ms. Wrobel's dedication to serving the residents of Northern Indiana is exceeded only by her love and devotion to her three sons, Chris, Tom, and David, her daughter-in-law, Heather, and her cherished grandson, J.J. I wish her quality time with her family in the years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Ms. Beth Wrobel for her unwavering commitment to improving health care throughout Northern Indiana and beyond and in wishing her well upon her retirement.
For her many remarkable contributions, Ms. Wrobel is worthy of our deepest gratitude and appreciation. ____________________
