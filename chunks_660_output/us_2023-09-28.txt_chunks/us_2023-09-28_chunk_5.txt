RECOGNIZING SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-09-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 158 Pages: E908 - E908 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH ______ HON.
DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. BEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Suicide Prevention Month.
We know our country is in the midst of a severe mental health crisis, and people are struggling.
After declines in the suicide rate from 2019 to 2020, the rates increased almost percent in 2021.
Provisional data from the CDC shows that the rate is continuing to rise, up 2.6 percent from 2021 to 2022.
According to this data, which is not yet final, we lost about 49,450 people to suicide in 2022.
This is a dire situation, but we have tools to help save lives and the opportunity to transform how we as a nation respond to suicide, mental health, and substance use crises.
I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
Formerly the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, the 988 Lifeline has helped connect millions of individuals across the country with support and resources in their darkest hours.
Since its transition to the 988-dialing code from the longer, 10-digit hotline in July of 2022, the Lifeline has received almost 5 million contacts (through calls, chats, and texts).
Vibrant Emotional Health, the administrator of the Lifeline, estimates that this number could reach 9 million in the next fiscal year (FY24).
