DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-09-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 158 Pages: E907 - E908 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E907-E908] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2024 ______ speech of of texas in the house of representatives Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment No.
90 to H.R. 4365--the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2024.
I want to thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making this amendment in order.
The Jackson Lee Amendment No.
90 is an important and potentially life-saving amendment in an unfortunate and distracting appropriations bill.
Namely, the Jackson Lee Amendment No.
90 seeks to allocate $10 million to fund Triple Negative Breast Cancer Research (``TNBC'').
I must offer my appreciation to both the military and the Biden administration for making research into breast cancer a priority, but there is still work to be done.
Breast cancer accounts for 12.5 percent of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, making it the most common cancer in the world.
This issue is extremely important, especially for the brave men and women in the military, who are up to 20-40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer.
There are few people in this country whose lives have not been touched by breast cancer.
Yet, there are persistent disparities in breast cancer incidence and death rates: Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States for Black and Hispanic women.
Black women are more likely to die from breast cancer than women of any other racial or ethnic group.
Experts believe that it's partially because about 1 in 5 Black women is diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, more than any other racial or ethnic group.
Compared with non-Hispanic white women, Black women are less likely to receive guideline adherent care and have an approximate 2-fold higher mortality incidence, resulting in a disproportionately higher risk of death from Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
