HONORING RIVER ROCK OUTFITTER; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
185



Date: 2023-11-08 Volume: 169, Issue: 185 Pages: E1077 - E1077 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING RIVER ROCK OUTFITTER ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. SPANBERGER Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate April and Keith Peterson and the River Rock Outfitter team on their hard-earned nomination for the United States Chamber of Commerce's 2023 Top Small Business award.
Located in Downtown Fredericksburg, River Rock Outfitter provides apparel, gear, and guided outdoor experiences to customers while bringing awareness to local recreational opportunities in the region.
River Rock Outfitters is committed to supporting access to recreation and conservation efforts in the community and is widely known for its friendly and knowledgeable staff.
Notably, over 70 percent of its staff are women--actively challenging gender biases in the outdoor sector and creating an inviting environment for women to explore the outdoors through their programming, like their GirlsGO!
initiative.
In response to supply chain backlogs and an increased interest in the outdoors during the pandemic, April and her team implemented the ``Re- Boot with River Rock consignment program.''
This initiative expanded River Rock Outfitter's reach to a national level, encouraged people across the country to explore the outdoors, and promoted sustainability.
April's contributions as an owner extend past River Rock Outfitter's storefront--she has become a prominent fixture in the community as an active member of the Fredericksburg Virginia Main Street, serving as its president from 2020 to 2021.
She has also earned multiple accolades from organizations such as the Rotary Foundation, Chesapeake Conservancy, and Blue Ridge Outdoors, for her contributions to the community and philanthropy.
River Rock Outfitter has embraced community, inclusivity and representation, and sustainability throughout their journey.
These attributes distinguish them as an outstanding small business, and Fredericksburg is lucky to have them in our community.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating River Rock Outfitter, a finalist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's 2023 Top Small Business award. ____________________
