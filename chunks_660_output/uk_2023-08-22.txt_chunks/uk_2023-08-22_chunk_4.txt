RECOGNIZING THE 5th ANNIVERSARY OF PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP

ASSOCIATION

HON.
DANIEL S. GOLDMAN

Mr. GOLDMAN of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Parent

Child Relationship Association (PCR) on the occasion of its 5th

anniversary.
PCR is a volunteer run nonprofit organization that rose to

the challenge to provide essential services to some of the most

vulnerable residents of New York's Congressional District 10.
The South Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park and its neighboring

Dyker Height and Bensonhurst are home to New York's fastest growing

Chinese immigrant community.
The influx of the immigrant population

invigorated local cultural and economic life, and it also brought great

needs for social services.
Nicole Huang established PCR in 2018, after

having successfully organized local immigrant parents and youths to

volunteer for community improvement projects and to provide mutual

assistance.
In the 5 years since, PCR has expanded rapidly, becoming an essential

service provider for Chinese-speaking community members that are in

need of culturally competent services in Sunset Park.
Every year,

hundreds of volunteers contribute countless hours through PCR to

provide services that benefit many thousands that are in need.
