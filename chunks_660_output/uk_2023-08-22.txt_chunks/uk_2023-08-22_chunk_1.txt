CAUCUS MEMBERSHIP

HON.
BRAD SHERMAN

Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify that when I join a

Congressional Caucus, it does not necessarily mean that I agree with

every position of the Caucus.
At a minimum, my membership indicates

that I seek to learn more about related issues and legislative agendas,

and I look forward to a robust dialogue on topics under consideration

by the Caucus.
In particular, as mentioned by my colleague, Congressman

Brad Schneider, in his announcement of the Family Business Caucus,

membership in that Caucus is open to all Members of Congress seeking to

learn more about generationally owned family business issues.

CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MAROLYN OVERTON

HON.
EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER

Mr. CARTER of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the

achievements of Marolyn Overton, the outgoing chair of ``Ladies on the

Right.''
Marolyn has always been involved in her community and in politics.
She was once the President of the Skidaway Island Republican Club, and

she founded ``Ladies on the Right'' in 2020.
To quote their website, ``when most folks were thinking of retiring,

Marolyn started the Tea Party movement in Savannah.''
Since 2020, Ladies on the Right has been a home for conservative

values in Savannah, Georgia hosting monthly meetings and events about

the Constitution, the dangers of socialism, and many other topics.
Ladies on the Right does not just stop at meetings, either.
The group

works to develop solutions to issues facing our country while holding

politicians accountable.
Ms. Overton has created an impressive organization, and I commend her

lifelong commitment to fighting for what is right.

HONORING ENERGIZER'S 75th ANNIVERSARY IN ASHEBORO, NORTH CAROLINA

HON.
RICHARD HUDSON

Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate

Energizer Holdings on its 75th anniversary in Asheboro, North Carolina.
Energizer Holdings is a dynamic and diverse company, operating within

a wide range of industries and producing an equally wide range of

products and services.
Perhaps best known for Energizer batteries and

its bunny mascot, this company also runs Rayovac and Eveready, as well

as prominent auto care brands like Armor All and STP.
Energizer's

impact on our Nation's economy is tremendous, especially within my

community in North Carolina.
Energizer set up shop in Asheboro, North Carolina 75 years ago and

has since remained an economic staple of the community.
Energizer hosts

hundreds of high paying, local jobs and has brought in millions of

dollars in economic development into the region.
Yet, its impact is

soon to grow even more.
Last spring, Energizer announced a new

investment of $43 million into its Asheboro-based facilities that will

add 143 new jobs with wages far above the average for the county.
This

investment will greatly benefit both the city of Asheboro and our

region at-large.
Energizer is an esteemed member of our community down in North

Carolina.
Its economic and community impact is astounding, and I am

pleased that they have called Asheboro home for the last 75 years.
I

look forward to continuing to work with Energizer to see what they will

accomplish in the future.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Energizer, its

leaders, and employees on this momentous occasion and to thank them for

all they do for the community in Randolph County.
