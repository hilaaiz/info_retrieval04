HONORING HOMETOWN HERO COLLEYVILLE HERITAGE HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Colleyville Heritage

High School's Softball Team, who recently won the 2023 UIL Class 5A

Region I championship.
This is the first time in the school history

that the softball team advanced to the UIL 5A State Tournament.
On

Saturday, May 27, 2023, head coach Allison Conaway led this group of

talented young women to victory.
In the regional finals they beat

Northwest High School, in the third game of the round with a final

score of 1 to 0.
This team has shown hard work and dedication all

season and this was a well-deserved victory.
I commend this group of

young women on their UIL Regional championship victory and representing

the 24th Congressional District of Texas.

HONORING HOMETOWN HERO KANDI STEWART

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kandi Stewart,

co-owner of Courage to Conquer Cancer (C2CC).
C2CC is devoted to

promoting research, advocating for patients, and ensuring cost-

efficient resources and systems that will enhance post-surgical

management outcomes for dialysis, cardiac surgery, cancer, and other

patients.
Kandi is a HEBISD teacher and was diagnosed with breast

cancer in the fall of 2014.
After her diagnosis and treatment, she had

the inclination to help other cancer patients surmount the financial

and physical costs.
C2CC's first initiative was the Breast Cancer

Recovery Tee Shirt, which is designed with fashion, affordability, and

functionality in mind.
The nonprofit arm of C2CC works to donate free

recovery kits to mastectomy patients facing financial hardship through

post-surgical care.
Kandi is undergoing cancer treatment for the second

time after being in remission for years.
I want to thank Kandi for

being a beacon of selflessness and strength within our community.

HONORING HOMETOWN HERO LISA GOODWIN

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lisa Goodwin, a

shepherd of altruism in North Texas.
Lisa routinely goes the extra mile

to give back to our North Texas community through her charitable

conduct and volunteerism.
Lisa has earned a well-deserved reputation

for going above and beyond to help others, including using her own

resources to purchase childcare products for families in need.
In her

free time, Lisa visits nursing home residents and refugees in the Fort

Worth area to offer them companionship.
When Lisa is not volunteering

her time at church, she can be found helping teens register for

volunteer hours.
I want to thank Lisa for being a shining beacon of light in our

community.
