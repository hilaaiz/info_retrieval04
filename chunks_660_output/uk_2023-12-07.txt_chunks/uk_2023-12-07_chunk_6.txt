HON.
RICK LARSEN

Mr. LARSEN of Washington.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Chief

Master Sergeant Chloe Rainey-Fluellen, United States Air Force, and her

work as the Department of Defense (DoD) legislative fellow detailed to

my office for 2023.
In 2022, Chief Master Sergeant Rainey-Fluellen was selected to

represent the Air Force as a DoD legislative fellow.
The DoD legislative fellowship program provides superior

servicemembers with valuable legislative experience and an

understanding of how congressional actions affect DoD's budget, roles

and missions, force structure, military projects, and quality of life.
Over the past year, Chief Master Sergeant Rainey-Fluellen has been

essential to my office and the defense portfolio.
She has crafted and

coordinated National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) amendments in

line with my priorities and the needs of Northwest Washington

communities.

policymaking, the NDAA and appropriation processes to several military
