HON.
RICHARD HUDSON

Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate

Mr. Jack Nance, Executive Director of the Carolinas Golf Association

(CGA) after 32 years of dedicated service in this role.
Jack is a proud North Carolina native, he was born and raised in

Clinton, North Carolina and attended high school and college in our

great state.
Jack is an avid golfer and has been a huge fan of the

sport ever since his college days where he played golf at Wake Forrest

and even served as the assistant coach for the golf team following his

graduation.
Throughout his tenure at the CGA, Jack has seen the organization grow

to over 700 affiliated clubs that represent over 200,000 members.
We

will always appreciate the dedication Jack has shown to ensuring that

golfers in the Carolinas have a great sporting experience and North

Carolina maintains its reputation of the best state for golf.
Jack has worked for the CGA since 1984 and has served as a rules

official, communications point of contact and a course rater, before

finally serving as Executive Director, a position he has held since

1992.
Jack even qualified for the 1980 US Amateur as a player.
Nobody

knows our courses quite like Jack and we will certainly miss his unique

perspective.
We know Jack is looking forward to being able to spend more time with

his wife DeAnn and his two daughters Caroline and Liza.
While we are

sad to see Jack go, we wish him and his family the best as he begins

this new and exciting chapter in his life.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Mr. Jack Nance on

his well-earned retirement after 32 years of serving as the Executive

Director for the CGA.
