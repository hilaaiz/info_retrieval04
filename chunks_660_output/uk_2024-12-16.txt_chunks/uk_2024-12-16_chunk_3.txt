RECOGNIZING MATTHEW GLEASON--EAGLE SCOUT

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I have the privilege of

recognizing and celebrating Matthew Gleason for achieving the great

rank of Eagle Scout after 13 years of steadfast commitment to the Scout

Oath and Law.
Matthew's scouting career began as a Cub Scout in the

fall of 2011, where he rapidly ascended to leadership roles, including

Assistant Patrol Leader and Patrol Leader.
Early on, he earned the

prestigious Arrow of Light award, a testament to his dedication and

hard work.
Matthew's commitment to community service has been nothing

short of exemplary.
He logged nearly 200 hours helping neighbors,

friends, and strangers alike, demonstrating an inspiring dedication to

those around him.
In addition to his service, he has shown impressive

physical fitness by completing a challenging 33-mile hike through

rigorous terrain, successfully reaching every mission-required

destination.
For his Eagle Scout project, he dedicated over 160 hours

to the Aura Volunteer Fire Company, where he built a shed for their

antique fire truck, preserving

and honoring the department's rich history.
Beyond his scouting

achievements, Matthew is a remarkable student.
He has consistently made

the honor roll ten times and has been recognized on the

Superintendent's List five times.
As a standout soccer player, he has

lettered three times at Delsea Regional High School and has earned a

spot on the All-County team for all three years.
Looking ahead, Matthew

has clear and ambitious goals: he plans to pursue a degree in Civil

Engineering and eventually establish his own engineering firm.
In a

beautiful full circle moment, inspired by the tremendous support he

received from firefighters during his project, Matthew is determined to

serve his community as a volunteer firefighter.
I am confident that

Matthew will excel in any path he chooses, and I eagerly anticipate the

significant impact he will make in our world.
May God bless Matthew and

God bless our United States of America.
