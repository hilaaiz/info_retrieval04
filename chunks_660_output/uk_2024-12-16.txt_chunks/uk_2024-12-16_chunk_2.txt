Mr. Speaker, I along with the people of St. Louis, rise

today to honor the extraordinary life of Esther Jean Hill Haywood, a

trailblazer, educator, public servant, and unwavering advocate for

civil rights and social justice.
Born in Memphis, Tennessee on January

15, 1940, Esther's early commitment to service shaped a lifetime of

transformational contributions to her community and our nation.
She

dedicated herself to fostering equity in education, leading initiatives

for underserved youth, and tirelessly advocating for social

progress.
Esther Haywood's life exemplifies the power of purpose,

passion, and perseverance.
As an educator, Esther broke barriers in the Shelby County Public

School System, becoming one of the first African-American teachers to

integrate its classrooms in 1967.
Her pioneering efforts set the stage

for generations of students and educators who followed.
Her passion for

educational equity continued in East St. Louis, Illinois, where she

dedicated over 27 years to uplifting young minds as a math specialist,

an organizer of student trips to Washington, D.C., and a mentor to

countless youth.
Beyond education, Esther's service extended to leadership in civic

and community organizations.
As President of the St. Louis County

Branch of the NAACP, she reactivated and expanded its influence,

earning national acclaim.
Her tenure as a Missouri State Representative

demonstrated her commitment to justice and equity through legislation

combating hate crimes, advocating for educational funding, and

commemorating the contributions of civil rights icons.
Esther's

advocacy reached global audiences through her role as an Ambassador for

Peace, reflecting her belief in the universal power of community and

unity.
Esther Haywood's legacy is a testament to her boundless love for her

family and community.
Her devotion to her husband, Edward, their two

daughters, and her grandchildren, exemplified the values of family,

mentorship, and enduring strength.
Her unparalleled contributions,

whether in education, public service, or civil rights, will forever

inspire those who follow in her footsteps.
On behalf of Missouri's

First Congressional District, I am honored to celebrate the life of a

truly remarkable woman who embodied the spirit of service and uplifted

everyone around her.
