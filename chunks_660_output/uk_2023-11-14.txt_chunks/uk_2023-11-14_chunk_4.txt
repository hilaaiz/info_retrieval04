I was proud

to serve alongside him on the Commission, as did my father.
Fernandina is proud of Ron Sapp not only because of his dedication to

his community, but also for his military service as an Air Force

veteran.
But no true biography of Ron would be complete without a

chapter on Mr. Sapp--the teacher.
Mr. Sapp didn't just teach students

what to think, he taught them how to think, and that is something

special.
Generations of Pirates developed an in interest in--and love

for--public service--and for that inspiration, we are grateful.
Mayor Ron Sapp sought to preserve the spirit of Fernandina Beach as a

small island town and is a better place because of his accomplishments.
Ron, of course, has done all these things with his wife Kasey by his

side, and with the support of his daughters Sherri and Lori, and the

love of his grandchildren.
On November 14, one of Mayor Sapp's greatest achievements is being

named after him: The Ron Sapp Egans Creek Greenway.
Mayor Sapp's

introduction of the Open Space Bond issue secured the funding for this

greenway, which will leave this land untouched by development to be

enjoyed by all.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mayor Ron Sapp

for his significant role in shaping Fernandina Beach into the beautiful

town it is today.
