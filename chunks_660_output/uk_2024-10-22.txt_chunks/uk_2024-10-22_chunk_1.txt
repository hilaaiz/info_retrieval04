CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM ``BILL'' TEAGUE

HON.
RAUL RUIZ

Mr. RUIZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a

remarkable individual whose dedication and service to our communities

has spanned nearly seven decades--Mr. William ``Bill'' Teague.
As he

embarks on his well-deserved retirement, I want to express my deepest

gratitude for his unwavering commitment to the residents of Indio,

California and the Coachella Valley.
Bill's journey with the Valley Sanitary District began in 1951 when

he was hired as a Plant Operator.
Over the next 34 years, he rose

through the ranks to become the General Manager, a position he held for

28 years.
His leadership not only enhanced our wastewater management

but also set a standard for excellence that continues to benefit our

community today.
Bill retired as an employee of Valley Sanitary District in 1985, but

his passion soon brought him back.
In 1991, Bill was elected to the

Valley Sanitary District Board of Directors, where he has served

tirelessly for over 33 years, including two decades as President from

1992-2011.
His contributions have been invaluable, ensuring that our

local water resources are managed with care and innovation.
Bill also

served on the East Valley Reclamation Authority, taking on various

leadership roles, including President and Treasurer, further

demonstrating his commitment to environmental stewardship.
Throughout his career, Bill has received numerous accolades,

including the prestigious Wm.
D. Hatfield Award and recognition from

both the Santa Ana Basin and Colorado River Basin for his significant

contributions to the wastewater industry.
His work with the California

Water Pollution Control Agency and other organizations underscores his

passion for public service and community improvement.
Beyond his professional accomplishments, Bill has actively engaged

with various community organizations, from the Indio Chamber of

Commerce to the Coachella Valley Boys Club, always seeking to uplift

those around him.
His service on multiple committees and boards

reflects his dedication to fostering a better community for all.
As Bill retires from the Board of Directors in December 2024, we

celebrate not only his professional achievements but also the lasting

impact he has made on the lives of countless individuals in our

communities.
Mr. Speaker, let us all join in recognizing Bill Teague's outstanding

contributions to our community and extend our heartfelt gratitude for

his years of dedicated service.
On behalf of California's 25th

Congressional District, we wish him all the best in his retirement,

knowing that he leaves behind a foundation of excellence that will

inspire future leaders.

HONORING PAUL CARVER

HON.
DEBBIE LESKO

Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Arizona's 8th Congressional

District, it is my honor to recognize Paul Carver, the Chairman of

Republican Legislative District 2, which is in the north central area

of Phoenix and has a population of over 246,000.
As chairman, Paul has worked tirelessly to educate, train, and

inspire the next generation of citizens through civic engagement.
His

efforts to ensure Republicans are elected in Maricopa County have been

instrumental to the success of Legislative District 2 and beyond.
I am thankful for Paul's leadership and dedication to conservative

principles.
I sincerely appreciate his service to the legislative

district and to the state of Arizona.
