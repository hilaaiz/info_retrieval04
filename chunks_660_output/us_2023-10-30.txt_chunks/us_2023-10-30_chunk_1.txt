In 1993, Craig and his wife, Julie, founded the FARMS Program giving high school students access to applied scientific research and careers in agriculture, conservation, and sustainability.
The FARMS Program grew to become a model practice for youth education throughout the nation and led to the establishment of the Center for Land-Based Learning in 2001.
Since its founding, the Center for Land-Based Learning has educated more than 25,000 students from 30 different California counties.
The Center for Land-Based Learning is the only organization of its kind in the state to offer a closed loop of agriculture-based education, internships, and careers.
Because of the program high school students and adults have had the opportunity to discover impactful careers in fields ranging from biological sciences and technology-aided farming to land-use management and robotics.
As an American farmer and activist, Mr. McNamara was revolutionary in the field of sustainable, climate-smart agricultural practices.
He endured years of skepticism from those steeped in antiquated beliefs, but that did not slow down his work.
Today, modern environmental science and economics embrace Mr. McNamara's teaching which emphasizes that ``people, profit, and planet'' all deserve equal attention and dedication.
Throughout his professional career, Mr. McNamara has served as a board member for the American Farmland Trust; the Roots of Change Stewardship Council; University of California, Davis Dean's Advisory Council and Agricultural Sustainability Institute Advisory Board; and the Public Policy Institute of California Advisory Board, He is currently a board member on the Edible Schoolyard Project and Project REGEN.
He is also on the leadership council of the Public Policy Institute of California.
Mr. Speaker, Craig McNamara is a dedicated public servant and leader in our community.
He has inspired and educated future generations of farmers and agricultural leaders.
It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor him and the work of the FARMS Program here today. ____________________
