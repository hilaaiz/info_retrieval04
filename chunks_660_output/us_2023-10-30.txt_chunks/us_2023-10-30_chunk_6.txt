must be a part of future bipartisan retirement saving packages.
I am hopeful my colleagues will cosponsor the Lifetime Income for Employees Act and help us to enact it into law.
In addition to expanding access to lifetime income Congress must do more to help all Americans achieve a financially secure retirement.
More than 55 million Americans do not have access to an employer sponsored retirement plan, including 78 percent of workers at arms with fewer than 10 employees.
Congress should continue to work to help them get access to savings plans as this is the first step to helping them achieve financial security in retirement.
Let's not wait until next year's National Retirement Security Month to advance proposals that will strengthen our nation's private retirement system.
Bipartisanship has been and will continue to be the key to advancing the next retirement security package.
We can and should act now to help all our constituents get on a clearer path to a more secure retirement. ____________________
