INTRODUCTION OF THE RESTROOM ACCESS ACT OF 2023; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-10 Volume: 169, Issue: 117 Pages: E641 - E641 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE RESTROOM ACCESS ACT OF 2023 ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Restroom Access Act of 2023, which would require retail establishments to provide individuals with medical conditions requiring immediate use of a restroom, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, access to employee-only restrooms when such establishments do not have public restrooms.
Individuals would have to present a Department of Labor- issued identification card certifying such a medical condition.
Individuals with certain medical conditions need immediate access to a restroom.
When public restrooms are not available, these individuals may experience uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
As long as there are no safety concerns, which this bill addresses, these individuals should be able to use employee-only restrooms.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
RECOGNIZING KEVIN KLINKENBERG FOR OVER TWO YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE NEW DEMOCRAT COALITION; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-10 Volume: 169, Issue: 117 Pages: E642 - E643 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E642-E643] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING KEVIN KLINKENBERG FOR OVER TWO YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE NEW DEMOCRAT COALITION ______ of new hampshire in the house of representatives Ms. KUSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the service of one of the New Democrat Coalition's most exceptional staffers, Kevin Klinkenberg.
Kevin recently left the Coalition to begin his tenure as a Senior Advisor and Congressional Liaison at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
I can truly say that HHS and all Americans are lucky to have him in this role.
In his 2 years with the Coalition, including my tenure as Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Kevin proved himself to be an invaluable asset who shaped our policy work and outreach efforts.
From health care and trade to immigration, Kevin's work was exemplary.
We would not have been able to accomplish all that we have without Kevin's presence on our team.
Kevin also led the New Dems' outreach work, forming critical relationships with important stakeholder groups, from labor to the business community.
His commitment to expanding the reach of the New Dems has positively impacted each of our nearly 100 members, including me, and his work will continue to benefit the Coalition long after his departure.
Kevin has not only contributed to the Coalition through his superb work but also through his kind and collaborative spirit which is known to all those who had the privilege of working with him.
Although we are sad to see him go, we know that Kevin will excel in his new role, and I wish him the very best in all his future endeavors. ____________________
