Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the Emergence Health Network Veterans One Stop Center for their continuous innovation to expand mental and behavioral health services to El Paso veterans and active-duty military and their families.
Emergence Health Network (EHN), the local mental health authority in El Paso, has a dedicated facility focusing on behavioral needs and services.
The Veterans One Stop Center (VOSC) in Northeast El Paso provides behavioral health services and additional support to veterans, active-duty military, and their families.
Recovery-oriented care is offered to meet the needs of veterans, thus promoting hope and encouragement.
EHN's partnership with Fort Bliss has proved to be a tremendous benefit as an additional resource and support system for these individuals to solve the wait and intervention times for care.
EHN's Veteran's One Stop Center has the capability and resources to expedite these services to a much-needed population and can provide care to service members anywhere from two to five days of initial contact.
Today, it is my privilege to honor Emergence Health Network's Veterans One Stop Center for the grand opening of their new facility in East El Paso and thank them for their ongoing efforts to help our veterans, active-duty military, and their families. ____________________
HONORING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF WJHL-TV; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-11-07 Volume: 169, Issue: 184 Pages: E1071 - E1071 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF WJHL-TV ______ of tennessee in the house of representatives Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and acknowledge a cornerstone of our community and a leading source of news and information in Northeast Tennessee and surrounding regions, WJHL- TV.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of WJHL's dedication to broadcasting excellence.
On October 26, 1953.
WJHL made its debut, serving as the first voice of television in Northeast Tennessee and the second station to sign on in our great state.
It was the vision and determination of founders Hanes Lancaster, Jr., Hanes Lancaster, Sr.,
and Jay Birdwell that brought this dream to fruition.
Nestled in the heart of downtown Johnson City, WJHL has since been a familiar presence, illuminating our homes with news, information, and entertainment each day.
Over the decades, WJHL has been dedicated to informing, educating, and entertaining over 300,000 households, spanning not just our Tennessee counties of Washington, Sullivan, Carter, Greene, Unicoi, Johnson, and Hawkins, but also extending its reach to into Virginia and Kentucky.
The expansive reach of WJHL's signal is a testament to its leadership and trust within the region.
Under the leadership of General Manager Paula Jackson, the station has maintained its commitment to broadcasting excellence.
Paula and her team of over 80 employees--writers, producers, reporters, technicians, and staff members--all play a crucial role in ensuring that our region stays connected and informed.
Their commitment to integrity, fairness, and community service is more than admirable.
For seven decades, the dedicated staff of WJHL has been firm in their mission to report accurate local news that is vital to our region.
Their creed is simple: news that matters to you and your family.
Throughout its history, WJHL has seen numerous milestones.
For many decades, they have proudly operated as a CBS affiliate.
And in February 2016, they expanded their broadcasting network, adding ABC to their second channel, further adding to the content available to their viewers.
However, it wasn't just in content where WJHL sought change.
