For many decades, they have proudly operated as a CBS affiliate.
And in February 2016, they expanded their broadcasting network, adding ABC to their second channel, further adding to the content available to their viewers.
However, it wasn't just in content where WJHL sought change.
In the Fall of 2019, the station embarked on a new chapter, unveiling a state-of-the-art studio, certainly fitting for a station of its legacy.
As part of the Nexstar Media Group, WJHL, which encompasses News Channel 11 and ABC Tri-Cities, is poised for continued growth and success.
As they celebrate their 70th anniversary this year, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Paula and the entire WJHL team on 70 years of broadcast excellence.
May they continue to shine brightly, informing and uniting our communities for many more years to come. ____________________
