HONORING CLAY FIRE TERRITORY CHIEF TIMM SCHABBEL'S CAREER IN SERVANT

LEADERSHIP

HON.
RUDY YAKYM III

Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate

Chief Timm Schabbel, who recently retired as Fire Chief of the Clay

Fire Territory in South Bend, Indiana, after 35 impressive years with

the department.
During his nearly four decades in public safety, Timm has served in

different roles within the fire department, including as a firefighter,

Engineer, Lieutenant, Chief of Operations, and Fire Chief.
Timm was

promoted to Fire Chief in 1997, making him the longest tenured chief

officer in the agency's 75-year history.
Under Chief Schabbel's leadership, Clay Fire became the first

internationally accredited fire department in Indiana.
In addition,

Clay Fire also expanded under Chief Schabbel's tenure, essentially

tripling the area the department covers.
These achievements were only

possible thanks to Timm's vision and determination.

========================= END NOTE =========================

The many awards and accolades he has received over the years--

including Firefighter of the Year from Clay Township, Fire Chief of the

Year from the state of Indiana, the President's Award from the

International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the Sagamore of the

Wabash award--are all a testament to Timm's commitment to excellence

and an accomplished career spent in the service to others.
The broader South Bend community and St. Joseph County are

unquestionably better off and safer thanks to this good man who

exemplifies what it means to be a leader and a true public servant.
Timm's example and leadership are also reminders that first

responders are on the frontlines of some of the most difficult

situations our communities face.
When there is a problem, first

responders like Timm answer the call and willingly put themselves in

harm's way to keep us safe, and for that all of us are extremely

grateful.
I am proud to join so many Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second

District in expressing our appreciation to Chief Schabbel for his

service and in wishing him and his family all the best going forward

during Timm's very well-deserved retirement.
I thank Timm.

HONORING FRANCIS `FRANK' HUMMEL, JR.
HON.
ANDY KIM

Mr. KIM of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

selfless service and incredible accomplishments of Francis `Frank'

Hummel, Jr., a United States Army Veteran, who passed earlier this

month.
Born and raised in Philadelphia, Frank spent his adult life in

southern New Jersey.
In December 1950, he joined the United States Army

where he completed his basic training on Joint Base McGuire-Dix-

Lakehurst, right in his own backyard.
Frank was then transferred to a

small town in Germany where he went through military intelligence

training and served in the Army Security Agency.
During this time,

Frank enjoyed boxing, playing center and linebacker for the Seventh

Army Special Troops Ramblers football team, and being a member of the

97th Signal Satans basketball team.
Today, we all remember him for his

brave service, and love for sports with his fellow soldiers.
After the Army, Frank opened his own mechanical engineering firm,

Hummel Engineering Corporation, which served New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

New York, and Delaware.
