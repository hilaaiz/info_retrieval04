HONORING BRIANA DANIEL AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA FOR

BLACK HISTORY MONTH

HON.
DARREN SOTO

Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, during a run in Orlando in 2013, Briana Daniel

encountered the stark reality of homelessness.
Motivated to help but

inexperienced in addressing this issue, she chose to immerse herself by

living among the Downtown Orlando homeless community for over a month.
Through firsthand experience and conversations with them, she

discovered their profound need for dignity through cleanliness.
This

insight led her to establish Street Team Movement Inc., an organization

dedicated to offering hygiene services to the homeless community.
``It's hard to have dignity or feel like you have value when you have

nowhere to wash and no way to clean your clothes or yourself,'' said

Daniel.
Street Team Movement Inc. provides laundry services to the unhoused

and hygiene items distributed through their hygiene vending machines.
The machines are accessible for free to the homeless through their

proprietary ``Hope Cards,'' which are special access cards allowing the

population a limited number of transactions per week.
``We believe in compassionate assistance, not just handouts.
The

`Hope Card' allows us to help without enabling dependency.
We provide

individuals the means to access items, and services while preventing

any misuse,'' said Daniel.
In 2021, Street Team Movement launched a special program specifically

for homeless women called Project Lioness.
The program aims to bridge

the hygiene gap for unhoused

women by connecting them to critical feminine hygiene kits that will

carry them through their monthly cycle.
To date, Project Lioness has

distributed over 1,000 hygiene kits stocked with panty liners, feminine

napkins, tampons, and wipes.
To date, Street Team Movement has washed

over 30,000 loads of laundry, provided over 500 haircuts, and has given

out over one million hygiene items.
Since launching the hygiene vending

machines in 2020, Street Team Movement has given out over 5,000 hygiene

kits in five States.
On February 22, 2024, Briana Daniel was honored as a distinguished

leader in Central Florida for Black History Month.
