As a sophomore at Southlake Carroll High

School, Caden has made waves in the cross-country world.
After winning

the Class 6A individual state title and leading the Dragons to the 6A

team championship, he went on to lift his team to a bronze medal at the

Nike Cross Nationals (NXN) final.
In qualifying for the NXN, he clocked

a personal best, walking away with bronze and First Team All-Region

recognition at Nike Cross Regionals South.
Not only is Caden an exceptional athlete, he's also a servant in the

community, volunteering with the Young Men's Service League, the local

branch of the Special Olympics, and serving in youth ministry at

White's Chapel Methodist Church.
Caden's dedication to academics,

athletics, and public service led Gatorade to name him as Texas' 2024

Boys Cross Country Player of the Year.
Congratulations to Caden on his incredible accomplishments and well-

deserved recognition.
I look forward to following his cross-country

career and cheering him on.
