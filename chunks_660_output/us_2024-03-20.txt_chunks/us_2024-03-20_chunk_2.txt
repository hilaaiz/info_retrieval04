He was a man of deep conviction who never faltered in his mission, no matter the cost.
He was one of the bravest, most principled men I have ever met, and his memory will never be forgotten.
The United States must continue Navalny's legacy and stand up against Putin's efforts to trample freedom in Europe and around the world.
May we never stop fighting to secure peace and democracy for all those who seek it, just as Navalny so courageously did. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 49 Pages: E268 - E269 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E268-E269] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE OF JOHN KELLEY ______ of connecticut in the house of representatives Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the distinguished career and public service of Police Chief John Kelley from the town of Vernon, Connecticut that is drawing to an honorable end on March 22, 2024.
Chief Kelley's devotion to duty in the U.S. Army Reserve and the Vernon Police Department focused on defending our nation and ensuring public safety has always been about caring for and serving others.
As a resident of Vernon for over forty years, I have had the privilege to personally witness the positive impact he has had on our town, which is deep and meaningful.
A Vernon native, Chief Kelly grew up in a family whose patriarch Robert Kelley served in town fire service for 42 years, 21 of which as Fire Chief.
I also knew Bob Kelley and worked with him on fire department issues during my time as town attorney and state representative.
Bob was a true gentleman who led his department by example, a trait that his son followed, with great success.
John Kelley attended Vernon schools and graduated from Rockville High School.
After high school, he then enrolled at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, where he studied Criminal Justice and Sociology, which obviously signaled the direction he would follow later in life.
After graduation his journey of public service began.
He enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserve, where he honorably served for 6 years.
Chief Kelley began his career in public safety when he was hired by his hometown police department on January 29, 1996.
His diligent work resulted in a cascade of training awards and frequent promotions.
He excelled in all aspects of his work.
