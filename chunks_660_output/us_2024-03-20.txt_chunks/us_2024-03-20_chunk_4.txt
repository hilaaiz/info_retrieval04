He is a reliable and amiable individual whose devotion to his community shines through in every aspect of his being.
One may hope that his humility and thoughtfulness are emulated by future generations of Americans.
As Chief Kelley caps off 28 years of consummate service to Vernon, we should acknowledge his wife, Kellie, and daughters Grace and Abby.
I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in commending and thanking John Kelley for his endless service to the United States. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mayor Olivia Trujillo, who passed away on March 3, 2024, surrounded by loved ones.
She was 67 years old.
Mayor Trujillo was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and at the age of five, her family immigrated to Arvin, California.
During her summers, she worked alongside her family harvesting fruits and vegetables in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley, learning the values of hard work and perseverance from a young age.
Mayor Trujillo attended Sierra Vista Elementary, Haven Drive Middle School, and Arvin High School, and was involved in numerous activities in the Arvin community during her childhood.
Mayor Trujillo dedicated her life to serving the Arvin community for more than 60 years.
She served as the Vice-President of the Arvin Chamber of Commerce from 2013 to 2018, Chair of the Arvin City Planning Commission from 2015 to 2018, and was a member of the Arvin City Council from 2016 to 2018.
In 2020, she was elected as the Mayor of the City of Arvin.
As the first woman, Latina, and immigrant in this position, her election represented a significant milestone in our community's history.
During her tenure, Mayor Trujillo was deeply committed to serving the community's most vulnerable, including the youth, senior, and homeless populations.
