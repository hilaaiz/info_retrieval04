ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Hampton High School Men's Basketball Team from Hampton, Virginia on becoming the Virginia High School League's Class 4 State Champions.
On Friday, March 8, 2024, the Hampton Crabbers won the championship game against the Tuscarora Huskies with a score of 66-63.
Led by Coach Eric Brown, the Crabbers won this title for the sixth time, the first since 2012.
Hampton High School closed their season with a record of 26 wins and 2 losses, maintaining a 16-game winning streak.
Throughout the game, the Crabbers and Huskies fought for control of the court, with the Crabbers maintaining the lead.
But victory for the Crabbers would not come easily, as the Huskies consistently chipped away at their lead.
With 20 seconds left on the clock, senior Daron Baugh sank two free-throws to give the Crabbers the final 66-63 lead.
The Crabbers fought hard and stayed determined until the game was over, and because of that, they were able to secure the championship.
Mr. Speaker, I want to again congratulate the Hampton High School Basketball Team and thank Coach Brown, the parents, and the entire Hampton High School community for supporting these students throughout the season.
They have all made their community proud.
I wish them the best in their future endeavors, and I wish the program continued success. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ALEXEI NAVALNY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 49 Pages: E269 - E269 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ALEXEI NAVALNY ______ of north carolina in the house of representatives Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Alexei Navalny, who made the ultimate sacrifice in his fight for freedom, democracy, and basic human rights.
For more than a decade, Navalny courageously led the unflinching opposition against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his evil cronies.
Determined to create a truly democratic Russia, Navalny exposed Putin for who he truly is: a murderous, corrupt dictator.
In August of 2020, officers of the Russian government attempted to kill Navalny by poison, forcing him to be evacuated and hospitalized in Germany.
Despite this attempt on his life, Navalny never wavered and, after miraculously recovering from this attempted murder, insisted on returning to Russia to continue his mission of bringing freedom to his countrymen.
Upon his return home, Navalny was wrongfully imprisoned by Russian authorities for the remainder of his life and, tragically, to his death.
His only crime was his determination to speak out in the face of oppression and advocate for a Russia free from Putin's control.
Throughout his imprisonment, Navalny never lost his sense of optimism and hope for the future.
He remained positive, even telling jokes in court less than 24 hours before his death.
While in prison in the Arctic Circle, Navalny continued being a strong voice for freedom, relying on his family, lawyers, and other supporters to speak out on his behalf and stand defiant against Putin's evil regime.
He was a man of deep conviction who never faltered in his mission, no matter the cost.
He was one of the bravest, most principled men I have ever met, and his memory will never be forgotten.
The United States must continue Navalny's legacy and stand up against Putin's efforts to trample freedom in Europe and around the world.
