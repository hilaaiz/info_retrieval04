OCEANVIEW FIRE DEPARTMENT'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this past September, I had the honor of

commemorating the historic 100th Anniversary of the Oceanville

Volunteer Fire Company, a milestone that marks decades of exceptional

service to our community.
Oceanville Fire is the oldest fire department

in Galloway Township, established in 1924 by local community members.
These visionary individuals, primarily farmers and shell-fishermen,

recognized the urgent need for fire protection and rescue services.
Their selfless dedication set the foundation for the department we know

today.
The department, now consisting of 39 men and women, continues to

serve the township with unwavering commitment.
Their dedication as

extraordinarily well-trained firefighters echoes the spirit of the

founding members many years ago, providing a sense of security to the

township.
Through the years, Oceanville Fire has proven to be a vital

part of the community and has played a crucial role in making its

residents feel safe.
I am deeply grateful to the Oceanville Volunteer

Fire Company for their century of great service and may they continue

to protect and serve for many more.
God bless Oceanville Fire

Department, and God bless our United States of America.

the University of Texas in August 1967, followed by a Doctor of

Jurisprudence from the University of Texas School of Law in January

He served on the District Court for the Northern District of

of the City of Brownwood from 1984 to May 2010, while practicing law as

a partner for Massey & West.

Mayor Massey's dedication to the Brownwood area and love for his
