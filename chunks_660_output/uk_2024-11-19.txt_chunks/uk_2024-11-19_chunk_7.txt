SUPPORTING H.R. 8371, ELIZABETH DOLE 21ST CENTURY VETERANS HEALTHCARE

AND BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT

HON.
GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, every day, we lose an average of 17

veterans to suicide.
This statistic is not just a number; it represents

real lives, families, and communities torn apart by tragedy.
Behind

each of these 17 daily losses is a story of service, sacrifice, and

struggle.
These are our neighbors, friends, and family members who have

worn the uniform with pride and honor.
They are mothers and fathers,

sons and daughters, whose absence leaves an irreplaceable void in

countless lives.
The ripple effect of each suicide extends far beyond

the individual, impacting spouses, children, parents, friends, and

fellow veterans.
It creates a cycle of grief and trauma that can

persist for generations.
As members of Congress, it is our responsibility to address this

heartbreaking reality with the urgency and dedication it demands.
Answering the call of duty to our veterans, I was proud to work with

Senate Veterans Affair Committee Chairman Jon Tester to put forward

H.R. 4157, Not Just a Number Act, legislation included in this Veterans

omnibus package as Section 149 that would require the Department of

Veterans Affairs to expand its scope when studying veteran suicide

data.
Instead of focusing solely on VA health care utilization, this

bill mandates a more holistic approach, considering factors such as

education, job training, housing, and other relevant socioeconomic

factors.
By broadening our perspective, we aim to gain a more

comprehensive understanding of the complex, interconnected factors that

contribute to veteran suicide.
This approach will paint a more accurate

picture of the multifaceted challenges our veterans face, enabling us

to develop more effective support systems and interventions.
While the Not Just a Number Act is a crucial step forward, we must

recognize that addressing veteran suicide is an ongoing commitment.
This bill lays the foundation for a more comprehensive understanding,

but our work will not end with its passage.
We must be prepared to

adapt our strategies based on the insights gained and continuously

improve our support systems.
This is merely the beginning of a long-

term mission to safeguard the lives and well-being of our veterans.
We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that can never truly be

repaid.
It is our responsibility to ensure that they feel our

unwavering support and appreciation every single day.
Let us honor our

troops not just in words, but in our actions, by standing alongside

them and their families.
Together, let us ensure that they feel the

depth of our appreciation and support at every step of their journey.
I

urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical

legislation.
