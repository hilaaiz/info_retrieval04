Let us honor our

troops not just in words, but in our actions, by standing alongside

them and their families.
Together, let us ensure that they feel the

depth of our appreciation and support at every step of their journey.
I

urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this critical

legislation.
By passing the Not Just a Number Act as Section 149 of the

Elizabeth Dole 21st Century Veterans Healthcare and Benefits

Improvement Act, we demonstrate our commitment to those who have served

our nation and do everything in our power to prevent veteran suicide.
If you or a veteran you know is in crisis, please call the Veterans

Crisis Line at 988 and Press 1, or text 838255.
Help is available 24/7,

and you don't have to be enrolled in VA benefits or health care to

connect with caring, qualified responders.
