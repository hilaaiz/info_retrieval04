HONORING THE CAREER OF RICHARD BARON; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-03 Volume: 169, Issue: 182 Pages: E1051 - E1052 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1051-E1052] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE CAREER OF RICHARD BARON ______ of connecticut in the house of representatives Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate Richard Baron of Woodstock, Connecticut who retires from his work with the Woodstock Fire Marshal's office on November 30, 2023.
Richard's retirement concludes 50 years of exemplary service to the Town of Woodstock, the last 27 of which were as Fire Marshal.
His outstanding dedication to his community and expertise will be sorely missed.
From his earliest days in northeastern Connecticut, Richard was destined to be an exceptional member of the Woodstock community.
He attended the Woodstock Academy and Ellis Technical School in Woodstock and Danielson respectively and was drawn to helping others by following a special calling to the challenging work of public safety.
At a very young age, Richard began his journey at the Muddy Brook Fire Department as a volunteer, which gave him a chance to apply his technical knowledge and caring disposition to the tasks of a firefighter.
Richard's professional career has also been defined by his service to the community--in the halls of Connecticut's state government, where he worked with the Connecticut Department of Transportation for over 31 years.
His talented work and leadership skills were rewarded over the years with a series of promotions.
At the time of his retirement, he had risen to the position of Fleet Manager for the entire state of Connecticut, which is a huge responsibility, requiring tremendous logistical and organizational skills.
In November of 1973, when Richard joined the Muddy Brook Fire Department, one of three volunteer departments serving Woodstock and the surrounding community, he started on the training squad.
He has since remained a dutiful protector of his neighbors, serving 50 years in fire safety through many different capacities.
He has always been guided by a principle to contribute wherever he felt he was needed by the town.
Richard spent 45 of those years as an EMT.
Given his diligence, Richard was promoted several times within the Muddy Brook Fire Department.
His valuable contributions to the community were recognized and he achieved the rank of Captain by the early 1980s.
During his time as Captain, Richard committed himself to advancing fire safety in Woodstock and took on the role of Deputy Fire Marshal for the town in 1984.
In 1990, Richard was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Muddy Brook Fire Department.
Only two years later he was promoted again to Chief of the Department, a position he would hold until 1995.
It was not just his extensive experience and impressive ethic that prompted these promotions, but also his obvious leadership qualities.
