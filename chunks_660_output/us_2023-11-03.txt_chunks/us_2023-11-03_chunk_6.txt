Date: 2023-11-03 Volume: 169, Issue: 182 Pages: E1055 - E1056 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1055-E1056] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE FAIRFAX TREE COMMISSION'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the Fairfax County, Virginia Tree Commission.
The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors chartered the Tree Commission as a board of public members in August 1973, and in 1976 it was expanded and incorporated into the county code to advise the Board on implementing the newly enacted Tree Planting and Preservation Ordinance.
The Tree Commission's has operated for 50 years in service to the health and well-being of the county's urban forest, which in turn affects the health and well-being of all county residents.
In 2005, as then Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, I recognized that the county's population had grown exponentially and so had the stressors on our tree canopy.
I appeared before the Tree Commission and asked it to develop a Tree Action Plan the county could use to manage and enhance the county's forests and trees.
