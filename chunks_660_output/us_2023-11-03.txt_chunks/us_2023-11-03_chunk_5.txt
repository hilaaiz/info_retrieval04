RECOGNIZING PENELOPE GROSS ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-03 Volume: 169, Issue: 182 Pages: E1055 - E1055 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING PENELOPE GROSS ON THE OCCASION OF HER RETIREMENT ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Penelope ``Penny'' Gross on her retirement after 27 years of serving as the Fairfax County Mason District Supervisor and 21 years of chairing the Potomac Watershed Roundtable.
Elected in 1995 to represent the Mason District, Penny has been an advocate for affordable housing, expanded public transportation, and violence prevention.
Penny represents Fairfax County on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the Northern Virginia Regional Commission, the INOVA Health System Board of Trustees, and the Potomac Watershed Roundtable (PWR).
Shortly after becoming the chair of PWR, she encouraged the VA Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to help in developing strategies that will bring the state of Virginia up to the standard that Maryland had already set, regarding efforts that support the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Program.
With that, in July 2003, the Potomac River Tributary Strategy was developed by DCR.
In January 2004, Penny led the PWR in discussions for a 2004 vision, whose focal points influenced many water-related issues, such as Stormwater Management, Wastewater Treatment Plants, and Total Maximum Daily Load.
In April later that year, Penny was appointed by then Governor Mark Warner to the Chesapeake Bay Blue Ribbon Funding Panel.
A panel tasked with finding alternative sources for funding the Chesapeake Bay Cleanup.
By October 2004, Chairman Gross announced some recommendations on behalf of the Chesapeake Bay Blue Bay Ribbon Finance Panel.
On the state and national level, Penny is a past president of the Virginia Association of Counties, vice-chair of the National Association of Counties' Energy, Environment, and Land Use Committee, and past president of the National Association of Regional Councils.
She was first appointed by Governor Mark Warner to the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC) to the Chesapeake Executive Council, which she chaired from March 2006 until August 2008, and continues to serve.
I had the great pleasure of serving with Penny during my 14 years on the Board, first representing the Providence District and then as Chairman.
The work that she has done for Fairfax County is outstanding, and we will continue to honor her legacy as a public servant.
Penny Gross's commitment to our community and the mission of local government is unparalleled.
She leaves behind a legacy that will enrich our community for generations to come.
Her career in public service is truly commendable and deserving of our heartfelt gratitude.
All through her tenure as Chair of the PWR, she proved to be an exemplary leader, and continues to attract very influential and dedicated environmentally minded individuals to the roundtable.
