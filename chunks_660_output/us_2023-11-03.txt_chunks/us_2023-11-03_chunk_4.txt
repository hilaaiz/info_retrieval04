Santa Ana Kiwanians Doy Henley and Cliff Benson took a stand and advocated for the inclusion of women at the International Convention in 1979.
Since 2000, the club has focused on education and support for low- income families and those with special needs.
The Club has evolved with the needs of the community and has developed into a group of concerned, motivated men and women from diverse ethnic and vocational backgrounds.
While many similar organizations within the Kiwanis Community and other similar organizations have disbanded, the Kiwanis Club of Santa Ana is still doing significant work in our community.
I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating this wonderful milestone of a century of community service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of James ``Jim'' Theodore Herfurth, who passed away peacefully in his home on November 1, 2023, in Osage Beach, Missouri.
Jim was born on July 21, 1937, to parents Theodore and Mathilda Herfurth in Eldon, Missouri.
He attended Eldon High School where he played forward for the Mustangs Basketball team.
The team ultimately won the State Championship in 1954, and Jim graduated in 1955.
He continued his education at the University of Missouri, graduating in 1959 with a BS degree in banking and finance, and commissioning as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Artillery.
He was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where he served as a Finance Officer and as adjutant for the Target Artillery Department.
His passion for his country led him to extend his original tour for an additional year due to the Berlin Crises.
After leaving active duty, Jim began his finance career with IBM in Kansas City, Missouri.
In 1964, he began his 35-year banking career with Central Trust Bank in Jefferson City, Missouri while simultaneously joining the 420th Civil Affairs National Guard Reserve Unit.
During his career with the Central Bank organization, Jim rose through the operations and loans divisions, as well as the ranks of the Missouri National Guard, until Central Bancompany's acquisition of Bank of Lake of the Ozarks in 1987.
Jim was then named President and CEO of the newly named Central Bank of Lake of the Ozarks, and he earned his rank of Colonel in the Missouri National Guard.
Passionate about his community, Jim left a mark wherever he lived.
His commitment to his community was evidenced through his involvement in the new construction of roads and bridges, economic development through Central Bank, public schools, YMCA, hospitals, and the Dogwood Animal Shelter.
He had a strong sense of community and worked hard to make his home a better place for everyone.
Although a busy man, Jim still found time to enjoy his hobbies.
He loved to play golf, spending an equal amount of time playing as he did trying to convince his grandchildren to play.
When he wasn't golfing, Jim was snow skiing, visiting Palm Springs, or visiting he and his wife's friends in Tucson, Arizona.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife Marjorie M. Herfurth; his two children from his marriage in 1961 to Barbara A. Silvers: daughter, Kimberly Herfurth Ayscue of Franklinton, North Carolina; son, J. Matthew Herfurth and his wife Jeane Herfurth of Madison, Mississippi; his four grandchildren: Michael and Andrew Boyleir; daughter, Grace, of Monet, Missouri.
He was preceded in death by his sister, Barbara Herfurth Moffitt.
Jim's life was one of service, grace, and love for his family

and community.
He will be deeply missed by all whom he encountered.
