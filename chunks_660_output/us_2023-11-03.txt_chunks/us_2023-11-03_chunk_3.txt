In 1990, Richard was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Muddy Brook Fire Department.
Only two years later he was promoted again to Chief of the Department, a position he would hold until 1995.
It was not just his extensive experience and impressive ethic that prompted these promotions, but also his obvious leadership qualities.
Richard has always been willing to share his abundance of knowledge by mentoring and recruiting new members of the fire department.
Richard was appointed Fire Marshal by the Town of Woodstock in

1996, the position from which, after nearly another 30 years, he retires this month.
Richard has been essential in presenting fire safety and prevention techniques.
As Fire Marshal, he has been responsible for assisting all three Woodstock Fire Departments with fire suppression and hazardous materials activities.
Richard's impact has reached far beyond administering the basic duties of a Fire Marshal.
He has used his plentiful experience to create poster contests for children, scholarships, and more to help publicize and educate the public on Woodstock's fire safety activities.
During this time, Richard has also served as the Safety Officer for the Muddy Brook Fire Department, demonstrating how deeply he cares about protecting those within his community.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent such committed constituents like Richard Baron.
Richard is an institution unto himself whose retirement leaves shoes that will not easily be filled.
However, we can take solace in the knowledge that Richard's legacy lives on in the countless firefighters he mentored and, despite his retirement, that he will remain close to the Woodstock firefighting community.
Having positioned the town of Woodstock for greater success, Richard has earned this retirement and will appreciate time with his wife of 30 years, Beth, and their family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing Richard Baron's community-oriented contributions to the town of Woodstock and congratulating him on his well-earned retirement. ____________________
HONORING THE KIWANIS CLUB OF SANTA ANA; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-11-03 Volume: 169, Issue: 182 Pages: E1057 - E1057 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE KIWANIS CLUB OF SANTA ANA ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate a remarkable milestone: the 100th Anniversary Celebration of The Kiwanis Club in Santa Ana.
On October 20, 1920, a group of 77 leading citizens of Santa Ana organized the Kiwanis Club of Santa Ana as the seventh Kiwanis Club in California.
The Club Charter was issued on February 23, 1921.
In the 1920's and 1930's, the Club focused on supporting various youth and community organizations, including the YMCA and Boy Scouts of America.
Members of the Club worked on the coordinating committees for the development of the current Santa Ana College Campus and the YMCA building on Sycamore Street, as well as helped to build the Masonic temple on that same road.
In 1954, a focus on scholarships led to the Club's first award to a Santa Ana High School student for $500.
Due to the generosity of members, friends, and bequests, the Foundation scholarship fund has grown to over $1 million.
Scholarships today are awarded to continuing and transferring Santa Ana College students.
To date, the Club has awarded over $3.6 million in scholarships.
Notably, Kiwanis International eliminated gender as a qualification of membership in 1987.
The Kiwanis Club of Santa Ana welcomed its first female member shortly thereafter.
Santa Ana Kiwanians Doy Henley and Cliff Benson took a stand and advocated for the inclusion of women at the International Convention in 1979.
Since 2000, the club has focused on education and support for low- income families and those with special needs.
The Club has evolved with the needs of the community and has developed into a group of concerned, motivated men and women from diverse ethnic and vocational backgrounds.
