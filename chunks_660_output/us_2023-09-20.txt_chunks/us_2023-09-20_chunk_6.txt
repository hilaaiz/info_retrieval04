Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 175th anniversary of Washington Gas, a leading provider of energy services in the national capital region.
In 1848, Congress passed, and President James Polk signed, an Act that chartered the Washington Gas Light Company, making Washington Gas the first congressionally chartered gas company in the country.
Washington Gas was originally responsible for installing gas lights in the United States Capitol, the White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue in the District of Columbia.
Washington Gas expanded its service into Maryland and Virginia around the turn of the 20th century, and today provides energy to more than 1.2 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in the national capital region.
Over the years, Washington Gas and its employees have supported various nonprofit, community, civic, and charitable organizations.
