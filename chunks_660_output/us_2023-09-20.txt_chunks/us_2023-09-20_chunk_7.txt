Washington Gas was originally responsible for installing gas lights in the United States Capitol, the White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue in the District of Columbia.
Washington Gas expanded its service into Maryland and Virginia around the turn of the 20th century, and today provides energy to more than 1.2 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in the national capital region.
Over the years, Washington Gas and its employees have supported various nonprofit, community, civic, and charitable organizations.
This support has enhanced the quality of life for countless individuals and families in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, providing millions of dollars for vocational training, job placements, and other paths to long-term employment, including more than $500,000 in scholarships for underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Since 2018 alone, Washington Gas' philanthropic programs and initiatives have contributed more than $7 million in local support.
This funding has advanced programs that support healthy and safe communities.
Washington Gas employees have provided more than 140,000 hours of volunteer service since 2005 to organizations in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, including the Capital Area Food Bank, Special Olympics DC, Healthy Babies Project, The Latino Student Fund, The Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, INROADS, Junior Achievement, The March of Dimes, YMCA of Greater Washington, A Wider Circle, and The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the Washington Area Fuel Fund (WAFF).
Since 1983, WAFF has provided over $33 million to help more than 308,000 local families heat their homes during challenging times, no matter their heating source.
Washington Gas pays all administrative fees to ensure that every WAFF dollar goes to a family in need.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in congratulating Washington Gas on its 175th anniversary and thanking Washington Gas for its service to its customers and community. ____________________

MATTHEW CAUSEY ______ of louisiana in the house of representatives Mr. CARTER of Louisiana.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate an outstanding gentleman and dear friend, Dr. Matthew Causey.
Dr. Causey departed this life on September 6, 2023.
He was born on August 5, 1943, in New Orleans, Louisiana to the late Helen Kelly Jones and Matthew Causey.
For most of his childhood, he grew up in St. Charles Parish in the small town of Killona.
It was there that life-long values were formed under the loving and watchful eyes of his late grandparents, Eva and Andrew Kelly, Sr.,
and his 7 aunts and uncles.
To him, his many first cousins were more like brothers and sisters, and to many close relatives, he was known as ``Snook.''
Dr. Causey's early education preparation culminated in his graduation from George Washington Carver High School in Hahnville, LA.
Thereafter, he enrolled at Southern University at New Orleans (SUNO), and eventually transferred to the Baton Rouge campus, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics Education in 1966.
He began his professional career as a math teacher in Orleans Parish Public Schools at Samuel S. Green Junior High School.
Always yearning to learn more, Matthew earned a Master of Science degree in Mathematics from Loyola University in New Orleans in 1970.
Continuing his steadfast commitment to education, Matthew applied and was accepted into a doctoral program in mathematics education at the University of Houston.
It was there that he met the love of his life, Lynette Smith, as they were both pursuing doctoral degrees.
Upon completing their respective graduate programs, they returned to New Orleans.
They married in 1978.
