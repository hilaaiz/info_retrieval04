Drafted in 1970, Corporal Allen proudly served in the United States Army for 3 years, where he was assigned a tour of duty on the Korean peninsula.
He is survived by his loving daughter, Retha Allen; son, Andrew Allen; and 5 grandchildren, LeAnna, Maycan, Anaya, Clay, and Tayte.
As a devoted family man, his children remember him for his kindness and down-to-earth nature.
They fondly recall how attentive he was to his daughter, then only 13, when she was hospitalized for an entire month; how he would hike 3 miles through the wintry snow just to feed the livestock; and all the fun they shared on the family's one and only camping trip.
Corporal Allen was a man of few words, but his words carried weight and respect from all who knew him.
Please join me in thanking Corporal Danny K. Allen for his distinguished military service to the United States of America. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Vietnam Era veteran and Purple Heart Recipient, Haskel Joe Hill (1947 through 2022) for his distinguished service in the U.S. Army.
Hailing from Harriman, Tennessee, Haskel Hill served in the Army from October 1964 to October 1973.
He fought in Vietnam and was captured by enemy troops, being held as a prisoner of war.
His bravery and heroism during the conflict and throughout his capture earned him the Purple Heart.
Haskel Hill also received the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross, awarded to him by the former government of South Vietnam, in recognition of his valor in combat with the enemy.
While he safely returned to America, he passed away due to complications resulting from exposure to Agent Orange during the conflict.
Haskel Hill is survived by his proud daughters, Ida L. Hendrix of Jacksonville, Florida, Helana J. Cormier of Green Cove Springs, Florida, and Alice Hill of Kingsport, Tennessee.
Vietnam Era veterans and their surviving family members deserve our deepest gratitude for their service and sacrifice, and it is long past due.
Please join me in remembering American hero and patriot, Haskel Hill for his strength, courage, and bravery.
We are eternally grateful to him and his valiant military service to our great country. ____________________
