SAVING AMERICA; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
152



Date: 2023-09-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 152 Pages: E868 - E868 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAVING AMERICA ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, Stephen Moore of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity provides a daily Hotline ( steve@committeetounleashprosperity.com ) with very informative research on economic issues facing American families.
A very thoughtful analysis was distributed on September 18, 2023.
``House Budget Committee Chair Jody Arrington's [. . .
fiscal plan] won't solve our financial problems--but it will stop the bleeding.
`The plan reaches a balanced budget in 10 years without a penny of new taxes,' said Arrington.
`We grow the economy and cut spending.'
``The Democrats and Biden are hysterical and threatening to shut down the government to keep the current runaway train of spending over the cliff.
``To get a sense of the stakes here, consider that the fastest growing component of the budget over the next decade--other than the Green New Deal--is interest on the . . .
national debt.
Interest payments, which will soon reach $1 trillion, will be like a Pacman swallowing up more and more of the entire budget.
``Our ace economist EJ Antoni highlights a troubling trend.
Almost $8 trillion of low-interest-rate debt will roll over at much higher rates.
Instead of paying 2 and 3% interest on bonds, we will be paying close to 5% and maybe more if the Fed has to raise interest rates again.
Biden has created a fine fiscal mess, and it will take years to get out of it.
Arrington is right: let's start right now.''
In conclusion, God Bless our troops, who successfully protected America for 20 years, as the Global War on Terrorism continues moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders. ____________________
