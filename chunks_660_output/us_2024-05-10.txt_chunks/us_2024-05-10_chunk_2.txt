Bryan even formed the ``Green and Gold Committee'' at USF where he and his fellow Pre-Med students met regularly to discuss ways to help the Foundation prosper.
They held a ``game night'' at USF to educate college kids about colon cancer and offered screening information for them to share with their family members.
They raised a little money and dispensed a lot of information.
Bryan is about to start his journey in medical school this summer and plans to practice medicine in Citrus County one day.
It is clear that Mr. Fisher has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Coen Brehmer, a Yulee High School Hornet who recently won the Florida High School weightlifting championships which is impressive at any age, but even more so as only a junior in high school.
Coen qualified for both the Olympic and traditional in the 119-pound weight class.
At the state championship, Coen stung the competition, winning first in the Olympic lift and finishing second in traditional.
He pulled off a 160-pound snatch, a 205-pound clean-and-jerk, and a 215-pound bench to bring home the gold.
The victory was as sweet as honey and the crowd was buzzing at his magnificent displays of strength.
The Hornets, under the leadership of Coach Kyle Dougherty, performed incredibly well across the board this season.
Coen's teammates, Zachary Kruger and Kevin Harris, also qualified for state after exceptional performances this season.
Coen is a fantastic representation of Northeast Florida.
He is a kind friend and a great teammate.
His hard work paid off and he became Yulee High School's first male state champion in any sport.
