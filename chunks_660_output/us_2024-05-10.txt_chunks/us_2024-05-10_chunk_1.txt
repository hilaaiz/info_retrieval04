Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Annette Wolf for her milestone 100th birthday celebrated on April 1, 2024.
Annette has been a resident of Boynton Beach, Florida since 1999 and is a proud wife and mother to two great men.
What a wonderful occasion for Annette, her family, and friends as she reminisces and celebrates a life great in years and rich in accomplishments.
Annette and her husband ran a corrugated box factory business in Upstate New York for several years.
She started the Women's Business and Professional Organization in 1954 in Glens Falls, NY.
Annette loves to socialize with her friends by playing Mah-Jongg and Canasta.
She believes in doing everything in moderation and is an avid reader and regular viewer of MSNBC and CNN.
She has lived through extraordinary times in history and has no doubt witnessed remarkable changes unimaginable at the time of her birth in 1924.
May this be a joyous time as her family and friends gather to celebrate this amazing milestone.
Annette always has a smile on her face and remains positive in all things.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to congratulate Ms. Annette Wolf on her 100th birthday and I wish her good health and great happiness. ____________________

RECOGNIZING BRYAN FISHER; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-05-10 Volume: 170, Issue: 82 Pages: E480 - E481 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E480-E481] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BRYAN FISHER ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions that have been made to our community by one of my constituents, Bryan Fisher.
Three years ago, his mother was diagnosed with colon cancer and started a non-profit charity with her gastroenterologist and surgeon.
Their goal was helping other colon cancer patients.
Bryan, who was a Pre-Med student at the University of South Florida in Tampa at the time, volunteered countless hours to help the organization get off the ground.
He maintains the non-profit organization's website, updating it regularly with helpful resources for patients and healthcare providers.
The Foundation provides pamphlets to endoscopy centers that perform colonoscopies.
If a mass is found, the center gives the patient the pamphlet so patients don't have to go through their cancer journey alone.
The foundation also provides the public with pamphlets about colon cancer screening and pamphlets for current colon cancer patients.
All of the pamphlets have been designed by Bryan.
Bryan has also been instrumental in fundraising efforts to ensure the non-profit foundation has the resources it needs to operate.
Bryan even formed the ``Green and Gold Committee'' at USF where he and his fellow Pre-Med students met regularly to discuss ways to help the Foundation prosper.
They held a ``game night'' at USF to educate college kids about colon cancer and offered screening information for them to share with their family members.
They raised a little money and dispensed a lot of information.
