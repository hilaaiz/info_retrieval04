The support they have provided for Dexter's students and educators over the last 40 years is worthy of commendation.
The Educational Foundation of Dexter (EFD) was founded in 1984 to enhance the educational experience for those enrolled in the Dexter Community School District.
Through teacher written grants, the EFD provides financial support for new and innovative educational projects.
The EFD has awarded over $1 million since 1984 for programs such as FLEX Robotics Kits for Creekside Middle School, a field trip to the Charles H. Wright Museum for the entire 5th grade, adaptive music for students with special needs, and equipment to support the Iron Dread program at Dexter High School.
In 2023, the EFD's Spring Auction raised over $24,000 for Dexter students.
In 2015, Excellence 4 Dexter Students (E4DS) was formed in response to multiple years of annual budget cuts at the state level.
This led to some notable changes within the district, including larger class sizes and reduced staffing.
Since their founding, E4DS has donated over $182,000 to the Dexter Community Schools for additional programming.
Their donations have supported additional math and science programming for grades 3-6, mental wellness programs for both staff and students, and an experience at Eastern Michigan University for many 6th grade classes.
In 2020, E4DS and the Educational Foundation of Dexter joined forces to better support and respond to the needs of the Dexter Community School District.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the work of the Educational Foundation of Dexter over the last four decades.
Both the teachers and students of the Dexter community have had a more fulfilling educational experience due to the hard work of the EFD.
We are excited to see what they can accomplish over the next 40 years.
I thank the EFD. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO VIOLET SAGE WALKER--CALIFORNIA'S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL WOMAN OF THE YEAR; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
82



Date: 2024-05-10 Volume: 170, Issue: 82 Pages: E481 - E481 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO VIOLET SAGE WALKER--CALIFORNIA'S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL WOMAN OF THE YEAR ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CARBAJAL.
Mr. Speaker, each year, through the Women of the Year Award, my office extends special recognition to women on the Central Coast who have made a difference in our community.
I would like to recognize one outstanding Women of the Year Award recipient, Violet Sage Walker of San Luis Obispo, California.
Violet is the chairwoman of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council (NCTC), a non-profit offering a foundation for the Chumash people of San Luis Obispo County to continue practicing their heritage and culture with dignity and vibrancy.
She assumed the position after the passing of her father, Native American Tribal Chief Fred Harvey Collins, on October 1, 2021, and continues to advance Chumash heritage and culture in partnership with a broad community of Tribal allies, conservation organizations, and others.
As leader of the NCTC, Violet's mission is to protect the sacred places for those who were here long ago, for those here now, and for those who are still coming.
The Central Coast is home to many sacred locations that are mentioned in Chumash oral tradition which include stories (saga' squatinas'ni) and context over the past 15,000 years, including an older recorded date at Point Conception, an extremely important Chumas Sacred Place known to Native Americans as the Western Gate (Humqaq).
For Violet, one of those duties is serving as the nominator of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, the first Indigenous-led sanctuary nomination and one that tribal elders and members of the local community in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties have advocated for decades.
As proposed, this sanctuary bridges the physical gap of protection between the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands national marine sanctuaries.
