Prior to holding office, Senator

Breaux worked for the Indiana Department of Economic Development, where

she fought for Hoosiers of all backgrounds.
In 2006, she was elected to

the Indiana Senate--following in the footsteps of her mother, Billie

Breaux--and served as assistant Democratic leader for the Senate

Democratic Caucus from 2012 to 2020.
In her role, Senator Breaux fought tirelessly for vulnerable and

disadvantaged Hoosiers.
In particular, she worked to improve Black

infant and maternal mortality, increased access to healthy food in food

deserts, protected Hoosiers from rising utility costs, fought for

reproductive justice, passed policies to address poverty, advocated for

gun violence prevention to keep our communities safe, and so much more.
In her role on the Senate Health Committee, she helped combat health

disparities in the Black community and pushed for comprehensive access

to care.
Equity was always at the center of her service.
Senator

Breaux's initiative to eliminate school textbook fees passed last year,

which will help Hoosier families for generations to come.
Senator Breaux's impact on our community is reflected in the

outpouring of grief and support as the entire Indiana community mourns

this substantial loss.
She was a great friend, mentor, and confidante

to so many, including myself.
On many occasions, I relied on her wisdom

to guide me, and the lessons she taught us all will continue to endure.
On behalf of the entire 7th Congressional District, we offer our

condolences to those grieving this significant loss, especially her

beloved mother, former Senator Billie Breaux.
Today, we honor the life and legacy of Senator Jean Breaux, but we

will continue to honor her every day moving forward by heeding her

advice: fight for those less fortunate, no matter the obstacles in the

way, speak up against injustice, and never stop working towards a

brighter future.
