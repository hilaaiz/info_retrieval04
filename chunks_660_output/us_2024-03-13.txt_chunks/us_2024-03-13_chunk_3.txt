HONORING THE MEMORY OF HARRIS COUNTY JUSTICE OF THE PEACE JUDGE ARMANDO V. RODRIGUEZ; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 45 Pages: E247 - E248 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E247-E248] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE MEMORY OF HARRIS COUNTY JUSTICE OF THE PEACE JUDGE ARMANDO V. RODRIGUEZ ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. GREEN of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.
I rise to honor the memory of a noble public servant Harris County Justice of the Peace Judge Armando V. Rodriguez.
Elected to Harris County's Precinct 6, Place 2 in 1973, Judge Armando V. Rodriguez became the first Hispanic to hold the title of Harris County Justice of the Peace.
He served our county admirably for more than four decades and was known as the longest-tenured judge in Harris County.
The Honorable Judge V. Rodriguez was not just a holder of public trust but a justice seeker, community leader, and coalition builder.
Judge Rodriguez exercised compassion and experience to boldly advocate for and protect his community.
Judge Rodriguez went above and beyond the call of duty when he founded Fiestas Patrias, an organization that celebrates the diversity and cultures of Latin America and culminated into an annual parade that is still being held today.
Judge Rodriguez's efforts also included the creation of the Black and Brown Coalition, which we co-founded together.
Mr. Speaker, I am fortunate enough to say that I knew and worked alongside The Honorable Judge Armando V. Rodriguez for many years.
I believe that when history records the legacy of Judge Rodriguez, he will be forever remembered for his caring and candid demeanor as he worked to serve local communities, his county, as well as his country. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PERMIT COMMERCIAL FILMMAKING AND PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE GROUNDS OF THE U.S. CAPITOL; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
45



Date: 2024-03-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 45 Pages: E251 - E251 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PERMIT COMMERCIAL FILMMAKING AND PHOTOGRAPHY ON THE GROUNDS OF THE U.S. CAPITOL ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would permit commercial filmmaking and photography on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol Complex.
Currently, such filmmaking and photography is only authorized in Union Square.
In many countries, freedom of expression is limited, and while the January 6th insurrection was one of the greatest threats to American democracy in history, the Capitol and the United States remain beacons of democracy for the world.
We should encourage commercial filmmaking and photography at the Capitol to share this symbol of democracy with the world.
Movies and television shows that involve the Capitol should not have to go to other cities or use a fake building.
This bill would allow commercial filmmaking and photography outside of the Capitol and Congressional office buildings by permit, so long as neither chamber is in session.
The policy allowing commercial filmmaking and photography in Union Square shows that the Capitol Police can handle commercial filmmaking and photography at the Capitol Complex, especially when Congress is not in session.
However, that vantage point captures the least familiar view of the Capitol.
