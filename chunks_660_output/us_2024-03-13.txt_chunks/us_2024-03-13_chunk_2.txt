HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT CRAIGHEAD; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
45



Date: 2024-03-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 45 Pages: E250 - E250 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT CRAIGHEAD ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Robert ``Bob'' Anderson Craighead, who passed away on February 9, 2024.
He was 97 years old.
Mr. Craighead was born on December 18, 1926, in Hyattsville, Maryland, to William M. and Jean C. Craighead.
He graduated from Andrew Lewis High School at age 16 and then began a 44-year career in railroads, as a messenger in the N&W's Blacksmith Shop.
Not long after, Mr. Craighead's railroad career was put on hold when he volunteered for the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, serving as a rifleman with the Fourth Marine Division and earning a Purple Heart after being wounded in the Battle of Iwo Jima.
He also tried to volunteer for the Korean War when the war broke out, but because of his injuries, was turned down.
After returning from World War II, he completed a four-year apprenticeship, and moved to the Industrial Development Department in 1954, retiring in 1987 as Regional Manager.
During his life he served as the President of the Salem/Roanoke County Chamber of Commerce, Chairman of the Salem Industrial Development Authority, Chairman of the Economic Development Committee of the Virginia State Chamber of Commerce, and he was a member of the Regional Partnership of the Roanoke Valley.
He also served as director and Vice President of the Salem Educational Foundation and Alumni Association, establishing the Craighead Family Endowment, awarding scholarships to graduates of Salem High School.
When I was a boy, growing up in a mother-led single parent household, Mr. Craighead was very kind in making sure that I was included in activities with his boys.
Following his retirement in 1987, Mr. Craighead wrote and published a book titled, ``Jackson's Legacy.''
He was preceded in death by his wife, Janet Terry Akers Craighead, his parents, and his two brothers, William M. Craighead, Jr. and James L. Craighead.
He is survived by his five children and their significant others, Russell Craighead and Cynthia Miller, Anne Craighead, Steve and Beth Craighead, Nancy Craighead and Janet Ardam, Tim and Debra Craighead; adoptive daughter, Amanda Allen; nine grandchildren; and sixteen great- grandchildren.
I wish them my sincerest condolences during this difficult time.
I want to thank Mr. Craighead for his service to our country and note that he was a valued member of the Salem community throughout his life. ____________________
