RECOGNIZING VIRGINIA ALLEN AND THE BLACK ANGELS; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
45



Date: 2024-03-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 45 Pages: E250 - E250 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING VIRGINIA ALLEN AND THE BLACK ANGELS ______ of new york in the house of representatives Ms. MALLIOTAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following Proclamation recognizing Virginia Allen and the Black Angels.
Whereas: Virginia Allen arrived to Staten Island, New York at the age of 16 to work as a nurse at Staten Island Sea View Hospital in 1947.
Whereas: Staten Island Sea View Hospital opened in 1913 specifically to treat patients with Tuberculosis and, at its peak, Sea View Hospital saw nearly 2,000 patients and was one of only four municipal hospitals in New York City that did not discriminate against Black nurses.
Whereas: Virginia Allen received her training at Staten Island Seaview Hospital and courageously stepped up on the frontlines to be one of the 300 `Black Angels' to treat tuberculosis patients.
Whereas: the Black Angels were courageous, dedicated, and bold in answering the call to come to Sea View and risk their lives caring for the grievously sick and ``indigent consumptives'' of New York City, who had been banished to this woefully understaffed sanatorium.
Whereas: Virginia Allen served for 10 years at Staten Island's Sea View Hospital, working in the pediatric ward.
The Black Angels' years of expertise played a significant role in the first ever human trials of isoniazid, the first drug to cure tuberculosis.
