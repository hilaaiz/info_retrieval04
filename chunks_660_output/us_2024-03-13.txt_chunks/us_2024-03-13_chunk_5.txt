Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sense of gratitude that I rise today to honor the lifelong public service career of Mr. Carson Ross, who has served as the mayor of the city of Blue Springs since 2008.
Mr. Ross will be retiring as the first African American Mayor of Blue Springs, Missouri.
Mr. Ross's dedication to public service is truly exemplary.
Before he began his distinguished career, Mr. Ross was a graduate of Bradley County High School, attended the University of Arkansas--Pline Bluff, and later received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Rockhurst University in 1977.
He began his career as a public servant in 1981, when he was elected to the Blue Springs Board of Aldermen where he served Districts 2 and 3 for eight consecutive years as Alderman and one year as Mayor Pro Tem.
To further grow his expertise and leadership skills, he went on to serve on the Legislative Branch of the State of Missouri and was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives to represent the 55th District.
Under this capacity, Mr. Ross served for a total of 14 years in Missouri's House of Representatives and as a testament of his abilities as a leader, served as the Republican Whip in 1991 through 1992.
As a result of his work ethic and dedication to serving his community, Mr. Ross was recognized as one of Kansas City's most influential African Americans by the Kansas City Globe in 1995 and 1996.
Furthermore, his influence and impact did not go unnoticed when he received the Outstanding Legislator Award in 1996 by the Missouri Federation Grand Order of Pachyderms and the 1997 state award by the Kansas City Globe as the Most Influential African American.
Beyond his role as a legislator, Mr Ross worked with Hallmark Cards after having an illustrious career of 39 years with the company, where he held various positions.
Additionally, he has served the city of Blue Springs in various capacities outside of Mayor through his participation on various boards including as Chairman of the Blue Springs Personnel Board, President of St. Mary's Medical Center Board of Associates, a founding member of Summit Bank of Kansas City Board of Trustees, among many more.
As Mayor of Blue Springs for sixteen years, Mr. Ross focused on ways that he could better his community and his selfless spirit of service is displayed throughout his career.
His historical achievement of becoming the city's first Black Mayor serves as an image of resiliency and determination to break through barriers and lay the groundwork for future leaders.
As children look towards future careers and occupations, they will know that they too are capable of being Mayor and a public

servant, even if that means being the first to do so.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. Ross for his tremendous accomplishments, his commitment, and tireless community service.
His immense impact will continue through the multitude of lives he has impacted.
On behalf of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District, I wish Mr. Ross great joy and relaxation in retirement as Mayor. ____________________
