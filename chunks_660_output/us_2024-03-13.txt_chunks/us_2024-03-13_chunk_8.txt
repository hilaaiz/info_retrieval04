Whereas: the Black Angels were courageous, dedicated, and bold in answering the call to come to Sea View and risk their lives caring for the grievously sick and ``indigent consumptives'' of New York City, who had been banished to this woefully understaffed sanatorium.
Whereas: Virginia Allen served for 10 years at Staten Island's Sea View Hospital, working in the pediatric ward.
The Black Angels' years of expertise played a significant role in the first ever human trials of isoniazid, the first drug to cure tuberculosis.
Since its discovery in 1952, tens of millions of lives have been saved.
Whereas: The Black Angels were activists and active members of the NAACP, neighborhood churches, and community groups, and became founding members of the Lincoln Hospital Alumni Association, the Urban League Guild, and the Women's Civic and Political Union.
They were fierce advocates for the integration of Black nurses into the U.S. military and American Nurses Association, and in New York City they worked toward desegregating the hospital system.
Whereas: Virginia Allen continued to serve her community as President of the North Shore Staten Island section of the National Council of Negro Women.
Whereas: The people of Staten Island are grateful for the years of service by Virginia Allen and all the Black Angels who selflessly served on the front lines at Sea View Hospital to treat tuberculosis patients. ____________________
UTILIZING SPACE EFFICIENTLY AND IMPROVING TECHNOLOGIES ACT OF 2023; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
45



Date: 2024-03-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 45 Pages: E248 - E249 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E248-E249] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UTILIZING SPACE EFFICIENTLY AND IMPROVING TECHNOLOGIES ACT OF 2023 ______ speech of of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill.
Certainly, we can agree that federal agencies, like many large employers, need to reevaluate their office space requirements in response to more hybrid work options post-COVID.
But this is not a new endeavor for the federal government.
This is something the federal government was doing for more than a decade before the pandemic.
When we passed the Telework Enhancement Act in 2009, federal telework participation was below 14 percent.
By 2016, that number grew by more than 50 percent to 22 percent.
During that intervening period, agencies created hoteling options, reevaluated office space needs, and even identified telework savings associated with reduced real estate requirements.
So again, this is not new territory for the federal government.
What is new is the mindless and punitive approach Republicans have started to take towards agency decisions about workplace environments.
During the pandemic, Republicans on the Committee on Oversight and Accountability, voted to require 100 percent of federal employees back into the office for full-time in-person work--a standard that did not exist even before the pandemic and one that envisions a 19th century workplace complete with hole-punched timecards.
Concurrently, they opposed my legislation, the Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act, to implement common sense workplace public health standards to protect federal employees during COVID and any future public health emergencies.
Their opposition is, as I said, mindless and punitive.
With this bill, House Republicans are at it again.
This bill would establish an arbitrary requirement for agencies to dispose of property and leases.
It makes no accommodations for the workplace flexibility our federal agencies need, not just to compete for talent, but also to accommodate those with disabilities or military spouses whose employment would not be possible without hybrid or remote work.
This bill demagogues the issue of hybrid work at a time when we should be taking meaningful action to help the federal workplace remain competitive and productive.
I welcome the Administration's efforts to end pandemic era remote work postures while strengthening robust telework options for federal employees, which we helped create with the Telework Enhancement Act.
