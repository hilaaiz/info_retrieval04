Today, El Paso Electric is

unveiling Newman Unit 6--a cutting edge, 228 megawatt natural gas

combustion turbine generating power plant.
This state-of-the-art

facility will replace three older, less-efficient units with a robust

energy supply equipped to meet the growing needs of the El Paso region.
Situated at the Newman Power Station in El Paso, TX, this project

exemplifies El Paso Electric's dedication to enhancing energy

reliability and minimizing wasteful practices.
By utilizing modern

natural gas technology, this project will optimize gas usage and reduce

water consumption by an impressive 600 million gallons annually.
Additionally, alongside maintaining a robust natural gas power

supply, this initiative makes significant investments in renewable

energy.
Such diversification is integral for fostering a resilient

power grid fit for the demands of the 21st century.
Supporting a strong energy sector is a key priority of mine in this

Chamber.
I fundamentally believe that energy security is national

security and that safeguarding jobs, such as those generated by this

project, is paramount.
Witnessing the fruition of this development

fills me with pride.
I applaud El Paso Electric for their unwavering commitment to

bolstering energy reliability and security in the El Paso region.
Their

tireless efforts ensure that our energy grid remains strong and can

keep our lights on around the clock.

CELEBRATING GENERAL EDWARD GREER'S 100TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
VERONICA ESCOBAR

Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the distinguished

life and extraordinary military career of General Edward Greer, a

remarkable individual whose legacy has left an indelible mark on our

nation, as he approaches his 100th birthday.
Born in the coal-mining town of Gary, West Virginia, General Greer's

journey began at West Virginia State College in 1942, where he enrolled

during an era of racial segregation.
However, his education was

interrupted by World War II, leading him to serve in the 777th Field

Artillery Battalion, an all-Black unit.
By the war's end, he had risen

to the esteemed rank of Master Sergeant.
Returning to civilian life,

General Greer resumed his studies at West Virginia State College, where

he met and married Jewell Means.
Their union, forged on May 31, 1948,

endured for more than 72 years.
Commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Regular Army in 1940,

General Greer sought stability in the military, serving with

distinction for 33 years.
His early assignments in Japan coincided with

the outbreak of the Korean War, where he earned the Silver Star for

valor.
Promoted through the ranks, General Greer's military career

traversed Germany.
Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Pentagon, witnessing the

Army's integration and earning promotions to Major, Lieutenant Colonel,

and Colonel.
His family grew to include three children: Michael,

Kenneth, and Gail.
In 1970, Colonel Greer served in Vietnam before becoming a

trailblazer in military history.
Selected for promotion to Brigadier

General in 1972, he joined an esteemed group of Black officers,

contributing to the integration of the Army's general officer ranks.
Retiring in 1976 after 33 years of dedicated service, General Greer

made El Paso his home.
With his beloved wife Jewell, he became an

active member of the community, engaging in real estate sales and

contributing to various civic boards.
The Greers' post-Army life was a testament to their commitment to

service and community.
It is with profound gratitude and respect that

we honor General Edward Greer's legacy, a legacy that exemplifies the

highest ideals of duty, honor, and love for our great nation, and wish

him a very happy 100th birthday.
