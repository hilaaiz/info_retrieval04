He is genuinely a

patriarch to many who continue to cross his path and will always be a

part of my journey as I lead the constituents of the 2nd Congressional

District of Louisiana.
He is my dear friend and mentor, and I hope to

be the mentor to others as he has been for me.
On this day, I wish my dear friend a Happy and Blessed Birthday, and

may he see many more.

COMMEMORATING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE KHOJALY MASSACRE

HON.
STEVE COHEN

Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of

the massacre of hundreds of people in the town of Khojaly, Azerbaijan.
On February 26, 1992, Armenian armed forces massacred over 600

unarmed people--including 106 women, 63 children, and 70 elderly

people--and left less than 2,000 survivors.
Hundreds more became

disabled due to their injuries.
More than 100 children lost a parent

and 25 children lost both parents.
At least 8 families were entirely

killed.
This was the largest killing of ethnic Azerbaijani civilians

during the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict

Although a cease-fire was negotiated in 1994, it is my hope that

Armenia and Azerbaijan can come together and find peace.
Long-term

peace, security, and regional cooperation would greatly benefit the

region and the world.
As Azerbaijanis throughout the world commemorate

the massacre and continue to grieve the loss of loved ones, I hope they

can find peace amidst this tragedy.
