Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Napa County Library Literacy Center as they celebrate 40 years of literary services.
In 1984, the Napa County Library was one of twenty-seven programs that help pilot library literacy within California, the first of its kind in the United States.
The Literacy Center has committed to helping adult learners improve their reading and writing skills in English.
Over 40 years, the Napa County Library Literacy Center has helped more than 15,000 adult learners become literate, expanding their capabilities.
With the assistance of volunteer tutors, adult learners can also improve their computer skills, receive guidance on financial planning, access translation resources, and gain skills needed to obtain their General Education Diploma (GED).
The Napa County Library has collaborated with several organizations in Napa County, including Napa Valley College, Napa Valley Adult Education, and the Napa Valley Unified School District, to provide various resources.
The goal is to broaden the opportunities for everyone in our community.
In partnership with the California State Library and Smart Horizons, the Napa County Library also offers adults the opportunity to earn an accredited high school diploma and career certificate online through Career Online High School (COHS).
With a dedicated group of volunteers and other literacy and library staff, the Napa County Library is proud to be a part of State Library Literacy Services.
Together, they have provided assistance to over 300,000 adult learners through more than 106 programs.
Mr. Speaker, the Napa County Library Literacy Center is deeply appreciated for their work on behalf of our community.
It is, therefore.
fitting and proper that we honor the Napa County Library. ____________________
