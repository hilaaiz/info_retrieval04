Morse Manufacturing was incorporated on August 15, 1923.
It was first located at 402 S. Franklin Street in the City of Syracuse, New York, and then quickly relocated to Dickerson Street.
Ralph Andrews joined Morse Manufacturing in 1943, developed a product to safely handle drums, and purchased the company from the founder in 1948.
In 1953 the company was moved to East Syracuse.
Robert Andrews, son of Ralph Andrews, joined Morse Manufacturing in 1969.
Robert continued to grow and enhance a product offering to safely handle drums that was initiated by his father, and also expanded the building several times at the East Syracuse location.
Nathan Andrews, grandson of Ralph Andrews, joined Morse Manufacturing in 2002 and continued the family tradition of commitment and dedication through developing new international distribution and modernizing the operations at a new facility in the Town of Salina in 2019.
Today, Morse Manufacturing offers the most extensive line of high- quality drum handling equipment anywhere in the world and markets its products through an elite worldwide dealer network.
The longstanding success of Morse Manufacturing is largely because of the quality of its employees.
It has provided hundreds of employees and their families with careers and job security over its history.
Morse Manufacturing and its employees have continued to give back to the Central New York Community through volunteer work and contributions.
Morse Manufacturing takes pride in sourcing as much as possible from local suppliers with long established relationships.
This makes Morse Manufacturing a net revenue generator for the Central New York Economy, bringing revenues from products sold around the country and world to spend locally through wages, taxes, and local suppliers.
On behalf of New York's 22nd Congressional District, I would like to congratulate Morse Manufacturing on the occasion of its 100th Anniversary.
I wish them continued success for many years to come. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 128 Pages: E717 - E717 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARINE CORPS LEAGUE ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the 100th Anniversary of the Marine Corps League.
The Congressionally Chartered Veteran Service Organization over the past century has been critical in the care and welfare of our military, its Veterans, and their families.
The Marine Corps League was established in 1923 by World War I hero, then Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj.
Gen. John A. Lejeune.
On August 4, 1937, it was Congressionally Chartered by the 75th Congress of the United States and signed and approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The Marine Corps League provides millions of hours annually in service to the community, represents thousands of Veterans in cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs, performs tens of thousands of funeral honors annually for our passing Veterans, and provides millions of toys to the youth of America through the Toys for Tots Foundation and Marine Corps Reserves.
This volunteer work directly and positively impacts force readiness for the Marine Corps Reserves allowing additional focus on training and preparation.
As a retired Lt.
General and the former Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves and Marine Forces North, I deeply understand the importance of strong and battle-ready reserve units and will continue to support their mission here in Congress.
The work of the Marine Corps League and the impact of their advocacy on behalf of our servicemembers, Veterans, and their families cannot be overstated.
It is an honor to recognize the Marine Corps League for 100 years of service to our country.
I look forward to assisting in fulfilling their mission to support our Servicemen and women.
Please join me in congratulating the Marine Corps League for this historic achievement. ____________________
