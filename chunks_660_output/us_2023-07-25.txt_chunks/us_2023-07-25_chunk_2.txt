In fact, over the decade the Vasiloff family has been holding these fundraisers, they've become the largest private donors to the organization, with total donations closing in on $200,000.
Planning and holding a fundraiser of this magnitude is a huge team effort, and a major undertaking for the Vasiloffs.
As such, the Vasiloff family has decided that 2023 will be their final event.
But it certainly won't be the end of their service.
David, the proud Marine who helped inspire the fundraisers, continues to inspire, serve, and protect his hometown community of Green Oak Township, where he is now a police officer.
And Kathy and Steve will never stop supporting the brave men and women like their son who come home with visible and invisible scars of war, as well as the service families whose lives are forever shattered by loss.
Service to one's country takes many forms, and that includes contributing to our collective goal of moving toward a more perfect union.
Mr. Speaker, the Vasiloff family has never sought praise or publicity for their efforts, instead directing all attention to the cause so close to their hearts.
But as they prepare

for their tenth and final summer event, I thank them for their faithful service. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 128 Pages: E717 - E717 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOUNT SALEM AMERICAN BAPTIST CHURCH CELEBRATES 151 YEARS ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mount Salem American Baptist Church on its remarkable 151st anniversary this year.
This amazing milestone is a true testament to God's grace toward his people, as well as the unwavering faith, fellowship, and dedication of the congregation and its leaders throughout the years.
Founded in 1872, the church began in Indianola as the Mount Salem American Baptist Free Mission Church.
Soon after its founding, the church was sadly hit by 2 major hurricanes in 1875 and 1886, destroying the church's building.
Yet with faith in God's providence, the congregation endured and continued the ministry.
Led by Reverend Robert Greer, 20 church members moved to Victoria, bringing with them the pulpit, bell, and some of the salvaged lumber from the original church building to start anew--where the congregation reestablished and pressed forward in the mission.
With that perseverance came God's guidance and blessing.
The church continued to grow over the years and was eventually renamed as Mount Salem American Baptist Church in 1939.
In 1962, the church moved to another new building, where they still prominently display the original bell and pulpit used by the founding members.
To this day, Mount Salem American Baptist Church has touched countless lives in the Victoria community through its selfless acts of service.
Through outreach programs, compassionate ministries, and social initiatives, the church has been a steadfast advocate for the greater community, serving their neighbors for over a century.
But more than any building, program, or person, Mount Salem's anniversary milestone is a testament to God's enduring faithfulness toward his people.
Through both triumph and trial, it is clear that the Lord has provided the path and made clear His purpose.
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Mount Salem American Baptist Church on this incredible day.
May God continue to bless and keep them in the days and years ahead. ____________________
