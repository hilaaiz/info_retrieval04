His commitment to fostering a positive work environment and promoting the well-being of Wakefern employees is truly commendable.
I have had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the positive impact Wakefern has had on New Jersey, and I can attribute much of that success to Joe's steadfast leadership.
His dedication to the company's values and principles has set a high standard for the industry to follow.
As Joe transitions into retirement, I do not doubt that his legacy will endure, and his guidance will continue to be an inspiration to those who have had the honor of working alongside him.
His exceptional leadership and integrity have earned him the respect and admiration of colleagues, business partners, and the community at large.
On behalf of the constituents of New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, please accept my sincerest congratulations once again.
May his retirement be tilled with joy, good health, and the opportunity to enjoy special times with your loved ones. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the retirement and commend the service of Officer James Hutchins, who has honorably served with the Los Angeles Police Department for 35 years.
For nearly his entire life, Officer Hutchins has consistently and bravely put his life on the line in service of our Nation and in defense of our communities, and is now taking his well-deserved retirement to spend time with his loving family.
Officer Hutchins first began his career of service by enlisting in the United States Army in 1984.
Serving for 4 years, he received an honorable discharge as an Airborne Ranger.
It was at this time, in 1988 that he graduated from the LAPD Training Academy and joined the force, accruing time and experience in the Van Nuys, Pacific, and Venice Beach divisions.
By 1995, Officer Hutchins became a Los Angeles motorcycle officer assigned to the Central Traffic Division, and quickly set himself apart for his dedication and professionalism.
Upon returning to the Valley Traffic Division later that year, Officer Hutchins became a mentor to his fellow motorcycle officers, a legacy carried until his retirement as ``Most Senior Motor Cop in the City'', He additionally earned a Police Star in 2005 for bravely evacuating Los Angeles residents during a catastrophic fire.
This commendation was just one of over 200 accolades accrued over the course of his 35 years of service, marking his end of watch in June 2023.
I cannot commend Officer Hutchins enough for his service to California's 27th Congressional District and the City of Los Angeles.
We thank him for his tireless work to keep our community safe, and wish him the best in his retirement and the opportunity to spend more time with friends and loved ones, as is certainly deserved after such a long and successful career. ____________________
