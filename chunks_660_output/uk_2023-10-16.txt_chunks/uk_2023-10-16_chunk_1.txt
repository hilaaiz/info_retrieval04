INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA JUROR PAY PARITY ACT

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I introduce the District

of Columbia Juror Pay Parity Act, which would require D.C.'s local

trial court, the Superior Court, to pay jurors the same amount federal

courts pay jurors.
Currently, the Superior Court pays jurors the same

amount as federal jurors, but the Superior Court has sometimes paid

less.
Under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government

Improvement Act of 1997, Congress assumed responsibility for funding

the local D.C. courts.
The local D.C. courts, however, have always been

under the direct control of Congress, even when they were funded by

D.C. The D.C. Home Rule Act prohibits the D.C. Council from enacting

any law with respect to any provision of Title 11 of the D.C. Code.
Under Title 11, the Board of Judges of the Superior Court sets juror

pay.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF JEFF GREGORY'S SERVICE TO THE PATTERSON FIRE

DEPARTMENT UPON HIS RETIREMENT

HON.
JOHN S. DUARTE

Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Fire

Chief Jeff Gregory for his dedicated service to the Patterson Fire

Department and, at this moment, celebrate his thoroughly earned

retirement.
Chief Gregory was raised in the Modesto area and has lived in

Patterson since 1979.
He is married and has two daughters.
His

involvement in the fire service began as a firefighter with the

Patterson Volunteer Fire Department in June of 1986.
Chief Gregory

worked his way up through the Volunteer Fire Service ranks and became a

Volunteer Captain on September 1, 2001.
In December, he was promoted

again to Volunteer Battalion Chief.
On May 1, 2003, his full-time fire

service career began when he was hired by the City of Patterson Fire

Department, in a partnership with the West Stanislaus Fire Protection

District, as the Division Chief.
In this new role, Chief Gregory's

duties included training coordination, facilities maintenance, and

overseeing the purchasing, maintenance, and repair of the fire

apparatus and emergency equipment.
Chief Gregory was ultimately appointed as the permanent Fire Chief on

September 21, 2016.
Throughout his tenure as Fire Chief, he has had

numerous accomplishments and achievements that have improved the

delivery of fire, rescue, and emergency medical services to Western

Stanislaus County.
One of his successes includes improving and

expanding the Patterson Fire Department's Advanced Life Support Program

to ensure that both city fire stations and assigned apparatus have

advanced life support equipment available to on-duty Fire Paramedics.
Chief Gregory has also been instrumental in modernizing the fire fleet

and emergency equipment for the City of Patterson and West Stanislaus

Fire Agencies.
Chief Gregory's vision for the fire service has

significantly improved the force and has also had a positive impact on

his community.
During the Covid-19 Pandemic, Chief Gregory would often work or

remain on-call for over 100 hours per week to ensure that everyone in

the City of Patterson or the West Stanislaus Fire District would

receive help when they called 911 for assistance.
Chief Gregory's commitment to public service, spanning 37 years, is

truly commendable.
Every day, he tirelessly strived to serve the people

of his community--sometimes at the expense of his own personal time and

comfort.
His service will be greatly missed by his community and

everyone who worked alongside him.
