Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor retired USAF

Lieutenant Colonel Harold Eugene Rafuse, of Crawford, Texas, by

presenting him with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His

persistent efforts in fostering beliefs of sacrifice and respect

reflect his value as a leader during service and in retirement.
Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse devoted nearly 20 years to active duty in

the United States Air Force serving with distinction in a variety of

critical roles.
As an airborne Forward Air Controller and close air

support combat fighter pilot, he flew the North American T-28D Trojan

aircraft in Southeast Asia as a Raven Pilot, providing vital support to

ground forces.
He also piloted the RC-135 aircraft, conducting high-

altitude photographic and electronic reconnaissance missions in Eastern

and Southeast Asia, significantly contributing to our national security

efforts.
Later in his career, he was selected for the newly established United

States Air Force Space Operations Command, where he served as a space

operations and surveillance commander.
His leadership in this emerging

field showcased his adaptability and commitment to advancing our

Nation's capabilities in space.
Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse's 20 years of active service are

complemented by his extensive experience in aviation, aerospace,

scientific research, engineering, technology, education, senior program

management, information resource management, and administration.
He

held influential positions across the Department of Defense, multiple

federal intelligence agencies, and various civilian educational and

business institutions.
Notably, he served as a science and technology

advisor to the Office of President Ronald Reagan, a testament to his

expertise and the trust placed in him at the highest levels of

government.
By the time of his retirement, his exceptional achievements had

earned him numerous titles and certifications, including Senior Pilot

in the Air Force, Senior Space Operations Commander, Space Surveillance

and Mission Assessment Expert, Command Missileer, Master Acquisition

Manager (Department of Defense Level III certified), and Master

Instructor.
Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse's decorations include the Meritorious

Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Force Commendation

Medal, the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force

Organizational Excellence Award with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the

National Defense Service Medal, the Air Force

Longevity Service Ribbon with three Oak Leaf Clusters, the Small Arms

Expert Marksmanship Ribbon (Pistol), and the Air Force Training Ribbon.
These honors reflect his dedication, skill, and the high esteem in

which he is held by his peers and superiors.
Following his distinguished military career, Lieutenant Colonel

Rafuse has been deeply involved in community service and education.
He

co-founded the Baylor University School of Engineering and Computer

Science and has served on its Board of Advocates for over 25 years,

influencing the education of countless students.
He has also been a

member of the Baylor University Air Institute's Board of Advisors for

over five years, contributing his expertise to the advancement of

aviation education.
Currently, he chairs the Board of Texas State Technical College,

where he has served for over 25 years, demonstrating his long-term

commitment to technical education and workforce development.
Additionally, he is a member and former president of the Heart of Texas

Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America, where he has

served on the educational scholarship selection committee for over 25

years, supporting the next generation of leaders.
These are just a few

examples of the many organizations where Lieutenant Colonel Rafuse has

made significant contributions as a member and leader.
It is with great honor and respect that I present retired USAF

Lieutenant Colonel Harold Eugene Rafuse with a Congressional Veteran

Commendation from the 17th Congressional District of Texas.
His

exemplary service to our Nation and continued contributions to his

community stand as an inspiration to us all.
