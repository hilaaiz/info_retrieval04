Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and work of Michael E. Fox, Sr.,
a strong force for good in the South Bay who died on November 3, 2023, at the age of 87.
Michael Fox was born in Chicago on September 23, 1936 and attended Bishop Quarter Military Academy there, Campion Jesuit High School in Wisconsin, graduated from Notre Dame University in Indiana, and earned a degree in Brewing Science and Technology from the Siebel Institute of Technology in Chicago.
He met his wife Mary Ellen in Illinois, and the couple moved to California.
They bought a home in Saratoga in 1965 and acquired a small beer distributorship, which grew from 10 employees to more than 200 during 50 years of business.
Michael Fox and Mary Ellen were renowned for their extraordinary philanthropy, and he held leadership roles in countless charitable organizations.
His good works earned him accolades such as Santa Clara County Philanthropist of the Year, two Papal awards, and an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Public Service from Santa Clara University.
Mike Fox was deeply devoted to his family and his Catholic faith, and his commitment to both inspired his life and brought him great joy.
He was kind and affable and mentored many people over the years, ran marathons and loved Broadway musicals.
Any cause that would uplift others became his cause.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in honoring the life and work of Michael Fox, and in extending our most sincere condolences to his entire family.
He was a good man who did great things to better our communities and strengthen our country.
Mike Fox was a national treasure. ____________________
