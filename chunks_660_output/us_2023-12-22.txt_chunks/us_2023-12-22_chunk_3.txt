Known for her dedication to giving back and empowering others, one of Saisha's greatest attributes is her selflessness.
Her willingness to continually give back is one of her many attributes that will inevitably result in success in this field.
Saisha's heart is dedicated to equity for Black and brown communities, and she is moving on from my office to continue that work.
Upon transitioning from my office, Saisha will go on to advocate for safer communities, criminal justice reform, and civil rights access for marginalized communities.
On behalf of Florida's 24th Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Saisha White for her drive and dedication to public service. ____________________

Jim is a born and bred son of North Carolina, great American and dear friend.
Jim's dedication to service and constant willingness to step up when needed is commendable and inspiring.
It has been an honor serving the people of North Carolina alongside him and I wish him the best in all his future endeavors.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Senator Jim Perry for his service to our community and the great state of North Carolina. ____________________
