Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the St. Dominic Girls Golf Team on their victory in Missouri's Class 3 Team Girls' Golf State Championship.
The Crusaders claimed the Class 3 title by dominating their competition.
By the end of the first day, the team held a 17-shot advantage and never looked back as they went on to win by 42 strokes.
The team should be commended for all their hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home a state championship to their school and community.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the St. Dominic Girls' Golf Team for a job well done. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service of Saisha White, my legislative assistant who has dedicated her time to serving the people of Florida's 24th Congressional District.
A Cleveland native, Saisha moved to Florida to obtain her law degree at Florida A&M University after obtaining her bachelor's at Miami University.
Her time in law school inspired her passion to secure equity and opportunities across marginalized communities.
Saisha came to my office ready to make a difference.
She worked her way up to becoming my legislative assistant, handling my Transportation & Infrastructure Committee work.
In her time as my legislative assistant, she managed my proposed legislation, amendments--many of which were included in critical legislation and advocated for critical issues to better the lives of those across the country.
Known for her dedication to giving back and empowering others, one of Saisha's greatest attributes is her selflessness.
Her willingness to continually give back is one of her many attributes that will inevitably result in success in this field.
Saisha's heart is dedicated to equity for Black and brown communities, and she is moving on from my office to continue that work.
