COMMEMORATING NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY

HON.
MIKE QUIGLEY

Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National

Prisoners of War and Missing in Action Recognition Day and honor those

who were held captive and were returned, as well as those who remain

missing.
Established in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, National POW/MIA

Recognition Day is held yearly on the third Friday of September.
This

day is marked by ceremonies at the Pentagon and at military

installations across the Nation.
More than 81,000 American service

personnel are missing from previous conflicts and approximately 38,000

are believed to be recoverable.
I commend the work of the Defense POW/

MIA Accounting Agency in searching for our missing Americans and

ensuring that no service member is left behind.
As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I work hard

each year to ensure that the POW/MIA Accounting Agency has the

necessary funding to continue their essential work.
We have a duty to

these service members that have endured unspeakable indignities to

protect and preserve our freedoms.
The United States cannot and will

not abandon the search for those who gave their last full measure of

devotion in overseas wars.
I cannot express the depth of my gratitude for every patriot who have

served our Nation.
I will continue to use my role in Congress to bring

every imprisoned or missing servicemember home.
Mr. Speaker, please

commemorating National POW/MIA Recognition Day.

Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Women

Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter of the American Business Women's

Association (ABWA), based in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and to celebrate

American Business Women's Day.
ABWA's Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter held its first meeting

opportunities for local business leaders to network and learn from one

another.
Through their work to recognize the rich contributions of

women in business, members have brought together businesswomen from

various fields and highlighted their voices at the local and national

level.
I thank the Fredericksburg Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter for

their unwavering commitment to fostering growth and excellence,

spotlighting the role of local businesswomen in growing Virginia's

economy, and

empowering women in our communities.
I am proud to join them and their

sister chapters across our country in celebrating 75 years of the ABWA.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the

Fredericksburg Women Inspiring Women Leaders Chapter for their

remarkable achievements and their commitment to empowering women in

business.
Their dedication exemplifies the spirit of progress and

excellence we celebrate on American Business Women's Day.
