On a personal note, I was blessed to have known Senator Dunn and her

wonderful family.
As Alabama's first Black Congresswoman, I stand on

the shoulders of amazing leaders like Senator Dunn who opened the doors

for me and many others.
She was a grand dame whose footsteps we as

Black women elected officials in Alabama are blessed to follow.
On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional District, I ask my

colleagues to join me in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy

the State of Alabama and our Nation.

RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF FAIRFAX COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL

ADVOCATES (CASA)

HON.
GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 35th

anniversary of Fairfax Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), a

nonprofit organization that has provided direct advocacy and support to

abused and neglected children in Fairfax County's child welfare system.
Since its establishment, Fairfax CASA has made an immeasurable impact

on the lives of these children.
Fairfax CASA plays a crucial role by vetting, training, and

supervising community volunteers who are appointed by the Fairfax

County Juvenile Domestic Relations District Court to represent the best

interests of children in open abuse and neglect cases.
Over the last 35

years, the organization has trained nearly 1,900 volunteers, serving

almost 9,000 children since its inception in 1989.
The vision to bring CASA to Fairfax County began with Judge Jane

Delbridge, who recognized the need for neutral, dedicated advocates in

her courtroom.
After attending a 1985 conference for judges and

district attorneys, Judge Delbridge worked alongside Fairfax attorney

Carole Coile, as well as former Director of Court Services Vince

Pichcano and other court professionals, to launch the program.
Fairfax

CASA officially opened its doors in 1989, and its first child abuse

case was assigned to a Court Appointed Special Advocate on January 17

of that year.
Since then, Fairfax CASA has continued to grow, both in scope and in

the number of children it serves.
From its first year, when 37

community members volunteered and 80 children were served, to today,

where the program assists an average of 350 children annually, Fairfax

CASA has remained a vital resource for the community.
In the most

recent fiscal year, Fairfax CASA served 395 children from 230 families.
Over the course of its 35-year history, Fairfax CASA volunteers have

submitted over 10,000 comprehensive reports to the Court, ensuring that

judges are equipped with the information necessary to make decisions in

the best interests of the children.
These reports are an essential

component of the advocacy process, shining a light on the circumstances

that might otherwise go unheard in the judicial system.
Fairfax CASA's success is not just measured in the number of cases

handled but in the lasting difference it has made in the lives of

thousands of children.
The program's deep commitment to direct

advocacy, as well as its push for systemic change, has earned it the

respect and admiration of the entire child welfare community.
As Fairfax CASA celebrates 35 years of service, we are reminded of

the immense value of its mission.
Until the day comes when no child in

Fairfax County needs the services of a Court Appointed Special

Advocate, Fairfax CASA will continue to stand as a pillar of hope and

protection for the children who need it most.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Fairfax CASA

for 35 years of outstanding service and advocacy, and for its

unwavering dedication to the safety and well-being of the most

vulnerable members of our community.
