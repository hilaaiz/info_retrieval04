After hearing evidence and receiving legal instructions from the

judge, jurors enter a deliberation room.
They test one another's

recollections and assumptions and assess witness credibility.
Studies

show that, during deliberations, a jury polices itself.
Individual

jurors remind others of the obligations of their oaths and the

requirements of the law as stated by the judge.
As a new year--with a new Congress and President--is underway, it is

high time to bring courtroom reverence for truth-telling into the

government generally and the public square.
As citizens, we must demand

a commitment to the pursuit of truth from all of our public officials.
While enforcing oaths of office is a big challenge, citizens must

demand truth from public officials in all that we do.
And as public

officials, we must earn that trust by honoring our oaths.
The work of Judge Gregory Mize is exemplary in calling America back

to the bedrock quest for truth.
We owe him a debt of gratitude.
