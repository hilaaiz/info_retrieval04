a dedicated public servant and respected leader in West Valley City.
Margaret served on the city council for 18 years, always putting

families and students first.

It has helped improve academic outcomes,

encouraged stronger attendance, and given students a safe place to

Piece'' award--a heartfelt recognition of her decades of service and

the lives she's touched through education and community building.
Her example is one we should all aspire to.
