MIKE THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jim

Provenza for his exceptional career in public service and his

unwavering commitment to our community.
After 16 years of service on

the Yolo County Board of Supervisors and over 40 years working in state

and local government, Mr. Provenza will soon retire, leaving a legacy

of compassion, justice, and dedication to our community.
Born in Buffalo, New York, in 1955, and raised in San Diego, Mr.

Provenza pursued a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the

University of California, Santa Barbara, followed by a Juris Doctor

from the University of California, Davis Law School.
After graduating,

Mr. Provenza served as the Executive Director of the Legal Aid

Foundation of Santa Barbara County and as Managing Attorney for Legal

Services of Northern California.
During this time, he helped low-income

individuals gain critical access to the justice system, championing the

rights of domestic violence survivors, tenants, and victims of civil

rights violations.
Mr. Provenza then went on to serve as a counsel in the California

State Legislature, where he authored California's hate crime law and

pursued criminal justice reforms.
His tenure as Special Assistant for

the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office from 1993 to 2016 was marked

by his leadership on issues of public safety.
In this role, he worked

to combat gang violence, fraud, and abuse, while also leading

initiatives to reform the juvenile justice system, tighten

environmental protections, and improve workplace safety.
In 2009, Mr. Provenza joined the Yolo County Board of Supervisors,

where he served with distinction for 16 years, including three terms as

Chair.
Over his tenure, Mr. Provenza helped secure the funding and

approval for a new library in South Davis, advocated for the financial

stability and growth of the Yolo Crisis Nursery, and championed efforts

to allocate American Rescue Plan funds to communities most in need.
His

decisive action and sound leadership were instrumental during the

COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the protection of businesses, essential

workers, and the most vulnerable members of our community.
An advocate for environmental conservation, Mr. Provenza authored

Yolo County's Climate Resolution, setting a target for the county to

become carbon-negative by 2030.
His commitment to conservation also

extended to the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area and the Sacramento-San

Joaquin Delta, where he worked with our neighboring counties, state and

federal agencies, and local stakeholders to preserve our region's

natural resources.
Mr. Provenza's dedication to service is further exemplified by his

efforts to support older adults in Yolo County.
He co-founded and

chaired the Yolo Healthy Aging Alliance, organized the first Yolo

County Aging Summit, and has served on multiple aging and healthcare

committees.
Through these roles, he has coordinated essential services

and advocated for aging populations across the county.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our Yolo County community, I extend my

gratitude to Mr. Jim Provenza for his dedication, his integrity, and

his profound impact on our communities.
His legacy of public service

serves as an inspiration to us all, and it is fitting and proper that

we honor him here today.
