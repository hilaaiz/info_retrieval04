HONORING TOM SKILLING; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
38



Date: 2024-03-01 Volume: 170, Issue: 38 Pages: E202 - E202 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING TOM SKILLING ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of the most renowned and beloved figures in Chicago, meteorologist Tom Skilling.
Tom, a 9th Congressional District resident, has worked for 45 years on WGN-TV, enthusiastically and accurately providing weather forecasts to Chicagoland.
His lifelong passion for weather and his connection with his audience has earned him a place in the hearts and history of this city and beyond.
I am proud and honored to call him a friend.
As he embarks on his well-deserved retirement and starts his next chapter, we offer our sincerest gratitude for bringing his sunshine to our TV screens for decades.
I commend Tom Skilling for his unrelenting and contagious dedication to the weather.
As a boy growing up on the East Coast, he studied weather maps purchased with his allowance.
Tom moved to Aurora, Illinois in 7th grade and brought with him a passion for meteorology so strong he had to share it with the world.
At only 14 years old, Tom gave the forecast on the local radio station WKKD before attending class at West Aurora High School.
Upon completing his studies in meteorology and journalism at the University of Wisconsin, Tom embarked on a career that made him a Chicago area legend.
Joining the team at WGN-TV, Tom accomplished what no other did before him--he didn't just say what the weather was, he told us why it was happening.
Bringing a level of accessibility and authenticity like no other, Tom connected with viewers' hearts and minds.
Tom's last day on the air brought a 70-degree day in February, followed by rain and strong winds and a steep drop in temperatures.
Tom speaks with tremendous knowledge and gravitas about climate change science, and the dangers of not acting to protect our planet.
He has travelled across the country, including to Washington, to talk about ``climate disruption,'' and led a special series on WGN called Forecast--A Fragile Climate.
He speaks about climate change frequently.
I know first hand, since we participated together in a climate change forum several years ago.
He has and earned honorary doctorates at universities and colleges, but I'm sure none of those mean as much to Tom as the love and admiration of the millions of viewers who have trusted him to tell them about their weather and their environment for the last 45 years.
As his next chapter arrives Tom's lifetime love for weather persists.
We are grateful for Tom's dedication and contribution to this city, and he will always be revered as Chicago's weatherman. ____________________
