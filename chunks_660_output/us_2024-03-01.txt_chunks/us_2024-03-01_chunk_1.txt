Mr. Speaker, as this year's Black History Month ends, I rise today to honor two District of Columbia residents who have made tremendous contributions to civil rights, Walter Fauntroy and Robin Williams.
Walter Fauntroy served as a key organizer alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., helping to organize the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965.
Walter was also a noted lobbyist for civil rights, where he played a pivotal role in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.
Walter's efforts during this critical period were key to ushering in a new era of progress and possibility for all Americans.
Walter was also the second Delegate to the House of Representatives from the District of Columbia, a position he held for almost 20 years.
During his tenure in Congress, Walter was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and a champion for D.C. home rule.
Robin Williams is an associate director at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and a member of the National Board of Directors of the NAACP.
Robin joined UFCW as an employee at the Georgetown Safeway in 1986 and was elected International Vice President in 2015.
As a labor organizer, Robin was a lead coordinator for the ``Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride,'' which brought together tens of thousands of immigrant workers and immigrant rights activists for a tour throughout the United States to demand respect for immigrant workers' rights.
Robin also serves as an Executive Vice President of the UFCW Minority Coalition and is a trustee on the board of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists.
Robin is also a noted community activist.
Some of Robin's local contributions include developing the D.C. Workers' Rights Board and D.C. Jobs With Justice.
Robin has been recognized by the AFL-CIO Washington Metropolitan Central Labor Council for her impact on the National Capital Region.
Again, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring Walter Fauntroy and Robin Williams. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, it is encouraging that America's valued European allies are facing the Dictators with Rule of Gun invading Democracies with Rule of Law.
The Axis of Evil war criminal Putin, the regime in Tehran, and the Chinese Communist Party are being recognized for their murderous conduct and threats.
Last week I served on bipartisan delegations to Munich, Nurernberg, and Vienna.
The Munich Security Conference delegation was led by Chairman Mike Turner with Ranking Member Jim Himes.
For 60 years, the Conference has been an extraordinary forum for world leaders to provide their policies with many side meetings.
Opening day was gruesomely coincided with the announcement of the assassination of Alexey Navalny by war criminal Putin.
His widow Yulia Navalnaya courageously spoke to proclaim the efforts to resist Putin's oppression of the Russian people will continue.
