GLEN STEPHENS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Glen Stephens for his dedicated service to the Kern County community and to congratulate him on his well-earned retirement from the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District.
Mr. Glen Stephens' career in air quality control and passion for public health began more than thirty years ago when he became an Air Quality Engineer for the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District.
In 1992, he joined the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District and two years later, returned to work for Eastern Kern County.
In 2012, Mr. Stephens was appointed to serve as Air Pollution Control Officer by the Eastern Kern Air Pollution Control District Board.
During his tenure as Air Pollution Control Officer, Mr. Stephens has worked to expand the Tehachapi field office to solve staff members and the District's Board of Directors, deployed additional air monitors throughout Kern County to improve air quality, and advocated for cost-of-living wage increases for his staff.
Mr. Stephens has also used his expertise to help numerous solar projects navigate the rulemaking and permitting processes.
Throughout his career, Mr. Stephens has been steadfast in his commitment to promoting clean air for all residents of the community.
He has used his decades of experience to support rural communities and work with local stakeholders to address complex air quality issues and find common sense solutions.
He has also strived to engage community members on the importance of air quality and preserving the character of rural communities across the Valley.
His dedication to his colleagues, his work, and his community is a true testament to his character.
I know that his service to our Central Valley community will have a lasting impact for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Mr. Glen Stephens for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy and well-deserved retirement. ____________________
