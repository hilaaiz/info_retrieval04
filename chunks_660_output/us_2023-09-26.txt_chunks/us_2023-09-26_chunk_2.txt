Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the Clemenceau Heritage Museum for their unwavering dedication to preserving the rich history of Arizona's Verde Valley.
Originally opened in November 1991 through the efforts of the Verde Historical Society, the museum showcases artifacts and pieces of historical significance that are indicative of the rich heritage of both our district and state.
Since 1991, the members of the Verde Historical Society have been committed to ensuring that our community's history is honored and maintained through the museum's educational services to the public.
The Verde Historical Society's vision made the museum a reality and their continued faithfulness enables the history of Verde Valley to be appreciated by all residents of the valley today.
The countless hours they devote to the upkeep of the museum is commendable, and through their work, the history of the region is kept alive.
The Museum's exhibits and displays have blessed our community with a steady reminder of where we came from and the factors, including mining, ranching, and farming, that empowered our society and economy to prosper.
I applaud the Verde Historical Society for their commitment to presenting the history of the region and for carrying the torch necessary for current and future generations to enjoy and benefit from our heritage.
