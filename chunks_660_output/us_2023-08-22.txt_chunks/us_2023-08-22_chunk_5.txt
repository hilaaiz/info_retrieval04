RECOGNIZING THE 5th ANNIVERSARY OF PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP ASSOCIATION; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-08-22 Volume: 169, Issue: 138 Pages: E787 - E787 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 5th ANNIVERSARY OF PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP ASSOCIATION ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. GOLDMAN of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Parent Child Relationship Association (PCR) on the occasion of its 5th anniversary.
PCR is a volunteer run nonprofit organization that rose to the challenge to provide essential services to some of the most vulnerable residents of New York's Congressional District 10.
The South Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park and its neighboring Dyker Height and Bensonhurst are home to New York's fastest growing Chinese immigrant community.
The influx of the immigrant population invigorated local cultural and economic life, and it also brought great needs for social services.
Nicole Huang established PCR in 2018, after having successfully organized local immigrant parents and youths to volunteer for community improvement projects and to provide mutual assistance.
In the 5 years since, PCR has expanded rapidly, becoming an essential service provider for Chinese-speaking community members that are in need of culturally competent services in Sunset Park.
Every year, hundreds of volunteers contribute countless hours through PCR to provide services that benefit many thousands that are in need.
In addition to promoting civic engagement and providing essential social services, PCR also organizes community mental health workshops and steadfastly champions mental health awareness for youths, mothers and the elderly.
When the COVID-19 pandemic devastated New York City in 2020, PCR stepped up to serve when the community fell into crisis.
From collecting PPE donation and distributing them to hospitals and senior centers, to managing a weekly community food pantry, to assisting the victims of multiple devastating fires in Sunset Park who faced threat of homelessness in the middle of the pandemic, Nicole Huang and her volunteers were always on the frontline serving and uplifting the most vulnerable.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the ongoing work of PCR for the Chinese immigrant community of Brooklyn.
It has made a significant contribution in making New York the vibrant city of immigrants and diverse cultures that exemplifies the promise of the United States and the American Dream. ____________________
