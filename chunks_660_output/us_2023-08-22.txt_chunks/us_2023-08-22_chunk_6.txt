ELBRIDGE BRUBAKER ______ of wyoming in the house of representatives Ms. HAGEMAN.
Mr. Speaker, respect for one's neighbors and service to one's community are the values that have built this great Nation.
However, solitary acts of kindness and assistance were not nearly enough for Dr. Elbridge Brubaker who throughout his entire career consistently made it his goal to improve the quality of someone's day.
Dr. Brubaker was a born and raised Wyomingite who always recognized his lifelong dream to become a physician.
He would later realize that dream after completing his education at the University of Wyoming in 1961 and obtaining his medical degree from the University of Tennessee in 1965.
Upon graduating with his medical degree, he made the decision to serve our country in the Army as the Chief Medical Officer in Montgomery, Alabama, where he was responsible for performing physicals of potential recruits.
Following his time in the Army, Dr. Brubaker returned to Casper, Wyoming, and opened a family medical practice that he operated for over 5 decades.
His exceptional ability to provide compassionate care was valued by each and every 1 of his patients.
However, most importantly, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather who valued time with his family and the good Lord above all else.
Dr. Brubaker's kindness and expertise have undoubtedly left a powerful mark on the community of Casper and in the hearts of everyone who knew him.
TRIBUTE TO STANLEY (STAN) SLOSS; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-08-22 Volume: 169, Issue: 138 Pages: E788 - E788 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO STANLEY (STAN) SLOSS ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Mr. NEGUSE.
Mr. Speaker, this House is well served by the many public servants who make up the ranks of congressional staff, and I want to acknowledge the passing of one such public servant, Stan Sloss.
Stanley, or ``Stan'' as he was known to all those who worked with and knew him, grew up in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, and spent his career serving a number of Members of the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate who represented Colorado and Alaska.
He was a legislative director to former Representative David Skaggs and former Senator Mark Udall, who both, at the time Stan worked for them, represented the Second Congressional District of Colorado--a district that I am proud to represent.
Stan dedicated his life to public service having spent 37 years in various roles in Congress.
When he retired, at age 70, then Senator Mark Udall, provided a tribute to Stan in a floor speech, in which he captured the essence of what made Stan so respected and admired.
Those who had the benefit of working with Stan during his time in Congress can attest to the sentiments reflected in that tribute.
