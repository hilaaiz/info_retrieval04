Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Colleyville Heritage High School's Softball Team, who recently won the 2023 UIL Class 5A Region I championship.
This is the first time in the school history that the softball team advanced to the UIL 5A State Tournament.
On talented young women to victory.
In the regional finals they beat Northwest High School, in the third game of the round with a final score of 1 to 0.
This team has shown hard work and dedication all season and this was a well-deserved victory.
I commend this group of young women on their UIL Regional championship victory and representing the 24th Congressional District of Texas. ____________________

C2CC is devoted to promoting research, advocating for patients, and ensuring cost- efficient resources and systems that will enhance post-surgical management outcomes for dialysis, cardiac surgery, cancer, and other patients.
Kandi is a HEBISD teacher and was diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall of 2014.
After her diagnosis and treatment, she had the inclination to help other cancer patients surmount the financial and physical costs.
C2CC's first initiative was the Breast Cancer Recovery Tee Shirt, which is designed with fashion, affordability, and functionality in mind.
The nonprofit arm of C2CC works to donate free recovery kits to mastectomy patients facing financial hardship through post-surgical care.
