Spina Bifida is a birth defect which results from a hole in the

spiral cord that fails to close properly, which allows nerves and fluid

to form a sac outside the body.
This defect means that a child must

undergo dozens of surgeries before adulthood, and even then, they face

a multitude of mental and physical health issues.
Each condition is

unique, and no two children will be affected the same way.
In a testament to the innovation and research of our American

scientific ingenuity, we now have the first generation of adults who

are living with Spina Bifida.
However, there is still much work to do.
It is our obligation to ensure proper funding for Spina Bifida care

and research so that treatment and quality of life can improve for all

Americans with this condition.

HON.
VINCENTE GONZALEZ

Mr. VINCENTE GONZALES of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, due to a family matter,

I was not present to vote on Roll Call No.
528.
Had I been present, I

would have voted YEA on Roll Call No.
528.
I stand firm in my support

for our ally, Israel, and the Jewish community amidst the ongoing

conflict.
I condemn the atrocities committed by Hamas and other

terrorists and support additional appropriations so that Israel may

defend itself.
