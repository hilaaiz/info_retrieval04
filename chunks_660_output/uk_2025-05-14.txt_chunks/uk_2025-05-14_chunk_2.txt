On this day, we

recognize the legacy of service, sacrifice, and strength that defines

the Hmong American experience.
From 1961 to 1975, more than 40,000 Hmong men and boys--many under

the age of 18--were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to

fight in the Secret War in Laos, a critical but often overlooked

chapter of the Vietnam War.
Fighting alongside American forces, Hmong

soldiers risked everything to defend freedom and combat the spread of

communism in Southeast Asia.
Following the end of the war, they and

their families faced persecution and displacement, forcing thousands to

flee Laos.
On May 14, 1975, the final airlift evacuated Hmong soldiers and their

families from Laos to refugee camps in Thailand.
From there, many

resettled in the United States, including in California's Central

Valley, where they rebuilt their lives with determination and hope.
Today, communities like Clovis, Fresno, and Sacramento are home to some

of the largest and most vibrant Hmong populations in the country.
These

families have contributed to the fabric of American society in

countless ways by serving as educators, healthcare professionals,

entrepreneurs, public servants, and community leaders.
We especially honor the Hmong veterans and their families, whose

courage and loyalty to the United States must never be forgotten.
Their

stories remind us of the price of freedom and the enduring strength of

the human spirit.
I commend the County of Fresno, the City of Clovis, and other local

governments for formally recognizing Hmong American Day and paying

tribute to the history, culture, and contributions of the Hmong people.
I join them in encouraging all Americans to learn more about this rich

legacy and to celebrate the extraordinary impact of Hmong Americans on

our communities and our country.

Mrs. RADEWAGEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the

Polynesian Association of Alaska (PAOA), a non-profit organization that

Over the span of two decades,

this organization has committed itself to educating Pacific Islanders

Hansen.
This non-profit entity was formally established and registered

in the City of Anchorage and the State of Alaska on February 1, 2005,

and achieved 501(c)(3) status on June 16, 2006.
Since its

establishment, it has functioned as the leading organization for the

Pacific Island community in Alaska from 2005 to 2025.
PAOA's mission is to empower and educate individuals and families

while promoting pride and acceptance of all cultures and instilling the

best values they embody.
The organization currently has 53 registered

members and 19 Board Members.
Their vision is to ensure that the

Pacific Island community in Alaska and beyond receives support in

education, employment, and cultural enrichment.
I want to thank the

group for their continued dedication to Polynesian cultural and

community values in Alaska and for their contributions to the Pacific

Islands region at large.
