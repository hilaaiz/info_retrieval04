HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

Ms. Angela Y. Carson, a dedicated leader and community advocate, for

her outstanding service as Executive Director of Pine Grove

Association, Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Canton,

Mississippi.
Founded in 1992 by Rufus and Aggie Carson, Pine Grove Association has

been a cornerstone of the Canton community for over three decades.
The

organization is rooted in a mission of empowering individuals and

families by fostering mobility, advocating for social justice, and

promoting diversity and inclusion.
Under Ms. Carson's visionary leadership, Pine Grove Association

continues to offer impactful programs and services that serve both

youth and adults.
Among these is the Madison Area Global Innovation

Collaborative (MAGIC), a transformative initiative designed to promote

global learning opportunities for middle school students.
Through

education and innovation, MAGIC equips the next generation with the

skills, values, and global perspective necessary for success in an

increasingly interconnected world.
The mission of Pine Grove Association--to empower individuals through

value-centered leadership, talent development, and community well-

being--remains steadfast.
Ms. Carson has further advanced this mission

by exploring cutting-edge strategies, including the integration of

artificial intelligence (AI) to scale the organization's operations.
Her goals include developing a scalable business model, optimizing

internal processes through AI applications, and preparing for future

funding through AI-driven data analysis.
Ms. Carson's commitment to innovation and equity in community

building exemplifies the forward-thinking leadership that uplifts and

transforms lives.

HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF DETROIT MEMORIAL PARK

HON.
RASHIDA TLAIB

Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors

the 100th anniversary of Detroit Memorial Park, Michigan's oldest

Black-owned cemetery and a beacon of dignity, justice, and community

for generations.
Founded in 1925 by visionary Black leaders Charles C. Diggs, Sr.
and

Aaron C. Toodle, Detroit Memorial Park was born out of necessity, at a

time when Black families in Detroit were denied basic dignity in

burial.
These trailblazers cleared sacred ground where all people,

regardless of race or faith, could be laid to rest with respect.
From offering fresh vegetables to families during the Depression to

providing low-cost transportation for mourners, Detroit Memorial Park

has always led with care and compassion.
Today, with cemeteries in

Warren, Redford, and Flint, they continue this legacy across over 170

acres.
As we celebrate this historic milestone, I offer my deepest

gratitude to Detroit Memorial Park for a century of unwavering service

and dignity.
The 12th District honors the Detroit Memorial Park and celebrates

this momentous occasion for our community.

HONORING THE HMONG AMERICAN COMMUNITY

HON.
VINCE FONG

Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Hmong American

community and commemorate May 14, 2025, as Hmong American Day, marking

50 years since the first Hmong families began their journey to the

United States following the fall of Long Cheng in 1975.
On this day, we

recognize the legacy of service, sacrifice, and strength that defines

the Hmong American experience.
From 1961 to 1975, more than 40,000 Hmong men and boys--many under

the age of 18--were recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency to

fight in the Secret War in Laos, a critical but often overlooked

chapter of the Vietnam War.
Fighting alongside American forces, Hmong

soldiers risked everything to defend freedom and combat the spread of

communism in Southeast Asia.
