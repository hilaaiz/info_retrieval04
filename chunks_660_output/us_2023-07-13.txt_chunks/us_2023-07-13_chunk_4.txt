Bruce was a passionate and dedicated public servant who believed deeply in CRS's mission to provide Congress with authoritative, non-partisan and intelligent analysis.
Bruce brought deep historical understanding of the region.
He advised Congress on the most important issues of the day, but never stopped thinking ahead.
From early in his career, Bruce anticipated the importance of the Indian Ocean region and Oceania to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific.
Given the importance of the region to my constituents, Bruce was a valuable resource to me and my legislative staff in preparing for official travel, welcoming high-level delegations from the region and organizing briefings.
Even after Bruce's passing, staff and Members will continue to rely on his written analysis and expertise.
I offer my sincere condolences to Bruce's family, friends and colleagues at the Congressional Research Service, and hope they may take comfort in the knowledge of his indelible and ongoing contribution to the work of Congress.
Congress has lost a distinguished public servant.
I thank Bruce and honor his life and his work. ____________________
HONORING DAWN HELMS STEGALL; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 120 Pages: E673 - E673 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAWN HELMS STEGALL ______ of north carolina in the house of representatives Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate Union County Public Schools teacher, Dawn Helms Stegall, on her retirement after 48 years of serving Union County's students and families.
Dawn graduated from Piedmont High School in the class of 1972 before attending both Wingate University for a degree in history, and Meredith College for a degree in social studies and secondary education.
In 1975, Dawn started her teaching career at UCPS at Sun Valley, where she taught history for 10 years.
She accepted a job at her alma mater, Piedmont High School, where she taught history for the next 38 years.
She was named UCPS Teacher of the Year for the 1989-1990 academic year and was later named the Region IV Teacher of the Year.
Year after year, Dawn's students register among the highest scores for AP U.S. History.
Dawn's dedicated leadership in the classroom has inspired several of her students to further study history and return to teach in the UCPS system.
Dawn's years of service to the UCPS community also extends far beyond the classroom.
Dawn helped start the Piedmont Barbecue in 1986 and continued every year until 2019.
Over these years, the Barbecue has raised more than one hundred thousand dollars for Piedmont High students.
It is clear, Dawn is the epitome of servant leadership.
Once again, on behalf of the entire 8th Congressional District of North Carolina, I rise to congratulate Dawn Helms Stegall on a successful career and a well-deserved recognition for her years of dedicated service to Union County. ____________________
