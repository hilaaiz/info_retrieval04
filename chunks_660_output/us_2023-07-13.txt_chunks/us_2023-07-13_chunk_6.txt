Since arriving in Washington, DC in 1980, Sister Richelle has been a passionate champion and a tireless advocate for all Americans most in need.
For more than 30 years Sister Richelle has focused her energies and commitment to expanding opportunities for people experiencing poverty and other vulnerable populations.
She fought for justice through her years of work at NETWORK, a Catholic Social Justice Lobby, the McAuley Institute, the Children's Defense Fund, and the Coalition on Human Needs.
As the founder and leader of the SAVE for All Campaign (Strengthening America's Values and Economy for All), Sister Richelle has been a driving force for better public policy and an essential educator for Members on human needs programs, which is key in promoting and enacting good public policy.
Over the years, I have been proud to work with Sister Richelle Friedman on programs of mutual interest and concern.
She has been a tireless champion of meeting human needs through investments in housing and programs to reduce poverty and hunger.
She has been a strong voice of conscience, urging Congress towards equity, demanding that the rich and corporate interests pay their fair share of taxes and do not profit unfairly from government contracts.
Sister Richelle has unfailingly conveyed reliable evidence that increasing tax credits for low- and moderate-income families, expanding access to food assistance and health insurance, ensuring justice for immigrants, and building economic opportunity for all are investments that help our nation move forward, leaving no one behind.
Through her decades of advocacy, she has helped members of Congress understand that increased wages, family supports such as childcare and paid leave, adequate retirement benefits and civil rights protections are the goals we must reach, no matter how long it takes.
As a stalwart defender of the needs of those experiencing poverty, Sister Richelle has earned the praise of fellow advocacy organizations, the respect of ideological opponents, and the friendship of many of us on Capitol Hill.
I am honored to have this opportunity to stand today and pay tribute to Sister Richelle Friedman for her hard work and thank her for her commitment to social justice.
She has left an indelible mark and set a standard of compassion, service, and advocacy to which we should all strive. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 120 Pages: E674 - E674 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF DR.
PATTI LISK ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Dr. Patti Liski, Dean of Nursing and Health Technologies at Germanna Community College, on a remarkable career as a nurse, educator, and community college advocate.
Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. Lisk started her career at Germanna when she joined as a nursing faculty member in 1983.
In 1986, she transitioned to full-time teaching.
During her time at Germanna, Dr. Lisk has been credited with revolutionizing the school's nursing program and building a statewide on line nursing program.
Her work writing the original grant for the purchase of human patient simulators brought cutting-edge technology to the school and kickstarted Germanna's Virtual Hospital.
In 2013, after the passing of Dean Mary Gilkey, Dr. Lisk rose to the occasion after her emergency appointment to Dean of Nursing and Health Technologies, and in that role has helped further expand the mission of Germanna's nursing program.
Dr. Lisk has also served as a fierce advocate for the promise and potential that lies within America's community colleges.
She has seized the opportunity to help students, many identifying as firstgeneration students, navigate the college process and become successful nurses.
Her personal investment in supporting students through every step of their journey is admirable and has had a profound impact on the quality of nurses graduating from Germanna.
