My colleagues and I introduced amendments and resolutions encouraging our friends and allies to adopt specific policies that reflect our work in the U.S. Congress.
Among these were texts based on the Ukraine Victory Resolution and the Holding Accountable Russian Mercenaries Act, both which I have sponsored in the House.
Furthermore, I introduced a resolution with Congressman Chris Smith on addressing the phenomena of abuse, exploitation, and human trafficking of Ukrainian women and children stemming from Russia's war.
The AssembJy overwhelmingly adopted all these U.S.-led initiatives.
Looking forward, I would like to congratulate those in the recent OSCE PA elections who will be assuming leadership duties for the coming year, while also thanking those who have ended their mandates.
First, I want to applaud the election of Mrs. Pia Kauma of Finland as President of the Assembly.
Mrs. Kauma has a long history of important contributions and strong relationships within the Assembly that will serve her well in this critical role.
Additionally, I believe it is fitting that the PA should be led someone from NATO's newest allied nation, galvanized by aggression to assume greater responsibility for European security.
I also congratulate the Assembly's three newly elected Vice Presidents: Mrs. Daniela De Ridder of Germany, Mr. Mykyta Poturaiev

of Ukraine, and Mr. Kyriakos Hadjiyianni of Cyprus.
I am especially delighted by the selection of Mr. Poturaiev whose voice has become the conscience of the Assembly since the outbreak of Russia's full-scale invasion of his country last year.
It is important to have greater Ukrainian representation in the Assembly's upper ranks.
I also extend my congratulations to the newly elected Treasurer, Mr.Johan Buser of Sweden, and officers of the three general committees: First Committee Chair, Mr. Richard Hudson of the United States, First Committee Vice-Chair Mr. Costel Neculai Dunava of Romania, First Committee Rapporteur Mr. Laurynas Kasciunas of Lithuania, Second Committee Chair Mr. Azay Guliyev of Azerbaijan, Second Committee Vice- Chair Mr. Artur Gerasymov of Ukraine, Second Committee Rapporteur Mrs. Gudrun Kugler of Austria, Third Committee Chair Mrs. Lucie Potuckova of the Czech Republic, Third Committee Vice-Chair Mr. Sargis Khandanyan of Armenia, and Third Committee Rapporteur Mr. Malik Ben Achour of Belgium.
Finally, I thank outgoing President Margareta Cederfelt of Sweden for her two years of tireless service to the Assembly, which involved capably leading the organization through the twin crises of COVID-19 and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
This team of elected officers that span the European continent and the political spectrum are assuming office at a critical time for transatlantic and global security.
I look forward to cooperating with them closely in the coming year, particularly as I assume the responsibility of Head of Delegation for the United States in 2024.
I want to express my deep appreciation to our Canadian hosts at the Annual Session in Vancouver, British Columbia, especially Dr. Hedy Fry, Head of the Canadian Delegation, who demonstrated tremendous hospitality and outstanding organization in orchestrating this large and complex event.
The natural beauty, personal warmth, and cultural diversity we experienced in Vancouver made for an ideal setting for our meeting.
