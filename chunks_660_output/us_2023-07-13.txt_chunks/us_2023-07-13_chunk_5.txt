Deputy Durm was well liked and respected by all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Described by his colleagues and friends as genuine, courteous, and sincere, Deputy Durm always had a smile and joke to brighten someone's day.
A shining example of what it means to serve and protect, Deputy Durm worked in the Marion County Sheriff's department for 38 years, alongside his wife.
Inspired by their service, 1 of their sons is currently training at the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy.
Our community mourns the loss of a brave and selfless man who was dedicated to his family and the community he served.
He lived out his values every day.
Deputy Durm's legacy of service and friendship will be remembered by family, community members, and his Marion County Sheriff's Office coworkers.
Today, I solemnly ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Deputy John Durm and his loved ones. ____________________

Throughout his life, he has taken on many roles, including that of husband, father, grandfather, and great grandfather.
In 1944, he married Ms. Dorothy Murtha, and became the father of 4 wonderful children, Barbara, Diane, Douglas, and David.
Over the years, his family has continued to grow, and now includes 11 grandchildren and 22 great grandchildren.
In 2006, Mr. Smith married Gretta Woodward, a fellow veteran of WWII.
Mr. Smith's service was, and remains, essential to maintaining the freedoms we as Americans are so fortunate to enjoy.
Again, I thank him for his dedication and commitment to the United States of America.
Every American owes a debt of gratitude to him.
His dedication and courage in uniform helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of this Nation and all the people in it.
Happy Birthday to Mr. Francis Albert Smith.
