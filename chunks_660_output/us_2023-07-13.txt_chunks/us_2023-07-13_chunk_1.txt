Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the achievement the historic accomplishment of the Heroes' Alliance Vehicle Technology Team, a group of high school students from our district that won the 2022 national Solar Car Challenge within their division.
Heroes' Alliance was founded in 2009 by the late Pastor Reginald M. Lane, who established the organization in response to the educational and residential climates existing in the city of Detroit at that time.
The Heroes' Alliance is a Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) program that challenges students to develop innovative technology focusing on renewable energy and automotive engineering.
Today the project serves as a capstone for students who participate in the Heroes' Alliance Cooperative Learning Center, which utilizes vehicle technology for the basis of bringing together education, innovation, and industry as students work together to design and engineer a solar vehicle.
This summer, their journey will culminate in the Solar Car Challenge, a cross-country race from Fort Worth, Texas to Palmdale, California.
The students will face rigorous tests and evaluations to demonstrate the capabilities of their solar-powered vehicle.
I am so proud of this hard-working and talented group of young people from various schools in Metro Detroit and want to congratulate them on their achievements.
Please join me in recognizing Michigan's Heroes' Alliance Vehicle Technology Team, as we cheer them on to victory. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, last week I was grateful to serve as part of the leadership of the U.S. delegation to the 30th Annual Session of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in Vancouver, Canada.
There, I was joined by several of my Helsinki Commission colleagues, including Co-Chairman Sen. Ben Cardin and Ranking Members Rep. Steve Cohen and Sen. Roger Wicker.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) is a forum that gathers hundreds of parliamentarians from 56 participating States of the OSCE several times a year to discuss the most pressing issues facing the transatlantic community.
The Annual Session is the centerpiece of the Assembly's work and is the one time a year when parliamentarians meet to debate, amend, and adopt resolutions on a range of topics as well as elect the Assembly's leadership.
Participating in the OSCE PA is an opportunity to demonstrate the American leadership on the world stage.
Over the course of this Annual Session, we shared our diverse views, but our overwhelming message was about the unified, bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress for Ukraine in its fight to defend its democracy and sovereignty against flagrant Russian aggression.
Our friends in Canada and Europe deeply appreciated this reassurance of America's resolve.
The U.S. delegation participated in bilateral meetings with parliamentary delegations from Ukraine, Canada, and Germany, as well as a visiting delegation of legislators from the Western Hemisphere.
My colleagues and I introduced amendments and resolutions encouraging our friends and allies to adopt specific policies that reflect our work in the U.S. Congress.
Among these were texts based on the Ukraine Victory Resolution and the Holding Accountable Russian Mercenaries Act, both which I have sponsored in the House.
Furthermore, I introduced a resolution with Congressman Chris Smith on addressing the phenomena of abuse, exploitation, and human trafficking of Ukrainian women and children stemming from Russia's war.
