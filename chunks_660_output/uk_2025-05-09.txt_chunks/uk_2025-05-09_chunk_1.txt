DHS RESTRICTIONS ON CONFUCIUS INSTITUTES AND CHINESE ENTITIES OF

CONCERN ACT

speech of

HON.
BETTY McCOLLUM

Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 881, the DHS

Restrictions on Confucius Institutes and Chinese Entities of Concern

Act.
H.R. 881 is a solution in search of a problem.
In 2018, Congress

passed provisions prohibiting the Department of Defense from providing

funds to any U.S. institution of higher education that hosts a

Confucius Institute, unless that institution receives a waiver from the

Department.
Since its passage, no waivers have been issued, and the

number of Confucius Institutes in the United States has declined from a

peak of 118 in 2017 to fewer than five today.
The current protections

against Chinese intellectual property theft through Confucius

Institutes have worked, and Congress should not place additional

burdens on our colleges, universities, and their students.
Mr. Speaker, instead of addressing the harms of the President's on-

again-off-again tariffs, or working to address rising costs for

American consumers, Republicans used this week to negotiate their

Reckless Budget Scheme and rename a body of water.
My constituents do

not want Congress to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts to

billionaires.
They do not want cuts to SNAP or Medicaid, vital

lifelines in my home state of Minnesota.
It's time Congress starts

working to address the real issues--starting with passing full year

appropriations bills.
I am ready to get to work.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DIANE RAULSTON

HON.
EUGENE SIMON VINDMAN

Mr. VINDMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary

life and service of Diane Raulston, a devoted public servant, community

leader, and advocate for education in Prince William County, Virginia.
Diane Raulston served the residents of the Neabsco District with

distinction on the Prince William County School Board from 2015 to

2023.
Throughout her years of service, she was a passionate and

determined advocate for public education, promoting efforts to raise

teacher pay, close opportunity gaps, and create a more equitable,

student-centered school system.
Under Diane Raulston's leadership.
the school division made

meaningful strides: graduation rates rose, access to pre-kindergarten

expanded, and Career and Technical Education programs grew

significantly.
Her steady support helped guide the opening of nine new

schools to meet the demands of a growing student population, ensuring

that every child had a safe and welcoming place to learn.
Beyond her official role, Diane was known for her kindness,

determination, and unwavering belief in the power of public education

to uplift communities.
She listened, she acted, and she made a

difference in countless lives.
Her legacy is not only visible in the

buildings and programs she helped establish, but also in the spirit of

service she inspired in others.
As we remember Diane Raulston, we celebrate a life lived in service

to others, a life marked by integrity, compassion, and impact.
Her

passing is a profound loss for our community, but her contributions

will endure for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Diane

Raulston's remarkable life.
May her legacy of service and her devotion

to educational equity continue to inspire and guide our efforts.

HONORING U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENT TRAVIS W. SALO

HON.
MICHAEL BAUMGARTNER

Mr. BAUMGARTNER.
Mr. Speaker, behind every badge is a story, a

family, and a heart committed to service.
I rise today with a heavy

heart to honor the life of Border Patrol Agent Travis W. Salo, who

tragically passed on April 25th in an off-duty vehicle accident near

Metaline, in Pend Oreille County.
He was just 36 years old--a life full

of promise, commitment, and courage, taken far too soon.
