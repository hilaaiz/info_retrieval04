HONORING TOM SKILLING FOR A REMARKABLE 45-YEAR CAREER

HON.
BILL FOSTER

Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today along with my

colleague, Representative Mike Quigley, to celebrate one of

Chicagoland's very own, legendary meteorologist Tom Skilling, and his

45-year career as a beloved presence on our local airwaves as he

embarks on his well-deserved retirement.
As the longtime chief meteorologist for WGN-TV, Tom Skilling has been

one of the most trusted figures on television screens throughout the

Chicago area for decades, expertly and calmly explaining the region's

often unpredictable weather situations for generations of viewers.
I am especially proud to say that Tom Skilling is an Aurora, Illinois

native, and a proud graduate of West Aurora High School.
After

completing his studies at the University of Wisconsin, Tom worked

briefly on local television stations in Madison and Milwaukee before

landing at WGN-TV, where he quickly became a daily fixture in

households throughout Chicago and the suburbs.
Those of us who know Tom and have worked with him over the course of

his career know how passionate he is about his work and how talented he

is at communicating often complex scientific data to people of all ages

and backgrounds.
But his greatest strength is the kindness with which

he treats everyone he interacts with; he is always ready to greet a fan

with a warm smile and meaningful conversation.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me in

celebrating Tom Skilling and his decades of service to the Chicagoland

community and offer him our most sincere best wishes on the next

chapter of his life.
