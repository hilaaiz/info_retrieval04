RECOGNIZING JONI EARECKSON TADA WHO SHE LEADS AMERICA IS HONORING AS A

CHRISTIAN WOMEN OF DISTINCTION RECIPIENT

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female

leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as

``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in

Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics

for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired

by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering

dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the

women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought

great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both a sacred and

constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the

defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard

religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve

never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Joni Eareckson Tada,

is a hero to many.
In 1967, Joni was left paralyzed by a diving

accident but quickly emerged from rehabilitation, determined to help

others who have similar disabilities.
Her autobiography, Joni, has been

adapted into a film and was also translated into 15 different

languages.
Today, she serves as the CEO of Joni and Friends, which

serves to assist those who are disabled and in need of assistance.
Through this organization, Joni has delivered over 220,000 wheelchairs

in developing nations and has hosted over 64,000 families at Family

Retreats and Getaways.
Joni also had the unique opportunity to serve

her country on the National Council on Disability during the passage of

the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Mr. Speaker, these women, including Joni, have left an indelible mark

on countless lives.
They are pioneers whose examples have--and will

continue to--inspire many.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each of

them for their unwavering dedication.
This honor is truly well-

deserved.
