LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female

leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as

``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in

Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics

for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired

by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering

dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the

women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought

great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and

constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the

defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard

religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve

never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Dr. Susan Michael, is

the Director of the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem and a

member of its board.
Susan's studies and travel to Israel over the past

45 years have allowed her to skillfully handle a variety of issues

regarding biblical and modern Israel.
To that end, Susan is a

remarkably gifted author, teacher, and speaker.
She has produced highly

cited articles, podcasts, and educational resources, serving many

throughout the world.
Mr. Speaker, these women, including Dr. Michael, have left an

indelible mark on countless lives.
They are pioneers whose examples

have--and will continue to--inspire many.
I extend my heartfelt

gratitude to each of them for their unwavering dedication.
This honor

is truly well-deserved.
