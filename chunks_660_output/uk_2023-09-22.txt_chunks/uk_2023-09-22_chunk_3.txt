While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in

Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics

for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired

by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering

dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the

women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought

great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and

constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the

defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard

religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I

serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Charmaine Hedding, is

a global development manager in the non-profit sector.
In this role,

she focuses on the protection of Christians and other minorities in the

Middle East and Africa.
A fierce proponent of religious freedom, she

has also assisted in many humanitarian projects, including the

evacuation of over 9,000 people from Afghanistan.
Today, she also

consults for government agencies, authorities, and faith-based

organizations.
Mr. Speaker, these women, including Charmaine, have left an indelible

mark on countless lives.
They are pioneers whose examples have--and

will continue to--inspire many.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each

of them for their unwavering dedication.
This honor is truly well-

deserved.
