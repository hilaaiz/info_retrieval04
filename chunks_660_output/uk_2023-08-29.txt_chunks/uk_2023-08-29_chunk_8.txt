GREG STANTON

Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my departing Chief of

Staff, Seth Scott, for his years of service to the people of Arizona's

Fourth Congressional District.
It's a bittersweet day.
Seth has worked

with me for more than a decade--half of that here in the House.
I often

say hiring him was the best career decision I've ever made.
Few have as broad experience in government, law, media and politics.
He cut his teeth in the Arizona Governor's office, Congress, and local

government and ran several important political campaigns before

returning to Arizona State University for law school.
At the City of

Phoenix and here in Congress, Seth has led my office with a steady

hand.
His acumen while serving as my Chief of Staff was always in clear

view, and all the accomplishments we achieved would not have been

possible without him at the helm.
His fierce intellect, sharp political instincts and deep policy

expertise have made him an invaluable and sought-after adviser.
But it's his loyalty, integrity and a work ethic second to none that

have endeared Seth to all who have worked with and under him.
As deftly

as he's handled complex legislative matters, he has also cultivated and

mentored a generation of young staffers.
Seth has the talent and determination to succeed anywhere he

chooses--but the people of Arizona are fortunate that he has chosen to

devote his career to serving his community.
He has been a great friend and trusted confidant of mine, and he will

continue to be well after he departs--though perhaps with a few less

late-night and early morning phone calls.
I wish him all the best as he

takes on this new challenge.
