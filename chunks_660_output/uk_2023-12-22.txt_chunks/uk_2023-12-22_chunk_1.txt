COMMEMORATING THE CITY OF RICHMOND HEIGHTS

HON.
CORI BUSH

Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to commemorate the 110th

anniversary of the City of Richmond Heights, located in Missouri's

First District.
Richmond Heights was incorporated on December 29, 1913

with just 18 families residing in the area.
Since then, the population

has grown to 9,286.
Richmond Heights has been home to many Missourians who brought the

joys of art and music to St. Louis, such as jazz singer Mae Wheeler,

rock-n-roll legend Chuck Berry, artist Ernest Trova, gospel singer

Doris Fiddmont Frazier, architect Henry Hampton, and filmmaker Henry

Hampton Jr. Moreover, Richmond Heights is home to many impactful social

justice advocates such as Dr. Thomas E. Rusan, Jr., Georgia Tallier

Rusan, and Rev. James E. Fiddmont.
It is also home to one of the most

recognizable voices in St. Louis, the legendary sports commentator,

Jack Buck.
Richmond Heights enriches Missouri's First District with community

institutions such as the Esquire Theater, Tropicana Lanes, SSM Health

St. Mary's Hospital, the Saint Louis Galleria, and the Boulevard.
It

includes four school districts: the Maplewood Richmond Heights School

District, Clayton School District, Brentwood School District and Ladue

School District, as well as Little Flower, Immaculata School, and the

International Schoolhouse.
As the Congresswoman for Missouri's First District, I congratulate

the residents of Richmond Heights and their current leadership,

including Mayor Jim Thomson and Councilmembers Lisa Eppert, Greg

Vescovo, Reginald Finney, Maurice Muia, Megan Moylan, Ashley Metcalf,

Danny Hebenstreit and Scott Huston on 110 fruitful years.
Here's to 110

more.
