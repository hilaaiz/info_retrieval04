COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF NANCY FAYE CARLOW

HON.
PAT FALLON

Mr. FALLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Mrs.

Nancy Faye Carlow of Nash, Texas, who peacefully passed away on January

13, 2024.
Mrs. Carlow was a loving wife, mother, and grandmother.
Mrs. Carlow was born on April 27, 1944, in Maud, Texas, to H.J.

``Scooter'' and Hazel Smith.
From a young age, she was known for being

an academically gifted student.
In 1962, Mrs. Carlow graduated from

Maud High School as the valedictorian.
She later received a bachelor's

degree from Stephen F. Austin State University and a master's degree

from East Texas State University.
After graduation, Mrs. Carlow briefly

taught home economics and worked as an elementary school teacher before

becoming a bookkeeper for Dairyland Farms and Texarkana Tractor.
Mrs. Carlow was a devoted woman of faith and was a lifetime member of

the Maud United Methodist Church.
While there, she taught Sunday school

and led the Methodist Youth Fellowship church group for ten years.
Mrs.

Carlow was always a thoughtful woman who sought to put a smile on your

face.
Along with her husband James, she hosted daily happy hours for

friends and loved ones so they could spend quality time together during

the pandemic.
She also started a weekly tradition of sending flowers to

others so that they wouldn't feel alone.
You could always count on her

to help guide you throughout life and encourage you to do the right

thing.
Mrs. Carlow's tragic passing leaves behind a legacy of hard

work, entrepreneurship, and family values that can never be replaced.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's

Capitol in recognition of Mrs. Carlow's beautiful and uplifting life.
She will be dearly missed by her friends, family, and all who knew her.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PITTMAN-ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESOTRATION ACT AND

DINGELL-JOHNSON SPORT FISH RESTORATION ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

EQUALITY ACT

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pittman-Robertson

Wildlife Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act

District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make the District of

Columbia eligible for the same federal funding as states under the

Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson

Sport Fish Restoration Act.
D.C. residents pay full federal taxes and

therefore D.C. is treated as a state under federal programs, with

limited exceptions, most of them simply oversights or failures to

update post-home rule.
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act provides funding,

derived from excise taxes on sporting equipment, for five distinct

purposes: program administration, wildlife restoration, basic hunter

education and safety, enhanced hunter education and safety grants,

and multistate conservation grants.
D.C. does not receive any funding

under this Act.
The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act provides

funding for sport fish restoration, aquatic education, wetlands

restoration, and boat-related activities.
Under this Act, states

receive a minimum of one percent of the total amount apportioned, while

D.C. is capped at one-third of one percent.
This omission and lack of parity under these Acts have serious

consequences for D.C. D.C. has roughly 7,800 acres of parkland covering

nearly a quarter of the city, which means it has more parkland per

capita than any other city in the United States.
This bill would define

``State'' in these Acts to include D.C., providing D.C. with equal

funding for wildlife conservation in our Nation's capital.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
