Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today in favor of the Conference Report on the Fiscal Year 24 NDAA.
This conference report is the result of bipartisan efforts to strengthen our national defense while supporting our military members, families, and communities.
I would like to thank Senator Reed, Senator Wicker, Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Smith for their leadership throughout the entire process to produce this bipartisan bill.
I would also like to thank Chairman Waltz of the Readiness Subcommittee for his partnership, Jeanine Womble the Readiness PSM, my MLA Rob Hurd, and my Defense Fellow Taylor Brunstad.
I am proud of the work we have done to protect the Readiness of our Armed forces.
This bill continues our work, along with our Senate colleagues, to support military families by providing more childcare centers, protect basic healthcare rights for women service members, support energy resiliency on our bases, increase base pay to retain and recruit top talent, and demand DoD accountability and transparency on spending to prevent wasteful use of taxpayer dollars.
It is of vital importance to me to support our servicemembers and their families at bases like Travis Air force Base and ensure they have the housing, training, equipment, and the quality of life they need and deserve.
I am proud to continue my work to serve the men and women in my district, and to serve the brave men and women volunteering to protect our freedom.
While this bill is a strong bipartisan effort to support the military, there is still more to be done and I look forward to building on these efforts in the years ahead. ____________________

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res.
918, Republicans' baseless attempt to distract from the ongoing criminal proceedings against former President Donald Trump.
After a year of frivolous investigations produced no evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, Republicans brought to the floor a resolution directing committees to pursue a sham impeachment inquiry.
This resolution is clearly an attempt to minimize and distract from former President Trump's high crimes and misdemeanors, during the same week that his criminal trial proceedings reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
While House Republicans have spent the year wasting time and taxpayer dollars, Democrats have delivered the votes to prevent a government shutdown--not once, but twice.
This body has a duty to keep the government functioning and open for the American people, yet Republicans time and time again have shown no interest in meeting that obligation.
As we approach the halfway point of the 118th Congress, it is clear the majority would rather spend their time distracting the American people with their extreme MAGA messaging instead of doing the serious work of legislating.
It is past time for House Republicans to start addressing the serious and urgent needs of all our constituents. ____________________
