Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 2022, the President signed into law S. 1404, which awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, known as the Ghost Army.
The Congressional Gold Medal is the oldest and highest civilian award in the United States.
I rise today to honor Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II for his contributions, sacrifices, and patriotism while serving in the Ghost Army during World War II.
Due to the unit's sworn secrecy, their service and contributions went unnoticed for far too long.
Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II was born in Mission, Texas, on November 13th, 1915.
Mr. Taylor joined the Civilian Conservation Corps.
After the outbreak of World War II, he was assigned to the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops.
This specialized unit comprised only 1,100 brave Americans and often served near the front lines.
Mr. Taylor helped conduct numerous deceptive campaigns with the Ghost Army throughout Europe.
During his service, he received a Certificate of Merit and was promoted to Sergeant Major of the Army--the highest rank possible for an enlisted soldier.
While the Ghost Army's work was secret, its impact was substantial.
The Ghost Army performed 22 ``deception missions'' across the front lines of France, Belgium, and Germany.
By simulating the movement of 30,000 service members, the Ghost Army fooled German forces and aided General Patton at several critical junctures in World War II.
It is my honor to recognize the service Sergeant Major James C. Taylor and the Ghost Army.
Their dedication and service saved thousands of American lives.
Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr. Taylor posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family and country. ____________________

'S LIFE AND LEGACY ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and accomplishments of Mr. Anthony DeWayne Baker, Sr.--a pillar of our Dallas community.
Mr. Baker was a graduate of David W. Carter High School in Dallas, Texas before rising through the ranks of Airbus helicopters.
Anthony then went back to school, graduating from Dallas Baptist University with a Bachelor's Degree in Business in 2005.
Anthony's first job was employment at Walls Services delivering sheet rock and in 1991 his career in the aerospace industry began when he landed a job working in the Bond shop at Vought Aircraft, formerly known as LTV.
However, after 3 years with his newfound skills he accepted a temporary position as a blade repairman at American Eurocopter (Airbus), and due to his hard work and determined mindset he was later offered a permanent position.
Mr. Baker eventually capped off his illustrious career as Vice President for Customer Support at Airbus Helicopters, the first African-American to hold the position.
Throughout his lifetime he overcame many barriers both personally and professionally, while always looking for ways to help others.
