In 2018, D.C. enacted a law to provide domestic partner benefits for the police and firefighters pension plan, which mirrored a law already enacted for teachers.
However, these domestic partner benefits apply only to service accrued after 1997, since the federal government funds pre-1997 benefits.
This bill would make the domestic partner benefits available for pre-1997 benefits, too.
Finally, in 2012, D.C. enacted the Equity in Survivor Benefits Amendment Act, which reduced from age 60 to 55 the age after which a surviving spouse may remarry without losing survivor benefits for those in the teachers, police, and firefighters pension plans.
However, these survivor benefits apply only to service accrued after 1997, since the federal government funds pre-1997 benefits.
This bill would bring those pre-1997 benefits in line with both the post-1997 benefits and the retirement benefits for federal employees in the Civil Service Retirement System or FERS and make an analogous change for D.C. judges, whose retirement benefits are funded by the federal government.
In general, for federal retirees, 55 is the age after which a surviving spouse may remarry without losing survivor benefits.
This bill is an important step to assist these workers in getting the retirement benefits they deserve.
I urge my colleagues to support

this bill. ____________________
