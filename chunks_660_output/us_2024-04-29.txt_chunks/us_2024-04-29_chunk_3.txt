He was not only a friend, but a great mentor.
I learned a lot from him and was always grateful for his support and friendship throughout my own career.
Lawrence ``Larry'' Amendola was a remarkable member of our community.
His passing leaves a hole in our community that will not easily be filled.
I extend my deepest sympathies to his companion of nearly 20 years, Flora D'Elsi, as well as his many cherished nieces, nephews, great and great-great nieces and nephews.
His passion, advocacy,

and commitment to service will long serve as an example to which we should all strive. ____________________

Date: 2024-04-29 Volume: 170, Issue: 73 Pages: E403 - E404 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E403-E404] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 2024 ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Ms. BUDZINSKI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Workers Memorial Day 2024 and the workers who have both lost their lives or risk their lives in unsafe working conditions on a daily basis.
Too many people across the country, even today in 2024, are still forced to choose between a paycheck and having a safe and healthy workplace.
This is unacceptable, and on Workers Memorial Day we remember all the workers who have been injured or have lost their lives on the job.
As a Member of Congress, I am dedicated to working to ensure that Congress and the federal government both strengthen protections for workers in the workplace and defend the rights of workers to organize and create strong unions.
For this reason, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the PRO Act and will continue to work with my colleagues in Washington to push Congress to take up and pass pro-worker legislation.
As someone who got their start in the labor movement, I will never stop advocating on behalf of the working men and women who serve as the backbone of this country.
On this Workers Memorial Day, I am proud to take this opportunity to honor them and the sacrifices they have made over the years to fight for their right to be treated with dignity.
