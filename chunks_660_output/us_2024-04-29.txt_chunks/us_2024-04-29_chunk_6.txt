Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor George W. Waddles, Jr., on the occasion of his 10 years of service to the Second Baptist Church of Ypsilanti, Michigan.
His significant service to his congregation and community is worthy of commendation.
Pastor Waddles received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Truman State University, a Master of Theology with a concentration in Pastoral Leadership from Dallas Theological Seminary, and a Master of Educational Administration from Texas A&M. In 1984, he was licensed to preach at the Ninth Street Baptist Church in Lawrence, Kansas and was also ordained at Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church on December 1, 1995.
After serving Sunset Missionary Baptist Church of Texarkana in Texas for over ten years, Pastor Waddles began his service as Pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in March 2014.
Under his leadership, the Second Baptist Church has become a pillar of Ypsilanti, and continues its important mission of serving the community.
Pastor Waddles has led by example and embodies the mission of the church: Connection, Commitment, and Community.
During his decade of service, Pastor Waddles has been deeply involved with ministry teams to better serve his community, and the church continues to make a positive impact by promoting the Making Strides Cancer Walk, participating in the Ypsilanti 4th of July Parade, and collecting backpacks and school supplies to help students.
Pastor Waddles has also been a lecturer and instructor in the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education and the Wolverine State Convention and Huron Valley District Association.
He has served as Dean, and currently is the President of the Huron Valley District Congress of Christian Education.
Across all these roles, Pastor Waddle has remained committed to serving his community and uplifting all those within it.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Pastor Waddles for his decade of public service in Ypsilanti.
His commitment to his faith, community, and mission is truly inspiring.
I join Pastor Waddle's family, friends, and congregation in extending my best wishes to him during this time, and I am sure he will continue to serve his community far into the future. ____________________
