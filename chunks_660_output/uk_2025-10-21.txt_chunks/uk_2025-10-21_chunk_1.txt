CELEBRATING DIWALI THIS HINDU HERITAGE MONTH

_____

HON.
SUHAS SUBRAMANYAM

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
Mr. Speaker, Hinduism is the third largest religion

in the world, and this month, millions of Americans will come together

to celebrate Diwali, or Deepavali, the festival of lights.
Diwali, symbolizing unity and renewal, marks the victory of light

over darkness and is a significant cultural and spiritual celebration,

observed by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and others in the United States and

across the globe.
Virginia, and the United States as a whole, is home to a vibrant and

thriving Hindu community.
Hindu Americans contribute meaningfully

across sectors, including business, law, government, technology,

medicine, science, education, and philanthropy.
Several states, including the Commonwealth of Virginia, have passed

legislation to officially proclaim October as Hindu Heritage Month.
I encourage residents across the Commonwealth and the country to join

in celebrating Diwali and take this opportunity to learn more about

Hindu American civic engagement, history, traditions, and culture.
In this spirit, I join those across the country in celebrating

October as Hindu Heritage Month.
May this Diwali bring joy, light, and

prosperity to all those who celebrate.

HON.
JOHN GARAMENDI

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Judge Terrye Davis,

a distinguished leader and trailblazer, as one of California's 8th

Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Her visionary leadership

and lifelong commitment to service have strengthened the fabric of

Solano County for decades.
Judge Davis began her career as the Founding

Director of the Solano College Small Business Development Center, where

she empowered entrepreneurs and expanded pathways to economic

opportunity across our region.
She later served as Executive Director

of the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club, where under her

guidance the organization's budget grew more than fivefold, allowing

countless young people to access a safe and supportive environment to

learn, grow, and thrive.
Today, Judge Davis serves with distinction on

the Solano County Superior Court, where she presides over juvenile

justice and dependency cases.
In this critical role, she brings

compassion, integrity, and structure to some of our community's most

vulnerable youth, offering not just legal judgment but also hope and a

path forward.
Her dedication to public service extends well beyond the

courtroom.
She has contributed her leadership to the Sutter Solano

Medical Center, the City of Vallejo Human Relations Commission, the

Mare Island Reuse Advisory Committee, and the Board of Trustees at her

local church.
Judge Davis's journey is a testament to courage and

purpose.
Leaving behind a successful nonprofit career to pursue her

dream of becoming an attorney, she graduated from UC Hastings and rose

to the bench, proving that it's never too late to follow one's calling.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, I

am proud to recognize and honor Judge Terrye Davis for her

extraordinary contributions to our community.
