Kim has demonstrated extraordinary leadership and a lifelong

dedication to building stronger, more equitable communities throughout

Solano County.
For more than twenty-five years, Ms. Castaneda has

exemplified what it means to serve others.
Through her work in the

nonprofit sector, she has guided organizations through growth, crisis,

and transformation, with a focus on ensuring that the most vulnerable

are not left behind.
As Vice President of Development and

Communications at the Food Bank of Contra Costa and Solano, Ms.

Castaneda has raised millions of dollars to fight hunger and played an

instrumental role in doubling private donations, ensuring that

thousands of families have consistent access to nutritious food.
Her

leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was especially remarkable.
At a

time when food insecurity reached unprecedented levels, she rallied

staff, volunteers, and community partners to secure critical resources

and distribute millions of additional meals.
Under her guidance, the Food Bank never turned anyone away and

continues today to serve more than 65,000 households each month.
She

was also a founding board member of the Vacaville Recreation Foundation

and helped establish the first Boys and Girls Club in Vacaville,

expanding opportunities for local youth that endure to this day.
She

has also served on the Board of SafeQuest Solano, supporting survivors

of domestic violence and sexual assault.
Her commitment to equity and

inclusion is reflected in her advocacy for LGBTQ rights, foster youth,

and women's empowerment, and in her leadership roles with key

organizations including the Solano Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the

Solano Economic Development Council, and the Travis Credit Union

Foundation.
In each of these, she has championed small business

development, workforce opportunities, and economic inclusion.
Her work

stands as a testament to

the power of service-driven leadership, and the lasting impact one

person can make.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th

Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Kim

Castaneda for her invaluable contributions to our community.

come to the operating room.''

Resources Officer, shared, ``Congratulations to TaKayla on earning her

BSN and becoming a registered nurse!
