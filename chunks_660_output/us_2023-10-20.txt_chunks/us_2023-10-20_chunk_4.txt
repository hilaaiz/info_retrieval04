In a matter of hours, six tornadoes swept across the state, leaving a trail of devastation from west to east.
Five people died, dozens of homes and businesses were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of Michiganders were left in the dark due to power outages.
Under these most pressing circumstances, more than 40 percent of LBWL's customers were affected by the storm, including 612 unique power outage locations, 835 downed wires, 47 broken poles, and 187 transformers knocked offline.
In the challenging days that followed the storms, LBWL sent an unprecedented number of crews into the field, calling in mutual aid from across Michigan and around the country.
In total, 45 tree crews, 57 line crews, and 162 spotters worked around the clock in difficult conditions, restoring power to 98 percent of customers in a matter of days.
That effort was born of experience.
After a similarly devastating ice storm hit the region 10 years ago, LBWL implemented all the recommendations from an independent investigation into the storm response, spending millions on proactive tree-trimming, expanding mutual aid agreements, hardening its communication plan, and revamping the entire corporate structure.
This organizational soul-searching has paid off, with vastly improved reliability and response time when it matters most.
The work of LBWL crews, and crews from across the country, was difficult and even dangerous, requiring long hours and high skill to bring the power back for hundreds of customers.
That hard work and dedication deserve recognition here. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 173 Pages: E1002 - E1003 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1002-E1003] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF KENNETH A. MILLS ______ of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. KIM of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the life and selfless service of Kenneth A. Mills, a U.S. Army veteran who bravely served during the Korean War and passed earlier in October.
A beloved member of our Evesham community, many knew Ken as a person that was deeply committed to family, his community, and our country.
After graduating high school, Ken enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he was later stationed in Korea and served there for 3 years.
After his honorable discharge in 1955, Ken's service was highly honored, as he earned two Bronze Stars, the Korean War Service Medal, and the United Nations Service Medal.
Beyond his service to our country, Ken went above and beyond in his personal and professional life to care for those around him.
While starting a family of his own in Rockwood, Michigan, with his wife, Betty, Ken also started his career as a union representative, before eventually transitioning into a long, accomplished tenure in Human Resources.
Eventually stepping up as the Director of Human Resources for Allied Signal, Ken became a strong leader of their department, working on behalf of the people, and traveling across the country before eventually settling in Marlton, New Jersey.
It was in Marlton that Ken became a dedicated member of the St. Joan of Arc parish, our local government, and the town watch.
Through his involvement across multiple organizations, he took every opportunity to facilitate projects to make our community a better, safer place.
Most recently, he focused his vision on the Evesham Township Veterans Wall of Honor in the Evesham Township Municipal Building.
Ken played a vital role in the `Coffee with a Vet' program as well as the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter.
No matter the task--big or small--Ken proved every day that he was a deep believer that it was always possible for each person to create positive change in their community.
Even beyond Evesham's borders, he dedicated his time as the President of the Boys & Girls Club of Philadelphia, uplifting kids and young adults across the area.
