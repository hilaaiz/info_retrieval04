These appliances generate significant noise pollution that can damage human hearing, disturb wildlife, and interfere with life and work.
Replacing gas-powered equipment with zero-emission equipment would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and protect operators of the equipment from hearing loss and other potentially negative health effects.
I am also very proud to share that this legislation has garnered widespread support from numerous national, state, and regional organizations, including industry, environmental, and health-focused groups.

Date: 2023-10-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 173 Pages: E1003 - E1003 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING KATHLEEN O'BRIEN HAM, 20 YEARS WITH T-MOBILE USA ______ of washington in the house of representatives Mr. SMITH of Washington.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize Kathleen O'Brien Ham for her forty years of work in wireless telecommunications advocacy, and to congratulate her on her retirement as T-Mobile's Senior Vice President for Government Affairs.
Throughout her nearly 20 years with T-Mobile, Kathleen has been instrumental in leading the company's public policy practice.
She was responsible for engaging federal and state governments and agencies to advance a wide range of priorities for T-Mobile, including radio spectrum and consumer safety matters.
Kathleen's fourteen years of prior experience at the Federal Communications Commission equipped her well for the landmark achievements she accomplished during her tenure at T-Mobile.
Thanks to her unmatched focus on industry competition and doing more for consumers, T-Mobile became the first telecommunications provider to offer 5G network coverage in all 50 states, expanding wireless access for millions of Americans across the country.
From testifying before Congress to spearheading T-Mobile's efforts to secure additional spectrum, Kathleen laid the groundwork for the company's growth and innovation in recent years.
Under her oversight, T-Mobile closed its merger with Sprint after a successful two-year policy and regulatory campaign, positioning T-Mobile as the country's leading 5G wireless provider and strengthening the company's competitiveness for years to come.
