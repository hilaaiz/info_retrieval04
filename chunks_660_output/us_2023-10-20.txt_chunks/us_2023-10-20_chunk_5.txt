Ken played a vital role in the `Coffee with a Vet' program as well as the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter.
No matter the task--big or small--Ken proved every day that he was a deep believer that it was always possible for each person to create positive change in their community.
Even beyond Evesham's borders, he dedicated his time as the President of the Boys & Girls Club of Philadelphia, uplifting kids and young adults across the area.
I know Ken will have the lasting memory of being a friendly face around town, often riding his lawn mower through the neighborhood with a warm smile and helping hand for whomever may need one.
We were lucky to have Ken as a member of our community.
He was a beloved husband, father, and neighbor.
My heart goes out to his entire family, his friends, and for anyone who knew him and grieving his loss.
Though he will be deeply missed, I am sure his legacy will live on for years to come through his positive impacts on all our

lives. ____________________

CCTV provides coverage of local government meetings, public safety information, local sports, and other community events with the goal of making local journalism accessible to all.
CCTV livestreams to their website and social media platforms and provides twenty-four hour broadcasting, providing Contra Costans with convenient access to breaking news, important community updates, and more.
CCTV has continually shown its dedication to sharing our community's stories and connecting Contra Costa residents.
CCTV has also partnered with the County Clerk-Recorder-Elections Department and local chapters of the League of Women Voters to provide voters with up-to-date reporting on candidates and ballot measures.
A well-informed public is vital to any healthy democracy and I'm proud of CCTV's contributions to provide locally-produced voter education programming.
CCTV has received many accolades for its outstanding programing.
The Veterans' Voices program received the Western Alliance Video Excellence award in 2016 and 2018 and the California State Association of Counties 2015 Merit Award.
