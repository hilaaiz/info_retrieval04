Thanks to her unmatched focus on industry competition and doing more for consumers, T-Mobile became the first telecommunications provider to offer 5G network coverage in all 50 states, expanding wireless access for millions of Americans across the country.
From testifying before Congress to spearheading T-Mobile's efforts to secure additional spectrum, Kathleen laid the groundwork for the company's growth and innovation in recent years.
Under her oversight, T-Mobile closed its merger with Sprint after a successful two-year policy and regulatory campaign, positioning T-Mobile as the country's leading 5G wireless provider and strengthening the company's competitiveness for years to come.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I thank Kathleen O'Brien Ham for her career helping T-Mobile thrive and subsequently doing more for American consumers, and I wish her a happy retirement. ____________________
