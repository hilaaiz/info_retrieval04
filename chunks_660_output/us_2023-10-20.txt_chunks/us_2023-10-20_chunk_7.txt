Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today along with my colleague, Representative Mike Quigley, to celebrate one of Chicagoland's very own, legendary meteorologist Tom Skilling, and his 45-year career as a beloved presence on our local airwaves as he embarks on his well-deserved retirement.
As the longtime chief meteorologist for WGN-TV, Tom Skilling has been one of the most trusted figures on television screens throughout the Chicago area for decades, expertly and calmly explaining the region's often unpredictable weather situations for generations of viewers.
I am especially proud to say that Tom Skilling is an Aurora, Illinois native, and a proud graduate of West Aurora High School.
After completing his studies at the University of Wisconsin, Tom worked briefly on local television stations in Madison and Milwaukee before landing at WGN-TV, where he quickly became a daily fixture in households throughout Chicago and the suburbs.
Those of us who know Tom and have worked with him over the course of his career know how passionate he is about his work and how talented he is at communicating often complex scientific data to people of all ages and backgrounds.
But his greatest strength is the kindness with which he treats everyone he interacts with; he is always ready to greet a fan with a warm smile and meaningful conversation.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Tom Skilling and his decades of service to the Chicagoland community and offer him our most sincere best wishes on the next chapter of his life. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE PROMOTING REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS THROUGH LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
173



Date: 2023-10-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 173 Pages: E1004 - E1004 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE PROMOTING REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS THROUGH LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT ACT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to introduce the Promoting Reduction of Emissions through Landscaping Equipment Act.
This crucial legislation provides businesses with a significant tool as they transition toward a more sustainable and consumer-friendly future.
This essential and forward-thinking piece of legislation provides a 40 percent credit on the purchase of zero-emission equipment, such as mowers, leaf blowers, hedgers, and accessories, up to $25,000 every year and up to $100,000 over the course of 10 consecutive years.
The tax credit, which applies to any equipment purchased on or after January 1, 2023, also extends to retrofitting equipment that transforms gas-powered devices to zero-emission.
These credits cover batteries, generators, retrofitting equipment, and other necessary accessories.
Currently, there are over 300 restrictions on the use of gas-powered lawn equipment across the country, as more localities recognize the need to transition to quieter, less polluting equipment.
The bill will assist local businesses as they adapt to local ordinances and consumer demand for better, cleaner, and quieter equipment while reducing their costs over time through lower maintenance expenses and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.
Moreover, the bill is compatible with local and state voucher and rebate programs for zero-emission equipment like the programs in my home State of California.
Current gas-powered equipment emits pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NO X ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), reactive organic gases (ROG), and particulate matter that negatively impact the climate, air quality, ecosystems, and are potentially harmful to human health, especially for the workers who operate the equipment.
These appliances generate significant noise pollution that can damage human hearing, disturb wildlife, and interfere with life and work.
Replacing gas-powered equipment with zero-emission equipment would improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and protect operators of the equipment from hearing loss and other potentially negative health effects.
I am also very proud to share that this legislation has garnered widespread support from numerous national, state, and regional organizations, including industry, environmental, and health-focused groups.
