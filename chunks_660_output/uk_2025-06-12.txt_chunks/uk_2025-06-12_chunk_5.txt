RECOGNIZING MICHAEL GOODWIN

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to

recognize Mr. Michael Goodwin for his service at Withlacoochee River

Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up

Navajo Project.
In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled

over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New

Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical

infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for

generations.
Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to

communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark,

families to preserve food, and elders to live with greater comfort.
Despite daunting challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team

completed a demanding project in just eight days--far ahead of

expectations--demonstrating professionalism, humility, and unwavering

commitment to this life-changing mission.
The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents

a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future

generations to their ancestral homes.
The emotional moment when power

was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and

renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project

made.
WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative

reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and

respect for the people they serve.
Their dedication has energized ten

homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that

embodies the true spirit of cooperative values.
The WREC team's journey

inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the

most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and

communities.
I commend the entire team for their efforts on this

worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local

community.
