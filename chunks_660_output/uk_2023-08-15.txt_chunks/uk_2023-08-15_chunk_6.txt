This bill would not change this

composition.
D.C., like every other jurisdiction in the United States, should be

free to set its own local land-use policies.
This bill is an important

step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support it.

RECOGNIZING CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH OF BUFFALO

HON.
BRIAN HIGGINS

Mr. HIGGINS of New York.
Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize

the impact of Calvary Baptist Church of Buffalo.
Calvary Baptist will

celebrate its 85th anniversary on September 15, 2023, which will mark

several decades of critical service to our community and its residents.
Calvary began on Clinton Street with Rev. Polite in 1938, and through

the years, has become a staple of the Western New York region.
This

church is compassionate and dedicated to the mission of helping others,

and they do this through local and global leadership that focuses on

fostering strong intergenerational disciples.
The efforts in Christian

education have made significant impacts on the lives of many, and the

nurturing of all followers (of every generation) is a testament to the

love and unity within this church family.
Every day, our community

ought to recognize and appreciate the leadership and members of Calvary

for their selfless work and devotion.
Their contributions to the

betterment of our community have not gone unnoticed, and their impact

extends far beyond the walls of the congregation.
Reverend Corey Bernard Gibson of Buffalo, New York, was named as the

seventh and current pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church.
Pastor Gibson

has continued to carry out community service, catering to both

spiritual and social needs.
This includes the continuation of the

Community Outreach Day and the establishment of a scholarship for the

local community high school, along with various other events throughout

the year that focus on benefiting the children of Buffalo.
It is

critically important to recognize such efforts, and I ask that you join

me in thanking the leaders and membership of Calvary Baptist, alike,

for their successful endeavors over the last 85 years.
