Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Asaad Kelada, a director and producer of many of America's favorite sitcoms over the last 40+ years.
His contribution to American cinema is worthy of commendation.
Born in Egypt, Asaad began his studies at the American University in Cairo.
In 1961, he earned a student visa and he came to the United States where he studied directing at the Yale School of Drama.
After years of teaching drama and directing stage plays, Asaad got his first big break in 1976 when, after spending five years working on the set of the sitcom Rhonda, he was given an opportunity to direct an episode.
Since then, Assad has been entertaining generations of American families with shows like WKRP in Cincinnati, The Facts of Life, Family Ties, Who's the Boss, Everybody Loves Raymond, Dharma and Greg, Two and a Half Men, and The Office.
Immigrants have always enriched and strengthened the fabric of our nation, and Asaad has said ``I never tried to minimize who I am.
For me, being an Egyptian was one of the strongest aspects of what I had.''
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating Assad Kelada for his almost five decades of incredible work.
As a young man, he quickly dazzled us with his humor and has been making families laugh together for decades, all while never forgetting his family and where he came from.
He is exemplary of everything we highlight when we speak about the American Dream, and I am sure he will continue to make us laugh for years to come.
I thank Asaad for his contributions. ____________________
