I hope this testament to Lt.
Col.
Carruthers' life serves as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed to him by the American people.
On behalf of Texas' 21st Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the extraordinary life of Lt.
Col.
Carruthers and his dedicated service to our country.
Today, a grateful Nation thanks him. ____________________
