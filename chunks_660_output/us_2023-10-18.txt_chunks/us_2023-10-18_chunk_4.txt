Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor Julia Bullock, a longtime Searcy resident and the National Guard's 2023 Armed Forces Military Spouse of the Year.
Julia serves as the Soldier and Family Readiness Group coordinator for Headquarters Company, 2-153 IN, and as one of the coordinators for the overall Battalion.
In her role, Julia tirelessly works to help soldiers and their families access resources within the community that can help them through major issues, especially home and food insecurity.
She also serves as an advocate for the Guard, frequently speaking to Arkansas elected officials to advocate for long-lasting solutions to these challenges for our military families.
Julia and her husband, Michael, an Arkansas Army National Guardsman, reside in Searcy with their children.
I extend my sincere gratitude to her and her family for their tremendous service. ____________________
RECOGNIZING OCTOBER AS NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-10-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 171 Pages: E991 - E991 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING OCTOBER AS NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. TONKO.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to recognize October as National Spina Bifida Awareness Month and to pay tribute to my constituents with Spina Bifida and their loved ones.
Additionally, I recognize October 25th, as World Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Day.
There are currently an estimated 166,000 individuals in the United States living with Spina Bifida.
According to the CDC, each year approximately 1,400 babies born in the United States have spina bifida.
Those diagnosed with Spina Bifida can expect to spend most of their lives in a wheelchair, or walking with braces, and face the prospect of dozens of surgeries they turn 18.
I have been honored to attend numerous events in the Capital Region, including the Spina Bifida Walk and Roll and the Spina Bifida Dare to Dream Gala, both of which are held by the Spina Bifida Association (SBA) of Northeastern New York, that have raised funds for research, brought awareness to the public, and told the stories of those in our community with this disease.
I am heartened to attend events like these.
which do so much to honor those with spina bifida, as well as their friends, families, and caretakers.
I am so impressed with the breakthroughs in research that have helped to give those living with this disease a more fulfilling life.
Thanks to the work of organizations like SBA, new medical treatments and technologies have been developed that allow most people with Spina Bifida to live a normal life span, ensuring they can have a full career, get married, and start a family--no different than those without this disease.
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure that organizations like the Spina Bifida Association continue to receive the funding and support they have earned.
I also will continue to support federal research funding for better understanding the condition, the cause, and treatments.
I hope that together we can continue to raise awareness. ____________________
