Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this past August, it was my honor to attend the Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony for Daniel Cohen.
The trail to Eagle Scout is marked by milestones and achievements, each one a testament to Daniel's unwavering determination.
From those early days as a Cub Scout to rising through the ranks, to earning merit badges and honing skills, he has demonstrated a thirst for knowledge and a willingness to embrace challenges.
Daniel makes giving back to his community a priority and that is evident through his Eagle Scout Project.
In an effort to help retire flags in a respectful way, Daniel built a flag retirement box for his local VFW.
I know Daniel has a bright future ahead of him and I wish him all the best.
God Bless Daniel Cohen and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union for International Credit Union Day.
SchoolsFirst is a long-time community staple in my district, and I am delighted to celebrate their growth.
In 1934, a group of 126 Orange County school employees pooled together $1,200 to found SchoolsFirst, formerly known as the Orange County Teachers Credit Union.
The first branch was opened in Santa Ana.
SchoolsFirst has since expanded to become the state's largest Credit Union and the 5th largest in the Nation.
SchoolsFirst serves over 350,000 school employees who live or work in Orange County and their family members.
They have 22 branches in Orange County alone and 70 across California.
As a member-owned credit union, SchoolsFirst has been steadfastly committed to returning excess earnings to its members.
Nationwide, they have over $25 billion in assets and over 1 million members.
I am grateful for SchoolsFirst's charitable contributions to the community.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join me in celebrating SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union and their contributions to our Orange County community. ____________________

I thank him for his distinguished service, and I am confident that he will be an inspiring leader for the lucky students of the Arkansas Military and First Responders Academy.
