Mr. Speaker, November 19, 2023 marks the one year anniversary of a violent attack in Colorado Springs killing five people and injuring 22 others.
I would like to once again extend my prayers of peace and healing for the families and victims.
During the incident, two heroes took action that night to prevent further harm and should be honored for their heroic acts.
Richard Fierro and Thomas James stepped up at their own peril to save lives and protect others.
The two heroes worked together to stop the gunman and remove the firearm from him, Mr. James even incurred injuries when a bullet was fired into his abdomen.
Because of the decisive, quick, and selfless action of these two men, more lives were not taken by the attacker.
This is the true spirit of selflessness and duty that we are privileged to experience so commonly in Colorado Springs.
Information Technician 2nd Class Thomas James was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest non-combat decoration the Navy can award for heroism.
Richard Fierro, a retired Army Major, received the Lifesaving Military Hero of The Year Award from the American Red Cross.
May we all remember their actions to save the lives of others and thank them for their service to our Nation and community on the anniversary of this terrible event. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 191 Pages: E1116 - E1116 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LEGACY OF WYNONA LIPMAN ______ HON.
DONALD M. PAYNE, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PAYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a great trailblazer from my district, Wynona Lipman, on what would have been her 100th birthday.
Born in 1923, Mrs. Lipman was the first African- American woman to be elected to the New Jersey State Senate when she won her seat in 1971.
She served the 29th Legislative District for 27 years, the Senate's longest-serving member at the time of her death in 1999.
Before she was a political trailblazer, Mrs. Lipman was a teacher.
She taught French at Morehouse College and tutored a famous civil rights advocate, Martin Luther King, Jr. She left that position to pursue a Ph.D. degree at Columbia University.
During her time at Columbia, Mrs. Lipman earned a Fulbright fellowship to study at the Sorbonne in Paris for two years.
When she returned, Mrs. Lipman finished her Ph.D. degree and eventually moved to Montclair, New Jersey, where she became an associate professor at Essex County College.
In Montclair, Mrs. Lipman became active in local politics.
In 1968, she won her first election to become an Essex County Board of Chosen Freeholder, where she became President of the Board in 1971.
Then Mrs. Lipman ran for the New Jersey State Senate and defeated Republican Senator Milton Waldor by less than 1,000 votes out of 170,000 cast.
During her 27 years in the State Senate, Mrs. Lipman was often the only woman serving there and worked diligently to protect the LGBTQ+ community and children on the Governor's Advisory Council on AIDS and Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect.
Mrs. Lipman's tireless efforts to serve her district earned her induction into the New Jersey's ``Women's Hall of Fame'' in 1998.
Today, her legacy is supported throughout the area.
