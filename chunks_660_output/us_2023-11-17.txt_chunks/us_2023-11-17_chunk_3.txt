During that time, he held various other titles, including Chairman of the Board, Deacon, Vice-Chair of the Executive Council, Elder, and choir member.
He mentored hundreds of young people over the years, and was known as a spiritual father to many.
In everything he did, Lonnie McKissic used his hands, his heart, and his life to build up the community.
Brick by brick, word by word, lesson by lesson, he laid out a blueprint for what it means to be a servant leader, and constructed his life on a bedrock of faith,

family, and hard work.
I send my condolences to his family, and ask that we now dedicate ourselves to building upon his memory, which will live on in Lansing. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 191 Pages: E1115 - E1115 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF JOHN BRANDON, PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MARION COUNTY COMMISSION ON YOUTH ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of John Brandon, President and Executive Director of the Marion County Commission on Youth (MCCOY), who will enter his retirement at the end of this year.
For 45 years, John has dedicated his life to youth development, leading positive changes in local programs and agencies and at larger city, state, and national systemic levels.
As an adjunct professor at the undergraduate and graduate levels, an agency director focused on increased opportunities for young people, and a trainer and facilitator for youth workers' continued education John has nurtured Indianapolis' young people in countless ways.
John's legacy is one of advocacy and empowerment.
He has been instrumental in guiding projects and initiatives aimed at the development of our youth, including a city-wide youth employment effort, developing more support and services for unhoused youth, and reforming our child welfare system to be more family-focused.
Under John's leadership, MCCOY has been an instrumental partner in my yearly Youth Opportunities Fair, which connects young people to employment, internships, and other programs during the summer months.
His passionate belief that young people must be part of the systems that impact them is evidenced through youth participation on MCCOY's board and the agency's facilitation of the Mayor's Youth Council.
Active in his community, John has served on numerous community-based nonprofit boards, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Multiservice Center, the Indiana Afterschool Network, and the Hawthorn Community Center.
At a national level, John dedicated a decade to the Partnership for America's Children's board of directors.
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring John Brandon as he enters this new chapter filled with cycling, reading, and family.
We celebrate his legacy of outstanding accomplishments as we continue to ensure a brighter future for our nation's youth. ____________________
