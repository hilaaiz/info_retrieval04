RECOGNIZING NOVEMBER 2023 CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH

HON.
MIKE LEVIN

Mr. LEVIN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to recognize veteran and

Oceanside resident Dr. Jack Morgan as my November 2023 Constituent of

the Month.
Jack is a hero of our Nation, serving as a naval gunnery officer

aboard the battleship USS South Dakota (BB-57) at the close of WWII,

aboard the Navy cruiser USS Saint Paul (CA-73) during the Korean War,

and as a Navy and Marine Corps medic during the Vietnam War.
After

retiring from military service, Dr. Morgan has dedicated himself to

increasing educational support to veterans by founding a scholarship

program that awards funding to veterans at California colleges and

universities.
I am honored to recognize veterans, like Jack, who served our country

with pride and now give back to their fellow veterans.
He is a

courageous and inspiring community leader, and I'm proud to recognize

Dr. Jack Morgan as my November 2023 Constituent of the Month.
