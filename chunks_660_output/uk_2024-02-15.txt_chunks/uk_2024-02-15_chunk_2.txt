Whenever faced with challenges or obstacles, Vicki never took no for an

answer--she just kept going.
In doing so she made such a difference in

people's lives.
One of her favorite programs, Roots & Wings, provides

lifesaving travel and related support to families whose child has

been identified with a potentially life-threatening Primary

Immunodeficiency requiring lifesaving medical care far away from home.
Jeffrey asked Vicki to ``Do Something,'' and she did.
As I stand today and extend my heartfelt condolences to Vicki's

husband, Fred, as well as her family, friends, and colleagues, I am

inspired to continue to work with them and the Jeffrey Modell

Foundation to honor Vicki's memory by making a difference in the lives

of those diagnosed with Primary Immunodeficiency and their loved ones.
I look forward to the day when we realize her ultimate dream of finding

a cure.
I know I, like so many others, will keep the memory of Vicki

Modell close as we continue this important work.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE N. SCOTT MOMADAY

HON.
TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ

Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor N. Scott Momaday

for his remarkable and unforgettable life, a legend to the last word.
Mr. Momaday passed away on Wednesday, January 24 in Santa Fe, New

Mexico at the age of 89.
I offer my sincerest condolences to his

family.
They are in my prayers to find peace and healing.
Mr. Momaday was born in Lawton, Oklahoma on February 27, 1934.
After

moving to Arizona, his family moved to Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico, also

known as Walatowa--meaning the ``people of the valley.''
There is no

surprise in my mind as to why N. Scott Momaday was inspired by this

beautiful place, which was often featured in his brilliant works.
Indeed, Mr. Momaday received the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for

his House Made of Dawn, which is largely credited with igniting a wave

of modern Native American literature.
He showed us the power of

storytelling and the oral tradition--of bringing imagination to life--

and shed light on the Native experience and culture.
As he once said,

``Our very existence consists in our imagination of ourselves.''
Mr. Momaday also reminded us of the importance of the land.
He wrote,

``We Americans must come again to a moral comprehension of the earth

and air.
We must live according to the principle of a land ethic.
The

alternative is that we shall not live at all.''
Today I say thank you to N. Scott Momaday for these stories that

preserve the beauty of our lands so that in a changing world, they

remain indispensable to our collective well-being for years to come.
Mr. Momaday will be forever remembered across Native America and New

Mexico.
His writing sparked our imagination and took our hearts to

places our bodies have never touched.
He had the ability to paint the

picture of a story through the finesse of power in his words.
He

created space necessary for creative culture to follow.
For all this

and more, we recognize N. Scott Momaday for his indelible influence on

the state of New Mexico and to the United States of America.
