Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Commission of Fine Arts District of Columbia Residency Act.
This bill would require that a majority of the members of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) be District of Columbia residents.
Under federal law and presidential executive orders (EOs), the CFA has review authority for federal property in D.C., certain military property, certain coins and medals, D.C.-owned parks and buildings and certain private land in D.C. Under the relevant EOs, CFA has review authority for the design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings.
Under the Shipstead-Luce Act, CFA has review authority for the design of private buildings in D.C. ``adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major importance,'' such as Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront.
Under the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of private buildings in the part of Georgetown referred to as ``Old Georgetown'' in the act.
Residency requirements for certain government positions are found in federal, state and D.C. law, including for members of the National Capital Planning Commission.
The primary reason such laws exist is so that government officials have a connection to the residents they serve and in-depth knowledge of the unique issues and challenges faced by residents.
I have also introduced the Commission of Fine Arts District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which would remove the authority of the CFA over non-federal real property in D.C. However, while the CFA maintains that authority, a majority of the members should be D.C. residents.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-10-02 Volume: 169, Issue: 161 Pages: E924 - E924 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Courts Home Rule Act.
This bill would give the Council of the District of Columbia authority over the jurisdiction and organization of the local D.C. courts.
The D.C. Home Rule Act (HRA) expressly prohibits the Council from enacting any law with respect to any title 11 of the D.C. Code, which relates to the jurisdiction and organization of the local D.C. courts.
Congress can correct this injustice to D.C. residents, who pay all federal taxes, by amending the HRA, even before D.C. becomes the 51st state.
Fifty years after passage of the HRA, matters involving the local D.C. courts almost never come to Congress, so Congress knows virtually nothing about D.C.'s local courts--and could not care less.
Notwithstanding the importance of D.C.'s local courts to D.C. residents, the Council, which is the repository of knowledge and experience for D.C.'s criminal and civil justice systems and the body accountable to D.C. residents, is irresponsibly left on the sidelines while Congress remains the sole entity that may correct flaws in D.C.'s local courts.
Under the HRA, the Council has no authority to ``enact any act, resolution, or rule with respect to any provision of title 11 of the District of Columbia Code (relating to organization and jurisdiction of the District of Columbia courts).''
Matters in title 11 primarily relate to the rules of criminal and civil procedure, court administration, the branches of the courts, the rules of jury service and admission to the bar.
This bill would strike this limitation on the Council's authority.
D.C. has never had authority over its local courts, even when it was responsible for paying for their operations.
