As the co-chair of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus.
I understand that hundreds of thousands of Americans with rare diseases rely on plasma protein therapies that are only available because of the commitment of dedicated plasma donors.
For example, Americans living with primary immunodeficiencies (PI) require intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatments derived from plasma donors.
Without timely care, even the most common infections can present the risk of serious illness or death for these patients.
That is why I introduced the PI Post Acute Access Act, which would expand access to IVIG treatment for Medicare beneficiaries with PI in skilled nursing facilities.
I have long advocated to ensure access to IVIG treatments, and I will continue to fight to ensure all Americans, including rare disease patients, have access to the innovative treatments they need.
I ask that my colleagues in the House of Representatives join me and rise in commemoration of International Plasma Awareness Week, honoring those committed donors and donation centers that make and collect needed and lifesaving contributions. ____________________
