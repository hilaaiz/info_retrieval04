Matters in title 11 primarily relate to the rules of criminal and civil procedure, court administration, the branches of the courts, the rules of jury service and admission to the bar.
This bill would strike this limitation on the Council's authority.
D.C. has never had authority over its local courts, even when it was responsible for paying for their operations.
Under the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997, the federal government assumed the costs for several state-level functions, including the courts.
This bill would not change the courts' funding.
This bill also would not change the authority of the President to nominate, or the Senate to confirm, local D.C. judges, which has been within their purview since the creation of the modern local court system in 1970.
This bill is an important step to increase democratic self-government for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of Roll Call No.
507, H.R. 4368, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2024, in order for the appropriations process to move forward.
However, I do have some concerns about certain provisions and cuts in the underlying bill.
Watershed programs, rural energy and broadband grants, and water and wastewater projects are just a few programs that are of vital importance to my district and need adequate funding.
As the appropriations process continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure the needs of rural America are met. ____________________
RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL PLASMA AWARENESS WEEK; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-10-02 Volume: 169, Issue: 161 Pages: E924 - E924 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL PLASMA AWARENESS WEEK ______ of california in the house of representatives Ms. MATSUI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and support International Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW), October 2-6, both in the United States and around the world.
Patients across the globe rely on medicines made from donated human plasma to lead productive, healthy lives.
The need for plasma donation is ongoing--plasma is the starting ingredient for numerous lifesaving therapies to treat individuals living with rare diseases.
This week, patients, plasma donors, and plasma donation centers will join together to raise global awareness of the crucial need for plasma, recognize the contributions of plasma donors, and call attention to the many rare diseases treated with plasma protein therapies.
Donors and patients alike will observe IPAW through a range of events seeking to enhance awareness of plasma-derived therapies and recombinant analogs, collectively known as plasma protein therapies.
These are unique biologic medicines that are either infused or injected to treat a variety of rare, life-threatening, chronic, and genetic diseases.
This includes bleeding disorders, hereditary angioedema, immune deficiencies, pulmonary disorders, neurological disorders, and infectious diseases such as tetanus, hepatitis, and rabies.
Plasma protein therapies have significantly improved the quality of life, markedly improved patient outcomes, and extended the life expectancy of patients across the country.
Healthy, committed donors provide the human plasma essential to manufacture these lifesaving therapies.
There are now over 1,100 plasma collection centers in the U.S. that have demonstrated their commitment to donor safety and quality by earning International Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) certification.
As the co-chair of the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus.
I understand that hundreds of thousands of Americans with rare diseases rely on plasma protein therapies that are only available because of the commitment of dedicated plasma donors.
For example, Americans living with primary immunodeficiencies (PI) require intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatments derived from plasma donors.
