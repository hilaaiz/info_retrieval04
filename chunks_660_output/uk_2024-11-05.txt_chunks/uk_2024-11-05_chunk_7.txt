We seek

information from the general public, those who have received

psychedelic-assisted therapies as an intervention, interested

stakeholders, and those individuals and entities working

within the bio-psycho-social-spiritual behavioral health

ecosystem (e.g., palliative care, addiction services), which

stresses a holistic system of care comprised of clinical

providers, counseling, and peer support (Courtney et al.,
2023; D'Souza, 2007; Urutia et al.,
2023).
It will be essential to receive input from people and

organizations with specialized experience in implementing

therapies where psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances

are administered, such as in clinical research protocols

(e.g., depression, palliative care, substance use disorders,

post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)), or experience in

training others for such therapies.
As a part of the PATH

Caucus information gathering effort, we acknowledge the

significant anthropological role of certain psychedelic

substances such as ayahuasca, peyote, and Psilocybe

mushrooms.
Some indigenous peoples of the Americas have

extensive traditions dating back hundreds to thousands of

years, where they incorporated these substances into

spiritual ceremonial or ritual healing practices.
The PATH

Caucus believes that respectful, inclusive, cultural

knowledge sharing from these communities may provide

substantial insights, further informing our overall

understanding, and we welcome their input.
In medications derived from psychedelic or entactogenic

drug substances are ultimately approved for therapeutic

indications by the FDA, it is important for States to

understand the risk mitigations frameworks FDA has

established and develop ways to make sure they are supported.
Aspects of real-world risk reduction and mitigation

frameworks may include, but are not limited to, providing

comprehensive transparent public education, implementing

substance misuse prevention programs, minimizing the

potential for adverse reactions, and developing implementable

risk mitigation, safety, and ethical monitoring strategies.
Moreover, it will be vital to consider how Congress can best

support states in developing and adopting scalable

infrastructures and sustainable service delivery systems that

ensure proper accountability and monitoring, as well as

facilitate access and equity in utilization, with a

particular focus on communities that may be at risk for

experiencing inequities in care resulting in disparate health

outcomes (e.g., veterans, the uninsured, those who are

experiencing homelessness, people with lower incomes, and

individuals living with mental illness and/or co-occurring

substance use disorders; Ortiz et al.,
2022).
In addition,

when federal agencies such as the Department of Veterans

Affairs make these products available, we need to be sure

there is sufficient infrastructure to ensure patient safety.
All of these components, when collectively addressed, may

contribute to more responsible, accountable, safe, and

ethical use of psychedelic and entactogenic derived

substances in medically supervised and interpersonally

supportive settings.
The PATH Caucus seeks input that can inform Congress so any

potential future appropriations will support states

collectively addressing the relevant issues and support

necessary federal initiatives such as research,

implementation and FDA regulation.
Congress believes that by

listening and learning from the broader ecosystem, staying

abreast of potential innovative evidence-based therapies that

may treat individuals with behavioral health disorders

refractory to current treatment modalities, and

simultaneously undertaking proactive measures for developing

real-world risk reduction and mitigation frameworks, will

help protect public health and safety.
Current State of Psychedelic and Entactogenic Clinical Research

Clinical data continue to be collected regarding the safety

profiles and potential benefits from therapies that use

psychedelic or entactogenic drug substances across a variety

of diagnoses such as major depressive disorder (MDD),

treatment resistant depression (TRD), demoralization, PTSD,

generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and substance use

disorders, in conjunction with appropriate supervision and

support from qualified mental health professionals (Belouin

et al.,
2022; Carhart-Harris et al.,
2021; Davis et al.,
2021; Griffiths et al.,
2016; Jerome et al.,
2020; Mitchell

et al.,
2021; Ross et al.,
2016; Siegel et al.,
2021; Xi et

al.,
2023).
Additionally, FDA has granted requests for

Breakthrough Therapy designation to specific development

programs involving MDMA for the treatment of PTSD

(Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies, 2017),

psilocybin for TRD (COMPASS Pathways, 2018; Goodwin, G.M.. et

al.
2022) and MDD (Khan, 2019; Raison et al.,
