Maj.
Don Wright serving as

the first NCOCC Commandant.
Potential candidates for the course were selected from groups of

initial entry soldiers who had a security clearance of confidential, an

infantry score of 100 or over, and demonstrated leadership potential.
Based on recommendations, the unit commander would select potential

NCOs, but all were not volunteers.
Those selected to attend NCOCC were

immediately made corporals and later promoted to sergeant upon

graduation from phase one.
The select few who graduated with honors

would be promoted to staff sergeant.
The outstanding graduate of the

first class, Staff Sgt.
Melvin C. Leverick, recalled ``I think that

those who graduated [from the NCOCC] were much better prepared for some

of the problems that would arise in Vietnam.''
The NCO candidate course

was designed to maximize the two-year tour of the enlisted draftee.
Though over 300 hours of instruction was given, eighty percent was

conducted in the field.
The final basic phase was a ``dress rehearsal

for Vietnam,'' a full week of patrols, ambush, defensive perimeters,

and navigation.
Twice daily, the Vietnam-schooled rangers critiqued the

candidates, and all training was conducted tactically.
These men, many now of advanced age, served our country with great

honor under challenging circumstances.
Four were awarded the Medal of

Honor.
Six are still missing.
Many--1,118 in all--never made it home.
Mr. Speaker, it is evident that these outstanding noncommissioned

officers and combat veterans were an indispensable part of our armed

forces and served our country with bravery, dedication, and honor.

RECOGNIZING BERTHA RAMSEY

HON.
RASHIDA TLAIB

Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Bertha Ramsey, a

long-time resident of the City of Detroit, as she celebrates 100 years

of life.
Born October 2, 1923, Mother Ramsey's loving parents instilled in her

the values of patience and hard work, as they raised her and her 12

siblings in rural Laurel, Mississippi.
Her compassionate nature shined

through in everything she did, and she always held onto faith,

especially in trying times.
A move to Detroit in 1942 was pivotal for Mother Ramsey.
It wasn't

merely a change of address.
In Detroit, she witnessed the World War II

era, the Detroit race protests of 1943, the milestones of the Civil

Rights Movement, the profound impact of the 1967 Detroit Rebellion,

Detroit's first Black mayor, and the groundbreaking election of Barack

Obama.
Detroit was also where Bertha's path crossed with Burnett

Ramsey.
Together, they raised 4 children in a home full of love.
As the

family tree expanded to 8 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, and 6

great-great-grandchildren, Bertha emerged as the spiritual compass,

always emphasizing the importance of faith and kinship.
Please join me in wishing Mother Bertha Ramsey a happy 100th birthday

as we recognize her contributions to our community in Detroit.
