In 1975, distinguished members of the Los Angeles community encouraged her to seek election to the LAUSD School Board.
She won her election, and in this role, she worked to expand school integration and to raise the rigor of academic standards for all students.
In 1978, Congresswoman Watson became the first Black woman elected to the California State Senate, where she served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and as Chair of the Health and Human Services Committee from 1981 through 1998.
At the state level, she championed legislation for nutrition assistance programs, breast cancer research, and access to health care.
In 1999, President Clinton appointed Congresswoman Watson as the Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia, where she helped stop illegal toxic waste from being dumped into surrounding waters.
After her election to the House of Representatives in 2001, she served California's 33rd District faithfully for a decade, representing areas of Los Angeles that are now part of the 37th District.
Congresswoman Watson became a vocal leader on issues related to racism and xenophobia, supporting reparations for descendants of enslaved Americans, educational system reform, and a comprehensive overhaul of the nation's criminal justice system.
She also called out the rise of Islamophobia following the 9/11 attacks.
Her tenure as a legislator demonstrated a dedication to creating legislation and initiatives for the betterment of all.
Throughout her career, Congresswoman Watson was a trailblazer, building a legacy of mentorship, leadership, and strength for others to emulate in their own public service careers.
I am honored to commemorate her impact on communities throughout California and the

United States.
I hope you will join me in wishing Congresswoman Diane Watson a very happy birthday. ____________________
