When his mother tragically passed away from small-cell lung cancer, Michael turned his grief into action.
He rode in his first Pelotonia in 2010 and promised to ride every year until the battle against cancer is won or until he no longer can.
Michael's commitment to finding a cure for cancer has become an inspiration to his community and to all those who know him.
This year, Michael became the first individual rider in Pelotonia history to raise over $1 million for cancer research, raising $115,000 in 2023 alone, and was awarded the 2023 Pelotonia Legacy Award for his outstanding leadership.

Date: 2023-12-04 Volume: 169, Issue: 199 Pages: E1161 - E1161 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE TRAILBLAZING CONGRESSWOMAN DIANE WATSON IN CELEBRATION OF HER 90TH BIRTHDAY ______ of california in the house of representatives Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate former Ambassador and Congresswoman Diane Watson's 90th birthday.
Congresswoman Watson paved the way for the many Black female legislators, myself included, who would come after her.
She is a true trailblazer, becoming the first Black female member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board and the first Black female California State Senator.
Today we recognize her remarkable contributions to Los Angeles, the State of California, and the United States.
Born in Los Angeles, CA, Congresswoman Watson attended local Los Angeles public schools before earning her Bachelor's degree in Education from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), her Master's degree in School Psychology from California State University at Los Angeles (Cal State LA), and her PhD in Educational Administration from Claremont Graduate College.
Congresswoman Watson began her life of public service as an elementary school teacher and worked diligently up the ranks to become an assistant principal and a school psychologist, touching the lives of countless students.
She also served as a Health Education Specialist for Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), at UCLA, and at Cal State LA.
In 1975, distinguished members of the Los Angeles community encouraged her to seek election to the LAUSD School Board.
She won her election, and in this role, she worked to expand school integration and to raise the rigor of academic standards for all students.
In 1978, Congresswoman Watson became the first Black woman elected to the California State Senate, where she served on the Senate Judiciary Committee and as Chair of the Health and Human Services Committee from 1981 through 1998.
