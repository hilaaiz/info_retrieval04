Date: 2023-12-04 Volume: 169, Issue: 199 Pages: E1162 - E1162 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING JEANICE SWIFT'S SERVICE TO THE CHILDREN OF ANN ARBOR ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. Dingell.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeanice Swift, Superintendent of the Ann Arbor Public School system in Ann Arbor, MI for a decade of tremendous service.
Her daily passion and drive to improve the educational opportunities for all our area's children is worthy of commendation.
Dr. Swift came to AAPS in 2013 with more experience than most gain in a lifetime.
She earned a Bachelors and Masters in Education, as well as her Ph.D. in Educational Leadership.
Before she arrived in Michigan, Dr. Swift spent almost 30 years working her way up the educational ladder, beginning as a classroom teacher in Texas before moving to Colorado Springs, CO.
There, she was Assistant Principal, Principal, and Executive Director of her school district before taking the role as Assistant Superintendent.
Since coming on as Superintendent of AAPS in August of 2013, Dr. Swift has been a great asset to our students.
Her tenure has seen an increase in graduation rates, SAT scores, and a substantial reduction in suspension rates across the district.
Under her leadership, AAPS made significant expansions to its preschool and early learning programs as well as the adoption of a comprehensive LGBTQ policy.
Dr. Swift's strong leadership on behalf of our children cannot be understated.
In 2017, she was named as a Superintendent to Watch by the National School Public Relations Association and in 2018 she was named as the Michigan Superintendent of the Year.
In 2019, she worked on and successfully passed a $1 billion capitol bond for the district, the largest the state had seen in almost 30 years.
Faced with an unprecedented pandemic, Dr. Swift successfully navigated the district through two school years of staffing challenges, safety protocols, and a transition to remote-virtual schooling.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating all that Dr. Swift was able to accomplish for the children of Ann Arbor over her decade at the helm of AAPS.
Her work has set AAPS with a stronger base and a promising future.
We wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.
I thank Dr. Swift. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kerreen Conley as she ends her twelve-year tenure as Mayor of the City of Belleville, Michigan after serving her local Wayne County community for over three decades.
Her tremendous dedication to public service while also maintaining a full-time career is impressive and worthy of commendation.
Kerreen graduated from Central Michigan University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and Management before pursuing Master's degrees in Business Administration (MBA) and in Human Resources and Organizational Development from Eastern Michigan University.
She began her decades of public service in 1990, working as Controller for the City of Ypsilanti before becoming Belleville City Manager in 1995 and Novi's Director of Developmental Services in 1998.
Kerreen was successfully elected to the Belleville City Council in 2000, and was elected as the City's Mayor in late 2011.
After serving three consecutive terms, she decided not to seek re-election and plans to dedicate her full attention to Human Resources Consulting when her political tenure draws to a close.
Kerreen can look back on an accomplished mayoral record that truly benefitted her community.
