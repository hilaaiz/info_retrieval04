This broad range of understanding has made her an invaluable asset to the company and to Idaho's larger business community.
As a trained nurse herself, Charlene is keenly aware of the importance of ensuring communities have quality and affordable healthcare options.
Her innovative approach and her dedication to improving access to healthcare for all Idahoans has truly distinguished Charlene as a leader in the industry, as evidenced by her seat on the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association Board of Directors, her time as president of the Idaho Association of Health Plans, her participation as a member of the Boise Metro Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, and her contributions to various other state and national industry groups.
Charlene's contribution to Idaho's healthcare landscape throughout her time as CEO of Blue Cross of Idaho has been immense.
I am grateful for her work and wish her the best of luck in her retirement. ____________________

Hardy joined the 282nd Engineer Combat Battalion on July 16, 1943, and was one of many brave soldiers who risked their lives during the Second World War.
He fought valiantly in the battle of Saint-Malo and captured enemy submarine pens throughout his time on the Western front.
He also contributed to the liberation of the Ardennes, the Rhineland, Central Europe, and France.
During these grueling compaigns, Hardy consistently demonstrated fearlessness and determination.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the undefeated Florida State University Seminole football team, who recently secured the 2023 ACC Championship title.
Under Head Coach Mike Norvell's leadership, the Seminoles are 13-0 despite a devastating injury that prematurely ended the collegiate career of Quarterback Jordan Travis.
This team plays with their hearts, and it shows.
Throughout this season, they've displayed incredible grit, determination, and perseverance even when the odds were against them.
Sadly, the College Football Playoff Selection Committee failed to recognize this team's incredible talent by excluding them from the 2023-24 College Football Playoffs.
This was a devastating blow to the team and the city of Tallahassee, who proudly displayed the Seminole spirit all season.
It's a shame that an undefeated team, who earned every bit of their perfect season, won't get a shot in the College Football Playoffs.
Make no mistake, Florida's Second Congressional District knows our Seminoles are champions even if the selection committee denies them a chance to prove it.
I congratulate Florida State University on a perfect season.
I thank them for playing with their hearts and making our district proud.
Go Noles. ____________________
