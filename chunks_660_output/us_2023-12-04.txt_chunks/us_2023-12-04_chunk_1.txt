Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of my dear friend and constituent, Oscar Ortiz, a devoted organizer and champion for educational equity.
Oscar was a visionary: he fought for a just, inclusive future where everyone thrives.
He was a beloved husband, father, brother, son, and respected member of the Illinois Third Congressional District community.
Born in our great City of Chicago on April 21, 1962, to Benito and Mirta Ortiz, Oscar dedicated his life to empowering our community through education.
He believed that education was a powerful tool to build a just future.
He knew education could unlock our collective potential and enable us to realize our dreams.
With that in mind, Ortiz became an elementary and high school teacher, helping our young people find their power and joy in learning.
Whether it was at Jahn and Lowell Elementary Schools or Jefferson Alternative School, el maestro Ortiz was always present for all his students, their parents, and faculty.
His desire to serve our community and defend public education in Chicago led him to join the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) in May 2003, where he quickly became a committed and active member, never missing a meeting or event.
There, Oscar served as a sergeant-at-arms, as the Lowell delegate, and as a member of the Legislative Committees, always with the intention of advancing social justice and equity through education.
Oscar generously committed his time on earth to countless social justice causes.
He believed in the power of organized communities and worked tirelessly to build a better future for Chicago and our nation.
I, personally, will miss his calls to action and the way he could stir our passions and stoke our courage on the bullhorn at direct actions.
May his passion for change and love of community always guide us.
I will miss him dearly, and I know that countless others will, too.
He was a true, loyal friend.
His wife, Sabina; sons, Gabriel and Daniel; brother Ed; parents, Benito and Mirta; all his loved ones, and to the entire CTU family, are in my heart and in my prayers.
Together, as we mourn his passing, let us celebrate the blessing he was in all of our lives, the impact he had on our community, and the mark he has left in our great City of Chicago.
Oscar vive, la lucha sigue.
Rest in power, Oscar. ____________________
