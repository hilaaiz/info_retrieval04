CELEBRATING ``ELIZABETH'S'' AND ``THE OLDE PINK HOUSE''

HON.
EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER

Mr. CARTER of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate two

hardworking Georgia establishments that were named among the Nation's

top 100 restaurants.
Recently, the restaurant review website `Open Table' released its Top

100 Restaurants in America for 2023 list.
Both `Elizabeth's' and `The

Olde Pink House' made it on the list.
The review states that `Elizabeths' has ``Southern hospitality, fine

coastal cuisine, and well-chosen wines in a comfortable, elegant 1900

mansion have made Elizabeth on 37th a favorite destination in Savannah

since 1981.''
As far as the `Olde Pink House' goes, the review states it is

``Savannah's only 18th-century mansion [and] is famous for memorable

dining experiences featuring seafood caught daily in local waters,

prime aged beef, and traditional southern fare.''
Congratulations to these establishments, and I wish them both

continued success.

CONGRATULATING JAKE MERKLINGER AND RASHAWN TRUELL

HON.
EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER

Mr. CARTER of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two

Georgia quarterbacks--Calvary Day School's Jake Merklinger, and New

Hampstead High School's RaShawn Truell, for their tied win of the

Finocchiaro Award.
The Michael Finocchiaro Memorial Outstanding Football Player Award,

now in its 43rd year, crowns the standout high school player in

Savannah and Chatham County.
Remarkably, the recent award ceremony

marked only the second occasion in its history where two players tied

after voting concluded.
Merklinger, the senior quarterback who is committed to Tennessee,

also took home the Ashley Dearing Award as a junior, which is awarded

to the most versatile male high school athlete.
Truell says ``this a big honor for [him], especially as a junior, to

win this award.''
He followed that by stating, ``It show's that all the

hard work that I have put in has paid off.
But everything I work for is

to help our team--our goal is to win a state championship.''
Congratulations again to both Jake and RaShawn.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY CLARA WILLIAMS

HON.
JOE WILSON

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all South

Carolinians, I am grateful to wish Mrs. Clara Singleton Williams a

happy 100th birthday.
Clara Williams, a native of South Carolina, was born on April 9,

1924, to parents Isaiah Singleton and Annie Livingston Singleton.
She

attended schools in Fairfield, Aiken, and Orangeburg County, where she

graduated from Wilkerson High School.
After, she furthered her

education at Claflin University for two years.
In 1946, Clara married Blanton Everett Williams, and together they

had eleven children, twenty-nine grandchildren, forty-five great

grandchildren, and three great-great grandchildren.
They purchased land

and a home in Salley, South Carolina, where to this day Clara enjoys

watching her vegetables and flowers grow.
Blanton and Clara were

happily married for sixty-one years until his death in 2007.
Clara lives each day to the fullest with warm-hearted memories.
Over

the years, she has embraced diverse pursuits, including

cooking, canning, farming, quilting, and caring for babies, all while

dedicatedly managing her household and working for Aiken County Public

Schools.
Her spirit of generosity shines through in her unwavering

commitment to caring for others.
Whether tending to her own children

and many grandchildren or extending her kindness to members of her

community, Clara's compassion knows no bounds.
As a devout Christian, Clara acknowledged her faith at an early age

and was baptized at Good Hope Baptist Church in Ridgeway, South

Carolina.
She later became a member of Samaria Baptist Church in

Springfield, South Carolina, where she still faithfully attends.
Her

love for both her church and her family is palpable, evident in her

years of dedicated service to both.
