As a devout Christian, Clara acknowledged her faith at an early age

and was baptized at Good Hope Baptist Church in Ridgeway, South

Carolina.
She later became a member of Samaria Baptist Church in

Springfield, South Carolina, where she still faithfully attends.
Her

love for both her church and her family is palpable, evident in her

years of dedicated service to both.
At the age of 100, Clara has witnessed many significant landmarks of

American history: the Great Depression, World War II, Briggs v.

Elliott, Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the

Cold War,

9/11, and the first African American President of the United States.
Today, I honor Mrs. Clara Singleton Williams and wish her a happy

100th birthday.
I am pleased to join her family and friends in

congratulating her on this remarkable milestone.

HONORING DELTA MISSIONS

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a

remarkable organization, Delta Missions.
Delta Missions Ministry is a nonprofit Christian outreach

organization dedicated to advancing the gospel of Jesus Christ,

offering discipleship training to local residents, and empowering them

to actively engage in their local churches.
Our mission is to impact

lives and nurture spiritual transformation through weekly Bible

studies, lay training, recreational activities, and mentoring programs

tailored for youth, adults, and senior citizens.
Under the guidance of Reverend Herron Wilson, Delta Missions was born

out of a desire to replicate the impactful work experienced during his

time with The Sonflowers, a mission focused on Vacation Bible School

(VBS) camps in the town of Sunflower.
Upon returning to the Southgate

Community in

Indianola, Rev. Wilson identified an opportunity to utilize the vacant

Bethune Center at the heart of the community to launch a VBS camp.
The

Executive Director of South Delta Housing generously granted access to

the center without charge.
The inaugural VBS camp took place in the summer of 1995, drawing over

100 enthusiastic kids.
The overwhelming positive response led to the

transformation of the summer camp into a weekly gathering, providing

not only spiritual education but also recreational activities, arts and

crafts, and occasional outings for children and their families.
This grassroots initiative laid the foundation for Delta Missions,

which is proud to celebrate its 30th year of service to the Indianola

community this summer.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Delta

Missions for their passion and dedication to serving their community.
