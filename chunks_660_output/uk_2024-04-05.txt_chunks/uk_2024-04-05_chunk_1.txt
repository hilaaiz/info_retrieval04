CELEBRATING THIENSVILLE VILLAGE PRESIDENT VAN MOBLEY

HON.
GLENN GROTHMAN

Mr. GROTHMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the remarkable

leadership and service of Van Mobley, President of the Village of

Thiensville, whose unwavering dedication has significantly enriched the

lives of his constituents and propelled the progress of his community

over the last twelve years..

Throughout his dedicated career, Van Mobley has demonstrated an

extraordinary commitment to public service and community development.
His journey began in 2006 when he was appointed to the Village Board as

a Trustee, filling a vacant seat, and subsequently earning the trust of

his constituents through two additional three-year terms.
In 2012, he

was elected Village President, a position he has since held for four

consecutive three-year terms.
Under President Mobley's stewardship, Thiensville has experienced

remarkable growth and advancement.
His visionary leadership has spurred

significant infrastructure improvements and development projects

throughout the village.
Notably, he spearheaded the development on

South Main Street, overseeing crucial water infrastructure

installations and the establishment of key properties, including the

Thiensville Health Alliance, Reuter Insurance, and a new Village

parking lot.
His pivotal role in the Pigeon Creek flood control project

has been instrumental in safeguarding Main Street from flooding during

major rain events.
President Mobley's commitment to collaboration and intergovernmental

cooperation has been exemplified by his efforts to merge fire and EMS

services with the City of Mequon, resulting in the formation of the

Southern Ozaukee Fire and EMS Department.
This innovative partnership

has garnered recognition from the Wisconsin Policy Forum for its

effectiveness and efficiency.
Beyond infrastructure, President Mobley has overseen numerous

enhancements in Village Park, including the construction of the Port

Washington State Bank River Stage, new Comfort Station, playground

upgrades, and boat launch improvements.
Van Mobley's dedication to

preserving Thiensville's rich history and heritage is evident in his

personal investment in the historic Thiensville State Bank building on

Green Bay Road, which he purchased and meticulously renovated.
In recognition of his exceptional service and tireless efforts on

behalf of the residents of Thiensville, I extend my heartfelt gratitude

and congratulations to Van Mobley.
His accomplishments have had a

profound and lasting impact on the community, and I wish him continued

success in all his future endeavors.

CELEBRATING UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND PROFESSOR EMERITA DR.
ANN WYLIE'S

EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY

HON.
STENY H. HOYER

Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a great Marylander and

important member of our University of Maryland community celebrated her

eightieth birthday: Dr. Ann Wylie.
She has educated countless students

from across Maryland and America ever since she first became an

Assistant Professor for the University of Maryland's Department of

Agronomy in 1972.
The following year, she became a founding faculty

member of the University of Maryland's renowned Department of Geology.
From the President's Medal and the Scholar-Teacher Award at the

University of Maryland, College Park, to the Butler Prize awarded by

the Geological Society of Washington, Dr. Wylie has received widespread

acclaim for her research and leadership in academia.
Crucially, Dr.

Wylie has displayed a commitment to service that deserves the

admiration of every Member of this Congress.
Her work on how exposure

to minerals--including many mined in Maryland--affect human health has

helped us better safeguard the well-being of the American people.
Whether for the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. geological

survey, the U.S. Bureau of Mines, or the National Institute for

Occupational Safety and Health, she has made important contributions to

our government's understanding of these issues.
As a Terp, I'm also grateful for her leadership in the University of

Maryland, College Park's administration.
