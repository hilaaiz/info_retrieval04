When America entered the Second World

War, Mr. Picard enlisted in the United States Army.
He held the rank of

Technician Fifth Grade with Signal Company of the 23rd Headquarters

Special Troops.
This top-secret unit is now known fondly as the ``Ghost

Army.''
The 1,100-man unit was assigned a critical task: to mask and

misrepresent the whereabouts, trajectory, and strength of Allied forces

in Nazi-occupied France.
Operating in the European theater, the Ghost Army was engaged in

battlefield operations beginning in June of 1944.
The unit's deception

strategies were critical to many Allied victories across Europe,

including the D-Day landings.
As a Cryptographic Technician in Signal

Company, Mr. Picard employed ``spoof radio'' to confuse Axis forces and

conceal the movements of other Allied troops.
His efforts and those of

others in the Ghost Army saved countless American lives.
Thirty years after the war, a U.S. Army report noted: ``rarely, if

ever, has there existed a group of such few men, which had so great an

influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''
While aiding

the victory in Europe, the Ghost Army also laid the foundation for

modern defense strategies, on which our national security depends.
As

we confront present threats in psychological, cyber, and information

warfare, the legacy of the Ghost Army and soldiers like Mr. Picard

endures.
Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr. Picard

posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family, community, and

country.
On behalf of Louisiana's 3rd District, I thank Mr. Picard for

his service.
May God bless his family and his Veteran Brothers of the

Ghost Army.
