Famous

Kerrville names, including Hal Peterson and Howard Butt of the HEB

Grocery Company, donated resources to round out the construction and

supplies for Camp.
Over the years, the Camp adapted to allow other special-needs

children to participate.
Children living with blindness, hearing and

speaking disorders, and various crippled limbs all enjoyed Texas Lions

Camp together.
This defied the original prognostications of

psychologists in the 1950s, who believed children with varying

disabilities could not get along.
However, they learned to help each

other and combine their strengths to thrive.
Several hundred adult

blind were also trained at the Camp through a contract with the State

of Texas for a couple decades into the 1980s.
Every summer, children with physical handicaps such as diabetes, down

syndrome, polio, missing limbs, blindness, and other disabilities are

accommodated every year at a weeklong camp session at no cost to their

families.
Over 82,000 children have attended Texas Lions Camp since it

opened in 1949.
The Camp motto is ``All Can Do!''
Campers experience a

zip line, climbing wall, ropes course, fishing, boating, swimming,

archery, arts and crafts, miniature golf, and much more.
Therapeutic

horseback riding was added in the 1980s and became a favorite pastime

for campers.
A more recent addition is the family camping experience,

allowing the families of kids with special needs to experience Texas

Lions Camp.
On a more personal note, my grandfather was afflicted by polio, and

my grandmother was his devoted caregiver.
I will never forget their

sacrificial love for one another and my family.
I am grateful to the

eight hundred Texas Lions Clubs International that work tirelessly to

provide funds for children with special needs to attend Texas Lions

Camp.
