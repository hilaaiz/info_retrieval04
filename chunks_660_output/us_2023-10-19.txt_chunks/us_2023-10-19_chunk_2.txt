Rather, I have long held that many of the activities regulators have incorrectly allowed the offshore oil and gas industry to engage in using foreign-flagged vessels are clear violations of the plain text of the Jones Act and original Congressional intent.
It is now clear to me that the regulators at CBP are unwilling to fully implement the Jones Act, as directed by President Biden's Executive Order 14005.
My `Closing Agency Loopholes to the Jones Act' would finally force federal regulators to enforce the law as Congress intended in 1920, maximizing job opportunities for American mariners, U.S.-flagged vessels, and domestic shipyard workers.
In effect, my legislation would also compel CBP to implement the President's stated policy by fully enforcing the Jones Act.
On April 26, 2023, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure passed two key sections from my bill in the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2023'' (H.R. 2741 ).
Sections 8 and 9 from my bill are now incorporated as Section 312 (Notification) and Section 313 (Publication of Fines and Penalties) of H.R. 2741.
Section 312 requires foreign-flagged vessels purporting to operate under a Jones Act exemption to notify CBP and post online its legal basis for operating on the Outer Continental Shelf.
Currently, CBP uses an honor system for foreign vessels operating on the Outer Continental Shelf and their legal basis for doing, which undermines the agency's' ability to enforce the Jones Act properly and enables outright fraud.
Section 313 requires CBP to publish online any penalties against foreign-flagged vessels operating illegally on the Outer Continental Shelf, including for failing to notify the agency of the purported Jones Act exemption in advance.
For this Congress, I also require in my bill that offshore energy developers on the Outer Continental Shelf pay a prevailing wage.
Under current law, project developers operating in the United States' Exclusive Economic Zone at sea can pay poverty wages, exploiting foreign workers and undermining American mariners' ability to compete for this work.
After decades of failed promises, we are finally building the clean energy economy of the future.
American mariners are ready, willing, and able to work in the burgeoning offshore wind industry.
But they cannot be expected to compete against foreign-flag vessels paying poverty wages to workers with no legally guaranteed collective bargaining rights or labor standards.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I encourage all members of the House to cosponsor this critical and long overdue legislation. ____________________
HONORING KATHLEEN AND WILLIAM WISNEWSKI; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-10-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 172 Pages: E998 - E998 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING KATHLEEN AND WILLIAM WISNEWSKI ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. GARBARINO.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor a true Long Island ``power couple''--Kathleen and William Wisnewski--who are both retiring this year after distinguished multi-decade long careers at National Grid--the leading energy provider in my district.
Bill began his service at National Grid--then known as LILCO--in 1986 as a meter reader making $7.50 an hour.
A second-generation company employee, he put himself through night school and rose through the ranks as a gas and electric planner, field inspector, contractor supervisor, and finally field trainer, ensuring that future generations of National Grid employees will adhere to the same high standards and dedication he so diligently displayed over his long career.
Bill was also long active in IBEW Local 1049 at times serving as a shop steward and on the executive board, effectively representing his fellow employees through several acquisitions and successful contract negotiations.
Kathy started at the company in 1989 after graduating with a degree in business administration from Hofstra University.
Initially hired as an energy specialist in the conservation services department, Kathy climbed the corporate ladder at LILCO, Keyspan and now National Grid eventually ascending to Director of Customer and Community Relations for all of Long Island.
