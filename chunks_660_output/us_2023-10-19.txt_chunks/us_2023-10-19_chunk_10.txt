The theme for this year's festival is ``care,'' in which the artists will explore their personal interconnectivity with care for the environment, care for one's heritage, and strengthening one's identity.
I am proud of the Ismaili Council for Midwestern United States and the Midwest Ismaili Arts Festival organizers, Ismaili Artists and Ismaili Volunteers who dedicate their time, knowledge, and passion to promote the arts.
On behalf of the residents of the 9th District of the State of Illinois, I proudly recognize the impact of the Ismaili Arts Festival and its contributions to the State of Illinois' arts and cultural stage and celebrate this showcase of Illinois' diversity and commitment to inclusion. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to honor the Pancretan Association of America (PAA) on their many achievements throughout their 94 years of dedicated service.
I am thrilled to congratulate the PAA on the establishment of their first-ever National Headquarters at the Hellenic Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and on the recent election of their organization's first female president, Diane Kounalakis.
The PAA and the Pancretan Youth Association (PYA) offer a rich array of programs to cultivate and preserve the extraordinary heritage of the island of Crete.
The PAA and PYA have supported the enrichment and personal development of both Cretan Americans and the general public through educational events, study abroad scholarships, dance and music workshops, and translations of Greek literature.
The PAA also has a long and storied history of advancing essential causes on the island of Crete and throughout both Greece and the United States.
From helping to establish Crete's first public hospital in the 1950s to supporting orphanages, food pantries and disaster relief today, the PAA has made immense contributions.
I have no doubt that President Diane Kounalakis, a longtime PAA member and volunteer, will be an exemplary leader for the PAA.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding the PAA for its many decades of service, and in wishing the PAA all the best in the years to come. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO DR.

Date: 2023-10-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 172 Pages: E998 - E999 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E998-E999] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO DR.
IRIS SHANNON, NURSE, EDUCATOR AND ADMINISTRATOR ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I wish to pay my deepest respects to Dr. Iris Shannon--a nurse, educator and administrator.
I met and got to know Iris Shannon in the late 1960s when I began to work in healthcare, first at the Dr. Martin King Health Center, the Westside Health Planning Organization and Mile Square Health Center.
I knew Iris as a competent, involved nurse, as Director of Nursing at Mile Square, as Director of Nursing at Rush Medical Center and as a Nursing Professor at Rush Medical School.
The late 1960s and early 1970s were very serious health interest years and health activity due to the civil rights activity, changes in health law and the leadership of Democrats in government.
These changes in health took place at all levels of government and Iris was what I call an activist.
There were meetings about health all over the place and practically all of the time.
Iris was often present at many of these meetings, sharing her knowledge, her expertise and her wisdom.
Iris worked with nurse groups, administrative groups, community groups, women groups, black power group and the list goes on.
