Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is my privilege to recognize and honor the United States Air Force 555th Civil Engineering Squadron, ``Triple Nickel,'' as one of the original RED HORSE units for their distinguished service and commendable achievements during the Vietnam War.
In the thick of the Vietnam War, on October 1, 1965, the U.S. Air Force activated the first RED HORSE squadrons, notably the 555th and 554th Civil Engineering Squadrons (CES), which would soon earn their nicknames, ``Triple Nickel'' and ``Penny Short,'' respectively.
Initially designated as ``Prime BEEF Heavy Repair'' units, these squadrons quickly distinguished themselves, prompting leaders to coin the term ``RED HORSE,'' an acronym for Rapid Engineer Deployable, Heavy Operations Repair Squadron--Engineering.
Their mission was crucial--to establish a long-term civil engineering presence and provide major repair capabilities in the combat zones of Southeast Asia.
The deployment of RED HORSE units was a strategic move at a critical juncture in the war when the demands on Army and Navy construction units far exceeded their capacity.
With the Army and Navy construction forces fully engaged, RED HORSE units emerged to fill the need.
Upon deployment to Cam Ranh Air Base, South Vietnam, the Triple Nickel unit immediately began operations by hitting the beach with supplies and heavy equipment.
Civil engineer units from across the United States were assigned to various Air Force installations throughout Vietnam, including Cam Ranh, with some of the most distinguished officers and airmen being selected for RED HORSE duty.
The 1969 roster that served in the 555th CES was composed of four hundred civil engineer personnel, arriving in Vietnam at the height of the war and responding to urgent infrastructural needs following the Tet Offensive of 1968.
which delivered damaging blows to American installations up and down the peninsula.
Cam Rahn Air Base required significant infrastructure to sustain the war effort--from paved landing strips to dormitory housing for the troops.
Triple Nickel not only repaired and constructed new facilities on Cam Ranh Air Base but also saw action at various American and Vietnam installations throughout the peninsula--from the Delta to the DMZ.
In Vietnam, over two thousand RED HORSE troops deployed annually where they built both horizontal and vertical facilities to support the Air Force's mission and engaged in numerous humanitarian projects for local communities.
As the Vietnam War began to wind down in the early 1970s there were calls to deactivate units that had been formed during the war.
However, thanks to the foresight of certain military and Congressional leaders who recognized the inherent value RED HORSE provides to the Air Force in both peace and war, multiple units remain in National Guard and Reserve organizations.
In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, the bonds formed during the conflict were not only maintained but strengthened.
Now, veterans of Triple Nickel who served together in Vietnam occasionally gather to celebrate the friendships, accomplishments, and bonds that were forged in the challenging environment of a war-torn country.
It is my distinct honor to recognize the 555th Civil Engineering Squadron, ``Triple Nickel,'' for the critical role they held in the Vietnam War and the enduring bond they maintain today. ____________________
