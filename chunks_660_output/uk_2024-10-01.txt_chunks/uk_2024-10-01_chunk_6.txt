His pledge to champion values of support and sacrifice

exemplifies American patriotism.
Born in Texas, Donald received his draft notice in October 1965 and

joined the Army to serve during the Vietnam War.
He underwent basic

training at Fort Carson, Colorado, before being deployed to the front

lines in Vietnam.
While overseas, he carried out critical operations

vital to his unit's success, such as establishing forward base camps

and managing supply runs.
His efforts were essential in maintaining the

operational effectiveness of his fellow soldiers under challenging and

often perilous conditions.
One fateful night, while stationed at a listening post outside the

perimeter, Specialist Johnson and three other soldiers were struck by a

mortar round.
Despite being severely injured, he remained composed and

took actions that saved lives under extreme adversity.
For his

extraordinary courage and selflessness in the face of danger, he was

awarded the Purple Heart, a testament to his bravery and dedication.
After returning to Texas, Donald channeled his entrepreneurial spirit

into building a successful Pepperidge Farm franchise in Houston.
Upon

selling the business, he returned to Limestone County to operate a

cattle ranch, applying the same dedication and hard work that

characterized his military service.
His commitment to his community

remained strong; he drove a school bus for the Groesbeck Independent

School District, serving as an inspirational mentor to many young

people.
Additionally, he worked as a jailer at the Limestone County

Jail, where he continued to positively influence lives through his

mentorship.
Donald's military honors include the Purple Heart, the Rifle

Sharpshooter qualification, the Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze

Service Stars, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the National

Defense Service Medal.
These accolades reflect his commitment to

excellence and the sacrifices he made during his service.
He is part of a remarkable family legacy of service; his four

brothers, Charles, Foy, Edwin, and Cecil, also served in the military,

each risking their lives for their country.
This collective dedication

underscores their character and commitment to the Nation.
I am honored to award Donald Gene Johnson with a Congressional

Veteran Commendation.
His life of service and dedication embodies the

spirit of American patriotism, demonstrating an unwavering commitment

to his country and community.
