When that Constitution first became effective in 1977, Dr. Camacho

was elected the first Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern

Mariana Islands and took office on January 9, 1978.
During his term as governor, Dr. Camacho fought against the

implementation of gambling in our islands, was a leading voice

protesting nuclear waste dumping in the Pacific, and managed the

transition from governance by the United Nations Trust Territory of the

Pacific Islands to self-government by the people of the Marianas.
He was a strong advocate for our newly formed Commonwealth government

throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
In the capitol of the Nation

we chose to join, he forged a special working relationship with U.S.

Congressman Phillip Burton, who had been instrumental behind the scenes

in negotiating the Marianas Covenant of Political Union with the United

States and who won approval for the Covenant in just three days' time

After serving one term as governor, Dr. Camacho retired from public

service in 1981 and went into private business.
Dr. Camacho is married to Lourdes Winefreda Ito Pangelinan.
They

share seven children: Carla, Mona Lynn, Carlos Patrick, Kevin Frank,

Francine, Jiana, and Franklin Luis; four grandchildren: Carlos Joe,

Liana Margaret, Lucas Patrick, and Leia Rose.
His own early life experiences as a colonial subject of the Japanese

empire and witness to the ravages of war greatly shaped Dr. Camacho's

commitment to public service.
His example of learning and service

inspires us today and is a legacy he leaves for future generations in

the Northern Mariana Islands and beyond.
