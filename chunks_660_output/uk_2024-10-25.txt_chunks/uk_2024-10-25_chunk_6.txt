RECOGNIZING METRA COMMUTER RAILROAD'S 40TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
SEAN CASTEN

Mr. CASTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Metra Commuter

Railroad on its 40th anniversary of providing reliable, affordable, and

safe transportation services throughout the state and for residents of

Illinois' 6th Congressional District.
In the last forty years, Metra has made significant progress

revitalizing and rebuilding stations, tracks, and signals, purchasing

new locomotives and railcars, and modernizing and stabilizing and

expanding services across the region.
Metra also provided a crucial

lifeline during the global pandemic.
I commend Metra on these advancements and was proud to lead the

Illinois Delegation's support efforts for its recent Federal Transit

Administration's Rail Vehicle Replacement Program grant application.
Metra was selected as one of only three recipients nationwide to

receive a grant.
This $100 million federal investment will support the

procurement of new, multi-level railcars to replace those from the

1970s and improve the safety, comfort, and accessibility to all

passengers boarding Metra trains.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying tribute to the dedicated

professionals at Metra who have continuously serviced Illinois with

vital transportation as they celebrate forty years of service.
I thank

Metra Commuter Railroad, and wish them a happy anniversary.

RECOGNIZING MONTGOMERY TOWNSHIP POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF J. SCOTT

BENDIG'S RETIREMENT AFTER 35 YEARS OF SERVICE

HON.
BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary

public servant, Chief J. Scott Bendig, on the occasion of his

retirement from the Montgomery Township Police Department after 35

years of dedicated service to the Montgomery Township community and the

field of law enforcement.
Chief Bendig was born and raised in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.
He

began his journey into public service by graduating from Bishop

McDevitt High School in 1985.
He then pursued higher education, earning

a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice from Temple University followed

by his completion of the Pennsylvania State Police Academy.
Chief

Bendig's passion for law enforcement was matched by his commitment to

continuous learning, as evidenced by his earning a Master's Degree in

Criminal Justice from West Chester University and his graduation from

the prestigious FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia.
These

experiences further solidified his credentials as a leader in public

safety.
Chief Bendig dedicated his entire 35-year career in law enforcement

to the residents of Montgomery Township.
During his tenure, he rose

through the ranks, starting as a Recruit Patrol Officer in 1989 before

serving as a Canine Officer and Unit Supervisor, Corporal in 2000,

Sergeant in 2001, and eventually Deputy Chief in 2010.
In 2012, he

became Chief of Police, where he embodied professionalism integrity,

and a tireless commitment to the safety of the community.
His auxiliary duties included serving as a DARE Officer, DARE Officer

in Charge, and Field Training Officer, as well as creating and

instructing the Citizens Police Academy and teaching at various police

academies.
Chief Bendig's commitment to education extended to the

classroom.
He worked as an Adjunct Faculty member at Gwynedd Mercy

University, and as a General Instructor for the Municipal Police

Officer Education and Training Commission for over a decade.
These

teaching roles highlight his dedication to nurturing the next

generation of law enforcement professionals.
Under Chief Bendig's leadership, the Montgomery Township Police

Department experienced significant advancements in both its operational

capabilities and technology infrastructure.
One of his most impactful

initiatives was the implementation of the Body Worn Camera system, a

crucial tool for promoting transparency and accountability.
He also led

the deployment of Fixed License Plate Readers, which enhanced the

department's ability to monitor and respond to criminal activity more

effectively.
Chief Bendig's leadership extended far beyond the borders of

Montgomery Township.
He served as Commander of the Montgomery County

Major Incident Response Team, playing a key role in handling critical

incidents across the region.
