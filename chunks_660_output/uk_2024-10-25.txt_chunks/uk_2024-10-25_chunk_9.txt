RECOGNIZING RUSSELL MATAR AS VETERAN OF THE MONTH

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary

life of Russell Matar, who I named Veteran of the Month for October

from Michigan's 9th Congressional District.
Born on October 18, 1924,

in Port Huron, Michigan, Russell was the second of five children.
His

journey began with resilience and dedication, culminating in his

graduation from Port Huron High School in 1942, before he enlisted in

the United States Navy in 1943.
His service during World War II took

him to the

Mojave Desert, where he contributed to vital rocket experiments, and to

the Marshall Islands, where he repaired aircraft electronics.
He was

honorably discharged in 1946.
In 1954, Russell married Ginger McDaniel, and together they built a

loving family, raising two sons and a daughter, along with a growing

number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Russell's professional career spanned over three decades with

Montgomery Ward, where he made significant contributions throughout the

Midwest.
His commitment to community service was unwavering; he

actively participated in local Chambers of Commerce and Merchants

Associations.
In Flint, Michigan, where he spent his later career,

Russell left an indelible mark on the community.
Notably, he served as

Chairman of a committee that collaborated with then-Mayor Jim

Rutherford to plan the inaugural Crim Race in Flint.
Additionally, he

dedicated six years to the Whaley Board for Children and served on the

board of the YMCA.
As a devoted member of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Flint, Russell

held the position of Vestry member and worked alongside First

Presbyterian Church and Court Street United Methodist Church to

establish the Ministry of Crossover Outreach.
This initiative addressed

the needs of the local community by providing clothing, food, and

referral services.
Throughout his remarkable century-long life, Russell Matar has

exemplified the core values of family, community, and service.
His

legacy of steadfast support and commitment to those around him truly

sets him apart.
I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating the

life of Russell Matar, a true pillar of our community and a shining

testament to the enduring spirit of service.

THE INVASIVE SPECIES RESPONSE ACT

HON.
ED CASE

Mr. CASE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a critical and growing

challenge that severely impacts our environment and has widespread

ripple-effect consequences beyond: invasive species.
This challenge threatens the delicate balance of our ecosystems, as

invasive species can outcompete, prey on or introduce diseases to our

native flora and fauna.
