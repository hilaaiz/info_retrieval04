Showing true sacrifice and dedication to his family, John decided to leave his career at NASA in order to preserve his family's seafood business: Graham & Rollins.
Keeping the spirit of a true family business, John brought his children and wife Sandra Graham to work alongside him, further cementing how his family was always a top priority.
As President of Graham & Rollins, John expanded the company threefold, leaving a family legacy to his children and grandchildren.
During his successful career within the family business, John also took the time to mentor his sons and grandsons in wrestling.
Due to his mentorship, his sons were able to blossom in the sport and each hold notable records.
With a renewed sense of love for the sport, John had a vision to expand the fan base of wrestling.
That's why he helped create the Peninsula Wrestling Association as well as founding the Virginia Duals.
He even went on to serve as the team leader for the Olympic wrestling team in 1988 and 1996.
Due to his contributions to the sport, John was awarded the Order of Merit for the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and was inducted into both the Virginia Wrestling and Lower Peninsula Halls of Fame.
John will always be known for his devotion to his family, his love for sports, and his unwavering commitment to give back to his community.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing John Graham, Jr. and to thank his wonderful family for giving me the pleasure of acknowledging

him and recognizing the kindness he shared with the world around him. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Keller City Manager, Mark Hafner, who is retiring after more than four decades of public service.
At just 18 years old, Mr. Hafner started his career as a police officer.
In 2001, he moved his family to Texas to lead the Keller Police Department as the Chief of Police.
Under his watch, Keller's first Crime Control and Prevention District sales tax was passed, allocating a portion of the tax dollars toward ensuring public safety.
Keller Police Department also earned its state and national accreditations and forged cutting-edge partnerships in 911 dispatch, animal services, detention, municipal court services, and policing with the cities of Colleyville, Roanoke, Southlake, and Westlake.
He also oversaw two major police station expansions and renovation projects.
After 14 years as the Chief of Police, including three as Keller's Director of Public Safety, Mr. Hafner was promoted to the organization's top spot in June 2015 as the City Manager.
In this position, he's overseen historic investments in public infrastructure, parks, and recreation amenities, helped attract vibrant commercial development, and worked to ensure Keller's long-term financial security.
The new Keller Senior Activities Center and renovations to Fire Stations 2 and 3 were also completed under his tenure.
I Thank Mr. Hafner for all he has done to protect and serve the people of North Texas.
His career has been marked by a commitment to excellence, service and innovation.
I congratulate him on his well- deserved retirement, he will be missed. ____________________
