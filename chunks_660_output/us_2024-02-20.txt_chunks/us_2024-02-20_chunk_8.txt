A devoted husband and Christian, Keith embodied 1 Corinthians 16:13-14 in every way that he lived his life, especially in the public square as a legislator: ``Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith, be courageous; be strong.
Do everything in love.''
Education remains one of the most important pillars of our society today.
Keith recognized that high-quality and well-funded education gave each child the best chance at an impactful life.
Keith's faith and his

family provided Keith with his ``North Star'' as he used his gifts and abilities to make life better for all of those around him.
Even into his later years, Keith was on campus at local high schools teaching and coaching basketball.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in Congress join me in remembering and honoring the life of a faithful man in Keith King whose impact in the Pikes Peak region will be felt for the rest of time. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE McINTIRE-STENNIS ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
32



Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E164 - E164 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE McINTIRE-STENNIS ACT DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the McIntire-Stennis Act District of Columbia Equality Act, which would correct an apparent oversight in the exclusion of the District of Columbia from eligibility for funding under the McIntire-Stennis Act.
The Act provides the states and certain territories with formula funding to support state designated institutions' cooperative forestry research programs.
The funding available under this Act assists the states and territories in carrying out forestry research programs at state forestry schools and colleges and developing a trained pool of forest scientists capable of conducting needed forestry research.
District of Columbia residents pay full federal taxes and therefore District of Columbia is treated as a state under federal programs, with limited exceptions.
The Act defines ``State'' to include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Guam, whose residents do not pay full federal taxes.
D.C.'s exclusion from the Act makes it ineligible for federal funding that would support research at D.C.'s public university, the University of the District of Columbia (UDC).
The College of Agriculture, Urban Sustainability and Environmental Sciences at UDC, the nation's only urban land-grant university, offers programs that complement D.C.'s ongoing forestry efforts and serve individuals in D.C. and beyond.
Rectifying D.C.'s exclusion from the Act would ensure equal treatment for D.C. and provide UDC a fair share of resources.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK AND BLACK HISTORY MONTH; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
32



Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E163 - E163 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK AND BLACK HISTORY MONTH ______ of ohio in the house of representatives Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the more than 160,000 Black-owned employer businesses in the U.S. during National Entrepreneurship Week.
Black businessowners experience pervasive barriers to accessing capital--more than any other demographic.
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, two-thirds of Black employers seek financing to expand business operations, yet half of them are denied loans and lines of credit.
Micael Habte is the owner of Upper Cup Coffee, an Eritrean-based coffee shop and wholesale coffee supplier located in the Old Towne East neighborhood of Columbus.
Despite capital challenges due to COVID-19, today Micael is running two cafes, and a coffee kiosk, and has even expanded his roasting facility.
I'm proud of the fortitude businessowners like Micael have displayed, and I urge my colleagues to closely consider the challenges faced by Black entrepreneurs.
We must work together to build a stronger, more equitable economy for all. ____________________
