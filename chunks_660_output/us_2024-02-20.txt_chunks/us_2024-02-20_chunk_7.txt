He was always willing to provide counsel and advice which I deeply appreciated.
Twenty years later he supported my election to the U.S. Congress, which was so special and meaningful to me.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to immortalize him today.
He has been a great inspiration not just for me, but for his family, community, and beyond.
His loss is deeply felt by his family members, including his wife, Ellen Schopfer Burke; his sons, Matthew, Jonathan, Andrew, and Sullivan Burke, and their wives; his sister, Susan Evans Burke, and his cousin Mary Jane Dempsey.
He will also be missed by the community at large, which has seen many improvements directly due to Bo's efforts and deep commitment to others.
His deep and nuanced understanding of the law assisted many constituents in defending their rights as American citizens.
I am grateful to know that Bo's legacy will carry

on within and beyond my district, as others follow in his footsteps. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFE OF KEITH KING; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
32



Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E163 - E163 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF KEITH KING ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to honor the life, legacy, and faith of Keith King, who died of pancreatic cancer on February 3, 2024, at the age of 75.
Keith was a champion for the Pikes Peak region as a successful and generous business entrepreneur, elected official, and advocate for school choice and charter schools.
Keith had a tremendous impact on those around him, but it was only possible because he was driven and directed by his love for Jesus Christ and his family.
Keith King was truly a giant in advancing policies that helped families, children, schools, and the state of Colorado.
In addition to being a personal colleague in the Colorado legislature for seven years and a brother in Christ, Keith was my friend.
Born in Tekoa, Washington, Keith moved to Colorado and completed his bachelor's degree at Colorado State University, Pueblo in industrial education in 1970.
He continued his education at Oregon State University in 1976 with a master's degree in vocational education.
It was through his studies that his already budding desire to see children succeed in school and have as many education choices as possible available to them bloomed.
Keith served on the Cheyenne Mountain School board from 1991 to 1995; and was president of Cheyenne Mountain Charter Academy, which he co-founded, from 1995 to 1998.
Keith also started Colorado Springs Early Colleges and Colorado Early Colleges which provided high schoolers the opportunity to take college classes and receive job training.
Education choice and specifically the emergence and growth of charter schools in Colorado became one of Keith's main passions in his legislative career.
First elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1999, Keith's first year in the legislature showed immediate results.
During his first session in office, Keith was the lead sponsor of two bills that improved charter school structures and operations that were signed into law.
This impressive success record was only the beginning of Keith's impact on Colorado.
Keith sponsored the annual school finance act three times and sponsored the landmark College Opportunity Fund which created substantial change to the funding system for public colleges and universities.
Keith and his wife Sandi of more than fifty years enjoyed the blessings of their sons Jeremy and Brandon, their families, and their five grandchildren.
A devoted husband and Christian, Keith embodied 1 Corinthians 16:13-14 in every way that he lived his life, especially in the public square as a legislator: ``Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith, be courageous; be strong.
Do everything in love.''
Education remains one of the most important pillars of our society today.
