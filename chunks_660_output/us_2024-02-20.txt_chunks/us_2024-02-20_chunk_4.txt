Don first arrived at Citizens National Bank as a Management Trainee in 1976, under the guidance of former bank president Clay Davis.
From there he climbed the banking ladder as auditor, comptroller, and cashier, until he was promoted to President and CEO in 2007, where he has guided the bank and the local community through unexpected changes in technology and financial shifts ever since.
Clay encouraged Don to learn every aspect of the industry through advanced educational opportunities, strengthening the future of the institution he serves and the local community.
May his life's story be an inspiration to our aspiring youth who hope to one day follow in Don's footsteps, working hard from the family farm to become the local bank president in their hometown.
We can all make a difference in our communities, like Don Bloomer, with a tireless work ethic and sheer resolve to make this region a better place to live.
My wife Cynthia and I deeply appreciate the loyal friendship of Don and Rhonda Bloomer, and we wish them the most joyful years of retirement in the years ahead.

Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E163 - E163 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ERNA JE'NEEN FRENCH ______ of missouri in the house of representatives Ms. BUSH.
Mr. Speaker, I, along with the people of St. Louis, rise to honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Erna Je'Neen French.
Erna was a giant in the gospel community, a mother, grandmother, and sister who dedicated her life to spreading the joy and love of God through her powerful voice.
Erna professed her devotion to Jesus Christ at the early age of five, and she knew she would one day be a famous gospel singer.
Inspired by her mother Lavera, gospel music was always central to Erna's life.
Erna was a scholar of spiritual hymns, and she understood the weight those verses carried.
Before the age of 12, Erna recorded three national gospel records with the Thomas A. Dorsey National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses under the St. Louis Gospel Choral Union, the O'Neal Twins, and the Stan Lee Gospel Music Workshop.
Later in her life, Erna recorded with numerous artists and ministries nationally and internationally and was a member of the Gospel Music Workshop of America, the Sanctified POSSE, GEMCA, Dello Thedford and the Gospel Symphonic Choir, Rusty Watson, One Voice, the Psalms of David, and countless other ministries.
In 2018, Erna accomplished a lifelong dream releasing her project ``Always'' with the help of Levi Too King.
A student of the University City School District, she was a proud member of the graduating class of 1985.
In 1986, Erna began a career as a professional driver.
She drove school buses until 1998 when she joined the Bistate Development Agency/Metro St. Louis Transit Agency, from which she retired in 2021.
Most importantly, Erna loved spending time with her family.
Her daughter Alysha De'Nise French and grandson CJ were the lights of her life.
Erna shared her deep passion for gospel music with her older sister, Monica.
I offer my deepest condolences on behalf of Missouri's First District to Erna's entire family and all those who loved her. ____________________
