The agency literally delegated regulatory decisions and inspections to deputized Boeing employees on the factory floor and in the design offices.
Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers made sure that Congress did not object and indeed had Congress facilitate this delegation, including by keeping the FAA's regulatory budget and skilled staff too small to regulate directly and forcefully.
Nonetheless, with astute and newsworthy press conferences and accurate responsiveness to media inquiries, the families pushed the FAA to be a little more hands-on and probing than it was up to 2019.
When the punitive damage bill passed the Illinois legislature, Governor Pritzker had 60 days to either sign it or let it become law.
He chose to sign it on August 12th without any ceremony, without having Nadia, the young Assemblyman Ford and other senior state lawmakers by his side.
Had he made it an event, he would have memorably conveyed the key motivating belief in a democracy--that one person can make a difference!
Citizen Nadia blazed the way, shaming the foot-dragging Illinois Trial Lawyers Association (ITLA) into jumping on the bandwagon in Springfield once the bill's momentum grew.
On February 27, 2023, I wrote a letter to the President of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association, Patrick A. Salvi II, wondering why the ITLA hadn't pushed this initiative over many past years and urged them to ``make the maximum effort to secure passage.''
Trial Lawyer Associations do not usually answer letters, but this one got through, with copies to other interested parties. (
See the letter here).
Our country, over time, has been helped immeasurably by outraged mothers (and fathers) turning their unabating mourning over the loss of their children into laser beam intensity behind health and safety laws to save other parents and children from similar

tragedies. (
Note e.g., Mothers Against Drunk Driving).
These civic heroes defy all odds to challenge and prevail.
The odds don't faze them; they have a higher calling to achieve.
Unfortunately, neither Governor Pritzker nor the mass media seized this dramatic moment for exemplary recognition.
The law, however, now is on the books to further more humane and deterrent purposes, thanks ``to that Lady from New England who shamed us all.'' ____________________

Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E167 - E167 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DON BLOOMER ______ of kentucky in the house of representatives Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my good friend, Mr. Don Bloomer, who is retiring after nearly 50 years of service at Citizens National Bank in Somerset, Kentucky.
Over the last five decades, Don has been a trusted leader in the Lake Cumberland area, dedicating countless hours of volunteer service to other community entities, and helping local families and businesses reach or exceed their financial goals.
Raised on a small farm in Pulaski County, Don knew the value of hard work and loyalty from an early age.
His life's dream was to be a successful citizen in his hometown community and a strong family man, both of which he has accomplished through diligent work and compassion.
Don first arrived at Citizens National Bank as a Management Trainee in 1976, under the guidance of former bank president Clay Davis.
From there he climbed the banking ladder as auditor, comptroller, and cashier, until he was promoted to President and CEO in 2007, where he has guided the bank and the local community through unexpected changes in technology and financial shifts ever since.
Clay encouraged Don to learn every aspect of the industry through advanced educational opportunities, strengthening the future of the institution he serves and the local community.
