Additionally, as Assistant to the Pastor, Minister Ware began the process and coordinated training with Middle Georgia Food Bank to establish Macedonia as a local agency to establish a food bank

on church grounds.
Minister Ware has been recognized numerous times for his professional achievements.
He is a recipient of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Certificate of Commendation, and Letter of Appreciation.
He was recognized by the Middle-Georgia Black Pages as a Young Entrepreneur and Professional in 2019 and was also nominated for Leadership Macon in 2022, a year-long program that introduces a class of rising community leaders to the successes and challenges in Macon- Bibb County's public, private, and nonprofit sectors.
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm once said that ``Service is the rent that we pay for the space that we occupy here on this earth.''
Belvin Ware has paid his rent many times over and still continues to give a prodigious amount of love and service back to his community.
He is currently the Executive Director for Heal the Hood Empowering Movement, a community initiative to cure violence and to bring economic power back to the Macon community through mentoring, job placement, and prison reform.
He is also a Co-founder of the Concord Project which is a partnership between the local clergy and the Bibb County Sheriff's Office.
Minister Ware has accomplished many things in his life, but none of it would have been possible without the enduring love and support of his loving wife of over fifteen years, Aisha N. Ware, as well as his sons, Kingston Josiah and Kingsley Uriah.
Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, in recognizing and commending Minister Belvin D. Ware, on his continued service as the newly appointed Pastor of Macon, Georgia's Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E166 - E166 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING JOHN GRAHAM, JR. ______
of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the late John Graham, Jr. as the committed family man he was and will continue to be in memory.
While at Poquoson High School, he won notable achievements such as: becoming Virginia's Boys State Representative, being elected President of his Senior class, and was a brilliant athlete.
John was such a brilliant athlete he not only received the role of Captain his junior and senior years of high school, he also was recognized as ``Little All American'' during his football career in college.
His drive to play and contribute to his teams got him inducted into the RMC Hall of Fame in 2015.
While working for NASA he was a fundamental contributor to groundbreaking missions.
John was critical in developing and building the budding space program, even working alongside the original astronauts.
He also held crucial roles in the development of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space programs.
Unfortunately, right before John was eligible to retire from NASA, he was confronted with a decision that would change his life forever.
His father was fighting through a tough battle with pancreatic cancer and asked John to take over the family business in his stead.
Showing true sacrifice and dedication to his family, John decided to leave his career at NASA in order to preserve his family's seafood business: Graham & Rollins.
Keeping the spirit of a true family business, John brought his children and wife Sandra Graham to work alongside him, further cementing how his family was always a top priority.
As President of Graham & Rollins, John expanded the company threefold, leaving a family legacy to his children and grandchildren.
