Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of my friend, Bill Brand, Mayor of Redondo Beach.
Mayor Brand passed away on fought stage-four lung cancer over the past four and a half years, while remaining in office.
He survived his specific cancer longer than any other diagnosed in the United States.
Bill Brand was born in Dallas, Texas, and moved to the South Bay region of Los Angeles County in 1966.
He vividly remembered his first sight of the Seaside Lagoon and called it ``finding heaven.''
Bill dedicated his life to serving people.
He saw the need to champion access to open space for South Bay residents and created a non-profit organization in 2004, the South Bay Parkland Conservancy, which is dedicated to the restoration, preservation, and public use of coastal land resources in the South Bay.
This organization continues to grow and serve our coastal communities as a steward of our environment, carrying on Bill's legacy.
Bill Brand expanded on his work in public service, first as a Member of the Redondo Beach City Council, and finally as Mayor, a position he served until his last day.
He was a fierce advocate for many environmental and coastal priorities, and it was a great honor to work with him to champion these issues.
Bill is survived by his loving wife, Deirdre.
He served his community fervidly despite the difficulty of his condition.
His tremendous will was a demonstration of his love and dedication for his community.
He was a remarkable public servant, and it was a privilege to know him and call him a friend.
May his memory live on in his many contributions to the community. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF MARTIN "BO" BURKE; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 32 Pages: E164 - E165 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E164-E165] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND CAREER OF MARTIN ``BO'' BURKE ______ of connecticut in the house of representatives Mr. COURTNEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of one of Connecticut's great leaders in our state's legal profession and government who sadly passed recently, Mr. Martin ``Bo'' Byran Burke.
A true gentleman, Bo represented thousands of clients, guiding them expertly through legal difficulty and, at times, crisis.
The positive impact he made on countless individuals, families, and small businesses is incalculable.
He also enthusiastically participated in politics and government out of both a sense of civic duty and his abiding devotion to our democracy and constitution.
Born in 1940 to Edmond and Francis Burke, Bo was a true son of New England.
His passion for his community and region defined his life's choices.
After graduating from Colgate University with a Bachelor's in English, Bo continued his studies as he pursued a Juris Doctor from Albany School of Law.
Although Bo's first foray into law was in New York State, he soon returned to his home state, passing the Connecticut Bar Exam in 1968.
Bo's career as a lawyer was long, eventful, and widely respected.
His work ethic was unparalleled, and he was modest about his accomplishments.
His small-town practice in Vernon, Connecticut was always centered on representing people, not large institutional clients.
Today that model might be viewed by some as out of date, but Bo knew that such representation is at the heart of the oath he took when he was admitted to the bar.
Bo was also committed to improving the profession.
