of arkansas in the house of representatives Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and heroism of U.S. Army Specialist Charlie Simpson, Jr. Mr. Simpson was drafted into the United States Army in 1968 and went to Basic Training in Fort Ord, California.
After Basic Training, he successfully completed Advanced Infantry Training and later, Jump Training School.
He then received orders to join our brave soldiers in Vietnam.
Mr. Simpson was injured on November 1, 1969, while serving the United States of America, and he was hospitalized in Japan for 30 days.
He returned home to the U.S. in December 1969, and recuperated at the Fitzsimons General Hospital in Denver, Colorado, for 1 year.
As a result of his combat service-connected injuries, Mr. Simpson lost both of his legs.
He received an honorable discharge in 1970, and he was recognized for his tremendous service with the awarding of a Purple Heart and other prestigious medals.
With such serious injuries, some would have given up, but that's not Charlie Simpson's way.
After his discharge from the Army, Mr. Simpson returned home to Malvern, Arkansas, where he met his wife, Brenda, and where they made a tremendously full life together.
The Simpsons have 5 children: Aaronda McNair and her husband, Tony, Veronica Rose and her husband, Cletis, Charlie Simpson, III and his wife, Nikya, Leticia Franklin and her husband, Kevin, and their dearly beloved, deceased son, Aaron Simpson.
They have also been blessed with 11 grandchildren and 2 great- grandchildren to carry-on the legacy of their brave grandfather and great-grandfather.
Mr. Speaker, we often mention the sacrifices our men and women in uniform and their families make for our country, and rightly so.
But today, along with our thanks, let us also celebrate the good work and contributions these soldiers, airmen, and marines have made in their communities.
I would like to thank Specialist Simpson for his tremendous sacrifice for our nation and wish him well as he continues working for the people of Malvern, Arkansas.
All Arkansans are eternally grateful for his service. ____________________
