Her dedication and commitment to serving her country is evident in her 30-plus years of active service, during which she exemplified the highest standards of professionalism and excellence.
For her service, she was awarded three Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, two National Defense Service medals, the Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Good Conduct Medal, and the Humanitarian Service Medal.
Since she retired from active duty in 1998, Lieutenant Commander Robertson's passion for helping others has not waned.
Since settling down in Easley, South Carolina, she has continued to contribute to her community as a volunteer at Easley Baptist Hospital, selflessly giving her time and expertise to assist those in need.
Her humility and willingness to serve are attributes that make her an invaluable member of her community.
Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant Commander Judith Robertson's tireless dedication and unwavering commitment to service, in both the United States Navy and Easley Baptist Hospital, have left a lasting impact on my constituency.
It is a privilege to celebrate the service of Lieutenant Commander Robertson and the barriers she has broken through her service in the United States Navy.
This has made her an inspiration and role model for countless young women and service members.
I am honored to represent the third district of South Carolina and to celebrate the exceptional individuals who make a difference in our community and country. ____________________
HONORING THE LIFELONG COMMUNITY SERVICE OF FLO BELLAMY; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
136



Date: 2023-08-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 136 Pages: E776 - E776 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFELONG COMMUNITY SERVICE OF FLO BELLAMY ______ of tennessee in the house of representatives Mrs. HARSHBARGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a truly remarkable individual, Ms. Flo Bellamy, whose dedication, passion, and selfless service to the citizens of Johnson County, Tennesse, have left an indelible mark on our community.
I have personally witnessed Flo's unwavering commitment to the youth of our community.
One of Flo's most outstanding attributes is the genuine love she extends to each child, and it is on display every day at the Community Center.
This is a woman who, for three years, worked without a salary, driven by a vision to establish an afterschool and summer program for our youth.
Her sacrifices, from collecting essentials for the disadvantaged to ensuring that many children receive their only meal outside of the school system, showcase her unprecedented dedication.
In addition to her work with the youth, Flo has been a beacon of hope for cancer patients, assisting them in navigating their journey, from finding care to arranging transportation to medical appointments.
Her connection to this cause is personal and sincere.
Having witnessed the devastating effects of cancer in her own family, Flo took the reins of the American Cancer Society's county-wide walk for cancer.
Even as the names and structures of these efforts evolved, Flo's leadership remained constant, her shift from fundraising for research to directly benefiting local cancer patients made a significant difference in the lives of many.
Furthermore, Flo's teachings have sowed the seeds of understanding, tolerance, and unity.
She taught respect for all, regardless of race, religion, or disability.
Due to her influence, I firmly believe that the younger generation in our community now embraces differences more openly and warmly than ever before.
However, the testament to Flo's legacy isn't just in the programs she led or the funds she raised.
It's in the heartfelt stories of grown adults, once children under her wing, who approach her in public to express their gratitude and love.
It's in the newfound perspectives and attitudes she fostered in a community that has historically faced its own set of challenges.
As I stand here, my heart swells with gratitude for Flo Bellamy.
