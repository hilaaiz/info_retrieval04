By this measure there are several other great young men and women who served as legislative fellows this Spring and Summer in my office.
Each day, they exemplified the highest standards of excellence, bringing forth fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and an unrelenting drive to effect positive change within our cherished community.
Their tireless efforts to address the diverse needs and pressing concerns of our constituents resonate deeply with the values we hold dear.
In the pursuit of serving the constituents of the 18th Congressional District of Texas, their contributions have been nothing short of remarkable.
That is why today I rise to pay tribute to 14 extraordinary young persons for their service to my constituents of the 18th Congressional District of Texas and to the American people.
They are: Panashe Siachitema, Texas Tech University; Ramanpreet Kaur, Indiana University; Amy Arceo, Texas A&M University; Ainsley Gill, Vanderbilt University; Joel Crawford, Harvard University; Kevin Darmadi, George Washington University; Lindsey O'Neal, Payne International Development Fellowship, Niyonsaba Magnifique, Payne International Development Fellowship; Vanessa Rogers-Wright, Charles B. Rangel Internatinal Affairs Program; Wilson Pemboh, Texas Tech University; Alexandra Wilhelm, Pepperdine University; Parker Milligan, Oglethorpe University; J Hardy, Howard University; Carrington Blair, Jackson State

University.
Mr. Speaker, the energy, intelligence and idealism that these wonderful young people brought to my office and those interning in the offices of my colleague's help keep our democracy vibrant.
The insights, skills, and knowledge of the governmental process they gain from their experiences will last a lifetime and prove invaluable to them as they go about making their mark in this world.
Because of people like them the future of our country is bright, and its best days lie ahead.
I wish them all well. ____________________
