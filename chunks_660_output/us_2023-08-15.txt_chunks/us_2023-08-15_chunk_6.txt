This church is compassionate and dedicated to the mission of helping others, and they do this through local and global leadership that focuses on fostering strong intergenerational disciples.
The efforts in Christian education have made significant impacts on the lives of many, and the nurturing of all followers (of every generation) is a testament to the love and unity within this church family.
Every day, our community ought to recognize and appreciate the leadership and members of Calvary for their selfless work and devotion.
Their contributions to the betterment of our community have not gone unnoticed, and their impact extends far beyond the walls of the congregation.
Reverend Corey Bernard Gibson of Buffalo, New York, was named as the seventh and current pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church.
Pastor Gibson has continued to carry out community service, catering to both spiritual and social needs.
This includes the continuation of the Community Outreach Day and the establishment of a scholarship for the local community high school, along with various other events throughout the year that focus on benefiting the children of Buffalo.
It is critically important to recognize such efforts, and I ask that you join me in thanking the leaders and membership of Calvary Baptist, alike, for their successful endeavors over the last 85 years. ____________________
