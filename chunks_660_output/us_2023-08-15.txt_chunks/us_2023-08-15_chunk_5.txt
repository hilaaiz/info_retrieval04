His most important role was as the chief organizer of the historic March on Washington, the largest demonstration ever organized at the time, in which a quarter of a million people turned out to demand civil rights for African Americans.
In the years after the civil rights movement, Rustin, a gay man, inspired others to advocate for and to achieve rights for LGBTQ people.
He remained a strategist and public speaker for workers' rights movements, including co-founding the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an organization for Black trade union members.
Rustin remained committed to promoting social good, and advocating for the disenfranchised, until his death.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENT HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
136



Date: 2023-08-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 136 Pages: E779 - E779 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BOARD OF ZONING ADJUSTMENT HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment Home Rule Act.
This bill would give the District of Columbia the authority to appoint the members of the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment (Board), except when the Board is performing functions regarding an application by a foreign mission with respect to a chancery.
The Board issues special exceptions, or variances, to the regulations issued by the D.C. Zoning Commission (Commission).
This bill would not alter the authority of the Board.
Under current law, in general, the Board consists of a representative each from the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is a federal agency, and the Commission, each of whom may be a federal official, and three mayoral appointees, subject to D.C. Council approval.
The Board has no authority over federal property.
Under current law, when the Board is performing functions regarding an application by a foreign mission with respect to the location, expansion or replacement of a chancery, the Board consists of the Executive Director of NCPC, the Director of the National Park Service (or, if the President so designates, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of General Services) and the three mayoral appointees.
This bill would not change this composition.
D.C., like every other jurisdiction in the United States, should be free to set its own local land-use policies.
This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the impact of Calvary Baptist Church of Buffalo.
Calvary Baptist will celebrate its 85th anniversary on September 15, 2023, which will mark several decades of critical service to our community and its residents.
Calvary began on Clinton Street with Rev. Polite in 1938, and through the years, has become a staple of the Western New York region.
This church is compassionate and dedicated to the mission of helping others, and they do this through local and global leadership that focuses on fostering strong intergenerational disciples.
The efforts in Christian education have made significant impacts on the lives of many, and the nurturing of all followers (of every generation) is a testament to the love and unity within this church family.
Every day, our community ought to recognize and appreciate the leadership and members of Calvary for their selfless work and devotion.
