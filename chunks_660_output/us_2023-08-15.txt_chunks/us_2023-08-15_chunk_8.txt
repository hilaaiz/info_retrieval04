Date: 2023-08-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 136 Pages: E776 - E777 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E776-E777] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEMBERS FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE 18TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES ______ of texas in the house of representatives Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to extend my deepest appreciation and profound gratitude to the extraordinary legislative fellows who have graced my office with their unwavering dedication and unyielding commitment.
Members of Congress know well, perhaps better than most, how blessed our Nation is to have in reserve such exceptional young men and women who will go on to become leaders in their local communities, states and the Nation in the areas of business, education, law, government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, and the military.
We know this because we see them and the benefits from their contributions every day.
Many of them work for us in our offices as junior staff members, congressional fellows, or interns and they do amazing work for and on behalf of the constituents we are privileged to represent.
Mr. Speaker, I believe there is no higher calling than the call to serve a cause larger than ourselves.
That is why I ran for public office.
I was inspired to serve by so many great public figures that came before me.
I was inspired to serve by President Kennedy who said, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who said: ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. . . .
You only need a heart full of grace.
A soul generated by love.''
By this measure there are several other great young men and women who served as legislative fellows this Spring and Summer in my office.
Each day, they exemplified the highest standards of excellence, bringing forth fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and an unrelenting drive to effect positive change within our cherished community.
Their tireless efforts to address the diverse needs and pressing concerns of our constituents resonate deeply with the values we hold dear.
