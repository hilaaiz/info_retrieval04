It's in the heartfelt stories of grown adults, once children under her wing, who approach her in public to express their gratitude and love.
It's in the newfound perspectives and attitudes she fostered in a community that has historically faced its own set of challenges.
As I stand here, my heart swells with gratitude for Flo Bellamy.
Her decades-long service, from leading the Johnson County--Mountain City Community Center to being an unwavering advocate for the most vulnerable, has left a mark that will echo across generations.
We all owe her an immense debt of gratitude.
I invite my colleagues and the citizens of Johnson County to join me in saluting our precious Flo.
Her work and her spirit embody the very best of our community.
We love and cherish her, and I am honored to have this opportunity to recognize her monumental contributions. ____________________
