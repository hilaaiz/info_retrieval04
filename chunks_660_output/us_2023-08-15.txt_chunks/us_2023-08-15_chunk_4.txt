Founded in 1956, the Stafford County NAACP has worked tirelessly ``to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate race-based discrimination,'' working to build a better future for everyone in Stafford County.
As the first and longest-serving president of the Stafford County NAACP, Frank White, Sr.
laid the groundwork for this branch's long-term commitment to service.
His legacy continues through his son, Frank White, Jr.--an active member.
Under the current leadership of President Yolanda Roussell, the Stafford County NAACP continues to be a beacon in the community through its activism, partnerships with local churches, support for Black-owned businesses, voter registration drives, and community forums on African American history, public education, and mental health.
The Stafford County NAACP brings the entire community together for large celebrations--including the Stafford County NAACP Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration and the Stafford County NAACP Juneteenth Commemoration and Celebration.
These events would not have been possible without the hard work of its members.
The Stafford County NAACP has demonstrated a fervent commitment to our communities and an extraordinary devotion to the strength and prosperity of our Commonwealth.
As the U.S. Representative for Virginia's Seventh District, I am honored to recognize this organization for its tremendous record of service to Stafford County-- and I thank the Stafford County NAACP for building a stronger Virginia. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE BAYARD RUSTIN STAMP ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
136



Date: 2023-08-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 136 Pages: E777 - E777 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE BAYARD RUSTIN STAMP ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Bayard Rustin Stamp Act.
This bill would direct the United States Postmaster General to issue a forever stamp to commemorate the life and work of Bayard Rustin.
I introduce this bill with Congressman Ritchie Torres.
We introduce this bill now to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which occurred on August 28, 1963, and the anniversary of Rustin's death, which occurred on August 24, 1987.
Born March 17, 1912, Bayard Rustin became one of the most important leaders in the 20th century civil rights movement.
At a young age, Rustin learned the values of nonviolence and peacekeeping from his grandparents' Quaker faith, and he would continue to build these values into his life as a civil rights movement leader.
Rustin attended City College of New York, where he joined a progressive club that aimed to remedy racial issues during turbulent times.
His time with the club was short-lived, but it inspired him to join the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an organization that became a champion for labor rights, equity and world peace.
Rustin's time with the Fellowship of Reconciliation led him to become a leader in the 1947 ``Journey to Reconciliation,'' where white and Black people across the South rode buses together to challenge segregation laws, a precursor to the Freedom Rides.
Rustin was an advisor in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s inner circle as King advocated pacifism and nonviolence for achieving equal treatment for African Americans.
Rustin applied his brilliant strategic mind to execute aggressive, peaceful action in the civil rights movement and throughout his life as an activist.
His most important role was as the chief organizer of the historic March on Washington, the largest demonstration ever organized at the time, in which a quarter of a million people turned out to demand civil rights for African Americans.
In the years after the civil rights movement, Rustin, a gay man, inspired others to advocate for and to achieve rights for LGBTQ people.
He remained a strategist and public speaker for workers' rights movements, including co-founding the A. Philip Randolph Institute, an organization for Black trade union members.
