LISA C. McCLAIN of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary constituent whose dedication, service, and unwavering commitment to our community exemplify core American values.
Michael Tomtishen, who many throughout the City of New Baltimore regard as a `hometown hero,' is a veteran of the Vietnam War, a two- time Purple Heart recipient, and a lifelong resident in his community.
Mr. Tomtishen served in the United States Army for three years, of which two were spent in Vietnam.
He assisted in the training of troops at Fort Benning in Georgia and was severely injured in combat as a result of a landmine.
An active member of the Lempke-Blackwell VFW Post 7573 and AMVETS Post 52, Michael Tomtishen has assisted and participated in many local events and parades, once saving an onlooker's life by performing CPR.
For 30 years, Mr. Tomtishen has also honored fallen heroes by assisting in the placement of American flags--a task he was never asked to do.
Michael Tomtishen is a hero to many--his selfless commitment to those around him is an example for us all to follow.
With National Purple Heart Day still fresh in our hearts and minds, I am beyond proud to honor Michael for his many years of unselfish leadership, generosity, and respect for his community.
We are all indebted to him for the example he sets. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ronald ``Ronnie'' Jett, who has recently passed away, and to honor his service to Virginia's First District and the Nation.
Ronnie served as a life member on the Northumberland Rescue Squad and is a recipient of the Michael B. Player Award for excellence in EMS.
His service to his community continued with the Fairfields Volunteer Fire Department, where he served as an active member for nearly four decades.
He has also been recognized as a life member for this service.
In January 1996, Ronnie was sworn into office for the Northumberland County Board of Supervisors for District 5.
While on the Board he acted as Vice Chair for six years, Chairman for eighteen years, Emergency Services Director for eighteen years, and liaison for the Board to the Northern Neck Regional Jail since July 2000.
His work on the Board includes enhancements to the County 911 System, obtaining funding for the Fire Department, construction of school complexes, athletic fields, and first responder facilities.
His loyalty and care for the citizens and staff was clearly visible through his work to better his County.
Ronnie was a family man who survived by his wife, Linda S. Jett, daughters, Carrie Jo Jett and Kelly Morgan Jett, stepdaughters Kristi and Carlina; eight grandchildren, Kyndal, Karter, Haleigh, Michael, Keith, Macey, Dallas, and Michael Jr.; sister, Patsy Basye, and numerous caring nieces, nephews, and cousins.
He was preceded in death by his mother and father, Doris and Wilson Jett, and his brothers, Mitchell and Michael Jett.
He could often be found spending time with his dog, Mia, or on his boat with family when he was away from his businesses, Smith Point Seafood and Cockrells Creek Deli.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the service, accomplishments, and values of Ronnie Lee Jett.
May God bless Ronnie, and may He look over Ronnie's family as we remember his splendid life. ____________________
