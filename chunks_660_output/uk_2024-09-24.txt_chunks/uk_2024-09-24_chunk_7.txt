Her efforts have been recognized

by many, including the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which

awarded her the Leadership Star Award.
She has also been named

Legislator of the Year by the Texas Association of Student Financial

Aid Administrators and honored with the Texas Community College

Teachers Association Legislator of the Year Award.
Beyond her legislative work, Representative Morrison has always been

deeply committed to community service.
Her 17-year involvement with the

Junior League of Victoria allowed her to lead programs like ``Making

the Grade'' and ``Great Expectations,'' where she worked with young

people to inspire academic success and provide support for pregnant

teens in completing their education.
Her leadership in these

initiatives has touched countless lives and opened doors of opportunity

for those who need it most.
Representative Morrison's service extended beyond her district and

into key leadership positions at the state level.
Prior to running for

office, she served as Executive Director of the Governor's Commission

for Women under Governor George W. Bush, and she was appointed to the

Texas Commission for Volunteerism and Community Service and the Texas

Juvenile Probation Commission.
Her long-standing dedication to public service has earned her

numerous awards, including the Boy Scouts of America South Texas

Council's Distinguished Citizen Award, the Victoria Chamber of Commerce

Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award, and recognition as one of South

Texas' Women of the Year.
These accolades are a testament to her

unwavering commitment to her constituents and her deep-rooted belief in

the importance of community involvement.
As Representative Morrison embarks on this new chapter of her life,

it is my honor to recognize her remarkable career and thank her for her

faithful service to Texas.
We are better off having had someone of

Geanie's caliber involved in public service.
May God bless her and her

family in the days and years ahead.

REMEMBERING SEAN GRIFFIN

HON.
MARY SATTLER PELTOLA

Mrs. PELTOLA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and remember a very

special Alaskan.
On August 25th, a devastating landslide in Ketchikan destroyed homes

and took a fellow Alaskan from us.
That Alaskan was Sean Griffin.
Sean

was a selfless husband, father, son, neighbor, and public servant.
Ketchikan families knew him for his positive spirit and his devotion to

his friends, family, and community.
At the time of the landslide, Sean,

a senior maintenance technician for the city, was clearing stormwater

drains on his day off.
It's heartbreaking to see that such a model Alaskan and public

servant is now gone from our Ketchikan community.
He will be so deeply

missed.
Earlier this month, I witnessed the landslide damage in Ketchikan

firsthand.
It was horrific.
Alaskans had their entire lives uprooted.
Our delegation will be working closely with those affected to make

sure Ketchikan is safe.
But Sean was taken from us too soon.
I am

sharing my deepest condolences to his friends, family and all those

whose lives he touched.
May he rest in peace.
