Understanding the need for recreation opportunities to promote community wellness, Dave also worked to build the Community Gym in 2010.
In 2019, Dave rallied community donors to seed the Deepening Roots Endowment with $2 million.
A year later, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for financial security for the Center in order to provide critical services to the San Geronimo Valley community emergencies.
During the pandemic, Dave assembled the Community Center's resources to bring vaccines, tests, food, emergency funds, accurate information, and a sense of community to the residents of West Marin.
Today, the San Geronimo Valley Community Center has a staff of 22 people and a comprehensive mission to foster healthy communities within the San Geronimo Valley and Nicasio.
Thanks to Dave Cort's dedication and leadership, the organization has become integral to the quality of life for the community, ensuring local residents have access to quality programs in the arts, youth services, senior services, community events, and more.
Mr. Speaker, Dave Cort exemplifies what it means to be a community- minded public servant.
His contributions to the San Geronimo Valley Community Center and the people of West Marin are extraordinary and appreciated.
Therefore, please join us in congratulating him for decades of inspiring work. ____________________
HONORING REUNION OF U.S. ARMY NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER CANDIDATE COURSE; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
159



Date: 2023-09-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 159 Pages: E919 - E920 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E919-E920] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING REUNION OF U.S. ARMY NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER CANDIDATE COURSE ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to hundreds of United States Army veterans who are gathering in and around our nation's capital the week of September 25, 2023, to join in reunion of their graduation from the Noncommissioned Officers Candidate Course (NCOCC).
The program was established for the training of noncommissioned officers in the U.S. Army.
The program operated at Fort Benning, GA, Fort Bliss, TX, Fort Knox, KY, Fort Sill, OK, and Fort Leonard Wood, MO, from 1967 to 1972, during the height of the Vietnam War.
As a proud graduate of the program and fellow Vietnam War veteran, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and saluting these leaders, combat veterans--many of them wounded--and unsung heroes.
As the Vietnam War progressed in the 1960s, the Army was running out of noncommissioned officers in several combat specialties.
In order to meet these unprecedented requirements for Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) leaders, the Army developed a solution based on the proven Officer Candidate Course.
If a carefully selected soldier can be given 23 weeks of intensive training that would qualify him to lead a platoon, then others can be trained to lead squads and fire teams in the same amount of time.
From this seed, the NCOCC was born.
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Harold K. Johnson approved the concept on June 22, 1967, and on September 5, the first course at Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), Georgia, began with Sgt.
Maj.
Don Wright serving as the first NCOCC Commandant.
Potential candidates for the course were selected from groups of initial entry soldiers who had a security clearance of confidential, an infantry score of 100 or over, and demonstrated leadership potential.
Based on recommendations, the unit commander would select potential NCOs, but all were not volunteers.
Those selected to attend NCOCC were immediately made corporals and later promoted to sergeant upon graduation from phase one.
The select few who graduated with honors would be promoted to staff sergeant.
The outstanding graduate of the first class, Staff Sgt.
Melvin C. Leverick, recalled ``I think that those who graduated [from the NCOCC] were much better prepared for some of the problems that would arise in Vietnam.''
The NCO candidate course was designed to maximize the two-year tour of the enlisted draftee.
