FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH RESOLUTION; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
159



Date: 2023-09-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 159 Pages: E918 - E919 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E918-E919] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH RESOLUTION ______ of hawaii in the house of representatives Mr. CASE.
Mr. Speaker, each year our country recognizes October as Filipino American History Month, a time for all Americans to celebrate the incredible past, present and future of our fellow citizens whose heritage lies in the great country of the Philippines.
I am especially humbled to do so as the Representative of Hawaii's First Congressional District, where some 190,000 Filipino Americans live, more than any other of our 435 districts throughout the country.
With Hawaii's Second Congressional District that has the second largest Filipino Americans population at about 180,000, our Fil-Am community in Hawaii stands at 370,000.
In total, fully a quarter of all Hawaii residents are Filipino Americans, by far the largest percentage of any state or territory.
We observe Filipino American History Month in October because the first recorded arrival of Filipinos in the continental United States took place on October 18, 1587, when the ``Luzones Indios'' came ashore from the Manila-built galleon Nuestra Senora de Esperanza in Morro Bay, California.
Today, across the country Filipino Americans have a population of approximately 4,400,000 and are the third largest Asian American and Pacific Islander group in the United States.
Many of the early Filipino immigrants were young men who came to the United States seeking a better life.
Most found work in Hawaii, California, Washington and Alaska.
This first generation of Filipino immigrants are commonly referred to as the Manong generation (Ilocano for first-born male).
They worked mostly physically demanding jobs in tough conditions for very little pay.
Over the years, they fought against discrimination, found a way forward and made a better future for themselves and their future generations.
They became respected members of communities throughout our nation.
The history of the Fil-Am community in Hawaii is particularly rich and echoes the national story.
In 1906, the first 15 sakada contract laborers arrived in Honolulu from the Philippines aboard the SS Doric, marking the first sustained immigration into our country and the humble beginnings of Fil-Ams in Hawaii.
These first immigrants, those that followed and the subsequent generations eventually became trailblazers in politics and government, the military, business and entrepreneurship, journalism, popular culture, music and the arts and more.
Domingo Los Banos was Hawaii's first Filipino American school principal and a loyal veteran of the 1st Filipino Infantry Regiment that fought in the Philippines during World War II.
Carolina Dizon Wong broke a glass ceiling when she obtained an M.D. degree and became the first Filipino American to start a medical practice in Hawaii in 1952.
Peter Aduja became the first Fil-Am elected to public office in the United States when he was elected to the Hawaii Territorial House of Representatives in 1954.
Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino American graduate of the School of

Public Health, Nursing and Social Work at the University of Hawaii.
She received the prestigious Jefferson Award in 1986 for her service.
In 1994, Ben Cayetano was elected the Governor of Hawaii, becoming the first Filipino American governor of a state in our union.
