The outstanding graduate of the first class, Staff Sgt.
Melvin C. Leverick, recalled ``I think that those who graduated [from the NCOCC] were much better prepared for some of the problems that would arise in Vietnam.''
The NCO candidate course was designed to maximize the two-year tour of the enlisted draftee.
Though over 300 hours of instruction was given, eighty percent was conducted in the field.
The final basic phase was a ``dress rehearsal for Vietnam,'' a full week of patrols, ambush, defensive perimeters, and navigation.
Twice daily, the Vietnam-schooled rangers critiqued the candidates, and all training was conducted tactically.
These men, many now of advanced age, served our country with great honor under challenging circumstances.
Four were awarded the

Medal of Honor.
Six are still missing.
Many--1,118 in all--never made it home.
Mr. Speaker, it is evident that these outstanding noncommissioned officers and combat veterans were an indispensable part of our armed forces and served our country with bravery, dedication, and honor. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Bertha Ramsey, a long-time resident of the City of Detroit, as she celebrates 100 years of life.
Born October 2, 1923, Mother Ramsey's loving parents instilled in her the values of patience and hard work, as they raised her and her 12 siblings in rural Laurel, Mississippi.
Her compassionate nature shined through in everything she did, and she always held onto faith, especially in trying times.
A move to Detroit in 1942 was pivotal for Mother Ramsey.
It wasn't merely a change of address.
In Detroit, she witnessed the World War II era, the Detroit race protests of 1943, the milestones of the Civil Rights Movement, the profound impact of the 1967 Detroit Rebellion, Detroit's first Black mayor, and the groundbreaking election of Barack Obama.
Detroit was also where Bertha's path crossed with Burnett Ramsey.
Together, they raised 4 children in a home full of love.
As the family tree expanded to 8 grandchildren, 20 great-grandchildren, and 6 great-great-grandchildren, Bertha emerged as the spiritual compass, always emphasizing the importance of faith and kinship.
Please join me in wishing Mother Bertha Ramsey a happy 100th birthday as we recognize her contributions to our community in Detroit. ____________________
