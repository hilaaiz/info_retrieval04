Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino American graduate of the School of

Public Health, Nursing and Social Work at the University of Hawaii.
She received the prestigious Jefferson Award in 1986 for her service.
In 1994, Ben Cayetano was elected the Governor of Hawaii, becoming the first Filipino American governor of a state in our union.
In 2019, Roy Macaraeg became the first Fil-Am to become a general officer in the history of Hawaii's citizen soldier ranks.
In Hawaii, we also regularly honor the over 250,000 Filipinos who answered the call to protect and defend America and the Philippines in the Pacific theater.
In 2016, President Obama signed into law the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act to bestow Congress's highest honor upon those veterans.
With my colleagues in the House, I have introduced our Filipino Veterans Family Reunification Act, which seeks to reunite World War II Filipino soldiers with their children, so that we can honor those living in our community who fought to protect the free and open Indo-Pacific that we have today.
Each and all of these lives of achievement are but a small sampling of a broader community that has achieved so much and contributed so much to the rich fabric of our country.
And the story of Filipino Americans is still in its early chapters.
This is why it is important that we take the time to recognize groups like Filipino Americans.
The story of Filipino Americans, and to an extent, the stories of all of our various ethnic groups, is the story of America.
From very humble beginnings, they have risen through hard work, sacrifice, commitment to advancing the next generations and mutual support to achieve so much already.
That well describes Filipino Americans overall--embracing the responsibilities and opportunities of America while honoring and treasuring the rich heritage of their ancestral homeland.
All of this is why I joined my friends and colleagues Congresswoman Michelle Steel, Congressman Bobby Scott, Congressman James Moylan and others in introducing this bipartisan resolution to express support for the designation of October as Filipino American History Month.
We urge our colleagues' support to promote an ongoing appreciation of the contributions of Filipino Americans to our country and the rich diversity of our nation.
To Fil-Ams everywhere, ``Maraming Salamat Po'' and ``Dios ti Agngina''--congratulations.
I truly look forward to partnering with them on their next proud chapters. ____________________

Date: 2023-09-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 159 Pages: E919 - E919 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAVE CORT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Dave Cort's 32 years of service as the San Geronimo Valley Community Center's Executive Director.
Dave became the Community Center's first executive director in June of 1991.
This part-time job was the first paid position for the organization and came with only three required qualifications: owning a truck, being able to lift 100 pounds, and possessing people skills.
His role and the services provided by the Community Center expanded exponentially over the next 3 decades.
Dave ensured the Community Center was a successful resource for the San Geronimo Valley residents.
He reformed the local delivery service, partnered with Lagunitas School District to facilitate after-school and daycare programs, and managed the expansion of senior services to include a new Senior Lunch program in the early 2000s.
Understanding the need for recreation opportunities to promote community wellness, Dave also worked to build the Community Gym in 2010.
In 2019, Dave rallied community donors to seed the Deepening Roots Endowment with $2 million.
A year later, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for financial security for the Center in order to provide critical services to the San Geronimo Valley community emergencies.
