Beyond his civic leadership, Mayor Marshburn has exhibited a life of dedication to public service, retiring as the Chief of U.S. Pretrial Services for the Eastern District of North Carolina, after a laudable 26-year career.
He and his wife, the equally esteemed Ms. Faye Marshburn, who served the Wake County Public School System, have been pillars of the Garner community for over three decades.
It's impossible to miss the philanthropic spirit of the Marshburns.
Both Mayor Marshburn and Mrs. Marshburn have been steadfast volunteers with Meals on Wheels of Wake County as well as active members of Garner First Baptist Church.
Furthermore, Mayor Marshburn's passion for education and youth empowerment is evident from his fourteen-year service as guardian ad litem for Wake County, his fifteen-year tenure as a reading tutor in Garner schools, and his unwavering commitment to the Garner Morning Rotary Club for nearly two decades.
Mayor Marshburn's leadership has steered Garner towards a positive and prosperous future.
His commitment to fiscal responsibility has laid a solid foundation for the town's growth, attractIng new businesses that enrich our economic diversity.
His legacy is one of leadership, service, and unwavering dedication to our community.
I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Mayor Ken Marshburn for his unwavering commitment and invaluable contributions to Garner and extending our best wishes to him and his family as they embark on this well-deserved retirement.
Our community is undeniably richer and brighter due to his leadership and service. ____________________
