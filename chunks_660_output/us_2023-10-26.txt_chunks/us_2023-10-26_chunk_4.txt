I am so proud that the North Central Chamber of Commerce is the first Chamber of Commerce in Massachusetts and New England to be recognized with this prestigious national honor.
The Chamber will be celebrating this success at their Congressional Luncheon on November 1, 2023.
Congresswoman Lori Trahan and I will jointly celebrate this monumental achievement.
The North Central Chamber demonstrates excellence in operations, member services, and community leadership.
The Chamber provides immeasurable support to budding and established entrepreneurs in the region, which helps our businesses thrive.
From new programs supporting Latinx small business, to revamping highly trafficked tourism destinations, the Chamber tirelessly works to improve the life of residents and guests to Central Massachusetts.
This recognition affirms what my constituents already know: the North Central Chamber of Commerce goes above and beyond for all.
The Chamber's commitment to continued improvement is what makes them so successful.
And, of course, Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the countless partners that help the Chamber excel at their work.
North Central Massachusetts's educational, economic, non-profit, cultural, and governmental organizations each have seamlessly integrated into the Chamber's purview.
The over 700 businesses and organizations the Chamber assists rightly trust the Chamber to help them serve the twenty-seven communities across North Central Massachusetts.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate the remarkable contributions of the North Central Massachusetts Chamber of Commerce.
Congratulations to such a great organization for another year of phenomenal work. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of Mr. Victor Garza.
He is a longtime community advocate and Latino leader in San Jose, CA.
Victor Garza was born in Eagle Pass, Texas, and moved to California in 1960.
He enlisted in the United States Navy and when he left the Navy, he realized there were limited services for veterans in the community.
He observed that Latinos were struggling to gain a political voice and recognized that two key areas that needed to be addressed were educational attainment of Latinos and increasing their political participation and increasing services to people in need throughout the community.
He was active in one of the most important veterans' groups in the nation, the American GI Forum.
Victor became the first Manager of the Santa Clara County Office of Veterans Services.
He has received numerous commendations and awards for his long history of political activism and community involvement including proclamations from the U.S. Congress, State Legislature, County of Santa Clara.
and the City of San Jose.
He was awarded ``Outstanding Young Man of America'' by the U.S. Jaycees, recognized by the Santa Clara County Human Relations Commission for outstanding service and dedication to the community, and was an Olympic Cross Country Torch Relay Participant in 1996.
The Victor Garza Community Center in Austin, Texas bears his name, as does the Victor Garza Educational Center at Evergreen Valley College.
He founded the La Raza Roundtable in 1988, Santa Clara County's largest coalition of Latino and Mexican American organizations, and spent the last 4 decades fighting for his community.
In 1998, Victor was invited by the White House to participate in President Clinton's Initiative on Race and Poverty.
Victor has been a strong voice for equitable education, social and health services, immigration issues, employment and promotional issues that impact the Latino workforce, as well as veterans affairs.
He is truly the best our community has to offer, and it has been my privilege to work alongside him and I am proud to call him my friend. ____________________
