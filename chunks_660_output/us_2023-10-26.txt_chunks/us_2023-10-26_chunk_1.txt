Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate the Las Vegas Aces on winning the 2023 Women's National Basketball Association Finals.
On October 18, 2023, the Las Vegas Aces defeated the New York Liberty, 70-69, in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals.
The Aces won the championship three games to one and became the first professional team in Nevada to win two championships.
They won despite two of their starters being out with injuries, star guard Chelsea Gray and center Kiah Stokes.
They also became the first WNBA team in 21 years to win consecutive championships.
Hall of Fame head coach Becky Hammon led the team to victory and became the third coach in either the NBA or WNBA to win two championships in her first two seasons.
Even before the playoffs, the Aces had an incredible season, clinching first seed in the playoffs after dominating the regular season with a record of 34-6.
They set a new league record for wins and led the league in points per game and field goal percentage.
At home, the Aces went 19-1 in the regular season and undefeated in the postseason, setting attendance records and even hosting the All- Star Game.
Owner Mark Davis and Team President Nikki Fargas proved once again that investing in women's sports is investing in success, thereby setting an example for others to follow.
In the championship-clinching game, Finals Most Valuable Player A'ja Wilson led the way with 24 points and 16 rebounds, while Jackie Young added 16 points and seven assists.
And Kelsey Plum delivered a well- rounded performance of eight rebounds, five assists, and seven points.
The Aces never trailed in the fourth quarter.
The Aces certainly raised the stakes when securing another championship for Vegas, firmly establishing District One as the Sports Capital of the World.
All of Southern Nevada is very proud and I can't wait to cheer the team on next year as they go for three in a row. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 177 Pages: E1021 - E1022 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1021-E1022] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE LEGACY OF MAYOR KEN MARSHBURN ______ of north carolina in the house of representatives Mr. NICKEL.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and celebrate the exemplary service of Mayor Ken Marshburn, a distinguished leader, and devoted public servant to the Town of Garner.
I'm privileged to recognize his remarkable contributions to our community and express our collective gratitude.
Before Ken Marshburn was elected as Garner's mayor in 2019, he served on the Town Council for twelve years.
He was also on the board of the Garner Economic Development Corporation, which led the redevelopment of the former ConAgra site into a bustling Amazon fulfillment center, further solidifying Garner's role in the economic prosperity of our region.
Beyond his civic leadership, Mayor Marshburn has exhibited a life of dedication to public service, retiring as the Chief of U.S. Pretrial Services for the Eastern District of North Carolina, after a laudable 26-year career.
He and his wife, the equally esteemed Ms. Faye Marshburn, who served the Wake County Public School System, have been pillars of the Garner community for over three decades.
It's impossible to miss the philanthropic spirit of the Marshburns.
