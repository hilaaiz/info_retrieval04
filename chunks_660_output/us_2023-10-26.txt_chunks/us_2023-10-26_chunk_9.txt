MARY ELLEN RIVERS SMITH ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a committed educator, devout Christian, and dedicated public servant, Mrs. Mary Ellen Rivers Smith.
Ms. Smith transitioned from this life on October 14, 2023.
She was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on February 13, 1931, the third of four children born to Addell and Mitchell Rivers.
Ms. Smith was a proud graduate of the Charleston School System, having attended Simonton Elementary School, where I began my professional career, and the historic Avery Institute, the first accredited secondary school for African Americans in Charleston.
The Avery Institute had a special place in her heart.
Decades after graduation, Mrs. Smith donated several artifacts from her school days to what has become the Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture.
Ms. Smith matriculated at North Carolina Central University, then North Carolina College, in Durham, North Carolina, in 1952 and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Health and Physical Education with a minor in Education.
An avid and talented singer, Mrs. Smith earned the nickname ``Songbird'' as a soloist in the University Choir.
After graduation, she returned to Charleston to teach high school and shortly thereafter married Reverend Dr. Charles F. Thomas.
Mrs. Smith was deeply dedicated to uplifting and shaping young minds.
Over her six-decades-long career as an educator, she taught in elementary and middle schools in South Carolina; Biloxi, Mississippi; Lanon, Philippine Islands; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Omaha, Nebraska.
After residing in Omaha for many years, she moved with her family to Huntsville, Alabama.
In Huntsville, Mrs. Smith became Education Director for the Comprehensive Childcare program.
She retired from teaching in 1999 but continued her commitment to educating the next generation of young minds as a substitute elementary school teacher.
Additionally, during this time, she met and married Frank C. Smith of Charleston.
Her dedication to education and community service served as an inspiration to her five children, all of whom served as educators in various capacities.
Mrs. Smith accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior at a young age and was baptized at Calvary Baptist Church.
Her love for the Lord would follow her throughout the entirety of her life.
A longtime devoted parishioner of Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, Mrs. Smith was involved in the Senior Choir, Hour of Power Choir, Educational Ministry, Newsletter Ministry, Social Butterflies, Senior Ministry, Pastoral Aid, Senior Citizens, and Sunday School.
After relocating to the Washington, D.C. area to live with her daughter Jennifer, Mrs. Smith became a member of the Reid Temple AME Church.
There, she participated in the Reid Temple Senior Services Bible study.
However, Morris Street Baptist always remained dear to her heart.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me

in honoring the remarkable life of Mrs. Mary Ellen Rivers Smith.
She is remembered fondly by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchild, beloved relatives, church family, and dear friends.
Mrs. Smith lived a life full of love, devotion, public service, and grace.
She will be sorely missed and well-remembered by all blessed to know her. ____________________
