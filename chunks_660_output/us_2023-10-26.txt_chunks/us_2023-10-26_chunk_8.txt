Episcopal Supervisor Penny is intentional about ensuring the missionaries bless organizations that serve ``the least of these.''
Donations of diapers, clothing, socks, coats, toiletries, toys, and funds are just a sampling of the ways the missionaries have an impact.
Penny's service to her community is rich and extensive, including serving: with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Miami; as Chair and Co-Chair of United Way Campaigns: as a Co-Chair for multiple March of Dimes sub-committees; on Committees within the American Cancer Society; as Treasurer for the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce Trustee Council; with the Chamber as they travelled to Brazil and South Africa to foster working relationships between countries; and as an officer of the Fort Lauderdale Chapter of The Links, Incorporated.
Penny currently serves as a Board Member of the Black Women's Agenda, Inc. During her tenure, Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White spearheaded the project to build a home for a pastor in Africa when she learned he needed a place to live.
She led the construction of a commercial kitchen in the public library in Pembroke, Illinois, to ensure the community had a suitable gathering place.
She also coordinated the purchase of sewing machines for widowed women in India so they could make items to sell to support their families.
I join with members of the 4th Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the global community to thank Mrs. Penny Hartsfield White for her exceptional service to the church and our nation.
I wish her health and happiness in her weIl-deserved retirement. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the life of Camille Brandon, a dedicated public servant and advocate for causes about which she cared deeply.
Those of us who are fortunate enough to have worked with her will recall the kindness, the decency and the warmth that she brought to all of her governmental, political and civic efforts.
Camille was the Deputy Erie County Clerk under elected clerks of both major parties, was a trusted advisor in the administration of Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski and held important positions at the Buffalo City Court.
She was the Vice President of the Pulaski Association, chaired the Youth Services and Citizens Police Advisory Boards in the Town of Cheektowaga, and sat on the board of the YWCA Institute for Public Leadership Planning.
She was an American Heart Association board member and had been Grand Marshall of Buffalo's Pulaski Day Parade.
Active in politics, she was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1992, 1996, and 2012.
She generously lent her time, her expertise, and her friendly and positive attitude to political efforts.
We join our friend, Camille's dedicated husband, Bob Brandon, in mourning this tremendous loss.
All of us who knew and worked with Camille will remember her with deep gratitude and affection.
If more people in the realms of politics, government and civic affairs shared Camille's deep commitment to kindness, decency and mutual understanding, our nation would be far better off.
May she continue to be an example to all of us. ____________________
