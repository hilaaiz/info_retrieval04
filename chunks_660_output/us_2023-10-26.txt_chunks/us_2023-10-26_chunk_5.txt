HONORING XIOMARA FLORES-HOLGUIN AS 2023 VALLEY LUCHADORA FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
177



Date: 2023-10-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 177 Pages: E1021 - E1021 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING XIOMARA FLORES-HOLGUIN AS 2023 VALLEY LUCHADORA FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CARDENAS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Xiomara Flores- Holguin as a Valley Luchadora.
Xiomara is famous in Los Angeles County for her work as a social worker and protecting thousands of kids during her amazing career.
She grew up a child of immigrants from Nicaragua.
As a first generation American whose first language was Spanish, Xiomara has always understood the importance of inclusion, representation, and protecting those without a voice.
She received her master's degree in social work from the University of Southern California and got her start working with the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.
During her time posted with the Emergency Response Command, there were many nights when she was the only Spanish-speaking social worker in the entire county available to respond to emergency calls to accompany law enforcement to homes where Spanish-speaking children needed care.
When LAPD units answered calls about gang violence, Xiomara was there.
When LAPD busted a human trafficking ring, Xiomara was there.
When they raided a house where drugs were being manufactured, Xiomara was there.
Her primary concern was always the innocent children caught up in the violence, usually standing to the side, quiet and frightened while police arrested the adults around them.
She made sure they were cared for and reunited with family whenever possible or placed into the foster system.
Xiomara retired after 36 years with the Department of Children and Family Services.
She leaves behind a legacy of new policies that protect the welfare of vulnerable children throughout Los Angeles.
She continues to give back to her community by way of teaching part- time at the California State University Northridge Department of Social Work.
Xiomara understands the need for compassion and trained, culturally competent crisis professionals to respond to urgent calls, values she passes on to her students.
In addition to her work at CSUN, she remains a tireless worker and advocate for underserved populations and is a major influencing member of the San Fernando Valley Coalition on Gangs.
I thank Xiomara.
It is my honor to recognize her as a distinguished community leader and luchadora during this Hispanic Heritage Month. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DIANNE FEINSTEIN LAKE TAHOE RESTORATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
177



Date: 2023-10-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 177 Pages: E1022 - E1022 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DIANNE FEINSTEIN LAKE TAHOE RESTORATION ACT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, today I introduce a bill cosponsored by every California Democrat and the entire Nevada delegation renaming the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-506) in honor of the late U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).
We recognize her legacy and leadership spanning more than three decades to Keep Tahoe Blue.
Among her many accomplishments, Senator Feinstein secured more than $715 million in authorized federal funding under this landmark 2000 law to conserve Lake Tahoe and the surrounding basin for future generations.
Senator Feinstein's 2016 amendments to this law provided new authorities for the U.S. Forest Service to combat wildfires across the Tahoe Basin.
These authorities were first employed in combating the devastating Caldor Fire in 2021 and in the recovery since.
Nobody in government has done more to Keep Tahoe Blue than Senator Feinstein.
