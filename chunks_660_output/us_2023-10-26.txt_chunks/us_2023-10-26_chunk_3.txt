A former resident of Panorama City, Fabian balances acting with his love for skateboarding.
He supports the sport and kids interested in it by donating skateboards so they can get involved in and improve at skateboarding.
Over four years ago, Fabian became involved with the Anti-Recidivism Coalition as a formerly incarcerated individual.
The ARC empowers formerly and currently incarcerated people to thrive by providing a support network, comprehensive reentry services, and opportunities to advocate for policy changes that will help others caught in cycles of incarceration.
Today, Fabian uses his platform to share the mission of ARC to help others who are formerly incarcerated integrate back into society.
Fabian, like me, is the son of immigrants and came from a lineage of farmers.
He told one of our local newspapers, the San Fernando Sun, that he recently reconnected with his campesino roots and is expanding his advocacy efforts to include agricultural workers.
His advocacy, energy, and compassion are limitless, and we are proud to call him a Valley native.
I thank Fabian.
It is my honor to recognize him as a distinguished leader and luchador during Hispanic Heritage Month. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 177 Pages: E1024 - E1024 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE MEMORY OF SAMANTHA WOLL ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize an incredible friend and community leader, Samantha Woll.
Our community is deeply saddened by her tragic death and the sudden loss of a courageous and tenacious fighter for all.
I first met Samantha, affectionately known as Sam, in 2016.
Sam was driven by her Jewish faith that led to her interfaith work.
Sam had the ability to connect with diverse communities and bring people together in a way that made us all stronger.
Her lasting impact is a testament to her strong values and character.
Not only did she serve as the President of the Isaac Agree Detroit Downtown Synagogue where she worked tirelessly in preparation of its recent re-opening, Sam also served with numerous community organizations, including serving on the board of the Mary Turner Center for Advocacy.
Through her work, Sam created spaces for both Muslim and Jewish youth together.
Sam served on a number of Democratic campaigns and volunteered for many political causes, helping support local, state and national issues.
Above all, Sam was a daughter, sister and aunt who absolutely adored her family.
If she wasn't actively organizing her community, she was spending most of her time with family and traveling.
Sam was our beacon of hope and a light for many.
Samantha Woll's infectious spirit, warmth, and friendship will be sorely missed.
Please join me in recognition of Samantha Woll's life and legacy.
May her memory be a blessing. ____________________
