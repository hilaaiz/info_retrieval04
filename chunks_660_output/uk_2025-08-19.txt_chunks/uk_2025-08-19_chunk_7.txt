Her commitment to equity is evident in her leadership of CalFac's Anti-

Racism and Social Justice workshops, which she regularly co-leads

across California.
As a Japanese-American woman and longtime Central

Coast resident, she brings both lived experience and deep empathy to

her work, encouraging other women of color to speak up, advocate for

themselves, and pursue leadership opportunities.
Lisa's service to the Asian, Pacific Islander, and Desi American

community is equally significant.
She is a member of the CFA APIDA

Caucus and previously served as Chair, working to advance visibility

and representation at Cal Poly and across the CSU system.
She is also

active with Tsuru for Solidarity, a social justice organization

dedicated to supporting immigrant rights and providing healing spaces

for those impacted by incarceration--both historically during World War

II and in the present day.
Lisa Kawamura is well known for her kindness, availability, and

integrity.
She is ``only a phone call away'' for her colleagues and

students, and she consistently uplifts others by making sure their

voices are heard.
She has become a trusted mentor, dynamic public

speaker, and respected leader in the Central Coast community.
I am honored to recognize Lisa Kawamura for her lifelong commitment

to education, equity, and justice.
I ask all Members to join me today

in honoring an exceptional woman of California's 24th Congressional

District, Lisa Kawamura, for her outstanding service to her students,

colleagues, and community.
