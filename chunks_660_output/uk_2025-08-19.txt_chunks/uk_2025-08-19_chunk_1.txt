HONORING GLORIA GLOVER

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and

recognize Gloria Glover for her remarkable dedication and service as

Youth Director at New Green Grove Church of Faith in Greenwood,

Mississippi.
For over 20 years, Ms. Glover has been a steadfast leader,

guiding and inspiring young people in her community through spiritual

growth, education, and outreach.
Under her leadership, the youth ministry has flourished, encompassing

a praise team, praise dancers, and numerous community service

initiatives.
Ms. Glover, alongside her daughter, LaFonda Knox, and

youth minister Robert Keyon Beamon, has played an essential role in

creating a vibrant and supportive environment where young members can

grow in faith and contribute meaningfully to their community.
Bishop Milton Glass, pastor of New Green Grove for 30 years, affirms

that the youth ministry's success has been vital to the church's growth

and vitality.
Thanks to Ms. Glover's tireless efforts, the ministry has

grown to welcome new young members every month, many of whom have been

baptized and actively participate in church life.
The young people under Ms. Glover's guidance have dedicated

themselves to serving others.
They have organized and delivered meals

to seniors, collected and distributed socks and blankets to nursing

home residents, gathered food for the Community Kitchen and disaster

victims, and supplied hygiene products to the Delta Correctional

Facility.
Their outreach also includes toy drives supporting children

during family visits to the prison, reflecting a deep commitment to

compassion and community service.
Despite challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic and concerns

over gun violence, Ms. Glover and the youth ministry have persevered,

fostering a spirit of resilience and faith.
Her leadership ensures that

the church continues to be a beacon of hope and growth, especially for

the young people who represent its future.
Today, I commend Gloria Glover for her outstanding commitment to

empowering youth, strengthening her church, and serving her community.
Her work exemplifies the profound impact that dedicated individuals can

have on shaping lives and nurturing the next generation.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Gloria

Glover's exceptional service and lasting legacy.

HONORING JOAN GROWE ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
ANGIE CRAIG

Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great Minnesotan,

Joan Growe, ahead of her 90th birthday on September 28, 2025.
Born Joan Ruth Anderson in 1935, Joan was introduced to public

service early in her life.
Her father, Arthur Anderson, served as mayor

of her hometown of Buffalo, Minnesota, where she would later graduate

from Buffalo High School.
She then went on to earn a teaching degree

from St. Cloud State University and spent the following years giving

back to her community as a teacher and a homemaker.
In 1972, Joan launched a bid for an open seat in the Minnesota State

Legislature.
While critics mocked her ``Housewives Campaign'', she

embraced the network of women she'd met through the League of Women

Voters.
She met people where they were, attending coffee parties, book

clubs, and PTA meetings.
This coalition carried her to victory, and she

spent her time in the Minnesota House fighting for election integrity

and voting access.
She championed Minnesota's same-day voter

registration law, the first of its kind in the Nation.
Her election as secretary of state in 1974 made her the first woman

in Minnesota's history to win a statewide election without prior

appointment.
Her 24-year tenure also made her the second longest

serving secretary of state in our state's history.
During this time,

she found creative ways to encourage voter participation, from voter

education campaigns to friendly contests between cities.
