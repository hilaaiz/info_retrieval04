Throughout the years Tom enjoyed vacations with friends, and attending classic car, boat, and air shows.
Most recently he looked forward to his weekly visits to Hotel Diamond for coffee, lunch bunch, and tea at three.
Tom also enjoyed spending time at Lake Almanor and hosted an annual 4th of July celebration for 19 years.
His love for the community of Chico drove Tom to be a faithful supporter of the Boys and Girls Club as well as the Salvation Army and additionally many other community organizations.
Tom was also a 35-year member of Chico Rotary, as well as a Chico Elks Lodge member for 53 years.
Tom will be missed not only by his family and friends but also by the greater Chico community who benefitted from his benevolence.
Many projects and endeavors were accomplished with Tom's silent participation both financially and with hours of hard work.
He was a true public servant.
We forever will be grateful for the legacy he has left. ____________________
