BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Representative William Delahunt who recently passed peacefully at his home in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Representative Delahunt, born in that very same town, spent his life dedicated to its people.
Representative Delahunt was a lifelong public servant.
He began his career as a Radioman for the Coast Guard, an honor he brought all the way to the House as co-chair of the Coast Guard Caucus.
Representative Delahunt progressed through a life of Public Service.
He served as a Quincy Town Councilor, State Representative, District Attorney, and finally House Representative, before his retirement in 2011.
Representative Delahunt always put the needs of his constituents first.
When low-income residents in his home state struggled to pay their heating bills during the winter of 2006, he got little assistance from the Bush administration.
Instead of doing nothing, he famously brokered an international fuel sale for approximately 50,000 Massachusetts residents in dire need.
His direct negotiation of this sale ensured even his most vulnerable constituents could keep the heat on that winter.
Well-respected for his lasting commitment to human rights, Representative Delahunt served as the chair of the Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight in the 110th Congress.
I had the distinct pleasure of serving with Representative Delahunt, and I still carry a deep respect for Representative Delahunt's strong principles and consistent defense of human rights.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his fiance, Julia Pagana, daughters Kirsten and Kara, and two grandchildren.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the life of a great man of this chamber. ____________________

Tom left his job with PG&E and established Thomas Welding in his garage in Chico in 1972.
Thomas Hydraulics followed in 1974 as well as Thomas Manufacturing in 1996.
What was once Tom's small business idea now stands as one of the largest machine shops north of Sacramento.
Tom served the Chico community with excellence, teaching and mentoring many and never hesitated to share his time and knowledge with those he encountered.
