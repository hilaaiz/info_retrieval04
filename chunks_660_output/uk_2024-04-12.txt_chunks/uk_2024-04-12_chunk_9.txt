HON.
BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pauline

Biedka, a remarkable constituent from my district, and to pay tribute

to her on the celebration of her 100th Birthday on April 13, 2024.
The daughter of Philomena and Luke Della Vella, Pauline was born on

April 13, 1924 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania--one of nine children

Pauline married her husband Peter, a World War II Veteran in 1942.
They

moved to Bristol, Bucks County and built their forever home.
They had a

daughter and two sons.
Pauline was a ``Rosie the Riveter'' during World War II and the

Korean War.
During that time, she worked at Fleetwings and Kaiser Metal

in Bristol, Pennsylvania.
In addition, Pauline was a Neshaminy School

District crossing guard for twenty-five years.
Pauline was and still is a devoted wife, remains an amazing mother,

grandmother of six, and great-grandmother of twelve.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues in the U.S. House of

Representatives to please join me in extending our heartfelt

congratulations, sincere well-wishes, and all of God's Blessings to

Pauline Biedka on the celebration of her 100th Birthday.
