CONGRATULATING BARB HEDSTROM AS THE RECIPIENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL

CRIME SURVIVORS AND JUSTICE CAUCUS ED STOUT MEMORIAL AWARD FOR

OUTSTANDING VICTIM ADVOCACY

HON.
ANGIE CRAIG

Ms. CRAIG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,

Barb Hedstrom, as the recipient of the Congressional Crime Survivors

and Justice Caucus' 2024 Ed Stout Memorial Award for Outstanding Victim

Advocacy.
Barb Hedstrom serves as Shakopee Police Department's Victim

and Community Services Coordinator.
This award's honoree is a professional, volunteer or organization

whose efforts directly benefit victims and survivors of crime.
The

award recognizes innovations in victim assistance and crime victim

services in the areas of program development, public or agency policy

development, community and public awareness, and collaboration among

community and justice-based organizations that serve crime victims.
Barb is exactly that.
The Shakopee Police Department was the first

police department in Minnesota to have a Victim Services Coordinator.
In 2015, Barb worked with her colleagues to launch the Recovery

Assistance Program (RAP), which helps those in recovery by providing

scholarships to help break down barriers to treatment.
Barb recently

started the Law Enforcement Association of Victim Essential Services

(LEAVES), which is a statewide professional association of law

enforcement-based victim service providers.
Due largely to Barb's work,

the Shakopee Police Department has been a leader in the State of

Minnesota and across the country for victims' services for nearly a

decade and has made victim services a top priority.
It is an honor to represent Barb Hedstrom and the Shakopee Police

Department in Congress.
I look forward to our continued partnership in

serving the Second District of Minnesota.

CONGRATULATING MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY VETERANS BUSINESS OUTREACH

CENTER

HON.
MICHAEL GUEST

Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mississippi

State University (MSU) Veterans Business Outreach Center (VBOC) on

being recognized as the 2024 Veterans Business Outreach Center of the

Year.
Director Mark Scott has worked tirelessly to make the MSU VBOC a place

where Veterans are served well.
Natalie Rhode, the program director,

has also played a key role in the center's success.
The Veterans Business Outreach Center is focused on small business

development for Veterans and their spouses.
The center was founded in

2015 and covers Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
The Small Business Administration selected the MSU VBOC this year for

its successes and unique contributions to the local community.
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.
The MSU

VBOC is committed to excellence while supporting many local Veterans as

they invest in their communities.
This award is a testament to the hard work by the outstanding team on

the front lines at the VBOC.
I am thankful to have the opportunity to congratulate the Mississippi

State University Veterans Business Outreach Center on the occasion of

this award, and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress on

behalf of our Veterans.

FRANCIS SCOTT KEY BRIDGE

speech of

HON.
SYLVIA R. GARCIA

Ms. GARCIA of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the lives of the

six construction workers who passed away as a result of the collapse of

the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.
Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, Dorian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, Maynor

Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Miguel Luna, Jose Mynor Lopez, and Carlos

Hernandez.
These men who lost their lives while working on the Bridge were

everyday heroes.
These men could've been our fathers, brothers, grandsons, or nephews.
That evening, they arrived at work proudly as immigrants, ready to

help build this country with their own two hands by undertaking

hazardous and challenging tasks that others refused.
