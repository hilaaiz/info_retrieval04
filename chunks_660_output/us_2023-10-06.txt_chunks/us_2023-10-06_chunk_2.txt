Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Adjoa McDonald as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Adjoa has dedicated her career to advocating for women and youth in the city of Vallejo.
Adjoa founded the Vallejo Project, an organization dedicated to developing the leadership skills of youth and young adults so they can improve the systems that impact them.
Adjoa's work has created a platform that empowers and uplifts women and youth in Vallejo, providing them with a network to connect, learn, and support each other.
Beyond advocating for women individually, Adjoa also fights to improve the status of women throughout society.
She fights to address issues that impact all women, such as gender inequality, domestic violence, and economic disempowerment.
Adjoa cares deeply about working collaboratively to make broad change.
She knows the importance of her work because she has faced the obstacles that many women in Vallejo, and the United States, experience today.
She is an example of the strength and resilience that women possess and use those qualities to make a difference for the women in her community.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Adjoa McDonald for her positive contributions to our community.

Date: 2023-10-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 164 Pages: E939 - E940 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E939-E940] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 2023 WOMEN OF THE YEAR: ALICE WILSON-FRIED ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Alice Wilson-Fried as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Alice is dedicated to teaching the youth of Solano County about the importance of democracy and civic engagement.
Seeing the need to educate young people about voting rights and civic duty, Alice implemented the Democracy Matters program at Golden Hills Community School.
This curriculum gives students the opportunity to learn about the importance of democracy and its impact, allowing students to see themselves as leaders with a voice in the policy process.
The importance and impact of this program has been recognized by the California Secretary of State, who is in discussions to use it in their statewide youth outreach efforts.
Through the framework of Democracy Matters, Alice has given students hands-on experiences with civic engagement, including coordinating a mock City Council meeting in the Suisun City council chambers and training students on how to conduct a forum with Solano Youth Council.
She also worked with the Solano County Registrar of Voters and League of Women Voters to train students who volunteered as poll workers.
These hands-on opportunities have allowed students to learn about the importance of citizenship and the power of their voices in our democracy.
Alice's work to educate the next generation about democracy will have an impact for years to come.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Alice Wilson-Fried for her positive contributions to our community. ____________________
