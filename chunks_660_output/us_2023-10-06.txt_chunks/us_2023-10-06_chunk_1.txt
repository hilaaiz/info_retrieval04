Date: 2023-10-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 164 Pages: E938 - E938 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING CHIEF OF STAFF ELLIOTT GUFFIN ______ of north carolina in the house of representatives Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to honor the public service of a long-time member of my team, George Elliott Guffin IV, and wish him success as he enters the next stage of his career.
A native of Jackson, Mississippi, Elliott is a proud graduate of the University of Mississippi--a fact he will share with you within five minutes of meeting him.
Elliott began his congressional service in the United States Senate in the office of Senator Roger Wicker prior to joining my staff in May 2016 and beginning a long tenure of service to the people of North Carolina's 8th, and later 9th, Congressional District.
As a young staff assistant, Elliott excelled at many things.
His sunny disposition, eagerness to learn, and dedication to public service are the main reasons why I didn't fire him that time he forgot and stranded a scheduled tour group at the White House.
However, my faith in Elliott was rewarded as he grew to be a trusted advisor, mentor to others, an exceptional leader, and a valued part of the team.
Advancing as a legislative correspondent, legislative aide, legislative assistant, senior legislative assistant, legislative director, deputy chief of staff, and chief of staff, Elliott never wavered in his commitment to serving our constituents.
Over the years, he helped me secure legislation to push for the paving of roads for the Green Gap community in the Uwharrie National Forest--a process that will soon come to fruition.
In addition, Elliott helped me secure multiple pieces of legislation to address the needs of our farmers, expand rural broadband access for North Carolinians, and increase support for our region's troops, military families, and veterans.
I am especially proud of the work Elliott accomplished in defense of the Second Amendment, drafting legislation with me to harden and secure schools and pushing for concealed carry reciprocity.
Over the years, Elliott has established himself as a trusted leader and friend to his colleagues.
He was the backbone of our office--always willing to do whatever was needed to help the team.
I have been impressed by the attention Elliott gave to his managerial role by setting aside time to work with each member of our staff in order to help them develop into great congressional staffers.
Through his dedicated leadership, Elliott has taken what has always been a great team and built an exceptional one by understanding the values and motivations of his peers.
Of all his tremendous achievements for North Carolina and the country, I am most proud of the man I've had the privilege to watch him grow into.
I always tell my staff that over all things, family is first.
Elliott has taken this to heart since day one, even ensuring I made

it to my son's soccer game as we drove from the opposite end of North Carolina.
I've been able to see the same values watching him get married and start his own family, starting with his lovely wife, Ariel, and their beloved dog, Moose.
Elliott Guffin made a difference.
He made a difference to me and to his colleagues.
He made a difference in the lives of my constituents.
He made a difference to this institution.
And he made a difference to the United States of America.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, please join me today in congratulating Elliott Guffin for more than seven years of incredible service to the House of Representatives and to the people of North Carolina, and wishing he, Ariel, and Moose the best in their future endeavors. ____________________
