In 1945 she and her husband founded one of the first Black-owned music stores, which remained open until 2019.
Over the years she has worked as staff to a Berkeley city council member, a state Assemblywoman, and a California State Senator.
In the early 2000s, Betty became involved in the plans to open the Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park.
This led to her career as a ranger which began in 2007, at the age of 85.
Betty led talks explaining the importance of the park in memorializing the contributions of women and African Americans working in war industries supporting the U.S. World War II efforts on the home front.
She has used her own experiences and observations as a Black woman to bring light to untold stories of African Americans during WWII and underscore the racism and misogyny experienced by her and countless other women of color throughout her lifetime.
Through hard work and storytelling, she has touched the lives of the thousands of park visitors and millions of Americans who can not only empathize with her story but celebrate and learn from it.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Betty Reid Soskin for her positive contributions to our community. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Brenda Plechaty as she is a honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Brenda's life was changed when her partner had a serious accident resulting in a traumatic brain injury.
During his recovery, Brenda experienced the lack of support there is for the family members of those who have traumatic brain injuries.
This led Brenda to create, run, and fully fund a free support group for family members who are caregivers to TBI survivors.
Brenda is dedicated to this group and helping the caregivers of TBI survivors, making herself available to caregivers every day, not just during the group's monthly meetings.
Brenda's work for this group has led her to become fully immersed in the TBI community, willing to share information and provide support whenever possible to those who have been impacted by TBI.
In addition to her work supporting caregivers, Brenda serves on several commissions and committees in the city of Vallejo and is actively working with the city to improve the Vallejo Municipal Marina.
A passionate rower, Brenda is involved in her rowing club's volunteering division and helped to create a summer youth rowing project that included instruction on the importance of the marina.
All facets of Brenda's work show her compassion and dedication to serving others.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Brenda Plechaty for her positive contributions to our community. ____________________
