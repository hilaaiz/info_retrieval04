Date: 2023-10-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 164 Pages: E938 - E938 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 2023 WOMEN OF THE YEAR: BARBARA BREWER ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Barbara Brewer as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Barbara retired from the United States Air Force after 20 years but continued her service as a civilian employee and is now a Unit Program Coordinator in the 21st Airlift Squadron at Travis Air Force Base.
In addition to her official duties in this role, Barbara selflessly volunteers for more responsibilities, including Security Program Manager, Paying Agent, and Resource Advisor.
She has been essential to the squadron's success and is fondly referred to as ``Squadron Mom.''
Barbara is the liaison between the aircrew, government travel agencies and foreign embassies, ensuring rapid travel in support of USTRANSCOM operations.
Her actions have directly contributed to the success of over 5,000 flight hours, 1,300 sorties, and 7 million pounds of cargo successfully delivered to meet our Nation's priorities.
Every member of her squadron knows they can rely on Barbara regardless of time or day or the reason for the call, because she shows unfailing care for every servicemember.
Barbara was chosen as an Assistant Mission Commander for the Capstone Military Leadership Program where she manages the development of over 50 Generals and Flag Officers.
On one mission she was asked to speak about her experiences as a woman in the military with the women of the Zambian Air Force, a country where women were historically excluded from service.
Barbara's 35 years of service to our country have led to a profound impact on her squadron.
Travis AFB, and beyond.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Barbara Brewer for her positive contributions to our community. ____________________
