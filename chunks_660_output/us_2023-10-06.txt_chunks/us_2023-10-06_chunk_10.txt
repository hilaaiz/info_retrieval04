Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I rise to honor the legacy of the Union County Board of Commissioners Chair, Stony Dwight Rushing.
Stony loved his family and he loved Union County.
He was fiercely devoted to his wife, Anne-Marie, and his two children, Reagan and RyLee.
Stony also served Union County for four terms on the Board of Commissioners from 2002 to 2006, and then again from 2014 to 2023.
Over the course of these four terms, Stony's fellow Board Members chose him to serve as Chairman for two of them.
Stony was a congenial presence and a highly effective servant to his community.
He stood for our God- given rights and took every opportunity to make people's lives better.
His larger-than-life presence that still echoes throughout Union County will truly be missed.
Outside of his involvement with the Union County Board of Commissioners, Stony mentored young North Carolinians on the importance of firearm proficiency and safety.
Stony served as a certified firearms instructor and owner of Take Aim Training Range.
In fact, he was the NRA South Carolina Youth Hunter Education Challenge State Coordinator, and was honored as the 2013 NC Governor's Conservation Achievement Award winner for ``Hunter Education Instructor of the Year.''
Stony also served as the Union District Chairman for the Boy Scouts of America between 2006 and 2009.
On behalf of the entire 8th Congressional District of North Carolina, I rise to honor and celebrate Chairman Stony Rushing's fruitful life and dedicated service to others.
I thank Stony and may he rest in peace. ____________________
