Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to introduce the Medicaid Accountability Act of 2023.
My legislation would remove barriers to operating Medicaid Fraud Control Units in the territories, advancing our ability to recover taxpayer money through the investigation of Medicaid provider fraud, abuse, and neglect.
The U.S. territories are subject to a hard, statutory cap on federal Medicaid support, unlike the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
As such, any spending for the operation of an MFCU is counted against the cap and subtracts from the amount of federal funding available for the coverage of healthcare services.
Congress has acknowledged this challenge.
We acted to exempt MFCU spending from Puerto Rico's cap through P.L. 115-31, Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017.
This exemption was extended to the U.S. Virgin Islands through P.L. 115-123, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.
We did not, however, extend this exemption to the other territories although all territories are statutorily required to operate an MFCU.
Congress has previously agreed that spending towards systems improvement measures should be exempt from the cap.
In addition to MFCUs, Congress has exempted spending related to Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive Program, and the design and operation of the claims and eligibility systems.
Without such exemptions, territories must choose between covering healthcare services or making systems improvements.
And faced with various emergencies--from natural disasters to a pandemic--in recent years, territories have prioritized the coverage of healthcare services.
Furthermore, certain territories have repeatedly exhausted their limited block grant, leaving no federal funding to support systems improvement measures.
My bill, the Medicaid Accountability Act of 2023, plugs a gap in our nation's ability to protect taxpayer money.
By extending the exemption on MFCU spending to all territories, Congress can promote the success of the territories in meeting statutory obligations to combat healthcare fraud and safeguard our Medicaid population from abuse, neglect, and misappropriation of funds.
I thank my colleagues who joined me in introducing this legislation-- Mr. Moylan, Ms. Plaskett, and Ms. Radewagen. ____________________
RECOGNIZING KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-10-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 164 Pages: E941 - E941 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the musical achievements of Kenny Wayne Shepherd.
Kenny received his first guitar from his grandmother at the age of four and began to play the guitar in earnest at age seven.
It is here when he began his love of the American genre of blues.
With a Stratocaster electric guitar replica, he taught himself to play one note at a time.
Growing up in Shreveport, Louisiana, he was exposed to music that influenced his relentless pursuit of his guitar skills and love of this art form.
From Elvis to Ledbelly, the combination of country, blues, and rock which flowed through his hometown created the musician we hear today.
His parents brought all varieties of music into his home, which deepened his appreciation for the talents and stylings of other artists.
From Hank Williams, James Brown, and Crosby Stills Nash and Young to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Albert King, these artists were the foundation of the musical talents we all enjoy today from Kenny Wayne.
At a very young age, Kenny's father brought John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters to Shreveport to p]ay.
This was the moment that turned on the light of blues music in Kenny Wayne's life.
