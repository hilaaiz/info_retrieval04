Kenny is a trailblazer, who, along with a cadre of incredible accompanying musicians, amazing songwriters, and the perfect mix of vocals, is an icon in American music.
Kenny continues to expand his musical horizons and skills, including his own vocals.
As important as Kenny's musical talents is his complete dedication to his wife, Hannah, and his six beloved children.
He is a remarkable father and role model for his family.
He and his wife have made it their life's work to ensure limitless possibilities for their children by nurturing their interests, talents, and abilities in every imaginable way.
Kenny is selflessly humble and appreciative of all those around him who have been a part of his path to success.
He is ceaseless with giving credit to his parents, his hometown, his upbringing, and friends and family in helping him along the way.
Our nation is grateful for Kenny's passion, commitment to his musical skills and his love of family and his fellow musicians in his continued journey to share his talents with folks here and around the world.
American blues is a unique genre of music that captures the soul of our country, and Kenny is a rare, and irreplaceable part of that emotion.
He is the quintessential artist and creator.
I thank Kenny Wayne Shepherd, for music that has and will continue to inspire generations

to come, for his devotion to family, fellow artists, associates and friends, and for his goodness and kindheartedness.
May God continue to continue to bless him and his family, team and bandmates. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise to congratulate Penelope ``Penny'' Gross on her retirement after 27 years of serving as the Fairfax County Mason District Supervisor and 21 years of chairing the Potomac Watershed Roundtable.
Elected in 1995 to represent the Mason District, Penny has been an advocate for affordable housing, expanded public transportation, and violence prevention.
Penny represents Fairfax County on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the Northern Virginia Regional Commission, the INOVA Health System Board of Trustees, and the Potomac Watershed Roundtable (PWR).
Shortly after becoming the chair of PWR, she encouraged the VA Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to help in developing strategies that will bring the state of Virginia up to the standard that Maryland had already set, regarding efforts that support the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Program.
With that, in July 2003, the Potomac River Tributary Strategy was developed by DCR.
In January 2004, Penny led the PWR in discussions for a 2004 vision, whose focal points influenced many water-related issues, such as Stormwater Management, Wastewater Treatment Plants, and Total Maximum Daily Load.
In April later that year Penny was appointed by then Governor Mark Warner to the Chesapeake Bay Blue Ribbon Funding Panel.
A panel tasked with finding alternative sources for funding the Chesapeake Bay Cleanup.
By October 2004, Chairman Gross announced some recommendations on behalf of the Chesapeake Bay Blue Bay Ribbon Finance Panel.
On the state and national level, Penny is a past president of the Virginia Association of Counties, vice-chair of the National Association of Counties' Energy, Environment, and Land Use Committee, and past president of the National Association of Regional Councils.
She was first appointed by Governor Mark Warner to the Local Government Advisory Committee (LGAC) to the Chesapeake Executive Council, which she chaired from March 2006 until August 2008, and continues to serve.
I had the great pleasure of serving with Penny during my 14 years on the Board, first representing the Providence District and then as Chairman.
