Retirement is to be celebrated and enjoyed.
It is not the end of a

career, but rather the beginning of a new adventure.
I commend Dr. Marc

A. Nigliazzo for his years of selfless service as well as his

commitment to the betterment of higher education.
He is an inspiration

to our community, and I wish him only the best in the years ahead.

HONORING THE VIETNAM AND KOREAN WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS

HON.
MIKE QUIGLEY

Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War

veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on July 12, 2023, with Honor

Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWII, Vietnam, and Korean War

veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on The National Mall

in Washington, D.C. These memorials were built to honor their courage

and service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures.
The Soldiers,

Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, who traveled here on

June 12th answered our Nation's call to service during one of its

greatest times of need.
From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean

Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service and

sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero.
We owe

them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women

for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to

rise and join me in expressing gratitude.
