Together the couple had 4 children.
A proud small business owner, Rosa was the owner and proprietor of Tony's Beauty Salon for over 70 years in addition to a small convenience store.
Rosa is still an active community member and has served in many city and local organizations, including the Eastern Star as well as serving as Choir Director and Vice President of Mount Olive Baptist Church.
Rosa still meets up weekly with a group of avid game players, and until recently taught piano.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday of Mrs. Rosa Cartwright.
We are so proud of her continued tenacity and spirit at such a well-seasoned age.
She continues to be a pillar of the Ypsilanti community and is a true beacon of love and friendship to all family and friends that are lucky enough to be in her presence.
Happy birthday to Rosa. ____________________
