Whenever a state of emergency is declared, it is because the authorities believe that the disaster that has occurred or is imminent, is severe enough to require State or federal aid to increase local resources to prevent and alleviate damage, suffering, and hardship to the affected communities.
The Air National Guard has an exceptionally unique role in aiding the prevention and recovery of these forms of disasters disaster.
Jackson Lee Amendment No.
1512 would have ensured that the Air National Guard was prepared to successfully fulfill their role in disaster prevention and recovery.
Jackson Lee Amendment No.
15l4 requires the Secretary of the Navy, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, to submit to the congressional defense committees a report on desalinization technology's application for defense and national security purposes to provide drought relief to areas impacted by sharp declines in water resources.
Throughout the history of our Nation, the U.S. Navy has been a pioneer in national defense and security technology.
The two main types of desalination systems on Navy ships, including reverse osmosis and distillation, produce up to 12,000 gallons of fresh, drinkable water a day.
The U.S. Navy has a unique opportunity to share resources and technology that lowers the cost of clean water production and use low- carbon energy sources.
Now, as climate change becomes an increasing national security concern, desalinization technology could have rippling benefits for drought concerns here

in the U.S. and around the world.
In one of the most unstable and geopolitical regions of the world, the Middle East and North Africa, water scarcity is a severe problem, with over 60 percent of the population having little or no access to drinking water.
Currently, the region is heavily dependent on their current system of desalination, which is expensive and energy intensive.
As many as 13 out of 22 Arab countries fall into the category of severe water scarcity and Navy desalination technology could make significant improvements in their process, addressing both climate change and security concerns.
Beyond addressing humanitarian concerns, this report will support needs here at home as water scarcity is a growing concern.
New desalination technologies could give Americans an opportunity to be prepared for the next water crisis.
Jackson Lee Amendment No.
1514 offered a proactive approach to protecting our national security and our planet as a whole.
