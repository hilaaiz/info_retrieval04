Mr. Speaker, on May 6 our North Texas community was left scarred by the shooting at Allen Premium Outlets.
Nine people were killed, and 7 others were injured.
But today, I recognize the brave story of the service of Gicela Aleman.
An unsung hero who that day was shopping for new shoes at the outlet mall with her daughter, Adele.
When the gunman opened fire, he severely wounded Preeti Patel, a mother and grandmother who was visiting family in North Texas and like so many others--was just trying to do some shopping.
Amidst the chaos and violence, Gicela sprung into action.
She grabbed Preeti and tried to slow her bleeding.
After seeing that ambulances were struggling to get through security, Gicela drove Preeti herself to get the care she needed.
Preeti is alive today because of Gicela.
An amazing story that deserves a hero's praise.
We thank her for her bravery, selflessness and representing the best of North Texas. ____________________

As Co-Chair of Congressional Caucus on Korea, I was grateful to have joined my colleagues in welcoming new Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States, His Excellency Hyun-Dong Cho and the Korean National Assembly ruling party delegation to the U.S. Capitol for a breakfast recognizing veterans of the Korean War.
I valued the opportunity to have met with 6 members of the ruling People Power Party Leader, Assemblyman Gi-Hyeon Kim, members of the National Assembly Chul-Gyu Lee, Seok-Ki Kim, Sang-Bum Yoo, Min-Kuk Kang, and Chairman of the International Relations Committee of the People Power Party and former National Assemblyman Jae-Young Lee.
