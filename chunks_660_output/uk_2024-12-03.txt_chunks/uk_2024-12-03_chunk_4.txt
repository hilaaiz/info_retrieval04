He described this period as the ``Third Great Era'' in Jewish

history--an era marked by Jewish self-determination.
This era would be

defined by Jews taking full responsibility for their own destiny, from

the establishment of the State of Israel to the creation of new

Diaspora institutions that would celebrate and sustain the full

spectrum of Jewish religiuos and ethnic identity.
Now, at 91, Rabbi

Greenberg explores this core principle of Tzelem Elokim in ``The

Triumph of Life: A Narrative Theology of Judaism'', a profound magnum

opus that encapsulates the breadth of his teachings.
Greenberg's vision

emphasizes justice, compassion, and dignity, with the sanctity of life

and the divine image inherent in every human being at its heart.
Throughout his career, Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his

commitment to these values, in partnership with his wife, Blu, a

trailblazing writer and founder of the Orthodox feminist movement.
Together, Rabbi Yitz and Blu Greenberg's progressive values have been

central to the educational philosophy of SAR Academy, the school they

founded in Riverdale, NY.
Inspired by the Open Education movement, they

envisioned a school with no walls, one that would foster creativity,

independence, and collaboration through open spaces and a student-

centered approach--a vision in this deep belief in the divine potential

inherent in every individual.
Today, more than fifty-six years later,

SAR continues to embody Rabbi Greenberg's vision, recognizing the

divine spark in each and every individual child.
The school challenges

students to live Torah values while fostering creativity, empathy, and

a commitment to building a better world.
Rabbi Greenberg has remained steadfast in his mission to advance

Judaism as dynamic, inclusive, and responsive to the challenges of the

modern world.
He has consistently advocated for the inclusion of women

and LGBTQ individuals in religious life, while also championing

interfaith dialogue as essential to fostering compassion and

understanding across communities.
In these dark and challenging times, Rabbi Greenberg's message serves

as a beacon of hope.
His teachings remind us of the transformative

power of goodness and respect for every individual in shaping a

brighter future for all.

HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE REO MOTOR CAR

COMPANY

HON.
ELISSA SLOTKIN

Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I honor the 120th anniversary of the

founding of the REO Motor Car Company, a pioneer in American automotive

history founded by Ransom E. Olds.
Established in 1904 in Lansing,

Michigan, REO played a foundational role in shaping both the automotive

industry and the city of Lansing.
Throughout its years in operation,

REO Motor Car Company stood as a symbol of innovation, producing

vehicles that helped define an era in American transportation.
REO Motor Car Company had a profound effect on Lansing.
By the 1920s,

REO employed 10 percent of the city's population, underscoring the

company's importance not only as a major employer but as a pillar of

the community.
The REO Clubhouse, built in 1917, served as a social

center for employees and their families, hosting weddings, patriotic

events during World War I and II, and even Lansing's first radio

station.
Through its commitment to its workforce and the community, REO

helped shape Lansing's identity as a manufacturing hub.
Among REO Motor Car Company's most celebrated vehicles were the REO

Speed Wagon, the Flying Cloud, and the Royale.
Introduced in 1915, the

REO Speed Wagon set a new standard for trucks with its speed and

durability, paving the way for the modern pickup truck.
The Flying

Cloud, launched in 1927, was known for its advanced hydraulic brakes,

which set a new benchmark in automotive safety.
The 1931 REO Royale

featured a streamlined design that made it a true trendsetter in

American car design.
Although REO ceased car production in 1936 to focus exclusively on

truck manufacturing, the company remained a force in the industry.
