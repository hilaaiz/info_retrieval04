Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Springfield native Brad Booker on the incredible achievement of winning an Oscar for his short film ``War is Over''.
This incredible achievement is even more impressive given that Brad was a first time Academy Award nominee.
Booker started his journey towards this incredible achievement in Springfield where he attended Glenwood High School and later Lincoln Land Community College.
Prior to his work on this short film, he worked as an animator at Warner Brothers Studios on films such as Iron Giant, Stuart Little, Spider Man, and Lord of the Rings.
I am honored to congratulate Brad, who still lives with his family in Chatham, on this incredible achievement.
His dedication serves as inspiration to me and all of those who call the Springfield region home.
Congratulations to him, his family, and his colleagues on this remarkable achievement.
I am looking forward to his next project. ____________________

THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. KEAN of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ellen Locker on her retirement and honor her 26 years of service as a member of the Hunterdon Health System Board of Trustees.
Under the exemplary leadership of Ms. Locker, the Hunterdon Health System has undergone tremendous growth.
Including the opening of the Hunterdon Regional Cancer Center, the opening of the Norman and Denise Guilloud Cardiovascular Center, and the expansion of primary care and health and wellness care systems across New Jersey.
During this time, Hunterdon Health not only expanded its physical network, but also increased its capacity to care by adopting and providing new and innovative procedures to treat a wider range of issues.
Furthermore, Hunterdon Health achieved impressive recognitions during the tenure of Ms. Locker, including eight consecutive `Leapfrog A' Hospital Safety Grades, four-time Magnet hospital designation, and its first 5- Star award from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
In 2020, Ms. Locker championed the greatest governance reorganization in the organization's history while simultaneously guiding the health system through the unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The revised governance model reshaped the 41-member representative body into a streamlined Board of 15 Trustees and resulted in the elimination of redundancies, an increase in efficiency, and a greater alignment with Hunterdon Health's mission and strategic direction.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Locker for her many contributions to residents in the 7th District and across the state of New Jersey.
Ms. Locker is an example of one of the many innovative leaders which makes the 7th District strong, and I congratulate her on a well-deserved retirement. ____________________
