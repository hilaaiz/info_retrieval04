MARKOWICH AS SHE RETIRES FROM NAVAIR ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my friend Amy Markowich as she retires as Executive Director for the Digital Analytics Infrastructure and Technology Advancement (DAiTA) and Mission Systems Groups, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)--located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in my district.
For over 30 years, the United States Navy and our community, state, and country have benefitted from her sound leadership.
Our Congress owes her a tremendous debt of gratitude for her service.
As Executive Director, Amy managed thousands of civilian and contractor personnel across multiple installations.
She guided them in their work developing and testing state-of-the-art naval aviation systems.
Amy also successfully oversaw $1.3 billion in National Asset laboratories, ensuring that these resources were used as effectively as possible to advance new technologies vital to keeping our servicemembers--and our Nation--safe.
Amy's tenure as Executive Director was just the latest chapter in a career defined by service and success.
Appointed to the Senior Executive Service in 2009, Amy also served as the Department of Navy (DON) Naval High Performance Computing (HPC) Principal, Deputy DON Test & Evaluation (T&E) Executive, the DON Modeling & Simulation (M&S) Executive, and a number of other important positions.
From spearheading development of the Air Combat Environment Test and Evaluation Facility, including the large anechoic chamber, and the Joint Simulation Environment to helping establish test configurations for various key aircraft, she has made numerous technical contributions.
These cutting-edge systems continue to help prepare our men and women in uniform to face down challenges in the field.
Crucially, no matter the post or project, Amy fostered a spin of innovation and culture of collaboration that will long endure.
Amy's work has also extended to representing the United States in many capacities at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other international organizations.
Amy's leadership in both domestic and international situations often placed her as a top leader and often as the only woman in key technical roles where she established herself as a respected authority.
I've been proud to work with Amy to ensure that Congress provides the hardworking team at Naval Air Station Patuxent River with the resources it needs to conduct this essential work.
She has been an excellent host during my many visits to the base over the years, and I--like many others--will be sad to see her go.
Her leadership in building capabilities for the Department of Defense has always been forward- looking and provided our Nation with the tools necessary to remain at the forefront of development and testing of the most complex weapons systems in the world.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in thanking one of the

smartest, most dedicated people I know: Amy Markowich.
Although she is stepping back as Executive Director, I know that her commitment to serving her fellow Americans will never waver.
For that, she has the gratitude of her Congress and her country.
I wish Amy and her husband Brian well as they embark on the next chapter of their lives. ____________________
