FRANK PALLONE, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to commemorate the life of my dear friend, Michael J. Cioffi, who passed away on March 23, 2024 after a courageous battle with cancer and other 9/11-related illnesses.
A resident of Ocean Township, Michael was born and raised in Long Branch and served his hometown's fire department for 14 years before serving with the New York City Fire Department (FDNY).
Although off- duty on September 11, 2001, the day of the attack, Michael didn't hesitate to rush into New York City to assist his fellow firefighters and emergency personnel and spent the next several months meticulously working through rubble at the site.
Despite the illnesses he endured as a result of his work at the World Trade Center site, Michael continued to serve with the FDNY until 2020.
Michael was tough and determined, and his duty to serve was profound.
Michael demonstrated character and leadership throughout his life and was deeply committed to each endeavor he undertook.
Michael is survived by his loving family, including his wife Sylvia and six children, Michael Luciano, Sofia, Maryella, Christopher, Jack, and Emma.
His dedication to his family was evident and I am blessed to have had such a wonderful friend in Michael.
Michael should be remembered for his decades of service to Long Branch and New York City as a firefighter, most notably his selfless actions following the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center, which contributed to his health battles.
I know I join with his family, friends, and fellow firefighters in paying tribute to his memory and the ultimate sacrifice he paid in service to our community. ____________________

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the distinguished career of Monica Silbas on the occasion of her retirement as Chief of Staff for the International President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM).
During her more than 20 years of union leadership, Monica has made a lasting impact throughout her career on behalf of working people and the Labor Movement.
Additionally, Monica helped found the Latino Labor Lobbyists group, the IAM's Spanish Leadership Program, and served as Co-Chair of the Women of Labor organization, in which capacity I had the great fortune of working alongside her.
Monica started her career with IAM in 1986 as a Customer Service Agent at Northwest Airlines in Los Angeles, where she was initiated into IAM Local 2785.
She quickly rose as a leader in organizing with her Labor brothers and sisters, and in 1999 became the IAM Transportation Department's Education Representative.
In this role, she initiated and won several organizing campaigns representing airline and railroad workers.
She then joined as IAM Assistant Political and Legislative Director before becoming the Chief of Staff to the International President.
Monica has dedicated decades of her work to expanding the reach and inclusion of the Labor Movement.
Fluent in Spanish, Monica was among the founding members of the IAM's Spanish Leadership Working Group, and was crucial in developing materials and resources for IAM in Spanish.
As Co-Chair of the Women of Labor organization, she helped lift and encourage women in the Labor Movement.
Finally, she was a member of the Executive Committee of IndustriALL Global Union, representing over 50 million workers in 140 countries.
Throughout it all, Monica has been an unwavering voice for working families.
