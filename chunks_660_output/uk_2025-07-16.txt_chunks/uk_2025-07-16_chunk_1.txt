CELEBRATING SCOTT W. HOBSON ON HIS RETIREMENT

HON.
JEFF HURD

Mr. HURD of Colorado.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and

celebrate Scott W. Hobson of Pueblo, Colorado, as he retires from the

Pueblo City Planning & Community Development Department.
Scott's career in public service began in Canon City, where he served

as Director of the Fremont County Special District Parks and

Recreation.
During that time, he earned two national certifications--

Certified Parks and Recreation Professional and Certified Parks and

Recreation Executive.
One of his proudest accomplishments there was

helping create the Arkansas River Trail and launching recreational

programs that brought the community together.
In 1980, Scott married Janice Chambers, and together they raised

three wonderful daughters, Cindi Selvage, Amanda Hobson, and Lauren

Snell.
Scott continued his public service in Summit County as an Open Space

Manager, focusing on preserving the beauty and open land of the region.
In 1998, he and his family made the move to Pueblo, a place they have

called home ever since.
Scott began working with the City of Pueblo,

where, for more than two decades, he became a key figure in shaping and

strengthening the community.
From the Historic Arkansas Riverwalk to Kayak Park and river

restoration efforts, Scott brought energy, vision, and a deep sense of

care to every project.
His understanding of Pueblo's history is second

to none, and he has always had a heart for building strong, vibrant

neighborhoods.
Scott's legacy is one of service, dedication, and a genuine love for

Southern Colorado.
We thank him for all he has given, and we wish him

the very best in this next chapter.

CELEBRATING THE CITY OF RAYTOWN'S 75TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
EMANUEL CLEAVER

Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Raytown

as it celebrates the 75th anniversary of its incorporation as a city.
Finding its foundations as a crossroads for road-weary travelers, this

city remains one of the warmest and most welcoming communities in my

district.
Raytown's rich history begins long before its incorporation,

stretching back to the 1820's when pioneers transversing the Santa Fe

Trail built a small settlement there.
A mere day's journey from

Independence via covered wagon, Raytown represented the final township

for settlers and adventurers to stock up on supplies.
Cattle, oxen,

fresh fruits and vegetables were commonly purchased from farmers in the

area.
Skilled laborers such as blacksmiths, wagon repairmen, and iron

workers began to settle in the area as well, responding to a growing

need for their expertise along the wagon trains.
One such laborer, a blacksmith named William Ray, moved to Jackson

County in 1848 and established his forge at the crossroads of the Santa

Fe Trail with other local trails.
Ray's shop, and even Ray himself,

soon became a prominent landmark, and by 1854, the area was known as

``Ray's Town,'' which eventually turned to ``Raytown''.
The city's

legacy as a center of trails and as a rendezvous meeting point, echoes

today in the community's strong network of parks, historic sites, and

trails throughout the city.
A century after people began to call the area Raytown, residents

acted to legally incorporate the city on July 17, 1950.
They mobilized

in response to Kansas City's annexation of surrounding towns and began

signing petitions to remain a distinct locality from Kansas City,

showing the same streak of local pride, fierce autonomy, and initiative

that still embodies Raytown and its residents 75 years later.
Raytown's community has changed substantially since its advent, from

the city's agrarian roots to a suburban business hub.
The city began

with a single store, a post office, and a doctor's office, but

currently hosts over 2,500 businesses, a testament to how the city has

expanded over the years.
