HONORING LEE CLARK

HON.
AUGUST PFLUGER

Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in tribute to the life and

legacy of Lee Clark, a soft-spoken and kind country gentleman, a loving

husband, an amazing father, and a true friend.
Lee passed into the arms

of our Lord on Friday, June 27, 2025.
His loss is deeply felt by all

who had the privilege of knowing him.
A sixth-generation Texan and rancher, Lee exemplified the values of

integrity, diligence, and quiet strength that define the best of rural

Texas.
Born and raised in Menard, Lee Clark, a steward of the land,

devoted his life to the care of his livestock and range.
His tireless

work ethic, principled nature, and gift for storytelling earned him the

respect and affection of all who knew him.
On September 8, 1990, Lee married his best friend and the love of his

life, Lisa Price Clark.
Together they built a life centered on faith,

family, and hard work.
Lee was a devoted father to his two daughters,

Candice and Madelon, and he was endlessly proud of the women they

became.
He was dearly loved by his family and inspired those who

crossed his path with his encouragement.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Lee Clark--a

devoted family man, a true Texas rancher, a pillar of his community,

and a man who lived with steadfast purpose.
May God grant comfort and

peace to Lisa, Candice, Madelon, and all who mourn his loss.
May Lee's

memory be a blessing, and may he rest in eternal peace.

NTIA POLICY AND CYBERSECURITY COORDINATION ACT

speech of

HON.
ZOE LOFGREN

Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1766,

The NTIA Policy and Cybersecurity Coordination Act.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or

NTIA, is a critical agency within the Department of Commerce that works

across the Federal government to develop telecommunications and

information policy.
Congress should support this agency and give it the

resources and authorities it needs to fulfill its current mission.
However, this bill would waste taxpayer dollars by unnecessarily

duplicating activities already authorized by Congress.
The NTIA was originally part of its sister agency, the National

Institute of Standards and Technology.
Since Congress established NTIA

as its own agency in 1978, the two agencies have carried out

complementary but distinct areas of work.
NIST serves as an

independent, unbiased arbiter of trusted measurements and standards

while NTIA has its regulatory responsibilities.
These two agencies often work together, unfortunately this bill would

swell NTIA's mission into a cybersecurity role to which it does not

possess the appropriate experience or expertise and blur the lines

between the agencies, especially on issues related to cybersecurity.
For example, Congress authorized NIST, in collaboration with CISA, to

conduct a cybersecurity activity related to the internet and

communications networks in the Cybersecurity Enhancements Act of 2014,

the CHIPS and Science Act of 2020, the HACKED Act of 2021, and more.
H.R. 1766 would directly duplicate, at NTIA, those ongoing efforts

underway at NIST.
There is also a provision in the bill that implicates

agencies outside of the Department of Commerce by duplicating the

Department of Homeland Security's information technology supply chain

security programs.
This Act was included as part of a broader NTIA Reauthorization that

was considered in

the 118th Congress.
