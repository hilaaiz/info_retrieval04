In addition to their dedication to the family business, the Faria cousins are active members of the Tulare community, having volunteered on several boards of organizations that help to serve the local agricultural community.
As the recipient of this year's award, the Faria Cousins are being recognized for their commitment to Central Valley agriculture and dedication to giving back to the community.
The success of Faria Land and Cattle is a true testament to the Faria family's hard work and perseverance.
I am confident that their work will continue to strengthen the Tulare agricultural community for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating Faria Land and Cattle as they are awarded the 63rd Annual Farmers of the Year Award. ____________________

Date: 2024-05-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 84 Pages: E495 - E495 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE SACRIFICE OF DEPUTY ELTON C. STOVER ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and sacrifice of Berrien County Sheriff Deputy Elton C. Stover.
Deputy Stover was born November 21, 1910, in Berrien County and pursued a career in law enforcement, serving in the Berrien Springs Police Department, Comstock Police Department, and served as the Constable of Lincoln Township.
On December 3, 1965, armed gunmen targeted the Farmers & Merchants National Bank in Benton Township.
Berrien County Sheriff Deputies Elton Stover and Gary Mitchell responded to the call for help.
Upon arrival to the scene, Deputies Stover and Mitchell were immediately met with an array of gunfire with both men being struck.
As Deputy Stover laid on the bank floor he was hit with two bullets, smashing through his chest and right leg.
He and Deputy Mitchell were rushed to Mercy Hospital in Benton Harbor, where he underwent what was thought to be a successful surgery.
Unfortunately, Deputy Stover's condition deteriorated, and he passed away during surgery at 2.55 p.m. on December 10, 1965, making the ultimate sacrifice in service to the people of Berrien County.
To this day, Deputy Elton C. Stover remains the only Deputy in the history of the Benton County Sheriff's Department to be killed in the line of duty.
Mr. Speaker, each day, law enforcement officials like Deputy Stover help to keep our communities safe, rush into dangerous situations, and lay down their lives to protect their fellow citizens.
It is my solemn honor to remember Deputy Elton Stover and all fallen law enforcement officers from Michigan's 4th Congressional District, the state, and throughout the country. ____________________
