Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a significant milestone in the agricultural community of Ballico, California--the centennial anniversary of the Cortez Growers Association.
Established on April 18, 1924, by four visionary Japanese immigrants, the Cortez Growers Association began as a small cooperative endeavor to market fruits and vegetables effectively despite language barriers.
The founders employed a bilingual agent, ensuring their enterprise's early success and sustainability.
The association thrived, even through the Great Depression, expanding its membership and operational capacity.
By 1932, twenty-six additional members had joined, and Cortez Growers Association appointed its first full-time manager.
However, the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent internment of Japanese Americans dealt a severe blow to the association.
All members, being of Japanese descent, were either interned or enlisted in the military, many serving in the highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team.
Despite these adversities, the Cortez Growers Association's land was preserved through trust and leased to neighboring farmers, allowing the association to regain its footing post-war.
The resilience and determination of the members during these trying times are a testament to their commitment to their community and country.
In the ensuing decades, the Cortez Growers Association has continued to adapt and thrive.
Transitioning from a diverse crop base to focusing solely on almond production, the association has stayed at the forefront of agricultural innovation and efficiency.
Today, the Cortez Growers Association is a leader in the almond industry and a pillar in agricultural advocacy, helping to found the Almond Alliance.
As we commemorate a century of enduring legacy, the Cortez Growers Association is a beacon of community resilience, adaptability, and success.
The values of faith, family, and dedication to future generations are as alive today as they were a hundred years ago.
With great pride, I recognize the Cortez Growers Association for its century of service to the agricultural community and the nation.
I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Cortez Growers Association for 100 years of service and offer my sincerest wishes for their future. ____________________
EQUAL REPRESENTATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-05-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 84 Pages: E496 - E497 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E496-E497] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EQUAL REPRESENTATION ACT ______ speech of HON.
BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 7109, the Equal Representation Act.
H.R. 7109 would mandate that the decennial Census include a citizenship question, and that the apportionment of U.S. Representatives be based solely on a count of American citizens.
This is yet another attempt by House Republicans to advance their anti- immigrant political agenda by sabotaging the Census, which is required by the U.S. Constitution.
This bill would deliberately undermine the Census's ability to reach chronically undercounted populations.
The resulting impact would be to make future Censuses more costly and lead to inaccurate data that will have wide-ranging implications for Minnesota and our nation.
Accurate Census data is necessary for determining the number of U.S. House of Representatives seats and Electoral College votes allocated to each state, as well as the share of trillions of dollars in federal funding each state receives.
For Minnesota, an inaccurate count could result in the loss of representation in Congress and less federal funding for essential services, causing unnecessary harm to our communities.
This bill threatens the accuracy of the Census and diminishes public trust.
It would lead to manipulation of election maps and the hindering of the fair allocation of federal resources.
