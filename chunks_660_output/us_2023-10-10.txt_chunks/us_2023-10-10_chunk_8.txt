The club is passionate about the well-being of the city's residents and focuses many of their efforts on strengthening local schools, libraries, and youth programs.
For a century, the Wasco Woman's Club has offered a chance for women of all ages to come together and give back to the Central Valley community.
The club is a strong supporter of the Ronald McDonald House and Toys for Tigers organization, helping children and their families get through incredibly difficult situations.
Additionally, the club hosts regular events for those in the community, including the Wasco High School Student Art and Photography Awards and the Christmas with Santa Event for special needs students.
The club is also the proud owner of the oldest adobe building in the city, which they use to host special events and community gatherings.
Amid all of their work, the members of the Wasco Woman's Club are committed to uplifting each other through their long-standing friendships and shared commitment to the betterment of the community.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the Wasco Woman's Club on their 100-year anniversary.
Their work to enrich the community of Wasco will be felt for generations to come. ____________________
