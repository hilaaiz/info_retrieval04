As such, she is not only a proponent for positive social change but also a leader in her community.
She has worked throughout her city to bring about transformative programs in areas such as affordable housing and homelessness.
Claudia is known for forging alliances between key stakeholders across diverse communities.
Her background as an immigrant from Colombia has helped shape her motivations as a community organizer.
Trained as an architect in Colombia, she moved to Richmond in 2009, took English language classes, did volunteer work to practice her skills, and earned a Master of Environmental Planning from UC Berkeley.
Claudia accomplished all this while caring for two children and still found time to lead campaigns and volunteer with other mothers in her neighborhood.
Now as a Richmond City Councilmember, she is even more committed to improving the lives of those in her community and making Richmond one of the more affordable places to live in the Bay Area.
Her commitment to her community and improving all different aspects of public life is an inspiration to all who know her.
