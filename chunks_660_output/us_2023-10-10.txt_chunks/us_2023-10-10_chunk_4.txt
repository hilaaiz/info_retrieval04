As a victim of gun violence herself, Ebony founded a nonprofit, Broken By Violence, to help families like hers heal after being impacted by gun violence.
Broken By Violence has provided services to hundreds of families, including rental assistance, food assistance, emergency housing, mental health service referrals, and monthly healing spaces for survivors.
She has worked with Solano Family Justice Center, the Vallejo Police Department, the City of Vallejo, and the Alameda County District Attorney to provide victims services and has also advocated for legislation that would better support survivors throughtout California.
Although her life was irrevocably changed by tragedy, through her strength and determination, she became a beacon of hope for others.
Her resilience and dedication to serving others is an inspiration to all who meet her.
She truly embodies the values of a woman of courage by showing kindness, wisdom, humility, and compassion.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Ebony Antoine for her positive contributions to our community.
HONORING THE 2023 WOMEN OF THE YEAR: JUDGE DIANA BECTON; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-10-10 Volume: 169, Issue: 165 Pages: E943 - E944 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E943-E944] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 2023 WOMEN OF THE YEAR: JUDGE DIANA BECTON ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker pro tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Judge Diana Becton as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Diana Becton has been Contra Costa County's District Attorney since her 2017 swearing in.
Diana is the first woman, first African American, and first woman of color to serve in the role since its creation in 1850.
This accomplishment alone shows the historical impact she has had on her community.
For 22 years Diana, served as a judge in Contra Costa County where she was elected and became president of the National Association of Women Judges.
She is known not only for upholding the law and holding people accountable, but also for striving to improve Contra Costa County's judicial system by focusing on disrupting the school to prison pipeline, creating safe alternatives for low-level non-violent offenders, and addressing the mental health needs of our community.
She created the Reimagine Youth Justice Task Force to create alternatives to juvenile hall for young offenders and has made efforts to curb racial bias in her department by partnering with the non-profit Vera Institute of Justice to evaluate her office's decision making.
Diana's accomplishments in the judiciary are too enumerable and impressive to list briefly as she is truly a pillar of her community and a testament to the excellence found in our district.
Diana, far from doing business as usual, has aimed to fundamentally change many aspects of our often- harsh criminal justice system to decrease bias and fulfill its duty to serve justice.
On behalf of the people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and recognize Diana Becton for her positive contributions to our community. ____________________
