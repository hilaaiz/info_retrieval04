He served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and saw

combat in some of the most pivotal battles of the war, including the

Battle of Okinawa.
Just three days before his death, we marked the 80th

anniversary of that battle, which serves as a reminder of the high cost

of freedom and the courage of those like Bob who helped secure it.
His

ship later guarded Tokyo Bay during the signing of Japan's formal

surrender, helping to usher in the end of the war.
In 1948, Bob returned home and joined the Kern County Fire

Department.
Over the course of a 30-year career, he rose through the

ranks to become the department's fifth fire chief.
Having worked

alongside Kern County's very first fire chief, Harold Boway, he was a

bridge between generations and remains the only known person to have

driven the department's first fire engine, a 1929 Moreland, on active

calls.
In his later years, Bob remained an active and honored member of the

community.
He was part of the very first Kern County Honor Flight to

Washington, D.C., where he visited the World War II Memorial and the

U.S. Capitol in recognition of his service.
On his 100th birthday, he

was celebrated by friends, neighbors, veterans, and members of the Kern

County Fire Department, who gave their former chief a ceremonial ride

in a working fire engine--a fitting tribute for a life of courage and

leadership.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of

Bob Lechtreck, Sr.,
who was a patriot and a pillar of Kern County.
His

memory will endure in the hearts of those he inspired and the

institutions he helped build.
