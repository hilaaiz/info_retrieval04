What happened in my district can happen anywhere in America, in any downtown.
We can and need to do more to minimize the economic damage inflicted on local businesses from projects that receive federal transportation monies.
The legislation will require local sponsors to create a BUMP fund that provides financial assistance for local entities that will experience a measurable interruption causing negative financial impact from the project.
The fund can cover utilities, insurance, rent or mortgage, payroll, loss of income, and any other expense that the sponsor determines is needed for the impacted businesses.
Importantly, the local sponsors who know the local community and best understand the impacts of the project create and manage the BUMP fund.
The local sponsor further determines how much to contribute to the fund, how the fund is structured, which entities are eligible for funding, and what type of expenses should be covered.
The requirement to create a BUMP fund only applies to highway projects with a total cost equal or greater than $50 million and transit projects with a total cost equal or greater to $100 million with measurable negative financial impacts on local businesses and nonprofits.
The bill also creates a one-time grant opportunity for businesses and nonprofits that are currently struggling financially from an interruption created by a major transportation project.
It is important to America's economy that local businesses can continue to serve our communities after completion of transportation projects.
I am introducing this legislation to make sure no other business is forced to face financial turmoil or close due to an interruption caused by a major transportation project.
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this crucial initiative, allowing our Nation's vibrant local economies to stay afloat during the construction of major infrastructure projects and reap the benefits of

these transit and highway projects upon their completion. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD FEDERAL EMPLOYEE LEAVE FAIRNESS ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
187



Date: 2023-11-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 187 Pages: E1093 - E1094 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1093-E1094] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD FEDERAL EMPLOYEE LEAVE FAIRNESS ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia National Guard Federal Employee Leave Fairness Act, which would prohibit the Department of Defense (DOD) from recouping pay from District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) members who are federal civilian employees or District of Columbia employees and took encampment leave.
The DOD claims these employees were not entitled to encampment leave without a loss of pay.
While I disagree with the DOD's interpretation, I am introducing this bill to resolve this matter.
Congress partially addressed this matter in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (NDAA) by adopting my amendment that effectively prohibited the DOD from recouping pay for encampment leave taken by DCNG members after the enactment of the NDAA.
That amendment, however, did not apply to encampment leave taken before the enactment of the NDAA because of budget rules.
In 1899, Congress codified in the D.C. Code the original authority for entitlement to leave when federal civilian employees were mobilized by the DCNG.
In 1968, that authority was moved into 5 U.S.C. Sec.
6323.
In that same year, Congress authorized two additional leave entitlements in 5 U.S.C. Sec.
6323, as well as established a salary offset provision in 5 U.S.C. Sec.
5519 referencing those two additional leave entitlements.
However, because the U.S. Code had not been updated to include the earlier DCNG authority, the U.S. Code contained a duplicate subsection, one referring to DCNG mobilizations and one to a general leave entitlement for the National Guard and Reserves.
