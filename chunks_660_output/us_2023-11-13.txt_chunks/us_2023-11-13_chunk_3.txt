6323, as well as established a salary offset provision in 5 U.S.C. Sec.
5519 referencing those two additional leave entitlements.
However, because the U.S. Code had not been updated to include the earlier DCNG authority, the U.S. Code contained a duplicate subsection, one referring to DCNG mobilizations and one to a general leave entitlement for the National Guard and Reserves.
Based on this legislative drafting error, the DOD has sometimes attempted to apply a salary offset to DCNG members who are federal employees and took encampment leave, and the DOD has indicated it will do so again soon.
The Government Accountability Office (GAO), has said that 5 U.S.C. Sec.
6323(c) was not intended to be subject to a salary offset under 5 U.S.C. Sec.
5519 and noted in 1990 that the ``[Office of Personnel Management] advised that it now believes that the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec.
5519 do not apply to D.C. National Guardsmen under the circumstances described in 5 U.S.C. Sec.
6323(c).''
However, the Office of Personnel Management once again believes that the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec.
5519 apply to 5 U.S.C. Sec.
6323(c).
DCNG members sincerely believed that they were taking this leave correctly, they have relied on this money, the recoupment will cause financial hardships for current and former DCNG members and it was Congress' intent that DCNG members were entitled to this leave without a salary offset.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to recognize this year's Catherine McAuley Distinguished Alumnae Honoree at Mount Mercy Academy, Meghan Crotty Quinn.
For over a century, Mount Mercy Academy has been a beacon of light and an indispensable institution within our community.
With a unique focus on academic excellence, women's leadership, and a commitment to building a just society, it is only proper to commend the alumni who have contributed to this much- deserved reputation.
A proud South Buffalo resident, Meghan and her husband Kevin Quinn are the proud parents of Kiera (Mount Mercy Academy, Class of 2027), son Rory and daughter Colleen.
Meghan is the daughter of Anita Durkin Crotty (Mount Mercy Academy Class of 1963) and Patrick Crotty.
Meghan is a business and community leader.
She graduated from John Carroll University in 2007 and earned the title of Certified Public Accountant shortly thereafter.
Meghan's rise in the banking industry has been rapid; after a stint with M&T Bank, she now serves as a Senior Vice President in the Commercial Banking division at HSBC Bank.
She has twice been recognized by her peers as a top 100 performer in United States commercial banking and is a recipient of the Irish Echo's 40 Under 40 Award in 2021.
Meanwhile, her professional success has been coupled with a steadfast commitment of paying it forward.
