DARIN LaHOOD of illinois in the house of representatives Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Jim DeRose on his retirement as Bradley University's Men's Soccer Coach after 28 successful seasons.
Beginning his career in 1996 at the age of 28 as the youngest coach in NCAA Division I men's soccer, Jim quickly emerged as a dominant figure in the soccer community.
Jim guided the Braves to the regular- season Missouri Valley Conference title in 1998, followed by the program's first NCAA Tournament appearance in 2000.
Under Jim's leadership, Bradley's soccer program reached new heights and resulted in a 2007 run to the NCAA Elite Eight, where Jim was chosen as the Soccer America National Coach of the Year.
Jim's record speaks volumes of his commitment and dedication to the game.
During his tenure as head coach, Bradley held a 267-227-66 record with seven NCAA tournament appearances, the highest for any coach in Bradley University Athletics history.
Jim finishes his career as the second-winningest coach in Missouri Valley Conference soccer history and coached the only four-year all-Americans in MVC men's soccer history.
In addition to his accomplishments on the pitch, the accomplishments of his players in the classroom and post-graduation are a testament to his ability to grow his players into successful young men.
Six former assistant coaches have gone on to become NCAA Division I head coaches, sixteen players have been selected for all-American academic awards, and nine have been selected in the Major League Soccer SuperDraft.
Jim has been an integral part of growing the game of soccer throughout central Illinois and his legacy will last for years to come.
It is my privilege to congratulate Jim DeRose on his retirement after 28 years with Bradley University Men's Soccer and wish him, his wife Robin, and his two children, Raleigh and J.R., all the best. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS UNINTERRUPTED MONETARY PROGRAM ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 187 Pages: E1094 - E1095 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1094-E1095] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE BUSINESS UNINTERRUPTED MONETARY PROGRAM ACT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Business Uninterrupted Monetary Program Act of 2023 (BUMP Act).
This crucial piece of legislation provides essential funding to businesses and nonprofits that have been directly and measurably fInancially impacted by major transportation projects, with the goal of keeping them solvent.
With major transit and highway projects planned across the country, the livelihoods and survival of some local businesses may be at risk because of construction disruptions that impede customers' access to their store fronts.
In my own district, on the heels of closures caused by the COVID pandemic, a major transit project prevented customers from accessing stores in downtown Santa Ana, CA for months.
Many of those businesses struggled to pay their rent and utility bills, pay for their inventory, and some had to close permanently as a result.
Efforts to help the businesses, such as signage, failed.
What they needed were financial resources.
What happened in my district can happen anywhere in America, in any downtown.
We can and need to do more to minimize the economic damage inflicted on local businesses from projects that receive federal transportation monies.
The legislation will require local sponsors to create a BUMP fund that provides financial assistance for local entities that will experience a measurable interruption causing negative financial impact from the project.
