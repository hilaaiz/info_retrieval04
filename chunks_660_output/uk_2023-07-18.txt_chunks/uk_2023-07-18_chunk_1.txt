CONGRATULATING EMILIA LABRUYERE ON HER CLASS 5 STATE CHAMPIONSHIP

HON.
BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to

join me in congratulating Timberland High School's Emilia Labruyere on

her victory in Missouri's Class 5 Discus State Championship.
Emilia claimed the Class 5 title, becoming the Wolves' first female

track and field state champion.
Her incredible, winning throw of 42.14

meters matched both her personal best and school record-winning toss of

the same distance a month prior.
Emilia should be commended for all her

hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state

championship to her school and community.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Emilia Labruyere for a job

well done.
