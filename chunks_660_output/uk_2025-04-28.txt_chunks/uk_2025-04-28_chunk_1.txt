HONORING PETER PEARSON

HON.
THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.
Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Peter

Pearson, a 57-year resident of New Jersey's 7th Congressional District,

who recently passed away at the age of 83.

Andover, he was elected member of the Andover Regional Board of

from 2002 to 2022.
Additionally, Mr. Pearson served as comptroller for

multiple small businesses and as the School Business Administrator for

several of the surrounding school districts for over 25 years.
Mr.

Pearson was always ready to help with anything that would better his

community and will be remembered for his kind personality and

dedication to serving those around him.
I am honored to be able to

recognize such a dedicated and thoughtful resident of my district.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MARY SELECKY

HON.
SUZAN K. DelBENE

Ms. DelBENE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, alongside my colleague Rep.

Dan Newhouse, to honor the life and legacy of Washington's former

Secretary of Health Mary Selecky, who we both had the honor of serving

besides in former Governor Christine Gregoire's cabinet.
For over four

decades, Mary dedicated her life and career to improving public health

across Washington.
She began her career as the administrator for the

Northeast Tri County Health District.
In 1999, she was appointed as the

Secretary of Health by Governor Gary Locke and continued in that role

under Governors Gregoire and Jay Inslee until her retirement in 2013.
During her tenure as Washington's Secretary of Health, Mary was

instrumental in reducing smoking rates and increasing childhood

vaccination coverage across the state.
She was known for her commitment

to preventive care and for strengthening the collaboration between

state and local health agencies.
In 2020, during the onset of the

COVID-19 pandemic, the state drew on Mary's commitment to preparedness

for a public health emergency.
During our time in the cabinet with her,

we valued her expertise, tenacity, and mentorship that she provided to

all.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Mary was deeply connected to

her community in Colville, Washington, where she resided for over 50

years.
Her dedication to both her local community and the broader

public health landscape left a lasting impact on the state.
Mr.

Speaker, we ask our colleagues to join us in honoring Mary Selecky's

life and contributions to public health, as well as Washington.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS.
CHIQUITA MICHELE GREENE

HON.
SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the

extraordinary life and legacy of Ms. Chiquita Michele Greene--a devoted

educator, trailblazer, and servant leader from Southwest Georgia.
Her

unwavering commitment to her students and the greater community has

profoundly touched countless lives across Georgia and the Nation.
Sadly, Ms. Greene transitioned from labor to reward on April 6, 2025.
A

celebration of her life was held on Monday, April 14, 2025, at Unity

Baptist Church in Sylvester, Georgia.
Ms. Greene was born from the union of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur L. and

Earnestine Greene.
Raised in Sylvester, Georgia, Ms. Greene embodied

academic excellence, purpose, and pride in her heritage from an early

age.
A 1995 graduate of Worth County High School, she made history as

the first African American member of the school's dance team--an early

indicator of the pioneering spirit that would define her life's work.
After high school, Ms. Greene attended Albany State University (ASU),

earning her bachelor's degree in Early Childhood Education and later

pursued advanced degrees in education at Wheelock College, Walden

University, Georgia Southern University, and Northcentral University.
