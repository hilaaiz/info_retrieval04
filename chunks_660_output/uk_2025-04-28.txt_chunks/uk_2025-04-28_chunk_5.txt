GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding

contributions that Daniel Flores has made to our community through his

work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter, which serves homeless kids aged

10-17 who are between foster homes; abandoned, or homeless.
The whole

team jumps in to take care of the kids who have no one else looking out

for them.
They teach kids structure, respect, understanding and so much

more in a loving environment.
The team really cares, and each member is

deeply invested in the kids' long-term success.
It is clear Daniel Flores has made a profoundly positive impact on

our community, and I am grateful for his service.
May we all strive to

serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
