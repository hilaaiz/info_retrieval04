BATTLE CREEK'S 150TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
MIKE FLOOD

Mr. FLOOD.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to honor Battle Creek, Nebraska as

they celebrate their

150th birthday.
One hundred fifty years ago in August 1873, Battle

Creek was founded.
Sitting along the Elkorn River Valley in Madison

County, Battle Creek has grown through the years, welcoming new

families, businesses, and visitors.
With a population of a few more than 1,000 people, they exhibit the

best of what small town Nebraska has to offer: A great quality of life,

family-owned businesses, and great recreation.
They're one of the first

stops on the Cowboy Trail.
And Battle Creek is proud of its community

members--both new and old.
One outstanding example is Rose O'Neill, the

cartoonist who imagined the Kewpie Doll, which has gained fame around

the world.
As Battle Creek reaches this sesquicentennial birthday,

there is much to celebrate.

CELEBRATING CHOWCHILLA'S CENTENNIAL EVENT

HON.
JOHN S. DUARTE

Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the city of

Chowchilla's Centennial Celebration being held on September 23rd.
Since its incorporation 100 years ago on February 7, 1923, Chowchilla

has distinguished itself as a vibrant agricultural city, idyllically

nestled between the cities of Fresno and Merced, with close access to

the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the Pacific Coastline, and Yosemite

National Park.
Chowchilla hosts a rich culture that traces its roots back to the

Chowchilla tribe who inhabited the area; the name `Chowchilla' being a

byword for bravery to the southernmost end of the Yokuts territory in

the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley.
At the heart of its celebratory traditions is the Western Stampede

Cattle Drive which arrives in Chowchilla every year with great fanfare

and excitement, showcasing the city's rich history.
And Downtown

Chowchilla displays the city's historical buildings and storefronts.
While home to only about 19,000 people, it's the birthplace of Ronald

D. Moore, best known for his work on Star Trek, and Cameron Worrell,

former NFL player of the Chicago Bears.
Chowchilla is now a part of a unique collective history--along with

other small communities such as Kerman and Patterson--that emerged from

the foresight of a real estate promoter O.A. Robertson who envisioned

the productive and agricultural significance of the area to

California's Central Valley.

========================= END NOTE =========================

On behalf of the people of California's 13th Congressional District,

I congratulate Chowchilla on 100 years of community-building that

contributes so greatly to the Central Valley, and the state of

California.
