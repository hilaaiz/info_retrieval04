One hundred years ago, a small real estate rally took place

that is credited with the inception of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Today, the Palos Verdes Peninsula is comprised of 4 beautiful cities.
The first city to be incorporated on the peninsula was Palos Verdes

Estates in 1939, followed by Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates in

1957, and most recently Rancho Palos Verdes in 1973.
On June 17, 1923, real estate developers hosted a rally to encourage

individuals to buy property on the peninsula.
This event invited people

to hear about the development plan for the Peninsula and led to one of

Nation's first planned communities.
The original site of the rally is

where the offices of the Palos Verdes Unified District now stands.
What

was once empty land with rolling hills and scenic views has transformed

into a beautiful community with an amazing school district, businesses,

and homes.
Today, the Peninsula is home to roughly 80,000 residents--

all of whom are my constituents.
The illustrious history of the Palos Verdes Peninsula was celebrated

on June 17, 2023, with Doors Open Peninsula 2023: Celebrating 100 Years

of History on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Community leaders, residents,

elected officials, and business owners worked in conjunction to honor

the Peninsula's history.
On behalf of the residents of California's

36th Congressional District, I would like to congratulate the Palos

Verdes Peninsula community on their 100-year anniversary and wish the

cities a prosperous future.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR.
SIDNEY BUTLER

HON.
RALPH NORMAN

Mr. NORMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable

individual, Sidney Butler, whose legacy continues to inspire and uplift

our community.
Sidney Butler dedicated his life to advocating for

justice, community improvement, and school safety, leaving an indelible

mark on the citizens of our county.
Mr. Butler's commitment to public service was exemplified by his

unwavering presence at council and utilities meetings.
He understood

the importance of civic engagement and actively participated in the

decisionmaking processes that shaped our community.
One of Sidney's most noteworthy contributions was his tireless work

on various community projects, including the extensive remodeling of

our beloved train station.
His dedication to these endeavors

demonstrated his deep-rooted commitment to enhancing the quality of

life for all residents.
Despite facing the challenges posed by his epilepsy disability, Mr.

Butler never wavered in his pursuit of a more inclusive society.
He

tirelessly advocated for the rights and well-being of individuals with

disabilities, serving as a beacon of hope and perseverance.
Remarkably,

Mr. Butler never owned a vehicle, yet this never deterred him from

reaching his destinations.
He relied on his own two feet or the

kindness of others who gave him rides, demonstrating his determination

and resourcefulness.
One cannot speak of Mr. Butler without mentioning his famous saying,

which encapsulates his unwavering spirit: ``If you cannot run, then

walk.
If you cannot walk, then crawl, as long as you keep it moving.''
These words reflect his enduring commitment to progress, no matter the

obstacles in his path.
As we remember Sidney Butler today, let us be inspired by his

example.
Let us continue the work he started, championing justice,

community improvement, and school safety.
