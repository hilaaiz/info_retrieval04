I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will return some land management authority to Native Americans who have lived on, and managed, this land since time immemorial. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE 39TH ANNIVERSARY OF NOVEMBER 1984; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 190 Pages: E1108 - E1108 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 39TH ANNIVERSARY OF NOVEMBER 1984 ______ of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Ms. SCANLON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my Sikh friends in Pennsylvania and around the world to recognize the 39th anniversary of November 1984 anti-Sikh violence in India.
November 1984 marks one of the darkest chapters in modern Sikh history.
Sikhism traces its nearly 600 years of history to the Punjab region of India.
The Sikh community has a rich history in our country, with emigration dating back 100 years.
With nearly 30 million followers globally and a thriving community here in the United States, Sikhism is one of the world's major religions.
Today we are here to remember the violence which occurred in November 1984, after the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the capital territory of Delhi and most major cities of India.
These killings lasted for days, and it is estimated that thousands of Sikh men, women, and children were brutally murdered in their homes and on the streets.
Mr. Speaker, as a proud co-chair of the Congressional Sikh Caucus, remembering this heartbreaking violence that targeted Sikhs across India in 1984 is an important and historic step towards justice, accountability, and reconciliation and to prevent future such occurrences. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 190 Pages: E1109 - E1109 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BENZIE AREA CHRISTIAN NEIGHBORS ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Benzie Area Christian Neighbors (BACN) for 40 years of dedicated service and charity.
BACN serves as an inspiration to the community, standing by their mission of improving the quality of life for others and lending a hand to those in need.
Founded in 1983, BACN has since performed an integral role in the Benzie Area.
The group provides direct, needs-based assistance to those in the area who desperately require it.
If BACN can't provide the support necessary themselves, they always assist with a referral to those who can.
Over the years as BACN grew, it began to transform from a growing charity to a vibrant organization of faithful people working to better our society.
For 40 years, the list of services that BACN offers has expanded substantially.
Today, BACN is proud to provide a stocked food pantry, a large clothing center, adult education opportunities, financial assistance and so much more.
BACN also partners with larger philanthropic entities in order to extend the best possible services to the Northern Michigan community.
Through their collaborative efforts, no one who seeks help is turned away empty handed.
The spirit of selflessness and compassion which characterizes BACN is what makes it special.
Dedicated volunteers fill many crucial roles within the BACN network, serving as coordinators, organizers, and staff in all of the different locales of service.
Their commitment and support have kept BACN running efficiently these past 40 years.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate the Benzie Area Christian Neighbors for 40 outstanding years of service to the Benzie community.
I'd like to thank BACN for their continued outreach and charitable programs, and I wish them the best in their future endeavors. ____________________
