Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Fostering Family Cohesion Nationwide Act.
The legislation makes Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), child support enforcement, and foster care programs available everywhere else in our Nation also available in the Northern Mariana Islands.
My district is the only jurisdiction ineligible for such programs under Title IV of the Social Security Act.
In every other part of the United States, these programs help low-income families with children achieve economic self-sufficiency, promote joint parental responsibility, and provide safe foster care placements for children who cannot remain in their homes.
The continued exclusion of our islands is not only inequitable, but also violates the agreement negotiated in the covenant that established the current political relationship between the Marianas and the United States.
Section 703 of P.L. 94-241 provides that the United States will make available to the Marianas the full range of federal programs and services available to the other territories.
And by failing to remedy the Marianas' exclusion from programs under Title IV, Congress is reneging on its promise and perpetuating the unequal treatment of Americans residing in U.S. territories.
My bill, the Fostering Family Cohesion Nationwide Act, makes this long overdue correction, and upholds our nation's statutory obligation to the people of the Marianas.
Each child's right to a safe, nurturing, and permanent family must be safeguarded no matter where they grow up in the United States.
I thank my colleagues who joined me in introducing this bipartisan legislation--Mr. Moylan, Ms. Radewagen, Ms. Plaskett, and Mr. Case. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE WY'EAST TRIBAL RESOURCES RESTORATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-15 Volume: 169, Issue: 190 Pages: E1108 - E1108 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE WY'EAST TRIBAL RESOURCES RESTORATION ACT ______ of oregon in the house of representatives Mr. BLUMENAUER.
Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce the Wy'East Tribal Resources Restoration Act, which establishes a first-in- the-nation tribal co-management structure on the Mount Hood National Forest.
This bill directs the Forest Service to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs to protect and enhance Treaty resources within ``Indian Treaty Resources Emphasis Zones,'' through a co-management structure.
The establishment of such Zones will help meet the trust responsibilities of the United States in protecting the exercise of Tribal Treaty rights and integrate indigenous ecological knowledge as an important part of the best available scientific information used to manage land within the Zones.
The co-management plan will be developed with public input, subject to all existing environmental laws and regulations, including the National Environmental Policy Act.
The bill also requires implementation of the Cultural Foods Obligations, which were included in the Public Lands Management Act of 2009 but have never been implemented.
The federal government forced Native Americans off of their homelands and onto reservations, and we haven't honored our promises for their treaty resources.
I believe this tribal co-stewardship is an incredibly important step forward.
It represents 21st century public lands management and I'm proud to lead the effort.
It also helps the federal government fulfill its treaty obligations to Native American communities--a moral obligation that the federal government has never truly fulfilled.
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will return some land management authority to Native Americans who have lived on, and managed, this land since time immemorial. ____________________
