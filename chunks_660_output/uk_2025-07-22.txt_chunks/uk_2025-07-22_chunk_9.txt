RIP ED FEULNER

HON.
JOE WILSON

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, supporters of freedom

universally appreciate the success of the late Ed Feulner.
The Unleash

Prosperity Hotline of Stephen Moore gives a heartfelt tribute of RIP Ed

Feulner:

``Ed Feulner was a free-market conservative and fierce

anti-communist back in the 1970s, long before it was cool.
He

invented the modern-day think tank, taking it from the days

of stodgy 200-page tomes that lay gathering dust on

bookshelves and read by few, to providing just-in-time,

influential, hard-hitting studies delivered into the hands of

the policymakers that mattered.
``Among his many contributions to advancing freedom and

free enterprise was to train hundreds of today's leading

voices in the conservative movement--including some of the

thinkers and activists at Unleash Prosperity.
Heritage taught

young talent how to be relevant and impactful--something our

billion-dollar universities don't do.
``He believed that ``people are policy'' and that's a

lesson that this so-far successful Trump administration has

taken to heart.
His legacy lives on.''
