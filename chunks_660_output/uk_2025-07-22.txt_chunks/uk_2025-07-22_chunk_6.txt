CHRISTA SULLIVAN

HON.
KEVIN MULLIN

Mr. MULLIN.
Mr. Speaker, it is with heavy heart and solemn

remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great woman and dear friend

and neighbor, Mrs. Christa Sullivan of South San Francisco, California.
Christa passed away peacefully on Wednesday, July 2, 2025 and her

funeral mass will be held for family and friends on Thursday, July 24,

2025 at 1:00 pm at Saint Agnes Church in San Francisco, California.
A native daughter of Germany, Christa immigrated to the United States

as a girl.
She worked at St. Mary's Hospital, where she met and married

the love of her life, the late Detective Patrick Sullivan.
Christa was

a beloved mother and is survived by her children Stephanie, Kevin

(along with his wife Orla), and Christian (along with his wife Karen),

and her grandchildren Mick, Leah, Casey, Caeli, and Patrick.
She was a

lover of animals, and a longtime volunteer at St. Veronica's Parish,

Mercy High School and Serra High School.
She was a steadfast supporter

the founder and lifelong advocate for their association.
Christa will be remembered for her warmth, quiet strength, and

unwavering faith.
She lived a life rooted in service to her community

and family, for which we will be forever grateful.
Mr. Speaker, I ask

my colleagues to join me and the residents of California's Fifteenth

Congressional District in rising to recognize a life well lived, and to

extend our deepest sympathies to Christa's family, friends, and loved

ones during this difficult time.
We pray that they will be consoled and

comforted in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF FRUITLAND PARK,

FLORIDA

HON.
DANIEL WEBSTER

Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and

celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the City of Fruitland Park, Florida.
Known fondly as ``The Friendly City'', Fruitland Park is a historic and

thriving community in Lake County, Florida.
On December 14, 1925, residents of the area gathered at the Casino

building in Fruitland Park for the purpose of organizing a municipal

government.
With a shared vision for the future, the citizens voted to

incorporate their town and officially adopted the name Fruitland Park.
Less than two years later, in May of 1927, the city was formally

chartered.
In 1925, Fruitland Park was home to just 417 residents, spread across

a modest 3-square-mile area.
As of May 2025, the city has grown to

serve a population of roughly 9,015 across more than 7 square miles.
Today, Fruitland Park provides a full range of municipal services,

including public safety through police and fire departments, essential

infrastructure support via a robust public works department, access to

clean water and sanitation utilities, and vibrant recreational and

library services.
These offerings reflect the city's deep commitment to

enhancing quality of life for its residents.
Fruitland Park's natural beauty, small-town charm, and strong civic

infrastructure make it a desirable location for retirees and families

alike.
Its development in recent years has been extraordinary, and its

future continues to look bright with anticipated progress over the

coming decade.
It is my privilege to honor and celebrate the City of Fruitland Park

on the occasion of its centennial anniversary.
May the next 100 years

be as vibrant and prosperous as the first.
