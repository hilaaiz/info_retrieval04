From the shores of

South Carolina to all around the world, they've served our Nation with

honor.
For generations, the Navy Club has remained deeply embedded in the

life of the Georgetown community--supporting Navy Junior Reserve

Officers, honoring naval heritage, and fostering a spirit of unity

among veterans and civilians alike.
What began in 1925, as a gathering of like-minded servicemembers, has

grown into a lasting institution, one that continues to support

generations of veterans through friendship, mentorship, and tradition.
The Club's annual shrimp dinners have become a beloved local occasion,

bringing people together to share stories, remember the past, and

strengthen community ties.
The Navy Club's mission is clear: to honor the proud legacy of naval

service in South Carolina.
Through veteran outreach, youth engagement,

and the preservation of time-honored customs, it safeguards our

maritime traditions for the future.
As we mark this centennial, we are reminded of the enduring values

that define our armed forces: honor, courage, and commitment.
The Navy

Club's story is one of lasting impact, civic pride, and a devotion to

service that transcends generations.
Over the decades, it has built a strong foundation of fellowship and

support, uplifting those who served, commemorating those we've lost,

and building bridges within Georgetown.
Its events have become more

than social gatherings--they are touchpoints of history, community, and

service.
Their passion for service, fellowship, and patriotism continues to

inspire the next generation.
On behalf of the people of South

Carolina's Seventh District, I thank them and congratulate them on 100

years.

REMEMBERING JOSEPH H. ``JOE'' CAMPBELL

HON.
VINCE FONG

Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy

of Joseph H. ``Joe'' Campbell, a respected farmer and pioneer in

California's table grape industry, who passed away on July 10, 2025, at

the age of 81.
Joe Campbell was part of a generation that helped shape the modern

agricultural landscape of the Central Valley.
After graduating from

Delano High School in 1960 and serving in the U.S. Army, Joe began

farming in 1969.
He first grew cotton and wheat, then later moved into

almonds and, ultimately, table grapes.
In 1986, he leased his first

vineyard, setting the course for what would become a transformative

career in California agriculture.
Through his leadership roles at Delano Farms and Four Star Fruit, Joe

helped grow the combined operation into one of the largest table grape

producers in the state.
His business decisions often required risk, but

they were grounded in instinct, common sense, and a deep familiarity

with the communities in which he operated.
He played a defining role in

shaping California's table grape industry--a legacy that endures.
While Joe's work ethic and vision helped drive the success of a major

agricultural enterprise, he remained grounded in his roots and true to

the values that shaped him.
He was known for his humility, consistency,

and dedication to his family above all else.
He shared a long and

loving marriage with his wife, Jana, and raised three sons who continue

his legacy in agriculture.
Joe Campbell's story is a reminder of the strength and promise of

California's farming families.
His contributions helped define an

industry, and his example will continue to influence the generations

that follow.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Joseph H.

Campbell.
He was a farmer, a businessman, and a man whose life's work

and pursuit of the American dream left a lasting mark on the Central

Valley and California agriculture.
