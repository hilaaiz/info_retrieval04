CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF STEPHANIE PAPAGIANNIS

HON.
MARLIN A. STUTZMAN

Mr. STUTZMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary

American who has resided for over 70 years in Indiana's 3rd District,

Mrs. Stephanie Papagiannis, as she celebrates her 100th birthday on

July 25, 2025.
a century marked by perseverance, family, faith, and an

enduring love for this country.
Born in 1925 in the village of Vishini now known as Vissinia.
Stephanie grew up amid the political and cultural upheaval of Greek-

occupied Macedonia.
She witnessed firsthand the efforts to erase the

language and customs of the native Macedonian people, yet she never

lost her sense of identity or resilience.
In 1952, with incredible courage and hope, Stephanie left behind a

war-torn Europe and emigrated to the United States with her young son,

James, to reunite with her husband Peter in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Together, they built a new life grounded in hard work, community, and

opportunity.
The couple raised three children, and today, their family

has grown including five grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.
Stephanie and Peter contributed meaningfully to the local community,

opening two highly regarded establishments; the Pontiac Rib Bar and

Pete's Gateview Inn.
Their restaurants were not just businesses they

were gathering places that embodied their warmth and entrepreneurial

spirit.
A proud member of Fort Wayne's Macedonian American community,

Stephanie maintained strong ties to her heritage and faith through St.

Nicholas Macedonian Orthodox Cathedral, founded by her relatives.
Her

life has served as a bridge between generations and is inspiring to

all.
Mr. Speaker, as Mrs. Papagiannis celebrates her centennial surrounded

by loved ones, we pay tribute to a remarkable woman whose story

represents the very best of the American immigrant experience who lived

the American dream.
May her legacy continue to inspire, and may her

next chapter be filled with joy and peace.
