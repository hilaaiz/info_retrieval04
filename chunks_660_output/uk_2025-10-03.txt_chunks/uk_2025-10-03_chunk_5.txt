RECOGNIZING INTERNATIONAL PLASMA AWARENESS WEEK 2025

_____

HON.
DORIS O. MATSUI

Ms. MATSUI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate International

Plasma Awareness Week, an annual campaign dedicated to raising

awareness about the importance of source plasma collection, recognizing

the valued contributions of donors, and increasing understanding about

plasma protein therapies and the rare diseases they treat.
As co-chair of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus and a member of

the Congressional Plasma Caucus, this annual event, celebrated from

October 6 to 10 this year, is close to my heart.
For many people with rare diseases, plasma-derived therapies mean the

difference between life and death, or between a life of diminished

health and physical limitations and one filled with hope and

possibility.
For example, Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare but serious

neurological disorder that can lead to rapid muscle weakness and, in

severe cases, paralysis.
A related condition, Chronic Inflammatory

Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), is characterized by ongoing nerve

inflammation that can significantly impair mobility and quality of

life.
For both these conditions, immunoglobulins reduce inflammation,

regulate the immune system, and help patients regain function.
Most

patients with CIDP require life-long treatment to manage their

symptoms.
In the case of primary immunodeficiencies, hemophilia, alpha-1

antitrypsin deficiency, and other conditions, the body does not make

important proteins, or those proteins are functionally damaged.
These

patients also rely on plasma-derived medicine to replace their programs

and restore their health.
In most cases, plasma-derived therapies are

the only available treatment for these conditions.
That is why it's so

important that we raise awareness of the importance of plasma-derived

therapies this week, and work to improve access to these unique

biologic products.
I'm committed to working to ensure that every individual, regardless

of how rare their disease may be, has access to the therapies they need

to lead healthier, fuller lives.

REMEMBERING MIGUEL ANGEL GARCIA-HERNANDEZ

HON.
MARC A. VEASEY

Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply heartbroken over the loss of

Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, who succumbed to his injuries following

the horrific shooting at the Dallas ICE facility.
Miguel was a husband,

a father, and a hardworking man whose greatest joy was providing for

and being present with his family.
His death is an immeasurable tragedy

that has left a lasting void for those who loved him most.
My prayers and deepest condolences are with Miguel's wife, Stephany

Gauffeny, their four children, and the baby they were expecting, as

they face this devastating loss.
To lose a loved one under such violent

circumstances is a burden no family should ever bear.
His loved ones

should know that they are not alone in their grief--our community

mourns alongside them, and we extend every measure of compassion and

support possible.
We will always remember Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez as a

hardworking father, husband, neighbor, and colleague.
Today, we stand

in solidarity with the Mexican community as we grieve this loss

together, and we hold on to the hope that his memory will strengthen

our resolve to bring an end to the epidemic of gun violence in our

country.

REMEMBERING NORLAN GUZMAN-FUENTES

_____

HON.
MARC A. VEASEY

Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, I am profoundly saddened by the

heartbreaking loss of Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, whose life was tragically

taken in the recent attack at the Dallas ICE facility.
His death is a

sobering reminder of the human toll that violence leaves behind and the

fragility of life when communities are confronted with such senseless

acts.
At a time like this, my deepest condolences go out to Mr. Guzman-

Fuentes's wife, Berenice Prieto, loved ones, and all who knew him.
Their grief is immeasurable, and they deserve the comfort, compassion,

and solidarity of their community as they endure this painful loss.
