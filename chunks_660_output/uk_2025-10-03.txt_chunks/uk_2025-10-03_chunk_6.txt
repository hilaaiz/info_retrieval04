His death is a

sobering reminder of the human toll that violence leaves behind and the

fragility of life when communities are confronted with such senseless

acts.
At a time like this, my deepest condolences go out to Mr. Guzman-

Fuentes's wife, Berenice Prieto, loved ones, and all who knew him.
Their grief is immeasurable, and they deserve the comfort, compassion,

and solidarity of their community as they endure this painful loss.
My

prayers are with them, and I hope they find strength in the love and

memories they shared with Norlan.
As a community, we must stand together to reject violence and embrace

peace and humanity.
Every life lost diminishes us all, and we honor

Norlan's memory by recommitting ourselves to building a safer, more

compassionate future where gun violence must end.
May his family be

surrounded by support and healing in the difficult days ahead.

REMEMBERING WALTER GRAINGER

_____

HON.
VINCE FONG

Mr. FONG.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of

Walter Grainger, a lifelong resident of Bakersfield, California, who

passed away on Sunday, September 14, 2025, at the age of 99.
In May 1944, just weeks after graduating from Kern County Union High

School, later renamed Bakersfield High School, Walter enlisted in the

United States Navy, where he served honorably during World War II.
He

and his four brothers together wore our Nation's uniform in defense of

freedom.
After the conclusion of his military service, Walter dedicated his

life to education and community.
He taught at Bakersfield High School,

Shafter High School, and North High School, where he chaired the

Industrial Arts Department, before later working as a safety consultant

for the school district.
Beyond the classroom, Walter was a devoted

husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and faithful member of

First United Methodist Church.
Even in his nineties, Walter continued to serve.
He was instrumental

in the design and construction of the Kern County World War II Veterans

Memorial at Jastro Park.
His vision and leadership helped shape one of

the most beautiful veterans memorials in the West.
Today, that memorial

stands as a lasting tribute to all who served, including Walter and his

brothers, whose names are engraved in granite for generations to see.
Walter was a deeply respected member of the community, and when he

spoke, people listened.
He lived his life with humility, service, and

quiet strength.
His legacy is found not only in the memorial he helped

build, but in the family he loved, the students he taught, and the

community he served.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the

remarkable life of Walter Grainger.
May his memory serve as an

inspiration to all of us, and may his family take comfort in knowing

the profound and enduring impact he had on Bakersfield, Kern County,

and our Nation.
