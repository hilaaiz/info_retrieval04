COMMEMORATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2025, AS NATIONAL ORANGE SHIRT

WEEK

_____

HON.
SHARICE DAVIDS

Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the

week of September 30, 2025, as National Orange Shirt Week.
Also known

as National Week of Remembrance, this designation aims to honor those

who were forced to attend Indian boarding schools.
From 1819 through the 1960's, thousands of Indigenous children were

forcibly removed from their traditional homelands to attend U.S.

boarding schools.
At these schools, countless children were stripped of

their cultural identities, often through physical, sexual,

psychological, industrial, and spiritual abuse and neglect, all with

the goal of assimilation into non-Native culture.
This issue is personal to me.
My grandparents, Ruth Stacy and

Lawrence Little George, both survived Indian Boarding Schools.
I would

not be here today if not for the resilience of my ancestors and those

who came before me.
Tragically, many other children of these schools

never got to return to their families or their communities.
Hearing the experiences of Indian boarding school victims and

survivors serves to not only honor the Native spirit, but also to

ensure that these types of injustices can never repeat themselves.
It

is for these reasons that I heartily support National Orange Shirt

Week.

extraordinary milestone.
