JOHN GARAMENDI

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 40th

anniversary of Citizens for East Shore Parks (CESP), an extraordinary

community organization founded in 1985 to protect open space and

wildlife habitat and to provide recreational opportunities along the

eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay.
Through their tireless advocacy and partnership with community

allies, CESP was instrumental in the creation of McLaughlin Eastshore

State Park, which preserves and protects 8.5 miles of shoreline habitat

and open space from the Bay Bridge to Richmond.
This remarkable park

provides Bay Area residents access to natural beauty and recreational

opportunities in one of the Nation's most urbanized regions.
Over four decades, CESP has helped transform the East Bay shoreline

from neglected dumping grounds into a connected landscape of parks,

trails, and ecological preserves.
Their efforts have supported the

creation and protection of McLaughlin Eastshore State Park, Point

Molate Park, Tom Bates Regional Sports Complex, the Bay Trail

connection at Golden Gate Fields, and the Albany Bulb.
Today, CESP continues to lead with vision and purpose, working toward

incorporating the Golden Gate Fields property into McLaughlin Eastshore

State Park and ultimately restoring the site to wetlands and marshes

that will provide a resilient shoreline in the face of sea level rise.
In this effort, CESP is committed to collaborating with Native American

communities to restore these historically vital landscapes.
CESP's long-term vision is bold and inspiring: a connected,

accessible shoreline of open space and parkland stretching from the

Carquinez Strait to San Jose.
Their work has created a legacy of

preservation, environmental stewardship, and public access that will

benefit generations to come.
On behalf of the constituents of California's 8th Congressional

District, I commend Citizens for East Shore Parks for their outstanding

contributions to our region and our environment, and I congratulate

them on 40 years of remarkable achievement.
