He has been a tireless advocate for growers, working to

strengthen markets, support research, and promote the health and

sustainability of the industry.
Beyond his professional accomplishments, Mr. Sakuma's greatest pride

is his family.
He is a devoted husband to his wife, Barbara, and a

loving father and grandfather.
Two of his sons, Nathan and Noel, have

continued the Sakuma tradition of stewardship, innovation, and service

to the community.
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to commend Bryan Sakuma for his

outstanding leadership, his dedication to American agriculture, and the

enduring legacy he has helped to cultivate.
I ask my colleagues to join

me in expressing our deepest gratitude for his service.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF JOHN J. MEYERS, III

_____

HON.
MIKE HARIDOPOLOS

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the life and legacy

of John J. Meyers, III, a decorated veteran of the United States Navy

who passed away on September 14, 2025, at the age of 87 in Sarasota,

Florida.
John answered the call to serve his country as a naval aviator.
He

trained in Pensacola, flew with Squadron VS-34 aboard the USS Essex,

and later served as an instructor pilot at NAS Meridian.
His skill and

leadership reflected the very best of our Nation's military tradition.
After his service, John carried those same values into civilian life.
He built a respected career in aviation and financial services,

retiring as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch in Sarasota.
But

beyond his profession, he was known for his mentorship and kindness.
John J. Meyers lived a life of honor, both in uniform and in his

community.
Today, we remember him not only for his service to our

Nation but for the positive impact he left on those around him.
May his

memory be a blessing, and may his family find comfort in knowing his

legacy of service will endure.

HON.
RASHIDA TLAIB

Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District honors

the extraordinary life and legacy of Michael ``Mike'' Friedman, a

tireless champion of economic justice and workplace democracy.
From his

early days as a truck driver and founding member of Teamsters for a

Democratic Union to his distinguished legal career.
Mike's life was

rooted in advancing the rights and dignity of working people.
As General Counsel at the Center for Community-Based Enterprise, Mike

dedicated himself to helping businesses transition to worker ownership,

empowering employees, and strengthening communities.
His leadership

extended beyond C2BE to the Michigan Center for Employee Ownership,

Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Detroit Community Wealth Fund, where he

shared his expertise and vision for a fairer, more just world.
Mike believed deeply in the power of unions to transform lives, which

was reflected in his lifelong advocacy and teaching.
His legacy will

continue to inspire all who fight for justice, equity, and workers

rights.
Our thoughts are with his wife Barbara Harvey.
We extend our love to his wife, siblings, children, grandchildren,

and friends as we celebrate his life, and we are committed to carrying

forward his spirit of service, joy, and justice.
