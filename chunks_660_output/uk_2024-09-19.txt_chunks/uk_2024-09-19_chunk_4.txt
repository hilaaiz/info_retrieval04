HONORING THE LIFE OF MARVIN TURNER

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of

Marvin Turner, who passed away on August 12, 2024.
Marvin was a

dedicated civil servant and worked tirelessly to make the District of

Columbia the 51st state.
Marvin was a native of Atlanta, Georgia.
After graduating high

school, Marvin joined Job Corps and then began his career fighting for

the rights of workers and for fair housing in North Carolina and South

Carolina with the Service Employees International Union.
Marvin came to D.C. to work for the Washington Metropolitan Area

Transit Authority.
Soon after arriving in D.C., Marvin became a staffer

for then-Mayor Sharon Pratt and then became a member of my staff.
In

2013, Marvin was appointed as a commissioner on the District of

Columbia Sentencing and Criminal Code Revision Commission, where he

worked with other commissioners and D.C. Councilmembers to revise

sentencing guidelines and the criminal code.
During his career, Marvin worked closely with Reverend Jesse Jackson

as an advance staffer, as well as serving as the D.C. Statehood

Coordinator for the National Rainbow Coalition.
Marvin's work on the

local and national levels ultimately led to him working for the

Democratic National Committee's Office of the Secretary for nearly 20

years.
Marvin's work left an indelible mark on both D.C. and our Nation.
I

ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the incredible

life and legacy of Marvin Turner.

RECOGNIZING AND HONORING PAT GOIN'S SERVICE AS CHAIR OF THE NORTH

AMERICAN BLUEBERRY COUNCIL

HON.
RUDY YAKYM III

Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Pat

Goin, who will be concluding her tenure as Chair of the North American

Blueberry Council at the end of this year.
This August, I had the honor of visiting Pat and her husband Kevin at

their blueberry farm, Goin's Blueberry Lane, in North Judson, Indiana

as part of my district-wide ``Factories, Freeways, and Fields'' tour.
During my visit, I had the opportunity to learn more about their

family-owned and operated blueberry farm that has been in business

since 1980.
Just as importantly, I was able to see firsthand Pat's

great character and the passion she has for consistently putting out a

high-quality product over all these years.
I am immensely grateful to Pat for the warm hospitality that my team

and I received on our visit, as well as for the fresh and ripe

blueberries that she, Kevin, and their family have been producing for

more than 40 years.
I also greatly appreciate the leadership that Pat has provided to the

North American Blueberry Council in her role as Chair on behalf of our

blueberry producers and those connected to the blueberry industry all

across our country.
Our farmers and agricultural producers are some of

the most industrious and important men and women anywhere in America,

and I know that Pat has done a great service by effectively advocating

on behalf of blueberry growers and their interests.
God bless Pat Goin.
