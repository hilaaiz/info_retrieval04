It is the voice of

the public it serves.
It is the mirror of its community.
And equally

important, it is the public's guardian against dark forces that would

erode or even destroy the people's rights and freedoms.''
As we celebrate The Republican's 200th anniversary, we thank all

those who have played and continue to play a part in upholding the

paper's mission of bringing home the news--news that embodies our

community here in the Pioneer Valley and promotes the tenets of a free

press.
The Springfield Republican has been there, and they will continue to

be there for generations to come.
Congratulations from the United

States of America.
