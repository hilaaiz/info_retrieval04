Outside the public sphere, John was also known for his generosity and

kindness and became a mentor to many in Clinton County.
I had the good

fortune to be seated next to John at a judicial candidate event twelve

years ago.
When I informed him that I planned to run for the New York

21st Congressional Seat at the age of 28 and he nearly fell out of his

chair.
Or at least he always told it that way, but since that day I

could always rely on John for advice and friendship.
In my many visits

to Clinton County, it was always a highlight to see John, whether it

was at county events or seeing him at the Rouses Point Independence Day

Parade in his antique car without fail every year.
John was warm and welcoming to all and a true North Country icon.
He

loved his family, friends, community, and country.
His legacy will live

on in the hearts of all who had the pleasure of knowing him.
On behalf

of New York's 21st Congressional District, it is my honor to remember

and celebrate the incredible life of John Zurlo.
