Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of individuals across the

country, donations flooded into our region, giving flood survivors a

glimmer of hope for the long journey ahead.
Many organizations, like

Samaritan's Purse, also dispatched recovery teams to our region,

helping sustain families through their darkest hour.
As various crews

expended as many resources as possible to aid Eastern Kentucky, there

has been one constant team remaining long after everyone else had to

leave--and that is Samaritan's Purse.
For every meal provided, every

mop distributed, every bucket of mud carried out, every nail that has

been driven and every prayer that has been prayed in our region, I want

to personally express my gratitude to Samaritan's Purse.
This organization has carried out the vision of the late evangelist

Bob Pierce for more than 50 years, which he established ``to meet

emergency needs in crisis areas through existing evangelical mission

agencies and national churches.''
Rev. Franklin Graham took up the

mantel over 40 years ago, spreading the same kindness, generosity and

steadfast hope around the world.
We are blessed that Samaritan's Purse found our small corner of rural

America and made our people a priority when they needed it the most.
As

a result of their dedication, we are now celebrating with flood

survivors in Breathitt County who now have a safe, new house to call

home.
On behalf of Eastern Kentuckians in Breathitt and surrounding

counties, we thank them for standing with us through the flood and long

after the flood waters have receded.
May God continue to multiply the

efforts of Samaritan's Purse as they rebuild hope in the mountains of

Eastern Kentucky and beyond.
