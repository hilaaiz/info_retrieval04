RECOGNIZING GUEST CHAPLAIN PASTOR DAVID MASON

HON.
BRUCE WESTERMAN

Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank our guest chaplain,

Pastor David Mason, for his opening prayer on May 10th.
I've had the

pleasure of knowing David for quite some time, as he serves as Pastor

at my home church, Walnut Valley Baptist in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
David and his wife, Aamie, who serves as a family counselor, are dear

friends of mine who have a heart for sharing the gospel and ministering

not only inside the church building but in the community with

individuals wherever there is a need.
David and Aamie have been faithful servants and leaders for many

years.
It was a pleasure to host them in D.C. this week.
I, along with others in Arkansas' Fourth Congressional District, are

grateful to Pastor Mason and his wife Aamie for their servant hearts

and their obedience in serving God.
