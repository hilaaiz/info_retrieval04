The Sentinel ICBM program, now estimated to be $150 billion, breached

the cost escalation limit of the Nunn-McCurdy law.
The Pentagon and

Congress must now justify the continuation of the program.
Congress and

the American public must not waste this pivotal moment to study the

reality of the nuclear weapon arms race and make a decision to shift

course.
It's past time to maximize our efforts to negotiate an end to

the race and seek paths to reduce nuclear arms and the associated

existential threat.
We face real challenges in this world, but too often, hyperbole and

fear are being used to drive our decision-making.
Competition need not

mean hostility.
It is time we returned to reason and rationality.
Together, we must confront the challenges before us, not by building

ever more dangerous weapons, but by placing the same priority on

effective arms control and risk reduction measures that we currently

place on modernization.
We may face challenges, but we still have the

choice of which future we will pursue.
We know the risks, we know the

dangers that modernizations and the inevitable arms race could hold,

but that's why it is so important we redouble our efforts toward making

de-escalation real.
Let us take this moment, this opportunity, to

engage in a meaningful dialogue and choose the path towards a safer and

more world.
