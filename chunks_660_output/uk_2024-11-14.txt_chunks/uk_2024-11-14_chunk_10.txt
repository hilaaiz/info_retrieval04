TRIBUTE TO DAVE HOBSON

HON.
JIM JORDAN

Mr. JORDAN.
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio and across

the country in paying tribute to our friend, former Congressman David

L. Hobson, who died on October 6.
Dave was one of the Buckeye State's most respected public servants.
He worked on behalf of the people of the Seventh Congressional District

for 18 years--and served in the State Senate for eight years prior to

that.
He took great pride in solving problems great and small on behalf

of his constituents.
A longtime member of the Appropriations Committee and a Military

Construction cardinal, Dave was a champion of our state's military

installations of all types, ensuring that they were in the best

position possible to contribute to our national defense.
Dave was himself a proud Ohio Air National Guard veteran, serving

during the Berlin Wall crisis.
In recognition of his service in and out

of uniform, in 2022 he was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of

Fame--a high honor accorded to no more than 20 Ohioans each year.
Mr. Speaker, we are grateful that men like Dave Hobson are willing to

enter the arena and commit their lives to public service.
Our prayers

are with his wife, Carolyn, their three children, and their grand- and

great-grandchildren at this time of sorrow.
