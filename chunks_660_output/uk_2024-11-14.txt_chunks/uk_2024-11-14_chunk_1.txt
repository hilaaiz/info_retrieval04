CONGRATULATING JASON ANDERSON ON 20 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY OF

ROCHELLE

HON.
DARIN LaHOOD

Mr. LaHOOD.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Jason Anderson for

his 20 years of impactful service as Economic Development Director for

the City of Rochelle.
In this role, Anderson worked with Illinois

businesses and others in the Rochelle community to attract increased

economic investment and improve public infrastructure in Rochelle.
Anderson graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in

Business Administration.
Before becoming the Economic Development

Director, Anderson served in many roles, including Northern Illinois

Regional Director for former U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald.
Through Anderson's tenure, the City of Rochelle saw robust

improvement in their economy and infrastructure.
Since 2005, there has

been $1.3 billion in capital investments made by businesses and 2,200

jobs created in Rochelle.
Highlights of this economic growth include

investment projects from companies like Wheatland Tube and the CHS

Ethanol plant as well as the construction of the Rochelle Business

Technology Park.
Additionally, the City of Rochelle has received over $125 million in

funding for infrastructure over the past two decades.
Anderson's work

as Economic Development Director focused specifically on infrastructure

modernization of the railroad and airport.
In Anderson's 10 years

overseeing Rochelle's airport it received almost $11 million in funding

and the Rochelle railroad's yearly revenue quadrupled under Anderson's

vision.
Jason Anderson's tireless work has left a lifelong impact on the

Rochelle community and the state of Illinois.
His commitment to our

community is truly inspiring and I congratulate Jason on 20 years of

service to Rochelle and wish him the best in all future endeavors.

CONGRATULATING THE FATHER TOLTON TRAILBLAZERS, THE MISSOURI CLASS 4

SOFTBALL STATE CHAMPIONS

HON.
BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

Mr. LUETKEMEYER.
Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize the Father Tolton

softball team for their remarkable achievement of clinching the Class 4

championship.
Their 24-10 season record and 5-0 shutout victory over

Belton in the title game, is the culmination of all the work they put

in and the great amount of talent on this team.
It is worth noting that this state championship is the second in

Father Tolton's program history.
Their last softball state championship

came in 2020.
This championship serves as an example of the upward

trajectory of where the program is headed.
I extend my sincerest congratulations to the Father Tolton softball

team, coaches, and its supporters.
Winning a championship is a

collective effort that takes an all-hands-on deck approach.
The

community recognizes and highly values their dedication and passion for

softball.

HONORING JAMES SCALICE

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, this past month, it was my honor to attend

the Eagle Scout Court of Honor for an incredible young man, James

Scalice.
James has learned an incredible amount through the merit badge

program earning 41 total badges in subjects such as Life Skills,

Business, and Science.

leadership skills through elected positions and has learned the value

to his church and community.

the Catholic Diocese of Camden.

great respect for veterans, James decided to help out the American

Legion Post 28 in Absecon, South Jersey for his Eagle Scout project.
