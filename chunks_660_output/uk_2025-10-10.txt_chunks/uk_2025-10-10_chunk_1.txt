CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF COLORADO LEGAL SERVICES

_____

HON.
DIANA DeGETTE

Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colorado Legal

Services on its 100th anniversary and to honor its enduring commitment

to justice for all Coloradans.
Founded as the Legal Aid Society of Denver in February 1925, Colorado

Legal Services has been a lifeline for low-income individuals and

seniors in every county across our state--providing free, high-quality

civil legal assistance to those who need it most.
As a former trial

attorney, I understand how critical legal representation can be when

everything is at stake.
Whether it's helping someone keep their home, secure child support,

access health care, or find safety from abuse, Colorado Legal Services

delivers life-changing support that strengthens families and

communities across our state.
Their work extends far beyond the courtroom--offering clients the

stability, emotional support, and community resources they need to move

forward.
In August of this year alone, Colorado Legal Services opened nearly a

thousand new cases to help Coloradans facing housing insecurity,

domestic violence, and other urgent challenges.
That's the kind of

quiet, vital work that keeps our communities strong and resilient.
I want to congratulate Colorado Legal Services on a century of

unwavering service and express my deepest gratitude to its staff,

volunteers, and supporters for their tireless dedication to equal

justice under the law.

CELEBRATING 150 YEARS OF ST.
PETER'S UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST IN

MILLBURY, OHIO

_____

HON.
MARCY KAPTUR

Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker.
I rise to recognize a significant milestone

in the life of St. Peter's United Church of Christ in Millbury, Ohio.
The congregation celebrates its 150th anniversary on Sunday, October

12, 2025.
Only one year after the founding of Millbury, St. Peter's Church was

founded in 1875 by twelve families of German immigrants who came

together to form the German Evangelical United St. Peter's

Congregation.
It is the oldest continuous church in the community.
Church records show that the first meeting took place at the home of

Adam Martin, a home that stands yet today, and was officiated by

Reverend Andrews of Genoa St. John's Church.
A fire sparked by a passing train burned the newly constructed

building in 1878 and a new building was finally completed in 1884 using

the railroad settlement.
That year, the church adopted its first

constitution.
In 1908 a parsonage was built and a minister was hired.
The following years brought growth along with stained glass windows

and a pipe organ.
In 1934 following a national merger the congregation

was renamed St. Peter's Evangelical and Reformed Church.
Since a 1957

merger the church has held its current name, St. Peter's United Church

of Christ.
Branching out into the community in the 1950's, adjacent land was

purchased and a park was built which serves the neighborhood, gardens

and athletic teams.
Uniquely, a boulder which resembled the image of

Christ at Gethsemane was unearthed in 1969.
Moved next to the church, a

plaque was inscribed with Mathew 16:18, ``And I say unto thee, that

thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the

gates of hell shall not prevail against it.''
Believing that ``every generation is called to live out its faith in

meaningful worship, honest reflection and sincere devotion to God,''

the church continued to grow through the decades.
A youth program

produced musical groups Kid's Praise and The Light Brigade which toured

the states in our region and visited the Creation Music Festival in

Pennsylvania.
