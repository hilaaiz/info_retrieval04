Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and career of nurse Joyce Grayson of Brooklyn, Connecticut.
Joyce was killed while serving in her capacity as a visiting nurse, creating a chasm in the life of all who knew her that will never be filled.
Despite the tragedy of her death, Joyce's life is remembered for her warmth and unbridled vitality--traits that served her well in her nearly 40 years of distinguished health service across Connecticut.
The shocking news of her loss has been felt across particularly in Connecticut and by also health professionals across the nation.
Growing up on a Sterling, Connecticut dairy farm with her 13 siblings and parents Robert and Edna Jordan, Joyce is a true daughter of eastern Connecticut.
From an early age, Joyce recognized her life's calling lay in the care of her fellows.
Immediately after graduating from Killingly High School, Joyce enrolled in Windham Tech's nursing school where she became a Licensed Practical Nurse, beginning the journey which would define the rest of her life.
Joyce started her professional career in service to the State of Connecticut, working for the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DHMAS).
Joyce's time was well spent at DHMAS given her specialty was in behavioral health.
During her tenure with DHMAS, she worked at a variety of institutions--from the old Norwich State Hospital to the Southeastern Mental Health Authority.
After working for the State for over a quarter century, Joyce continued her service- oriented work by becoming a visiting nurse for the Elara Caring company Ever committed to providing for others, Joyce also served Connecticut's next generations by acting as a foster parent.
Joyce's parenthood, whether for her six biological children or those she fostered, was defined by her infectious love for each child.
In 2017, Joyce was recognized for her consummate care and named Foster Parent of the year alongside her husband, Ronald, by the Connecticut Department of Children and Families.
Mr. Speaker, the profound loss experienced by the Grayson family in the wake of Joyce's death is unimaginable.
Despite the overwhelming tragedy of this situation however, our state and Nation can take solace in the knowledge that the legacy Joyce has left behind will continue to imbue the world with her kindness and care.
And hopefully the circumstances of her passing will spur meaningful change in our nations workplace rules to protect ``the caring professions'' that she so nobly personified.
Joyce touched thousands of people throughout her life, whether as a nurse working for Connecticut or Elara Caring, or in her capacity as a foster mother.
Her works have inspired two of her children to follow in her footsteps and serve in healthcare.
We mourn with Joyce's family, including her husband Ronald;

children Elliot, Kyle, Kaitlyn, Evan, Audrey, Shawn, and their spouses; her four grandchildren; and her eleven siblings.
To these ends, I ask my colleagues to join me in etching the life and legacy of Joyce Grayson further into stone, and enact legislation to better protect health care providers like Joyce from the violence they all too often face. ____________________
