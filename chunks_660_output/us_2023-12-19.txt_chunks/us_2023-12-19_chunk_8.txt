KERRY ARMSTRONG ______ of georgia in the house of representatives Mr. LOUDERMILK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. W. Kerry Armstrong, Chairman of the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), for skillfully shepherding the ARC forward as its chairman for the past ten years.
Kerry will conclude his chairmanship at the end of this year, and I know the other members of the Georgia Congressional Delegation, who represent the greater Atlanta region, will join me in thanking Kerry for his dedicated service on the ARC Board, which will continue even as he departs the chairmanship.
The ARC plays an invaluable role in the health of the Atlanta region.
Under Kerry's leadership, my colleagues and I have worked successfully with the ARC on numerous initiatives important to the region, including delivering Older Americans Act services, workforce development, regional transportation planning, and homeland security.
However, when it comes to Kerry and the ARC leadership, there is perhaps no issue as singularly important as the protection and preservation of our state's water supply.
In this very critical area, the ARC's work is unrivaled.
Kerry Armstrong came to Atlanta over thirty years ago, attracted by the beauty of the region, and I dare say, of his wife, Wendy, whom he met there.
Kerry has pursued a successful career in real estate development and finance; and over time has served in numerous public- private roles, including chairing notable community improvement districts (CIDs) in the region.
As Kerry turns the page on this chapter in his life, I want to congratulate him, Wendy, their daughter Jenny, and her husband Ben, and let Kerry know how much we value him and count on him for advice and support.
The Atlanta region is richer for his efforts.
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens takes up the gavel this January, as incoming Chair; and he will be fortunate to be working alongside ARC Executive Director Anna Roach, whose selection Kerry spearheaded.
On behalf of the citizens in the Atlanta region, we thank Kerry for his guiding hand at the ARC, his dedication to our communities, and his service to the great state of Georgia. ____________________
