Moreover, the example provided by young men and young women, like Deborah, should serve as inspiration to challenge ourselves and strive for excellence in every facet of our lives.

WILLIAM (BILL) A. SNOW ON 40 YEARS AT EDGEWOOD CONGREGATIONAL METHODIST CHURCH ______ of alabama in the house of representatives Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. William (Bill) A. Snow on his 40th anniversary at Edgewood Congregational Methodist Church in Anniston, Alabama.
Dr. Snow and his wife, Myra, came to Edgewood Congregational Methodist Church in January of 1984.
Under his leadership, the church grew larger and outgrew the building on Railroad Street in Blue Mountain.
In 1995, the church moved to its current location on Brighton Avenue in Anniston.
Since moving to its current location, the church has had a major sanctuary and fellowship hall renovation.
Through the years, two building projects have been completed.
The church has grown over the past 40 years from 50 to 500 members.
Under Pastor Snow's ministry, several members have been called into the ministry.
Through Pastor Snow's leadership, in June of 2002, Edgewood Church built the first permanent structure on Buvuma Island located in Lake Victoria in Uganda, Africa.
The structure was named The Edgewood African Church.
It serves as a church, a school, and a medical clinic.
During COVID-19, the church found new avenues to spread the Word through the streaming of services and social media.
Financial support increased so much during this difficult time that even to this day giving remains strong and no formal offering is taken on Sunday mornings.
Edgewood Church is the loving and caring church it is today because of the vision and leadership of Pastor Snow and his wife.
Inspired by its leadership to share the love of Jesus with those in need, Edgewood is involved in outreach ministries that make a difference in lives of those in the community.
Pastor Snow will never know on this side of eternity the number of people and the families whose lives have been enriched through his ministry.
Those who have been the recipient of Pastor Snow's personal ministry through the loss of a loved one can especially testify to the spiritual hope and steadfast support he has given.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating Pastor Snow on this incredible milestone and for spreading God's Word across our area.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career and service of retiring Houdini Elementary School crossing guard, Ms. Cheryl Latza.
For 44 years, Cheryl has dedicated her time and efforts to protecting children throughout the Appleton School District at Houdini Elementary School.
Given Cheryl's kindness and sincere care, she became more than just a crossing guard for many students; she also became a friend.
Cheryl was the first hello in the morning and the last goodbye to students on their way home, something that families throughout the Appleton area are surely thankful for.
Cheryl exhibits the qualities of a true community leader, and I thank her for her continued service.
Her actions will be remembered for many years to come throughout the Appleton community.
