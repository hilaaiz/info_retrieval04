Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life of my friend and longtime community leader, Pedro Cuellar ``Pete'' Alfaro of Baytown, Texas, who passed away on December 11, 2023.
Pete devoted his life to public service, honorably serving as mayor of Baytown, as a city council member, on the Lee College Board of Regents, and on numerous other community and non-profit boards.
He was a leader, mentor, friend, and role model to countless in the region, and leaves behind a legacy that will continue to inspire new generations of public servants for years to come.
Pete was born August 10, 1940, to Felipe and Victoriana Alfaro.
After serving in the United States Army as a basic electronics instructor at Fort Bliss for three years, Pete attended the University of Texas at Austin.
He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1969 and was a lifetime member of the Texas Exes alum association.
That same year, he began his career as an electrical engineer at Humble Oil and Refining, now ExxonMobil, where he would remain employed for the next 31 years.
After being elected to the city council in 1989 where he served two terms, Pete was voted in as the first Hispanic mayor of Baytown, a position he held for 11 years.
His pivotal role in infrastructure development, particularly the completion of the Fred Hartman Bridge in partnership with then-Governor George W. Bush, epitomized his dedication to building a stronger Baytown.
However, his reach was not confined to the city hall, it extended to significant roles on boards such as the Lee College Board of Regents, the Houston Methodist Baytown Hospital Board of Trustees, and the Patient and Family Advisory Council.
After facing the devastating loss of his daughter, Debi, Pete channeled his grief into a steadfast commitment to elevating healthcare standards.
Chairing the Quality and Patient Safety Steering Committee at Houston Methodist Baytown for two decades, he worked tirelessly to ensure the surrounding community received and had access to top-notch healthcare.
In recognition of his efforts, the Houston Methodist Baytown Hospital dedicated its new state-of-the-art education and training facility in honor of Pete and his wife, Lupe, in May of this year.
Throughout the years, Pete left a significant impact in the public and private sector.
In fact, he was named the 2004 Baytown Sun newspaper's ``Citizen of the Year'' and the 2010 ExxonMobil's ``Refiner of the Year'' for his community service.
Pete was preceded in death by his beloved daughter, Debi Alfaro Yarborough.
He is survived by his loving wife of 61 years, Guadalupe ``Lupe'' Alfaro; daughters, Priscilla Alfaro and Sandra Rodriguez; son, Paul Alfaro; and grandchildren, Christopher, Marissa, Austin, Alexis, Mikaela,

Emily, Nicholas, and Kelsey.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to honor the memory and legacy of Pete Alfaro.
My heartfelt prayers are with his wife and loved ones during this challenging time.
May Pete rest in peace knowing his tenacious efforts for the betterment of Baytown, Lee College, and the surrounding community will forever be remembered. ____________________
