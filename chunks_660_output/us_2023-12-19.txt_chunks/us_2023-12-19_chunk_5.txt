Although I sought complete authority for D.C. to set the date of special elections, the 2012 law did not include this home- rule principle.
The Home Rule Act originally required the Board to hold special elections on the first Tuesday occurring more than 114 days after a vacancy and allowed the Board to schedule special elections on the same day as the next general election if that election occurred within 60 days from when a special election would otherwise have been held.
This inflexibility led to special elections being held on religious holidays and forced D.C. to hold a special election separate from an upcoming general election, costing D.C. hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The 2012 law requires the Board to hold a special election on a Tuesday occurring between 70 and 174 days after a vacancy.
This bill is an important step to perfect home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

It is my hope that, by Deborah's example, students throughout my district and throughout the country are encouraged to challenge themselves academically, and endeavor to strive for excellence in every facet of their lives.
Moreover, the example provided by young men and young women, like Deborah, should serve as inspiration to challenge ourselves and strive for excellence in every facet of our lives.
I would like to wish Deborah the best in her future endeavors, both academically and professionally, and once again congratulate her on her incredible performance on the PSAT. ____________________
