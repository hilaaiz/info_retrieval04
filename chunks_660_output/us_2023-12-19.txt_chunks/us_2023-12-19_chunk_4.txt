Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to wish a happy 103rd birthday to Willie James Thomas, Sr.
On behalf of Missouri's First District, we are thankful for everything he is and everything he has done to provide for his family, neighbors, coworkers, and friends.
103 is a remarkable milestone and worthy of great celebration.
Mr. Thomas has seen and lived through segments of history that most of us can only rely on through books and education, and from being in close community with elders like him.
His trials, triumphs, and everything in between are a beautiful testament to a remarkable and full life.
Throughout his life, Mr. Thomas has had many blessings.
He is the beloved father of three, a grandfather of 10, a great-grandfather of 21, and great-great-great-grandfather of six.
As a World War II Army Veteran serving in England, France, and Germany, we thank him for his dedication to his family and service to our country.
I am so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate his life because it is an inspiration to so many of us in St. Louis.
I wish Mr. Thomas peace and continued joy tending to the best yard in University City throughout his 103rd year.
Happy birthday and bountiful blessings to Mr. Willie James Thomas, Sr. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SPECIAL ELECTIONS HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
209



Date: 2023-12-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 209 Pages: E1252 - E1252 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SPECIAL ELECTIONS HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Special Elections Home Rule Act.
This bill would give the District of Columbia complete authority to set the date of special elections for local offices, like other jurisdictions.
This bill would remove a limitation in the D.C. Home Rule Act that is not only inconsistent with the self-government granted by the Home Rule Act, but is also harmful.
In 2012, I got legislation enacted that gave the D.C. Board of Elections (Board) more flexibility to set the date of special elections for local offices.
Although I sought complete authority for D.C. to set the date of special elections, the 2012 law did not include this home- rule principle.
The Home Rule Act originally required the Board to hold special elections on the first Tuesday occurring more than 114 days after a vacancy and allowed the Board to schedule special elections on the same day as the next general election if that election occurred within 60 days from when a special election would otherwise have been held.
This inflexibility led to special elections being held on religious holidays and forced D.C. to hold a special election separate from an upcoming general election, costing D.C. hundreds of thousands of dollars.
