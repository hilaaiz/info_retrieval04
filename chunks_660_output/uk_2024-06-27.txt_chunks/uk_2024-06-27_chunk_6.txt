HONORING THE SERVICE OF DEPUTY BASE CIVIL ENGINEER JOHN L. EUNICE, III

HON.
AUSTIN SCOTT

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr.

John L. Eunice, III, who is retiring after over 40 years of dedicated

service in the U.S. Air Force.
Mr. Eunice began his career in 1981 after receiving his commission

from the United States Air Force Academy and served for twenty-seven

years on active duty, achieving the rank of Colonel.
While on active

duty, he served two command tours, serving as Commander of the 36th and

347th Civil Engineer Squadrons.
For the last sixteen years of his career, Mr. Eunice served as Deputy

Base Civil Engineer for Moody Air Force Base in Lowndes County,

Georgia.
During this period, the outstanding performance, professional

competence, and ceaseless efforts of Mr. Eunice resulted in the

completion of twenty military construction projects and modernization

projects supporting both the 23d and 93d wings.
His guidance was

recently instrumental in the development of the 23d Wing's F-35 bed-

down plan.
Mr. Eunice also led the development of benchmarked intergovernmental

service agreements, partnering with Lowndes County on the operation of

the base water and wastewater treatment plants, a shared-use golf

course, and municipal services agreements.
His efforts led to the first

Defense Community Infrastructure Program project in the State of

Georgia, contributing to the 23d Wing and Lowndes County being awarded

the 2023 Air Force Community Partnership award.
I am honored to represent distinguished public servants and veterans

like Mr. John Eunice.
I wish him the best in his well-deserved

retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE REAL ID GENDER REQUIREMENT REFORM ACT

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the REAL ID Gender

Requirement Reform Act, which would remove the requirement from the

REAL ID Act that REAL ID-compliant licenses include gender.
Instead,

the decision of whether to have gender on a state's REAL-ID-compliant

licenses would be left to the states.
I am pleased Representative

Maxwell Frost is co-leading this bill.
This bill would require states that require gender designation for

licenses to allow individuals wishing to change their gender

designation on their license to do so through self-attestation.
It

would also require states that require gender designation on licenses

to have a neutral or other designation gender field, in addition to

male or female.
Under the REAL ID Act, gender must be included on a license.
This can

be problematic for transgender or nonbinary individuals.
I recognize

that some LGBTQ+ individuals do not want gender designations on

licenses at all, while others do want gender designation so as to

express their identity.
I believe this bill strikes the middle ground,

while showing Congress' support for LGBTQ+ individuals.
This is an important bill for equality.
I urge my colleagues to

support this bill.
