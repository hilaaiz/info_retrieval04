Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, last month, I had the honor of attending Ian McKinney's Eagle Scout Court of Honor.
Ian began his scouting experience as a Tiger Cub and after many years and transformative experiences, has now earned the rank of Eagle Scout.
Throughout the years, Ian has gained valuable knowledge and useful skills, made possible by his participation in the merit badge program and his steady involvement with the troop.
To achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, Ian developed and built a community educational garden to enrich his school's STEM program, leaving a lasting impact on fellow and future classmates.
Ian's dedication to the Scouts has been admirable and he should be proud of all that he has achieved with them.
God Bless Ian McKinney and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 168 Pages: E975 - E975 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CORPORAL SCOTT GILLEY ______ of texas in the house of representatives Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to thank Corporal Scott Gilley for his service with the Euless Police Department and to congratulate him on his retirement.
Corporal Gilley has spent 28 years as an officer with Euless PD protecting his community and countless North Texans.
I'd like to extend my sincere appreciation for his selfless service.
Before pursuing his aspirations to become a police officer, Scott served in the United States Coast Guard for 8 years.
After attaining an Honorable Discharge, he was hired as a Euless Police Officer in 1995.
His primary assignment with the department was working as a senior member in the patrol division.
Scott's leadership and work has had a significant impact leading many of his fellow officers on to very successful careers due to his mentorship.
Over his many years of service, Scott has received four police certifications, his Corporal rank, and a variety of police in-service training.
He's used this knowledge to provide countless hours of police training to other officers and mentor new ones straight from the academy.
During his time with Euless PD, Scott has received 40 police commendations in which he was commended for his service and professionalism to the department and community.
It has always been my view that public service is among the most admirable of callings, one that demands the very best among us to tackle monumental challenges in the name of selfless service to others.
