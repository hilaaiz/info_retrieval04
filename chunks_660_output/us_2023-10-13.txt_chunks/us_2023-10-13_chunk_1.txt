Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this April, I had the opportunity to attend Dylan Branca's Eagle Scout Court of Honor.
Dylan joined the Boy Scouts in the fifth grade and shortly after achieved the Arrow of Light, the highest honor in Cub Scouts.
Once he crossed over into the Boy Scouts, he hit the ground running with his troop, embarking on many adventures such as hiking Mount Washington and Tuckerman's Ravine.
One of his most memorable adventures was the twelve-day trip to Philmont Scout Reserve in New Mexico, where Dylan had the opportunity to serve as their ``Leave No Trace'' Guide.
For Dylan's Eagle Scout project, he planted lavender in the fields at Reed's farm in Egg Harbor Township.
This lavender is now being used to produce different products such as soaps and oils while the fields are simultaneously serving as the location for community yoga classes.
Dylan currently studies environmental science at Cedar Creek High School in the Magnet Program while simultaneously earning college credit.
It was a pleasure to attend Dylan's Eagle Scout Court of honor and he should be proud of his scouting achievements.
God Bless Dylan, and God Bless our United States of America. ____________________
