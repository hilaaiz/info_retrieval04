Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise to honor the life and legacy of Mrs. Tonya Latrice Finley-McCaw.
Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a remarkable servant leader who touched the lives of so many people across the St. Louis community.
A passionate advocate, Mrs. Finley-McCaw fought tirelessly for the rights of families and workers, including aiding efforts across the region and state for living wages and the right to unionize.
Together, alongside her inspiring son and a stalwart community leader, Rasheen, the pair were never far from a picket line, joining striking workers and allies demanding fair wages in the ``Fight for $15'' movement.
Mrs. Finley-McCaw was indefatigable.
In addition to her strong support of labor rights and economic justice, she also chaired St. Louis City's Moms Demand Action chapter in an effort to tackle the crisis of gun violence in our communities and received several leadership certificates and accolades for her wide-ranging work and advocacy throughout the St. Louis region.
Born on July 7, 1970, in Chicago, Illinois, to her loving parents, Samuel and Dorothy Finley.
She was also blessed with an amazing sister, Teijuania Finley.
Finley-McCaw attended and graduated from Parkway South High School, where she was crowned prom queen.
She later pursued higher education at St. Louis College of Health Careers and obtained her certification as a phlebotomist.
Mrs. Finley-McCaw was married to the love of her life, Rick McCaw, for 27 years.
She is the proud mother of three sons: Rashaad Crawford, Rasheen Aldridge, and Rasheed Finley.
She is the stepmother to Rickey McCaw, Rikeyia McCaw, Malik McCaw, and Bernard Wings.
When she wasn't spending time with her family or working to improve the lives of her St. Louis neighbors, Mrs. Finley-McCaw loved to cook (especially on holidays), play with her dogs, travel, and spend time with her grandchildren.
Mrs. Finley-McCaw was a great friend and mother figure to many.
I have fond memories of her.
I have fond memories of her helping to support me as I worked hard to represent the people of Missouri's First District.
She provided unparalleled guidance and never faltered in the work of ensuring St. Louis has the representation it deserves at every level of government, I got to witness what a remarkable human she was to those around and what an incredible mother she was through my personal friendship with Rasheen.
She touched so many of our hearts and she will be deeply missed.
May her memory forever be a blessing. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS AND AMERICAN SAMOA COLLEGE ACCESS ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
21



Date: 2024-02-06 Volume: 170, Issue: 21 Pages: E118 - E118 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS AND AMERICAN SAMOA COLLEGE ACCESS ACT ______ of the northern mariana islands in the house of representatives Mr. SABLAN.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa College Access Act, which would authorize tuition assistance grants to cover the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition costs for Marianas and American Samoa community college graduates seeking to attend a four-year public university.
The importance of having an educated citizenry is a bedrock principle of our nation and has been since our founding.
And in today's competitive job market, a postsecondary education is increasingly becoming a critical necessity for obtaining a decent job with a decent wage.
The Northern Mariana Islands has only been part of America for forty- five years.
We understand well that education is key to our continued growth, but the reality is that household incomes in the Marianas are less than half the national median.
The U.S. territory of American Samoa is in similar economic straits.
Poverty and unemployment rates there are among the highest in the country.
I believe the best way to improve economic conditions in these territories is to improve the educational opportunities available to our residents.
