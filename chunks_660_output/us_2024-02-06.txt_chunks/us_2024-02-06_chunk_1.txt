Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the El Paso County Senior Meal Program.
Since February 1974, El Paso has been assisting seniors across our community to receive at least one warm meal a day through the Older Americans Act.
The program first started at the Sacred Heart Church Center and St. Alban's Church Center and there are now over 16 centers across El Paso.
The El Paso County Senior Meal Program ensures that no senior goes hungry.
Today, in partnership with various regional government entities such as the City of El Paso, City of Socorro, City of San Elizario, Town of Clint, as well as grant funders including the Rio Grande Area Agency on Aging and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, El Paso County remains committed to delivering essential services, including providing nutritious meals, facilitating socialization, conducting wellness activities, and performing safety checks.
These services are consistently offered across 16 congregate sites, where a dedicated team of both staff and volunteers works collaboratively to serve approximately 12,057 congregate meals each month.
Additionally, an impressive 39,000 home-delivered meals are distributed monthly as part of this initiative.
Today, it is my privilege to recognize the significant contributions of the El Paso County Community Services Department personnel, as well as their partners and the multitude of volunteers involved in delivering these essential and crucial services to our community, for the last 50 years.
I wish them continued success and impact for many years to come. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the career and accomplishments of one of southeastern Connecticut's most prominent veterans' advocates, Mr. Paul Dillon.
Paul has dedicated his retirement from his service in the U.S. Navy to being a staunch defender of veterans both within his hometown of Gales Ferry, Connecticut, and around the southeast region.
Paul served in the Navy for nearly a quarter century from 1956 to 1980 and was an exemplary sailor.
His service encompassed the Vietnam War and his tenure saw him promoted to U.S. Navy Master Chief.
After service, he became a member of my Veterans Advisory Council, the president of the Nautilus Chapter of the Association of the U.S. Navy, and more.
In 2012, he was befittingly inducted into the CT Veterans' Hall of Fame.
The efforts he has made to protect and serve his country reflect his generosity and patriotism.
His selfless commitment to his community and to veterans from across the country has undoubtedly inspired future generations.
Paul Dillon courageously and honorably served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, putting his life on the line to defend our nation.
He was a Master Chief Radio Man on the USS Oklahoma City and USS Providence for three years.
Paul rose to the challenge of working over 18 hour days, surrounded by constant fire.
The stressful conditions of war were no match for Paul's tenacious spirit.
He continued to work tirelessly to protect our country.
His presence was integral to the protection and preservation of democracy and every American's liberty.
Unfortunately, Paul was exposed to Agent Orange during his tours and to this day he suffers from the health complications caused from the chemical exposure.
