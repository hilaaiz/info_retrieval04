RECOGNIZING APRIL AS SECOND CHANCE MONTH; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-04-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 70 Pages: E378 - E378 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING APRIL AS SECOND CHANCE MONTH ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker, I wish to take a moment to celebrate April as Second Chance Month--a time to recognize that interventions that help justice-involved individuals make our communities safer and healthier, grow our economy, and reduce recidivism.
I am deeply proud of my successes during my Congressional career that have given people a second chance.
The impact of the criminal justice system is deep and harmful--breaking families, removing workers from their workplace, and weakening our families, communities, and economy.
We know that providing opportunity for improvement strengthens lives, and it also saves taxpayer resources on re-incarceration that could support citizens in other ways, with the Illinois Sentencing Policy Advisory Council estimating that the average cost associated with one recidivism event is $151,662.
Further, economists recognize that integrating individuals with records into the workforce boosts our economy by increasing earnings and tax revenue.
In April of 2008, Congress passed and President George Bush enacted my bill--the Second Chance Act.
This law has provided over $600 million to state, local, and tribal governments as well as reentry-focused non- profit organizations to operate programs and services to ensure the success of people reentering their communities after incarceration.
A study completed by Texas Southern University of the effectiveness of the Second Chance Act in Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia found that education, vocational and work release programs, substance abuse programs, and family support are integral activities in reducing recidivism.
Just this week, I joined with colleagues from both sides of the aisle and in both chambers to reintroduce the Second Chance Reauthorization Act to keep these programs running.
Research demonstrates that postsecondary correctional education is greatly needed, has tremendous effectiveness, increases economic well- being, reduces recidivism, and saves taxpayers money.
Two of my bills to improve educational opportunity for justice-involved individuals became law in 2019.
The REAL (Restoring Education and Learning) Act restored Pell grant eligibility to the incarcerated.
According to the Vera Institute study, states can save an average of $7.6 million in incarceration costs each year for which people in prison have access to Pell Grants.
The FAFSA act removed the prohibition on federal student aid to people with felony drug convictions.
