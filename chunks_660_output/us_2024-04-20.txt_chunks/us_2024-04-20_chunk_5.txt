170, No.
70



Date: 2024-04-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 70 Pages: E379 - E379 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide and stand in solidarity in the remembrance of the millions of lives lost during this tragic event.
Let us not forget the hate and mistreatment Armenian families faced and make sure that this terrible event is never forgotten in the minds of Americans and our history.
The Armenian Genocide was one of the darkest moments in human history, resulting in the deaths of approximately a million Armenians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire.
Today, let us be reminded to always treat our neighbors with love and human dignity, and inspired by the memory of those lost, to never stop fighting for a better world in their honor.
I join the Armenian communities of Michigan and across my district in recognizing the 109th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide as we remember the lives of the loved ones lost a century ago. ____________________
