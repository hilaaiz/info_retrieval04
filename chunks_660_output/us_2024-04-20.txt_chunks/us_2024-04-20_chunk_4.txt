Mr. Speaker, last year, my efforts to ensure foreign adversaries can't control American social media applications was declared dead, and TikTok's lobbyists were celebrating.
Today, I'm proud to say its on the path to passing the Senate and headed to the President's desk.
The CCP's last ditch attempts to destroy the bill and me personally failed.
And though I didn't expect to have to prioritize my family and leave Congress early, I'll confess this is how I always wanted to go out.
On top, with the select committee at the height of its influence, having just passed the most consequential bill of my career, perhaps the most consequential bill of this Congress, and having just completed two historic investigations.
And with FISA and these national security supplemental across the finish line, this Congress has completed its most important homework, for which the Speaker deserves enormous credit.
I firmly believe the Speaker has emerged on the other side of this stronger and a statesman.
Any Motion to Vacate will fail, the Republican majority will grow as three special election seats get filled in the coming weeks, and what remains of this Congress will involve bipartisan oversight and legislation.
And though I will be stepping away from politics, I think after this week my Republican colleagues will have a strong case to make come November, that they held the line for freedom at home and abroad.
It's typical at moments such as these to say ``I have no regrets.''
This is true legislatively and professionally.
I accomplished my mission and got to chair the most significant committee in the 118th congress.
Yet I have a lingering personal regret.
I wish I had devoted more time to building personal relationships with my colleagues.
Our time here is frenetic: filled with overlapping committee hearings and constant fundraising events.
It's hard to carve out time just to get to know your colleagues, to understand their background and motivation, and thereby develop trust.
Where I was able to do that, with Senator Angus King my co-chair on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, and with Raja Krishnamoorthi on the China committee, it produced the biggest legislative successes of my 8 years.
Put differently, my effectiveness as Congressman wasn't primarily a function of intellect or op-ed writing prowess and certainly not fundraising, it was a direct result of forging friendships across our caucus and maybe more importantly across the aisle.
So if there's a lesson in that for my successor or any of my colleagues it's after a grueling day of a thousand meetings, still make the effort to get that beer with a member you don't know that well.
Drink more, tweet less.
Get to know your colleagues in real life before trashing them on

social media.
At the end of the day, Republicans and Democrats, we're all Americans, citizens of the greatest country in the history of the world.
Even on our worst day the world is looking to us for leadership.
God bless America. ____________________

Date: 2024-04-20 Volume: 170, Issue: 70 Pages: E378 - E379 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E378-E379] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING CHULA VISTA ASSISTANT POLICE CHIEF PHIL COLLUM ______ of california in the house of representatives Ms. JACOBS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Chula Vista Assistant Police Chief Phil Collum, a 29-year veteran of the department who we sadly lost to cancer.
His service and his legacy will always be remembered.
Those who knew Assistant Police Chief Collum best emphasize his empathy, his compassion, his reputation for being fair, his work ethic, and more than anything, his dedication to his community.
Community was at the heart of everything Assistant Police Chief Collum did.
He gave the directive in 2022 to create the Community Engagement Division to help foster community relationships--and he personally led this division.
