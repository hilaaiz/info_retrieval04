Frank's entrepreneurial instincts can be traced back to working with his older brother, Jimmy, after he founded Jonna Construction in 1965.
Early on, Jimmy's leadership taught Frank the meaning of hard work, patience, and perseverance firsthand, propelling him to later become CEO of Jonna Construction.
With over 40 years of dedication to the Metro Detroit area, Frank has served on the numerous Boards including Henry Ford Health, Catholic Central High School, Angel's Place, and Detroit Public Television.
Alongside these accomplishments, his legacy will forever live on in the community Jonna Construction has contributed to and built, including Michigan National Bank Building, the Henry Ford Detroit Pistons Performance Training Center, Mother of God Church, St. Thomas Church, Shenandoah Country Club, and the Chaldean Community Foundation Headquarters.
Frank is the embodiment of the American Dream.
In every step of his career, he has showcased a neverending commitment to the Southeast Michigan community, so on behalf of all of Michigan's 10th Congressional District, congratulations to Frank Jonna. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, last year, my efforts to ensure foreign adversaries can't control American social media applications was declared dead, and TikTok's lobbyists were celebrating.
Today, I'm proud to say its on the path to passing the Senate and headed to the President's desk.
The CCP's last ditch attempts to destroy the bill and me personally failed.
