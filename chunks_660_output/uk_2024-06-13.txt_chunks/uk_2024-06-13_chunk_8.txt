My constituents enjoy working for Evapco as it follows the vision of

``one global team, united to be universally recognized as the superior

provider of a full spectrum of heat transfer solutions.''
And its

commitment to teamwork has enabled its employees--my constituents--to

excel.
It is a team their employees and customers alike can count on

for a lifetime.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of

Representatives to join me in celebrating Evapco's 45th anniversary in

California and recognizing its success in expanding in my district to

produce innovative water-saving, ``Eco-Air'' dry-cooling products,

which will improve the quality of life of my constituents,

Californians, and communities around the world.
