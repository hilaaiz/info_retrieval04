Over the last seven decades, the U.S. Small Business Administration has played a vital role in supporting and empowering small businesses.
Providing entrepreneurs important guidance on financial products, the SBA has proven to be an invaluable resource.
Small businesses and their employees drive growth and innovation and play an essential role in the American economy.
In the United States, there are over 33 million small businesses that employ approximately 61.7 million Americans.
In the past 28 years, these businesses have created 17.3 million net new jobs, which accounts for 62.7 percent of jobs created since 1995.
The Lower Rio Grande Valley District of the U.S. Small Business Administration serves 14 counties in south Texas.
In 2020, over 179,000 jobs were supported by approximately 10,000 establishments in the 34th Congressional District alone.
Through their various programs and initiatives, the SBA has provided small businesses access to capital, Federal contracting certifications and opportunities, and disaster recovery.
Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed the U.S. Small Business Administration open doors for and provide a lifeline to small business owners across south Texas and it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge this agency's invaluable contributions to our region and country. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today we gather to honor the life of Dorothy Diana (Roza) Decker, a passionate advocate for early childhood education and a beacon of dedication within our community.
Diana's lifelong commitment to education has left an indelible mark on the lives of countless individuals.
She peacefully passed away at her Fresno home on July 23, 2023, leaving behind a legacy of compassion, determination, and lasting influence.
Born on November 11, 1942, in Hanford, California, Diana's journey began on a dairy farm in Easton, California, surrounded by the love of her parents and five brothers.
Her heart radiated with a genuine concern for others from an early age, a trait that would define her entire life.
Diana attended Washington Union High School, excelling academically, and serving as the editor of the school's newspaper, a role that foreshadowed her lifelong dedication to sharing stories and voices.
Diana's path intertwined with that of her soulmate, Mike Decker, in 1963.
Their story unfolded with a sense of fate, and on July 4, 1964, they embarked on a journey of love that spanned 53 remarkable years.
Together, they raised a family and built a legacy of love, resilience, and unwavering commitment to one another.
Diana's passion for early childhood education was both a vocation and a calling.
For over 30 years, she poured her heart and soul into advocating for the youngest members of our society.
Her contributions to the Central California Association of Young Children were immeasurable, embodying her dedication through roles such as Chapter President, Community Outreach advocate, Governing Board member, and was the very first recipient of the Fansler Institute ECE Leader of the Year award for her contributions to the educational community.
She continued to shine her light at the state level, serving as a Central California representative on the State board of the California Association for the Education of Young Children, leaving an indelible mark on the landscape of childhood education across the State.
Diana's impact extended to her teaching career, empowering children, and adults with her wisdom.
Her role as a special education teacher for Central Unified and later as a Special Education Specialist Lead for the Merced County Office of Education, CPIN, exemplified her dedication to fostering growth and potential in every individual.
Her compassion radiated not only in her professional endeavors but also within her family.
