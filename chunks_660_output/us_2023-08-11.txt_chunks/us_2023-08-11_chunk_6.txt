Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pastor Eddie Williams for his 17 years of service to the congregation at Lakeridge Ministries Church of God in Christ.
Lakeridge Village Ministries was founded on the principle of uplifting people from all walks of life in spirituality and that the gift of spirituality is not limited to clergy.
Pastor Williams has sought to lead his flock under that guidance, fostering a true sense of community and caring for the most vulnerable.
In addition to his work in ministry, Pastor Williams has sought to expand resources and options for people suffering from the pain of addiction and mental illness.
His work at Lakeridge Village has accomplished so much in fighting the stigma around mental health issues and connecting those struggling with substance abuse to the assistance they need.
In short Pastor Williams has performed outstanding service to the community through his ministry and charitable work.
Please join me in tribute to Pastor Eddie Williams in celebration of his 17 years in spiritual service to Lakeridge Ministries Church of God in Christ. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MARCHING CENTURIONS; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-08-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 135 Pages: E772 - E773 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E772-E773] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MARCHING CENTURIONS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. MIKE GARCIA of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Saugus High School's 2022-2023 Marching Centurions for their selection to represent California's 27th Congressional District in the National Memorial Day Parade held in our Nation's capital.
Their designation as a distinguished participant in this year's festivities is a testament to not only their performative excellence, but their resilience through several years of challenges from which they have emerged stronger than ever.
It is important to recognize that this distinction is one that very few marching bands and color guards across the United States have the privilege of touting, and it is certainly one that is earned rather than given.
For years leading up to their participation in the National Memorial Day Parade, the Marching Centurions of Saugus High School have distinguished themselves as a benchmark of virtuosity and dedication to craft.
Time and time again, students throughout the years have represented their fellow classmates with unmatched pride and skill and it is heartening to see this program be rewarded with such an honor.
I also want to pay special recognition to the members who graduated with the Class of 2023.
Since they began high school in 2019, their graduating class has faced a gauntlet of trials and tribulations that many of their contemporaries or even most adults have not.
After the tragic shooting in November of 2019, they were immediately confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns, and virtual learning which forced them to press on with rehearsals over Zoom.
These challenges were of course coupled with the typical obstacles a teenager faces when navigating high school: homework, crushes, college applications, and anxiety about the future.
