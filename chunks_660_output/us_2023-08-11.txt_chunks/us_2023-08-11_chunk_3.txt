Diana's impact extended to her teaching career, empowering children, and adults with her wisdom.
Her role as a special education teacher for Central Unified and later as a Special Education Specialist Lead for the Merced County Office of Education, CPIN, exemplified her dedication to fostering growth and potential in every individual.
Her compassion radiated not only in her professional endeavors but also within her family.
As a loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she left an indelible mark of love, unity, and boundless support.
As we mourn Diana's physical absence, we find solace in the beautiful memories and legacy of love she has gifted us.
Her life's tapestry is woven with threads of compassion, kindness, and resilience, reminding us that the impact of a single life, lived with purpose, can reach

far beyond the confines of time.
Diana is survived by her three children: Timothy John Decker of Pagosa Springs, Colorado; Katie Marie Decker and Scott Arthur Decker, both Fresno, California and daughter-in-law Marie Estrada Decker.
Her legacy also includes three grandchildren: Michael Anthony Hill, Jadyn Decker Garrett, and Nicho Decker, as well as a great-granddaughter, Neelia Grace Hill.
She is also survived by her brothers Gene Roza and his wife, Marylou Roza; Robert Roza and his wife, Gail Roza; and Franklin Roza.
Numerous cousins, including myself, nieces, and nephews also cherish her memory.
May we honor Diana's memory by carrying forward her torch of compassion, nurturing the dreams of our youth, and supporting one another with the unwavering devotion she showed throughout her remarkable journey.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of Dorothy Diana (Roza) Decker, a dedicated educator whose commitment to early childhood education has profoundly shaped the lives of many.
Her contributions will continue to inspire generations, fostering a love for learning and education. ____________________
