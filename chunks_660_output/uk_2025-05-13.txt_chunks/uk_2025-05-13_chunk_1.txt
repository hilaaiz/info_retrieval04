CONGRATULATING ECORE INTERNATIONAL ON BEING NAMED EXIM'S EXPORTER OF

THE YEAR

HON.
LLOYD SMUCKER

Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize

Ecore International for being named Exporter of the Year by the Export-

Import Bank of the United States (EXIM).
Beginning as a small cork manufacturer in 1871, Lancaster-based Ecore

International is a global leader in circular rubber flooring.
Ecore has

covered projects from local gyms, turf fields, and playgrounds to NFL

locker rooms and Churchill Downs.
What makes Ecore truly special is

their dedication to sustainability and innovation.
Ecore uses recycled

rubber and ensures it can be reused continuously, transforming 430

million pounds of rubber waste annually into 1,500 different products.
Ecore International operates in 76 different countries and has 13

facilities across the United States, including 2 in Pennsylvania's 11th

Congressional District.
Their recognition as EXIM's Exporter of the

Year compliments their noteworthy pedigree of awards and

accomplishments.
It is with great pride that I can consider Ecore International among

my constituents.
I thank the company for helping to solidify

Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District as a center for

manufacturing and innovation, and once again I congratulate them for

being EXIM's Exporter of the Year.

HONORING THE VIETNAM AND KOREAN WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS

HON.
MIKE QUIGLEY

Mr. QUIGLEY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Vietnam and Korean War

veterans who traveled to Washington, D.C. on May 14, 2025, with Honor

Flight Chicago, a program that provides WWII, Vietnam, and Korean War

veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on The National Mall

in Washington, D.C. These memorials were built to honor their courage

and service to their country.
The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures.
The Soldiers,

Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here on May

14 answered our Nation's call to service during one of its greatest

times of need.
From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean Theater,

these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service, and

sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero.
We owe

them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women

for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to

rise and join me in expressing gratitude.
