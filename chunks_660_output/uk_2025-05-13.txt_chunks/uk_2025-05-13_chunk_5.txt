RECOGNIZING KIMBERLY GODDING BROOKS

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding

contributions that Ms. Kimberly Godding Brooks has made to our

community through her volunteerism.
Since 2008, 17 years, Kimberly

Godding Brooks has volunteered her time and talents to support Friends

of Citrus and the Nature Coast Grief Services for children.
Kimberly

started as a Volunteer Coordinator, for Camp Good/Teen Encounter, a

grief support camp for kids and teens who have experienced a loss.
Trained volunteers provide therapeutic activities, in a camp setting,

and help children share their stories with peers, whereby strengthening

their ability to cope.
Kimberly was Branch Manager with a local bank

which donated backpacks to all campers.
When Kimberly married Robert

Brooks, she quickly recruited him to become a Camp Volunteer.
Kimberly

and Robert use ``Lifelines'', an exercise using strings and dark

glasses, that block vision, to help children build self-confidence and

``find their way''.
When Kimberly's mom, Lynn Godding, moved to our

area, Kimberly quickly recruited her as a volunteer for the camp

``kitchen team.''
In 2018, Kimberly and Robert's daughter Coral was

born.
She began attending volunteer events, meetings, workshops and

camps with her parents.
Coral became an official volunteer at age 6 and

serves as a role model for other camp kids.
She participates in local

fundraising activities.
Kimberly is still employed as a bank Branch

Manager.
She serves on the organization's Advisory Board, actively

participates in fundraising activities and continues to advocate for

Camp Good Hope/Teen Encounter and other grief

support services in our community, along with her husband, mom and, of

course, Coral.
Volunteering has become a Godding/Brooks ``family

affair''!
Kimberly is truly an example of an outstanding volunteer and

a Hero in our Community.
It is clear that Kimberly Godding Brooks has made a profoundly

positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
May we all strive to serve our communities with the same dedication and

humility.

RECOGNIZING KYLE SMITH

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding

contributions that Kyle Smith has made through his work with the Pasco

County Human Services Team.
The Pasco County Human Services Team has

proven itself to be a cornerstone of resilience, innovation, and

unwavering commitment to the community.
Amidst the devastating impacts

of Hurricanes Helene and Milton, they emerged as an indispensable

force, transforming challenges into triumphs and ensuring no resident

was left behind.
The team managed and helped coordinate efforts for

shelters that housed 485 residents.
When Hurricane Milton struck

shortly thereafter, the team rose to even greater heights, coordinating

shelters for 5,800 individuals and 1,315 animals--an extraordinary feat

of operational precision and compassion.
Despite personal hardships,

including one case manager losing her home while another lost her

rental property, the team prioritized the welfare of the community,

working tirelessly to ensure safety and stability for all.
Post-storm,

the team was responsible for helping shelter residents whose homes were

no longer safe, find appropriate alternatives for housing.
Their

dedication shone through in rapid response efforts.
In the days

immediately following Hurricane Helene, 49 residents received critical

assessments and essential resources.
After Hurricane Milton, they

worked with 225 displaced individuals who remained in shelters,

demonstrating their unparalleled ability to adapt and respond under

pressure.
The team leveraged the Human Services Needs app to streamline

disaster case management, supporting 1,351 residents.
Their follow-up

system, in partnership with other agencies, ensured personalized

service for every individual.
This innovative approach epitomized their

ability to harness technology and partnerships for meaningful impact.
Beyond immediate relief, the team worked with individuals and families

who would require long-term recovery efforts.
