INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL RETIREMENT THRIFT INVESTMENT BOARD

INSPECTOR GENERAL ACT OF 2025

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Retirement

Thrift Investment Board Inspector General Act of 2025, which would

create an independent Inspector General (IG) for the Federal Retirement

Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB).
The FRTIB administers the Thrift

Savings Plan (TSP), the retirement savings and investment plan for

federal employees.
In 2022, the FRTIB launched a new recordkeeping system with the goal

of modernizing TSP's recordkeeping, improving customer service and

bolstering cybersecurity.
There were widespread problems with the new

system, including account access, account balances, missing or

incomplete information in accounts and hours-long wait times to reach

customer service.
I, along with several colleagues, asked the

Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine the implementation of

the new system.
GAO found that FRTIB ``did not fully implement key

acquisition management practices . . . [
which] significantly increased

the risk of a problematic rollout of the new system.''
TSP has approximately 7.2 million participants and $937 billion in

assets, making it the world's largest defined contribution plan.
Federal employees dedicate their careers to serving our country, and

they deserve a retirement savings and investment plan that provides

top-tier customer support and security.
While the Employee Benefits Security Administration has oversight

responsibility for TSP, as it does for private sector 401(k) plans,

there is no IG for the FRTIB.
The problems with the rollout of the

recordkeeping system are evidence enough that the FRTIB needs an

independent IG.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
