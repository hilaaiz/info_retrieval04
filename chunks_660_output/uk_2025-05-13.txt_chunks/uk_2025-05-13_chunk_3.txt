RECOGNIZING DEAN LANCASTER

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding

contributions that Mr. Dean Lancaster has made as a volunteer with the

Hernando County School System.
Mr. Lancaster offered his services as an

announcer for high school basketball games.
Coach Kupcik decided to

allow him to announce at an upcoming game and had no idea what to

expect.
When Mr. Lancaster arrived to announce his first game, he came

early, brought all his fancy equipment, and got to work setting up.
That night, he blew everyone away and bought a real, college-like feel

to the game.
He was prepared and professional, enthusiastic and

exciting.
He brought music, catchphrases, and announcing on the call--

the whole nine yards.
All night long people were asking, ``where did

this guy come from?'',
``he is amazing!'',
``Can he come to every

game?''.
Coach Kupcik told him, ``You're hired!''
That day, and every

day moving forward, he refused payment for his services.
Mr. Lancaster

always says it's his way of giving back to the community.
Since his

``tryout'', Mr. Lancaster has offered his talents, professionalism, and

enthusiasm to every home Boys Basketball game at Springstead High

School.
Over the years, he has agreed to do the same for every home

Varsity Football and Baseball game as well.
Because he has been so

popular and because he brings so much to the events he is announcing,

Mr. Lancaster has also been requested to announce at other big events

at Springstead, such as senior nights, their annual cheer competition

and during the final matches of the historic Corey Hill Memorial

Wrestling Tournament.
As an Athletic Director, Coach Kupcik shares that

having a consistent announcer locked in is always a plus.
It's one less

thing to worry about.
But having a consistent, amazing, professional-

level announcer that transforms a relatively meaningless Tuesday night

baseball or basketball game into a must-go-to, college like event for

fans and players alike is truly a blessing.
Mr. Lancaster is one of a

kind, and is now a true part of what Springstead Athletics is, and

forever an Eagle.
It is clear Dean Lancaster has made a profoundly positive impact on

our community, and I am grateful for his service.
May we all strive to

serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.
