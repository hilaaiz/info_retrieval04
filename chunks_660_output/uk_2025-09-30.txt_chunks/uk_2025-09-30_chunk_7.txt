He went on to earn the trust of voters time and again,

being elected in 1998 and re-elected in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016,

and 2020.
Over the course of his distinguished tenure, he represented

Ward 1--including Albany, El Cerrito, El Sobrante, Richmond, San Pablo,

and the surrounding unincorporated communities--with energy, vision,

and compassion.
A longtime champion for transit riders, Director Peeples was deeply

engaged in the AC Bus Riders Union, Alliance for AC Transit, Regional

Alliance for Transit, Alliance for Sensible Transit, and the Coalition

for a One Stop Terminal, among many other groups.
His commitment

extended beyond the Bay Area, as he actively participated in the

Transportation Research Board of the National Academies and the

American Public Transportation Association, where he elevated local

priorities to national and international conversations.
Director Peeples was especially devoted to advancing clean

transportation and was a strong proponent of AC Transit's

groundbreaking zero-emission fuel cell bus program.
He spoke at and

moderated panels across the country and abroad, promoting hydrogen and

zero-emission transit as solutions to climate change and air pollution.
Chris was also a pillar of civic life, serving on the Oakland Ethics

Commission and numerous community and political bodies.
A graduate of

Crown College, University of California at Santa Cruz, and Hastings

College of the Law, he combined his intellectual rigor with a passion

for equity and sustainability.
Christian Peeples leaves behind a legacy of advocacy, innovation, and

public service that will endure for generations.
I ask my colleagues to

join me in honoring his extraordinary life and in extending our deepest

condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, and the community he

served so faithfully.

HONORING THE REMARKABLE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ALBERT J. ``AL'' LLORENS

_____

HON.
RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI

Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable

life and legacy of my good friend, Albert J. ``Al'' Llorens.
Born and raised in Chicago, Al grew up in Englewood on the Southwest

side and attended Chicago Public Schools.
He went on to earn his

bachelor's degree in mathematics education from the University of

Illinois at Champaign and later a master's degree in curriculum and

instruction from National Louis University.
Al was, above all, a good man.
He believed deeply that making the

world a better place begins in the classroom.
For more than 30 years,

he poured his heart into teaching mathematics and coaching at the high

school level.
He loved the classroom and dedicated himself to

empowering the next generation of students.
But Al's impact reached far beyond the walls of any classroom.
Even

when he stepped away from teaching--always calling it a ``leave of

absence'' rather than a retirement--he carried his passion for students

into his work with the Illinois Education Association.
Before being

elected IEA president in 2023, Al served two terms each as vice

president and secretary/treasurer, working tirelessly to address the

teacher shortage crisis in Illinois and to ensure that every student

had access to a higher quality education.
As president of the IEA, he

was a giant in education, fighting for his beloved teachers and

students until the very end.
Al dedicated his life to strengthening

public education as he believed deeply in its power to transform

communities, leaving a legacy that will continue to change the lives of

many.
I will miss Al not only for what he accomplished, but for how he

carried himself.
He was a friend to all, a leader who combined

compassion with resolve, and a fierce advocate for public education.
Mr. Speaker, I extend my deepest condolences to his beloved wife,

Wanda, his children, and his grandchildren.
May they find comfort in

knowing that Al's life's work continues in the generations of students

and educators he inspired.
