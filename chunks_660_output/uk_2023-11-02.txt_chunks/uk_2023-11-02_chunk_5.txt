RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DENNIS, GARTLAND, & NIERGARTH

HON.
JACK BERGMAN

Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate Dennis,

Gartland & Niergarth of Traverse City on their 50th Anniversary.
A

full-service accounting firm, Dennis, Gartland, & Niergarth (DGN) are

committed to serving the people of Northern Michigan and improving its

communities.
On October 1, 1973, the late Thomas Gartland founded the firm with an

emphasis on teamwork and a focus on client success.
Sticking to these

founding principles, the company quickly became Northern Michigan's

largest, full-service, public accounting firm.
For the past 50 years, DGN has been committed to elevating their

clients, providing extraordinary attention to detail, and hands-on

service to businesses and individuals in their community.
DGN has

expanded to boast more than 55 professionals, 2 offices, and 12

partners who serve Northern Michigan.
When DGN grew, so did the list of

services they provide and today DGN is ready to help from Agribusiness

to estate and retirement planning.
As exemplified by the staff, DGN's

community-centric values are what distinguishes them in their endeavor

to serve and improve the lives of those in Northern Michigan.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Dennis, Gartland, &

Niergarth on their 50th anniversary.
I'd like to thank them for their

continued dedication to the people of Northern Michigan and wish them

and their staff all the best in their future endeavors.
