When his mother tragically passed away from small-cell lung cancer,

Michael turned his grief into action.
He rode in his first Pelotonia in

2010 and promised to ride every year until the battle against cancer is

won or until he no longer can.
Michael's commitment to finding a cure

for cancer has become an inspiration to his community and to all those

who know him.
This year, Michael became the first individual rider in

Pelotonia history to raise over $1 million for cancer research, raising

$115,000 in 2023 alone, and was awarded the 2023 Pelotonia Legacy Award

for his outstanding leadership.

RECOGNIZING THE TRAILBLAZING CONGRESSWOMAN DIANE WATSON IN CELEBRATION

OF HER 90TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE

Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate former

Ambassador and Congresswoman Diane Watson's 90th birthday.
Congresswoman Watson paved the way for the many Black female

legislators, myself included, who would come after her.
She is a true

trailblazer, becoming the first Black female member of the Los Angeles

Unified School District Board and the first Black female California

State Senator.
Today we recognize her remarkable contributions to Los

Angeles, the State of California, and the United States.
Born in Los Angeles, CA, Congresswoman Watson attended local Los

Angeles public schools before earning her Bachelor's degree in

Education from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), her

Master's degree in School Psychology from California State University

at Los Angeles (Cal State LA), and her PhD in Educational

Administration from Claremont Graduate College.
Congresswoman Watson began her life of public service as an

elementary school teacher and worked diligently up the ranks to become

an assistant principal and a school psychologist, touching the lives of

countless students.
She also served as a Health Education Specialist

for Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), at UCLA, and at Cal

State LA.
In 1975, distinguished members of the Los Angeles community

encouraged her to seek election to the LAUSD School Board.
She won her

election, and in this role, she worked to expand school integration and

to raise the rigor of academic standards for all students.
In 1978, Congresswoman Watson became the first Black woman elected to

the California State Senate, where she served on the Senate Judiciary

Committee and as Chair of the Health and Human Services Committee from

1981 through 1998.
At the state level, she championed legislation for

nutrition assistance programs, breast cancer research, and access to

health care.
In 1999, President Clinton appointed Congresswoman Watson as the

Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia, where she helped stop

illegal toxic waste from being dumped into surrounding waters.
After

her election to the House of Representatives in 2001, she served

California's 33rd District faithfully for a decade, representing areas

of Los Angeles that are now part of the 37th District.
Congresswoman Watson became a vocal leader on issues related to

racism and xenophobia, supporting reparations for descendants of

enslaved Americans, educational system reform, and a comprehensive

overhaul of the nation's criminal justice system.
She also called out

the rise of Islamophobia following the 9/11 attacks.
Her tenure as a

legislator demonstrated a dedication to creating legislation and

initiatives for the betterment of all.
