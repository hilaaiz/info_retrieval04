Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Lieutenant Jessica Wyman of the Nashua Fire Department, who, on November 28, 2023, passed away after her battle with cancer.
Lieutenant Wyman was not only an exemplary public servant working two jobs as a firefighter and an ER nurse, but also a trailblazer for women in the fire service.
She was the first female firefighter to be promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in Nashua Fire Department history.
She also led week-long summer camps to help women get involved in the fire service.
Lieutenant Wyman will be remembered as many things: a hero, a professional, a civil servant, a trailblazer, a community leader, and a friend.
My heart is with Jessica's husband, Chris, her family, and the Nashua Fire Department.
May she rest in peace.

ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Phoebus High School Football Team from Hampton, Virginia on becoming the Virginia High School League's Class 4 State Champions.
On Saturday, December 9, 2023, the Phoebus Phantoms won the Class 4 State Championship Game against the Salem High School Spartans with a score of 21-14.
This is the third year in a row Phoebus High School has claimed a state championship title following two consecutive victories in the Class 3 division.
Led by Coach Jeremy Blunt, the Phantoms won this title on the tail end of an equally astounding season.
Phoebus High School closed their season undefeated, with a record of 15 wins and 0 losses, and maintained a 35-game winning streak going back to the two previous seasons.
Throughout the game, the Phantoms and Spartans fought back and forth for control of the scoreboard, with the victor only being determined in the final moments of the game.
The two teams, tied 14-14, were seemingly set for a showdown in overtime.
But with one second remaining on the clock, freshman quarterback Maurikus Banks completed a pass to senior wide receiver Keyontae Gray, who ran the ball for an 86-yard touchdown to secure the championship.
The determination it took for these young athletes to keep fighting down to the end is an example for all of us.
Because of their hard work, they have made our community proud.
Mr. Speaker, I want to again congratulate the Phoebus High School Football Team and thank Coach Blunt, the parents, and the entire Phoebus High School community for supporting these students throughout this remarkable season.
I wish them the best in their future endeavors, and I wish the program continued success. ____________________
