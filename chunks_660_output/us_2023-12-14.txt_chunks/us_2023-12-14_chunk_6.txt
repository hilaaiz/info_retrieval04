During this time, she served on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Nuclear Repair Division; served honorably in U.S. Desert Storm campaign; and was a member of the U.S. Ready Reserve from 1993 to 2000.
In addition, she has received several awards, including the Navy Wide Command Award, the National Defense Service Medal for Desert Storm, and a Naval Citation.
Lucetia received her Master of Science in Human Services from Capella University, and her Bachelor of Business Administration from Davenport University.
She was a member of the Dean's List upon completing both degrees.
Since 1994, Ms. Manwaring has helped thousands of constituents throughout the state of Michigan.
Her tenure began as a staff member for my uncle, retired U.S. Congressman Dale Kildee.
She met Congressman Dale Kildee while serving in the Navy and began her career as a staff member shortly thereafter.
Upon his retirement, I was grateful to have her join my staff as well.
Ms. Manwaring's career is a true example of public service.
Throughout her career she has been a tireless advocate for her community and her work has had a lasting impact on the lives of hundreds of Michiganders.
I am grateful to be represented by such dedicated employees who work hard to make our community and Nation a better place.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Ms. Lucetia Manwaring for her unwavering commitment to public service and extend my heartfelt gratitude for her years of service to our great country. ____________________
