Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career of a devoted patriot and civil servant in Houston County, Georgia, Sheriff Cullen Talton.
Mr. Talton's dedicated career in law enforcement has spanned over five decades, making him the longest-serving sheriff in the history of the State of Georgia.
Born in 1932 in Bonaire, Georgia, Mr. Talton was a Houston County commissioner and a dairy farmer before being elected sheriff in 1972.
When he first took office, Mr, Talton was responsible for a department of just 28 employees, which has grown to over 300 today.
Additionally, Houston County had a population of 63,000 in 1972 and now boasts over 170,000 residents, which Mr. Talton has selflessly dedicated his career to protecting and serving.
He is a shining example for all law enforcement officers to aspire to.
Family and friends describe Sheriff Talton as a ``role model,'' a ``servant,'' and a ``peacekeeper.''
He has embodied the meaning of each of these words to their fullest during his time as Sheriff of Houston County.
I wish Mr. Talton a long and healthy retirement, surrounded by the family and friends he has served tirelessly throughout his esteemed career.
I would like to thank Sheriff Talton for his years of service to our community and our country.
It is an honor to represent such outstanding constituents like him in the Eighth Congressional District of Georgia. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, Rhode Islanders know that small businesses are the backbone of every city and town in our great state.
It is my distinct pleasure to honor Small Business Administrator District Director for Rhode Island Mark Hayward for his long and important service to our state.
Mark's service has benefited small businesses and the constituents of our First Congressional District in innumerable ways.
I applaud his decades of commitment, and I express my gratitude on behalf of Rhode Islanders across every community for Mark's dedication.
I understand Mark's retirement has been planned since before the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, Mark opted to continue to serve an additional few long years to help ensure that the Rhode Island small business community saw its way through the crisis.
Mark's decision to help his community get to the other side of such a major event is the mark of a true public servant--one who is willing to put others first no matter the circumstances.
The success of so many small businesses across our state is because of Mark's many decades of hard work and expertise.
For so many small business leaders, Mark's steady leadership was a lifeline.
Whether helping small businesses navigate the Paycheck Protection Program or helping new business owners access the technical resources they needed to be successful, Mark has been relentlessly focused on growing our economy through his public service during his long and effective entire career.
I wish Mark some very well-deserved rest and time off with his wife Nancy, his children, and grandchildren.
I know Mark's commitment to our community is thread throughout every fiber of his being and that he will continue to serve his fellow Rhode Islanders for many years to come.
Happy retirement to Mark, and I thank him for all he has done for Rhode Island. ____________________
