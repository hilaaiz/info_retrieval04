She steered our communications team through some of our greatest legislative accomplishments, including the introduction of the Equality Act and the passage of the Korean Valor Act into law.
Despite the challenges of being in the minority, her innovative vision for our social media stood out.
To the members of her communications team, she has been a mentor and a model of running an effective, relationship-based comms shop.
Above all, Taylor has been a joyful presence in my office.
She is cheerful, sharp, and quick-witted, and her jokes often make it to my social media pages.
She is known for always being good for a laugh or a heart-to-heart chat among my staff.
Wherever she may go down the road, she will always be a member of Team Takano.
I am enormously grateful to Taylor for her contributions.
She will be dearly missed, and I wish her luck in her next adventure. ____________________
