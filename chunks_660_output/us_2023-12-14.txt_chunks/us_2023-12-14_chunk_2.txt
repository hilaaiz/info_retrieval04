Stella's story is one of resilience, patriotism, and unwavering dedication to her family and country.
Born in 1919, Stella has seen more than most of us can imagine, from the Great Depression and World War II to the Cuban Missile Crisis and Apollo 11 mission.
Through it all, Stella has remained a pillar of strength for her family and community and channeled her energy into activism.
After losing her son Wayde to an enemy artillery shell in Vietnam, Stella became a relentless advocate for our Nation's veterans and their families.
She has offered solace and support to countless military families in their darkest moments.
Stella has been a dedicated community activist in her hometown of Big Lake.
She taught Sunday School at her church, and eventually became the Sunday School Superintendent.
Stella was also involved in local politics and served as caucus convener for the Big Lake area.
Stella is a true patriot.
She has written letters to the editor advocating for respect of our nation's flag and the Pledge of Allegiance and remains one of the most active members of the Big Lake and Buffalo American Legion Auxiliaries.
As she marks her 105th birthday, let us celebrate Stella and her incredible life.
We hope that her activism and strength will inspire generations of Minnesotans yet to come. ____________________
