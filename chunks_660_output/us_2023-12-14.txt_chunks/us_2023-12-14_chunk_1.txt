Mr. Speaker, the American people extend congratulations to the Honorable Javier Milei on being sworn in as the President of Argentina on Sunday, December 10, 2023.
His success as a member of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, as well as a macroeconomics professor, author, and radio host, demonstrates his ability to be a great versatile leader.
Best wishes to President Javier Milei for continued success to address Argentina's economic crisis alleviating poverty, creating jobs, and promoting prosperity.
Historically Argentina with its enterprising citizens and natural resources has been recognized for extraordinary capabilities.
I still cherish, as a teenager, in Charleston, South Carolina, meeting Argentine President Arturo Frondizi when he arrived at the Fort Sumter Hotel on the historic Charleston Battery at White Point Garden.
The inauguration of President Milei featured an overwhelming amount of support for him, as thousands of people from across the country and foreign dignitaries from around the world, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, gathered in downtown Buenos Aires on Sunday.
I am grateful for the commitment of President Milei to strengthen relations with the United States, support Ukraine in response to war criminal Putin's murderous invasion, and diversify trade away from China, currently their second-largest trade nation.
Free nations must work together as our adversaries threaten national security and sovereignty.
President Zelensky wrote this week that ``Freedom is what unites us, Ukraine and Argentina.
We truly cherish it, protect it, and stand ready to strengthen it together.''
I look forward to working with President Milei on achieving Peace Through Strength, in the war we did not choose between Dictators with Rule of Gun against Democracies with Rule of Law. ____________________
