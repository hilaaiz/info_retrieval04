Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mary Louise Orta as her family gathers to remember her life and the many people she touched along the way.
Mary Louise Orta was the matriarch of the Orta Family.
She was born in New Braunfels, Texas on November 13, 1931.
She met and married Albert Orta in 1949 and began their life together in Texas before moving to California in 1973.
Mrs. Orta was a military spouse who exemplified the virtues of family, commitment, and service.
She supported her husband Albert's career as he served our nation in the United States Air Force, then as an employee of the Department of Defense while traveling to several countries until his retirement in 1980.
During this time, Mary remained home and continued her own life of service by supporting his career and raising their 12 children.
In 1981, at age 50, as her youngest child entered kindergarten, Mrs. Orta joined the workforce volunteering at the local school.
Soon thereafter, she was hired by the Elk Grove Unified School District as a full-time employee at Valley High School in Sacramento County where she remained until her retirement in 2001.
She was a tireless contributor to her school community, always first to volunteer and never wavered when asked to help.
Throughout her twenty-year career, Mrs. Orta received several recognitions and was honored by the California State Senate and at districtwide ceremonies for her many contributions to staff, school administration, and students at Valley High School.
Mary Orta was a remarkable woman.
She was a loving and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother.
She enjoyed the simple pleasures of life, finding joy in the company of family and close friends.
She proudly walked with school administration at high school graduations, supported her children and grandchildren at events and family gatherings.
Her unwavering love for those she cared for was her driving force and her faith, kindness and compassion will undoubtedly be a continuing source of strength for her family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mary Louise Orta as her family gathers to honor her incredible life and legacy. ____________________
