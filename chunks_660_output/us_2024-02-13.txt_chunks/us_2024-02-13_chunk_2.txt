Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable public servant who dedicated his life to law enforcement, Sheriff Richard Berdnik.
Sheriff Berdnik served twenty-eight years with the Clifton Police Department.
After his time with the City of Clifton, he joined the County of Passaic as the Commander of the Juvenile Division and the SWAT Team.
On January 1, 2011, Richard was elected to the role of Passaic County Sheriff.
A prominent leader among law enforcement, Sheriff Berdnik was also a member of the FBI National Academy Associates, the New Jersey Honor Legion of Decorated Officers, and the International Chiefs of Police Association.
A native of Clifton, New Jersey, Richard Berdnik graduated from Clifton High School, the New Jersey State Police Academy, FBI National Academy, and FBI National Executive Institute.
Sheriff Berdnik took criminal justice courses at Seton Hall University, the University of Virginia, and Caldwell College.
Sheriff Berdnik's legacy embodies the principle of service over self.
His impact is woven into the fabric of the Ninth Congressional District, exemplified by the officers he mentored, and the countless individuals he helped.
Beyond his professional achievements, Sheriff Berdnik was a beloved figure in our community.
He was a Parishioner and Eucharistic Minister at Saint Andrew's Church in Clifton, New Jersey.
As a proud member of the Polish community, Sheriff Berdnik served as the Marshal for the Passaic-Clifton & Vicinity Contingent in the Pulaski Day Parade in 2011 and was the Grand Marshal of the Pulaski Day Parade in New York City in 2014.
Known for his unwavering commitment to justice and the well-being of the public, Sheriff Berdnik served as a beacon of bravery and compassion.
Under his leadership, Richard emphasized the importance of community engagement and proactive policing in order to build trust with the residents of Passaic County.
His innovative approach undertook a complete top to bottom review of the department effectively streamlining operations within the Patrol, Corrections and Courthouse Divisions.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and the residents of New Jersey in recognizing Sheriff Richard Berdnik for his outstanding contributions to law enforcement and beyond.
I thank Sheriff Berdnik.
He was a mentor, a friend, and a pillar in our community.
God bless his soul and may his wife Monica, and four children Ashley, Ryan, Alyssa, and Kevin stand proud. ____________________
