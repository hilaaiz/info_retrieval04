BILL PASCRELL, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize an esteemed and invaluable member of New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District, Mr. Huseyin Bayram.
His contributions to our community distinguish him as a prominent figure, serving as the proud owner of Toro's Restaurant and the New Corral.
Today I join the City of Paterson as they honor his contributions by awarding him with the Key to the City.
Huseyin is an outstanding community leader, philanthropist, and entrepreneur who continuously demonstrates an unwavering commitment to make a positive impact extending beyond the State of New Jersey.
For over three decades, Huseyin Bayram has been active in the City of Paterson.
His entrepreneurial spirit is embodied in the success of the New Corral in Clifton and the Toro's Restaurants, located in Paterson, Clifton, and Montclair.
The Toro's Restaurant of Paterson is an iconic dining establishment that opened its doors in 1972.
Mr. Bayram's compassionate philanthropy created numerous local initiatives, including his donation of over 10,000 meals to community members during the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Huseyin wanted to show his appreciation for frontline healthcare workers by providing free meals to doctors and nurses at three hospitals in New York.
Huseyin played a critical role in spearheading and organizing relief efforts for the earthquake of Turkey in 2023.
Huseyin's efforts have not only enhanced our community's well-being but also fostered a spirit of unity and cooperation among its members.
Mr. Bayram led 150,000 members as the President of the Turkish American Giresun Organization, representing the largest Turkish population in the United States.
In 2017, the City of Paterson appointed Huseyin as Deputy Mayor under Mayor Jane Williams-Warren establishing his role in local governance.
Furthermore, he holds the position of Vice-President with the Turkish-American Federation of New York and the Paterson Mevlana Mosque, showcasing how the Turkish community places their trust in his leadership.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, friends, family, and the residents of the City of Paterson in recognizing Mr. Bayram.
I take this opportunity to honor the great work Huseyin Bayram has accomplished.
May his work continue to be a guiding light in our community and inspire others to strive for excellence in service. ____________________
