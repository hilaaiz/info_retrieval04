Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to The Lighthouse Community Hospice, and its founder Jocelyn Campbell as they host their Annual ``Covered in Love'' Gala.
Ms. Campbell has devoted over 20 years to end-of-life care, working as an advocate for the preservation of dignity and compassion for those approaching the end of their lives.
In her role as the Chief Executive Officer of The Lighthouse Community Hospice, Ms. Campbell serves as a pioneer in advocating for quality end-of-life care.
She oversees a dedicated and hardworking group of healthcare professionals and takes part in strategic partnership and planning in order to ensure that their programs reach their maximum potential.
In 2023, the Lighthouse Community Hospice served as a signature community resource at the 52nd Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Caucus in our nation's capital.
In addition to her role as CEO of the Lighthouse Community Hospice, Campbell simultaneously serves as the CEO of Health Comply AI.
Through her work at Health Comply AI, she is able to balance her expertise in cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies with her passion for high standard health care delivery, in developing AI- driven solutions for administering healthcare services and organizations.
The Lighthouse Community Hospice helps to alleviate the difficult, emotional experience that is caring for a loved one who is near death.
They adopt a dedicated and compassionate approach to the work that they do, helping each family to develop a plan that centers around preserving the dignity and wishes of the individual approaching eternal rest.
I am humbled to acknowledge The Lighthouse Community Hospice and Ms. Jocelyn Campbell in their global caregiver advocacy movement for end- of-life initiatives.
The tireless, dedicated, and consistent work that they do continue to profoundly impact the ways in which end-of-life care is approached and administered both within our community and beyond. ____________________
