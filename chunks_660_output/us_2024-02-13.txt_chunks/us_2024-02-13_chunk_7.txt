KAREN KING ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Karen King for her dedicated service to the California public transit industry and to congratulate her on her well-earned retirement from the Golden Empire Transit District.
Ms. King's career in public transit began in 1976 at the Utah Transit Authority.
Ten years later, Ms. King joined Long Beach Transit as a Grants Administrator.
She quickly moved up the leadership ranks, and in 1995 was named Executive Director of Transportation.
In 1998, Ms. King worked for the North San Diego County Transit Development as the Director of Development and Communications Services and was selected as the agency's Executive Director in 2001.
In 2008, Ms. King moved to Bakersfield where she became the Chief Executive Officer of the Golden Empire Transit District.
During her tenure as CEO, Ms. King has been steadfast in her commitment to meeting the transportation needs of all Bakersfield residents.
She helped develop and implement the On-Demand Microtransit service program, which was first piloted in southwest Bakersfield and has since expanded across the city.
The program increases transportation access for all residents by offering low-cost transportation to residents traveling to popular destinations in the city.
Ms. King has directed other initiatives including a partnership with Kern Health Systems to provide rides to appointments for the more than 300,000 members of Kern Family Health Care.
Ms. King is also coordinating the Long Range Operational Service Analysis, which aims to improve local transportation and return ridership to pre-pandemic levels.
Ms. King has been recognized at the local, state, and national levels for her leadership in the public transit industry.
She is the Vice Chair of the California Transit Association (CTA) and in 2021, was selected for a two-year term as Chair.
Ms. King has also served as Chair of the CTA's COVID-19 Relief Task Force, where she has helped California's public transit industry recover from the pandemic.
In 2018, Ms. King received a Distinguished Service Award from the CTA, to celebrate her distinguished career and outstanding contributions.
This year, Ms. King is receiving the CTA's award for Innovation and Resiliency, to celebrate her commitment to the innovation of the industry and well-being of all Bakersfield commuters.
Ms. King's many accomplishments are a true testament to her character and leadership.
I'm confident that her service to the Golden Empire Transit District and her passion for improving public transit for all residents of our community will have a lasting impact for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Ms. King for her more than 40 years of dedicated service to the public transit industry and wishing her a happy and well-deserved retirement. ____________________
