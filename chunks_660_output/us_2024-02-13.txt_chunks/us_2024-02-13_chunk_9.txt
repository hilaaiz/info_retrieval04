TRIBUTE TO THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THE SUMGAIT POGROM; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-13 Volume: 170, Issue: 28 Pages: E141 - E142 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E141-E142] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THE SUMGAIT POGROM ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. SCHIFF.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the pogrom against the Armenian residents of Sumgait, Azerbaijan.
From February 27 to 29, 1988, Azerbaijani mobs assaulted and killed Armenians, leaving dozens of Armenian civilians dead and hundreds injured.
Women and girls were raped, and some victims were burned alive after being tortured and beaten.
Those who survived the carnage fled their homes and businesses, leaving behind all but the clothes on their backs.
In a pattern all too familiar to the Armenian people, the Azerbaijani authorities made little effort to punish those responsible, instead attempting to cover up the atrocities in Sumgait to this day, as well as denying the role of senior government officials in instigating the violence.
In the years that followed this unspeakable massacre, Armenians living in Kirovabad, Baku, and Maragha suffered a similar fate.
These pogroms were part of a pattern of hateful, racist anti-Armenian propaganda and activities occurring throughout Azerbaijan, dehumanizing its Armenian residents, and laying the groundwork for decades of aggression and mass violence.
This brutality culminated when the Azerbaijani government initiated war against the people of Nagorno- Karabakh, also known as Artsakh.
Beginning on September 27, 2020, and over 44 days, Azerbaijani forces invaded and murdered innocent Armenians in Artsakh and displaced tens of thousands more.
They continued to terrorize the people of Artsakh in subsequent military attacks, and by blocking the Lachin Corridor--which left 120,000 people without access to food, water, medical supplies and services, gas, and electricity for over 9 months.
On September 19, 2023, the Aliyev regime took full advantage of a people they had systematically starved, and launched a large-scale attack, further escalating their ethnic cleansing and genocidal campaign against the indigenous Armenian people of Artsakh.
At least 200 people were killed, 400 wounded, over 100,000 ethnic Armenians were forcibly displaced, and Azerbaijan now holds Artsakh's political and military leadership, civilians, and prisoners of war hostage.
With no help from the international community to confront Azerbaijan's military aggression, Artsakh was forced to negotiate under duress and consequently agreed to dissolve their democratically elected government.
There is also real and growing concern that Aliyev has his eyes set on land beyond Artsakh and will continue to seek further territory and concessions from Armenia by force.
To this day, Azerbaijani forces remain present on sovereign Armenian land, in violation of Armenia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and last month, President Aliyev made alarming remarks, including his refusal to remove troops from Armenian territory.
These are the horrific consequences when aggression and hatred grow unchecked and when Aliyev's hostility is met with deafening silence, emboldening him to continue, and expand, his unprovoked attacks on the Armenian people, knowing there will be no repercussions.
Azerbaijan's campaign of death and destruction against Armenians have been nothing short of deplorable, including the destruction of religious and cultural sites in Artsakh to erase or falsify history, and the torture, mutilation and killing of Armenian civilians, prisoners of war and soldiers.
This February also marks 20 years of a horrific crime when Ramil Safarov, an Azerbaijani army captain savagely murdered an Armenian army lieutenant, Gurgen Margaryan with an axe while he slept.
The two were participating in a NATO Partnership for Peace exercise at the time in Hungary.
In 2012, Safarov was sent home to Azerbaijan, purportedly to serve out the remainder of his sentence.
Instead, he was pardoned, promoted, and paraded through the streets of Baku as a returning hero.
