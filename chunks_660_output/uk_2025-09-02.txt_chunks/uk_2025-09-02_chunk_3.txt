HONORING WYNNTON HILL BAPTIST CHURCH

HON.
SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Wynnton Hill Baptist

Church.
The Church celebrated its 164th Anniversary on August 24, 2025,

with a service at the church located at 2620 Buena Vista Road in

Columbus, Georgia.
Wynnton Hill Baptist Church, established in 1861, proudly stands as

the first church of any denomination in the Wynnton area of Columbus,

Georgia and the second oldest predominantly African American Church in

the Muscogee/Chattahoochee Valley Area.
Driven by a deep yearning to

create a fellowship for the glory of God through Jesus Christ, a small

group of dedicated believers came together under the guidance of

Reverend Phillip Owens.
They gathered at the home of Mr. and Mrs.

Willie and Sarah James to lay the foundation of this spiritual

community.
Reverend Owens, who became the first pastor, led the church during

its formative years.
The congregation demonstrated exceptional

commitment by building a bush arbor on land that the church purchased

from the James family, using fresh bushes from nearby woodlands for

their Saturday gatherings.
The church quickly grew, with many souls

coming to faith.
The church's first wooden structure served as a worship center, and

under Pastor Owens--who served an astounding 47 years--the church

flourished.
Wynnton Hill has become a testament to the mercy and grace

of Jesus Christ, having faced various trials yet overcoming them

through faith.
Throughout its 164 years, Wynnton Hill has maintained a legacy of

resilience, even amidst challenges and disagreements.
The church has

birthed three other assemblies--Greater Peace, New Mt. Zion, and

Blessed Assurance Baptist Churches--emphasizing the unifying power of

the gospel.
