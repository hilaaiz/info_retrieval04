REMEMBERING JIMI JAMISON

HON.
STEVE COHEN

Mr. COHEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Memphis and

national rock 'n' roll legend Jimi Jamison as we approach the 10th

anniversary of his death in 2014.
Mr. Jamison is best known as the

frontman of the band Survivor and for hits that placed him at the top

of the music charts in collaboration with other artists.
He co-wrote

``I'm Always Here,'' the theme song for the television series

``Baywatch,'' and performed ``Burning Heart'' with Survivor for the

film ``Rocky IV,'' but is best known in Memphis for his performances of

``Eye of the Tiger'' at University of Memphis Tigers sporting events.
Born in Durant, Mississippi, he moved as an infant to Memphis and

considered our city his home.
In 2022, a stretch of Highland Street

between Central and Southern avenues was named Jimi Jamison Street.
Acclaimed for his rich vocal skills, Jimi Jamison will be long

remembered for his contributions to American music.
I join his many

fans and friends in remembering him as we near the September 1 tenth

anniversary of his passing.

REMEMBERING MUSIC LEGEND JUAN JOSE ``JOHNNY'' CANALES

HON.
HENRY CUELLAR

Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to the legacy of the

legendary Juan Jose ``Johnny'' Canales, who passed away on June 12,

2024.
Johnny was a cultural icon whose influence on the Latino

community, particularly in South Texas, is uncontested.
Beyond Johnny's

beloved music and television host careers, he was a beacon of hope and

inspiration for countless aspiring Hispanics and Latinos.
Canales was born in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and raised in Robstown,

Texas.
He's best remembered today for his groundbreaking bilingual

variety show, The `Johnny Canales Show.'
This show began in 1983 in

Corpus Christi and provided an unprecedented stage for Tejano and

Latino artists when such opportunities were scarce.
It became a vital

part of the cultural fabric of South Texas and beyond, showcasing

emerging talents and giving them a chance to shine.
Johnny's enthusiastic support of young artists helped launch numerous

careers, fostering a sense of pride and accomplishment within the

Latino community.
His catchphrase, ``You got it!
Take it away!''
symbolized encouragement and empowerment.
His show was more than

entertainment; it celebrated Latino culture and identity.
Beyond his contributions to music, Johnny served in the Army and was

an avid supporter of civil rights and veterans' issues.
During his

three years of active-duty service, he formed the foundation of his

advocacy for the troops and veterans, a dedication that made him a

cherished community figure.
Despite facing health challenges later in life, Johnny continued

influencing and uplifting his community.
