My district has one of the largest Ethiopian populations in the State

of Colorado, a characteristic that I consider among our strengths.
I

have had the privilege of attending the Taste of Ethiopia several times

over the last ten years, and I know firsthand how meaningful this event

is to our community.
It is an honor to be included in this celebration.
I recognize the leadership of the Taste of Ethiopia's organizers, the

contributions of Ethiopian individuals, families, and organizations,

and the support of volunteers and our community who make this one of

the district's popular annual events.

RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE OF MR.
FARRIS ``CARLOS'' HILL ON

THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE

HON.
JEFF DUNCAN

Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable

career and dedicated service of Mr. Farris ``Carlos'' Hill, a pillar of

our Ninety Six, South Carolina community, as he retires from the

Department of the Air Force.
Carlos' journey is a testament to dedication, perseverance, and

commendable service to our Nation both in uniform and as a civilian

leader.
Born in 1964 to a working-class family in Greenwood, South

Carolina, he learned the values of hard work and determination from a

young age.
Notably, he attended the first integrated first grade class

in our state, an experience that undoubtedly shaped his character and

resilience.
Following his graduation from Ninety Six High School in 1982, Carlos,

fueled by his work ethic, secured an Air Force ROTC scholarship to

Clemson University.
This marked the start of his lifelong dedication to

our Nation.
Earning a degree in Civil Engineering in 1986, he embarked

on a distinguished military career.
His assignments spanned Chanute

AFB, Mather AFB, and Dyess AFB, where he excelled as an aircraft

maintenance officer.
He further served as an Assistant Professor of

Aerospace Studies at Rutgers and Princeton Universities, inspiring

future Air Force leaders.
Transitioning to the Air Force Reserve after nine years of active

duty service, Carlos balanced his military responsibilities with a

successful civilian career at General Electric.
His unwavering

commitment extended to deployments in support of Operations Enduring

Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.
During his second mobilization, he sought

opportunities to further his military career through the Air Force

Legislative Fellowship Program.
This prestigious program allowed Carlos

to work closely with congressional members and staff, providing him

with invaluable legislative experience and insights that would shape

his future career in legislative affairs.
In 2013, Carlos assumed the crucial role of Mobilization Assistant to

the Director of Legislative Liaison at the Pentagon, while concurrently

serving as the Director of Air Force Reserve Policy Integration in a

civilian capacity.
He became a vital bridge between the Air Force and

Congress, securing vital resources and advocating for both the active

force and Reserves.
His promotion to Brigadier General in 2015 was a

fitting culmination of his outstanding military career.
Retiring from the Reserve in 2019, Carlos remained dedicated to his

civilian role, shaping policies as Director of Air Force Reserve Policy

Integration at the Pentagon.
Here, he continued to serve with

distinction, shaping policies that directly impacted the lives and

careers of thousands of Air Force Reservists.
Carlos' civilian tenure

was marked by his unwavering commitment to improving the operational

readiness and quality of life for Airmen.
He was instrumental in

identifying and resolving issues affecting the Air Force Reserve,

developing legislative strategies, and coordinating with Congress on

significant policy matters.
His efforts included formulating Air Force

Reserve strategic goals, managing policy initiatives, and maintaining

liaison with Congressional Defense Committee Chairs and a wide range of

other members of Congress.
He also ensured that Air Force senior

leaders were fully prepared for Congressional testimonies and

engagements, significantly contributing to the successful navigation of

complex legislative landscapes.
