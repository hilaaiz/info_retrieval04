Beyond his contributions to music, Johnny served in the Army and was

an avid supporter of civil rights and veterans' issues.
During his

three years of active-duty service, he formed the foundation of his

advocacy for the troops and veterans, a dedication that made him a

cherished community figure.
Despite facing health challenges later in life, Johnny continued

influencing and uplifting his community.
Alongside his wife, Nora, he

returned to television with ``El Show de Johnny y Nora Canales,''

ensuring that the voices of Latino artists remained heard and

celebrated.
Johnny is survived by his two daughters, Nora Seleste Canales and

Miroslava Canales.
Mr. Speaker, let us honor and celebrate the life of Johnny Canales, a

man who truly embodied the spirit of the Latino community and a pioneer

who paved the way for future generations of artists.
