It was right and fitting that he was

presented with the French Legion of Honor medal for his efforts.
He

also was one of only 75 American military members to be invited to

have dinner with the Queen of England in commemoration of D-Day's 50th

anniversary.
Jack Hamlin continued to live his life fully, even jumping out of an

airplane at age 95, and serving his state and fellow man.
He was loved

by all who knew him, and this true American hero will be greatly

missed.

PROCLAMATION IN HONOR OF THE 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STAR DEMOCRAT

HON.
ANDY HARRIS

Mr. HARRIS.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following

Proclamation in honor of the 225th anniversary of the Star Democrat

newspaper published in Easton, Maryland.
Whereas, the Star Democrat newspaper was first rolled off

the press in 1799 when The Honorable John Adams was the

sitting President of the United States and The Honorable

George Washington was still alive and living

his final year on his plantation at Mount Vernon; and

Whereas, the Star Democrat--originally the Republican

Star--was a staunch supporter of Jeffersonian democracy and

the ideas of The Honorable Thomas Jefferson; and

Whereas, the newspaper's original philosophy of individual

liberty, local autonomy and limited central government

continues to this day; and

Whereas, the Star Democrat has seen the Nation survive and

live through numerous wars and conflicts with its offices

twice destroyed in fires and once wrecked by a mob of

vandals, while one of its editors arrested and exiled by

Federal troops during the Civil War; and

Whereas, on August 21, 2024, the Star Democrat will

celebrate its 225th anniversary of publication.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andy Harris, Member of Congress, do

hereby proclaim and celebrate The Star Democrat for its role

and service to the Maryland community and our country on its

225th anniversary.

RECOGNIZING MICHELLE REIMERS ON HER RETIREMENT AS THE TURLOCK

IRRIGATION DISTRICT GENERAL MANAGER

HON.
JOHN S. DUARTE

Mr. DUARTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michelle Reimers, who

recently retired as General Manager of the Turlock Irrigation District

(TID).
TID was founded in 1887, making it the oldest irrigation district in

California.
Today, TID provides water from Don Pedro Reservoir to over

150,000 acres of farmland in Stanislaus and Merced counties through 250

miles of canals.
It is one of only four irrigation districts in

California that provide retail electricity to homes, farms, and

businesses in its service territory.
Michelle was with TID for 18 years, starting with its public

information operation, but through hard work and dedication to the

District, she assumed various other leadership positions, culminating

in becoming the first female General Manager in 2020.
During her time

leading the agency, she focused on transparency, collaboration, and

commitment to its customers, but always prioritized ensuring that TID

had water supplies to serve its communities, such as through creating

new water rights for the District to capture flood flows on the

Tuolumne River.
