His slogan, ``Doing whatever needs to be done, wherever

it is needed''.
This is how his business has remained successful.
He is motivated to make positive impacts on his community by helping

people in the community.
He loves to cook and take meals to the elderly

people in the area as a part of simply giving back to his hometown of

Cleveland.
This also keeps him active and gives him an opportunity to

stay connected with the community.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jimmy

Williams for his dedication and initiative in continuing to offer his

services to the community, surrounding areas and the MS Delta.
His

collective contributions are truly inspiring and reflect the best of

our shared values as citizens and neighbors.

HONORING MARSHALL'S MUSIC AND BOOK STORE

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

oldest Black-owned bookstore in the Nation, Marshall's Music and Book

Store.
Jackson, Mississippi, is home to the oldest Black-owned bookstore in

North America.
Marshall's Music and Book Store in the heart of downtown

Jackson is a family business that opened in 1938.
The quaint store on the almost empty Farish Street has shelves

stacked high with books, music, and everything in between.
The walls

are also plastered with photos of unsung African American heroes with

roots in Mississippi.
Pastor Louis Wilcher of the Greater Pearlie Grove Missionary Baptist

Church first opened the store 85 years ago on the corner of Farish and

Oakley streets.
Now, Primm is the third-generation owner of the store.
She believes in teaching people about the past, saying that Black

history didn't begin with slavery.
Her newfound hope now lies in opening a school.
Primm believes that

the way to stop the surge of violent youth crime is to teach children

about hope.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Marshall's

Music and Book Store for its longevity and dedication to serving the

community.
