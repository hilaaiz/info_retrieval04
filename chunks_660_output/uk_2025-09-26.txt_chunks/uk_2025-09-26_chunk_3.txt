HONORING MATT AND MORGAN YEAKLEY

HON.
CHUCK EDWARDS

Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matt Yeakley, and

his wife Morgan, for their extraordinary service and leadership during

the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Marshall, North Carolina.
When Hurricane Helene struck, downtown Marshall was left heavily

damaged, with streets blocked, buildings impacted, and the community in

urgent need of coordination and support.
From the very first morning

after the storm, Matt and Morgan stepped forward without hesitation to

organize and lead the town's volunteer cleanup efforts.
Matt focused on

heavy equipment and debris cleanup, while Morgan coordinated volunteers

and addressed medical needs.
Drawing on their leadership skills and deep knowledge of the

community, Matt and Morgan quickly established a volunteer coordination

hub in front of the courthouse.
They identified critical areas needing

attention, organized volunteers into specialized teams, and ensured

every person, local or visiting, had a meaningful role to play in the

recovery.
Their calm demeanor and logistical efficiency transformed a chaotic

and uncertain situation into a coordinated, effective response.
The

safety and productivity of every cleanup crew were always a priority.
Volunteers from across the region praised Matt and his wife for their

clarity, professionalism, and kindness.
Thanks to their tireless efforts, downtown Marshall was cleared and

stabilized within days, allowing businesses owners and residents to

access their properties and begin their own recovery efforts.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our

appreciation to Matt and Morgan Yeakley as their dedication, humility,

and leadership during this time of crisis exemplify the very best of

community service.
