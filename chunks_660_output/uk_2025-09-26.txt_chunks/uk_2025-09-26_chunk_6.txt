HONORING MS.
HATTIE WHITE ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

Ms. VELAZQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt

birthday wishes to Ms. Hattie White as she celebrates her remarkable

100th birthday.
Born in 1925, she lived in the vibrant Bedford

Stuyvesant community in Brooklyn, New York.
A community known for its

rich African American heritage, social activism, and brownstone homes

that reflected the pride of homeownership among neighbors.
In fact, at

a time when homeownership was not easily attainable, Ms. White owned a

home where she provided her seven children with a stable and nurturing

environment.
Ms. Hattie lived a life characterized by hard work, resilience,

adaptability, and faith.
Her life spanned historical events in our

society, from the Great Depression, World War II, to the Civil Rights

Movement, the cultural shifts of the 1960's and 70's and the

advancements in technology.
These events shaped her experiences and

perspectives, further strengthening her resolve.
In addition to her family, Ms. Hattie has been and remains a devoted

member of the Zion Shiloh Baptist Church.
Her unwavering faith and

commitment to the church community have made her a beloved figure among

her fellow congregants.
She is a respected elder of the church who is

renowned for her years of leadership roles, community service, and

guiding her congregation.
Her compassion and generosity have touched

the lives of many in Brooklyn, making her a true beacon of hope and

inspiration.
Ms. Hattie White exemplifies a remarkable legacy of longevity,

resilience and a proud spirit of service.
She is cherished by her

family and friends, who are deeply grateful for her unconditional love

and friendship.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Ms. Hattie White, one of

our Nation's Centenarians, on this special occasion of her 100th year

birthday.

HONORING PHILLIP ARROYO AS A DISTINGUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL FLORIDA

FOR HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

HON.
DARREN SOTO

Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, Phillip Arroyo is a distinguished attorney,

advocate, and proud Puerto Rican whose life reflects a lifelong

dedication to justice.
Born in 1982 on a United States military base in

Germany to a Puerto Rican father who served in the Armed Forces, he was

raised with the values of resilience, service, and courage.
From 2009

to 2012, Mr. Arroyo served as special assistant to the Puerto Rico

Secretary of State, Kenneth McClintock, and in the Puerto Rico Senate.
He later addressed the international community, twice testifying before

the United Nations in New York City on the island's unequal political

status within the United States.
In 2012, he was selected from

thousands of applicants nationwide to serve as a White House intern

under President Barack Obama's administration, where he worked in the

office of then-Vice President Joe Biden, analyzing domestic policy.
Following his graduation from Florida A&M University College of Law,

Mr. Arroyo chose to serve as a public defender, representing the poor

and ensuring the constitutional rights of the most vulnerable were

protected.
In 2022, he transitioned into private practice, co-founding

the Arroyo Law Firm in Orlando, Florida, with his wife and law partner,

Josephine Arroyo.
Under their leadership, the firm has become one of

Central Florida's most respected criminal defense and immigration

practices, recognized for zealous advocacy, service to underserved

communities, and its particular commitment to assisting the Hispanic

community.
In addition, Mr. Arroyo is a frequent commentator in both national

and local media on issues of criminal justice, immigration, and civil

rights.
While many in the legal community have remained silent, he has

consistently spoken up in defense of our Constitution and immigrant

communities during these dark times.
