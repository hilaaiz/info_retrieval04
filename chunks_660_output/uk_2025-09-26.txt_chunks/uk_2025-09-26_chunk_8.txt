Founded in 1975, the Wood County Committee on Aging was established

to provide comprehensive services to the county's seniors.
These

services have grown over the decades to include programs for home-

delivered meals, medical transportation, health and wellness

initiatives, caregiver support, and much more.
With senior centers

across the county, the Committee has been able to help elderly adults

and their families navigate the challenges that can arise while aging.
Mr. Speaker, by celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Wood

County Committee on Aging, the county can recognize the outstanding

achievements of the staff and pride the patrons have for their senior

centers.
I congratulate the Committee on Aging on this momentous

milestone.
I thank them for all they do for our county's seniors.
