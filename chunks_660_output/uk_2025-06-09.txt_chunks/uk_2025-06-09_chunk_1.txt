HONORING CHRISTIAN LOWE OF DYETT HIGH SCHOOL

HON.
JONATHAN L. JACKSON

Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and

celebrate an extraordinary achievement by a remarkable young man from

my district, Christian Lowe, a vital member of the Walter H. Dyett High

School for the Arts boys' basketball team, the Eagles.
This team

achieved a historic victory, winning the 2024-2025 Illinois High School

Association (IHSA) Class 2A State Championship with a decisive 52-41

win over Althoff Catholic High School on March 15, 2025.
This championship is more than just a win on the court; it is a

profound testament to the resilience, determination, and unity of the

Dyett High School community and the vibrant Bronzeville neighborhood.
A

decade ago, Dyett faced the threat of closure, but through powerful

community advocacy and unwavering commitment, its doors remained open.
Today, the Eagles' triumph, in which Christian Lowe played a crucial

role, symbolizes the incredible potential that flourishes when a

community invests in its youth and its institutions.
Christian Lowe, along with his teammates, demonstrated exceptional

skill, discipline, and teamwork throughout their season, navigating

challenges and competing at the highest level.
His hard work and

dedication were integral to the team's success, culminating in this

well-deserved championship that brings immense pride and joy to his

school, family, and the entire community.
I also extend my deepest gratitude to Head Coach Jamaal Gill, whose

visionary leadership and guidance steered the team to this historic

victory, and to Assistant Coaches Kimani Harris, Pierre Adams, and

Nathan Townsen, Jr., whose mentorship was vital to the players'

development.
Christian Lowe's contribution to the Dyett Eagles' journey from near

closure to state champions is an inspiring narrative for us all.
It

underscores the critical importance of supporting our public schools

and investing in programs that empower young people to achieve their

fullest potential.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating

Christian Lowe and the entire Dyett High School boys' basketball team

on their momentous achievement and in honoring them for the inspiration

they provide to communities across our Nation.
