Assistant Coach Darrell Bullock, alongside Head Coach Jamaal Gill,

II, provided invaluable leadership, strategic insight, and unwavering

support throughout the season.
His dedication to developing these young

athletes, both on and off the court, was instrumental in fostering the

skill, discipline, and teamwork that led to this historic victory.
His

hard work and commitment were integral to the team's success,

culminating in this well-deserved championship that brings immense

pride and joy to the school, the players, their families, and the

entire community.
Mr. Speaker, Darrell Bullock's contribution to the Dyett Eagles'

HONORING JIM IRSAY

HON.
ANDRE CARSON

Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life and legacy of

James Stephen Irsay, a philanthropist and beloved member of the

Indianapolis community.
Jim Irsay's remarkable 54-year affiliation with the Colts

organization began in Baltimore and blossomed in Indianapolis, where he

became a pillar of the community and a leader in the National Football

League.
As owner and CEO of the Indianapolis Colts, Jim oversaw 10

division titles and two AFC Championships--and, of course, a Colts'

victory in the Super Bowl XLI on February 4, 2007, marking one of the

most successful eras in franchise history.
Jim's impact extended far beyond the football field as a passionate

philanthropist and

pillar in the Indianapolis community.
He supported the Irsay Family

YMCA, Peyton Manning Children's Hospital, the Indiana Black Expo,

Wheeler Mission Center for Women & Children, and Gleaners Food Bank.
He

was also a dedicated advocate for mental health, courageously sharing

his own journey to break the stigma surrounding addiction and mental

illness.
Through the Irsay family's generous support of Kicking the

Stigma, they invested over $31 million to improve mental health

awareness, research, and treatment across Indiana and the nation.
Jim was also a cultural icon, cultivating one of the world's greatest

music and historical collections, sharing it generously as a

``traveling museum'' to inspire and educate.
Whether on stage with his

band or quietly supporting those in need, Jim's generosity and spirit

touched countless lives.
Above all, Jim cherished his family--his wife Margaret, his three

daughters, and ten grandchildren, whom he loved deeply and supported

unconditionally.
His devotion to family, football, and community

defined his life and will leave a legacy in Indianapolis and beyond.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jim Irsay--a man whose

passion, leadership, and kindness made a profound difference in the

lives of Hoosiers and NFL fans everywhere.
May his memory inspire us

all to serve with the same dedication and heart.
