In 2020, Dr. Dargan received the Dean's

Distinguished Service Award as a Friend of the University of South

Carolina School of Medicine.
In a final act of service, Dr. Dargan donated his body to the

Department of Anatomy at Howard University College of Medicine, to aid

in the training of future medical professionals.
Throughout his career, he trained fellow surgeons, presenting

research findings, and delivering papers at medical conferences in

Africa and throughout the United States, often at meetings of the

American College of Surgeons, where he became a Fellow, and for the

National Medical Association.
He was a lifelong devoted member of Zion

Baptist Church, where he served as a trustee.
Dr. Dargan was renowned for his knowledgeable, professional, and kind

relationships with his patients.
He was a practitioner who offered his

patients holistic and nutritional advice, a lot of which he learned

from his parents, both of whom grew up on rural farms, and particularly

from his dietician mother.
The Dargans have two daughters, Jennifer Dargan and Catherine Dargan

Phelps; a son-in-law, Peter Phelps; and three grandchildren: Addison

Dargan Phelps, Morgan Dargan Phelps, and Landon Dargan Phelps.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating

the life and legacy of an incredible man and servant.
Let us recognize

Dr. Dargan's commitment to service, sacrifices for, and contribution to

this great Nation.
