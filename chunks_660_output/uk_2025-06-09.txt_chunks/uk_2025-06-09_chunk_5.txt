Her enthusiasm is contagious, inspiring both staff

and fellow volunteers.
She has a unique ability to lift others up,

ensuring that every person who walks through our doors feels welcomed

and supported.
Her kindness is not just in her words but in her

actions--consistently stepping in wherever she is needed without

hesitation.
Without individuals like Teresa, the impact of the YMCA in

Hernando County would not be what it is today.
She represents the very

best of what it means to serve others.
It is clear Teresa Piechowicz has made a profoundly positive impact

on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
May we all strive

to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

RHODE ISLAND STATE POLICE CENTENARY

HON.
GABE AMO

Mr. AMO.
Mr. Speaker, with admiration and appreciation, I wish to

recognize the 100th anniversary of the Rhode Island State Police.
For a

century, these tireless men and women in uniform have traveled the

highways and byways of our state to ensure the safety of our

communities.
They have lived up to their creed of honor, integrity,

fairness, excellence, courage, honesty, and devotion to duty.
On April 2, 1925 the Rhode Island General Assembly created the

``Rhode Island Department of State Police.''
It was the first such

organization in our state dedicated to ensuring safety, order, and

security for Rhode Islanders.
What began with just 21 officers

patrolling on Indian-brand motorcycles has grown into a modern,

technologically advanced law enforcement agency committed to the

highest standards of public service.
From the earliest days of policing rural roads to the current use of

cutting-edge technology, the agency has continually evolved to meet the

challenges of each era while striving to maintain the trust and respect

of the public it serves.
Even their uniforms made an impression--most notably in 1986, when

their distinctive attire earned national recognition and was featured

on the David Letterman Show.
Over the course of the agency's esteemed 100 year history, the

dedicated men and women of the Rhode Island State Police have worked

tirelessly to ensure Rhode Islanders' safety.
And I know that for the

next one hundred years they will continue to serve justice, help

stranded motorists, and keep our communities safe.
As they mark their

centenary during national law enforcement week, I join every Rhode

Islander in thanking the Troopers of the Rhode Island State Police for

their 100 years of public service.
