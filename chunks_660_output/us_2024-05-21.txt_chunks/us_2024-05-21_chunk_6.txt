of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. KEAN of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my warmest congratulations to Fredon Township on its 120th anniversary.
I am truly grateful to be celebrating this monumental milestone with them.
Over the past 120 years, Fredon Township has flourished into a lively town with vibrant natural scenery and rich history.
As the youngest township in Sussex County, Fredon Township was formed from parts of Andover, Green, Hampton, and Stillwater Townships and is home to approximately 3,450 residents and 1,203 residential dwellings.
Once a dusty, rutted, narrow dirt road on Route 94, traveling through a busy little village in the 1800s, can now be found as the core of the township.
I am proud to have such a remarkable town within the 7th District, and I look forward to watching it continue to thrive in the coming decades.
I wish Fredon Township a wonderful 120th anniversary.
May its next 120 years be filled with as much success as this one. ____________________

of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join Hackensack Meridian Health in commemorating the 50th anniversary of Behavioral Health Services at Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Riverview Medical Center.
The hospitals' vision and commitment to supporting the well-being of Monmouth and Ocean County's communities is truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Since 1974, Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Riverview Medical Center have offered a range of inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services, including psychiatry, crisis and emergency services, hospitalization, consultation, and education.
Over the years, services have expanded to include addiction and children's programs.
Additionally, in 1979, Jersey Shore Medical Center began mobile services in Asbury Park under a grant from the State of New Jersey.
To better meet the needs of its clients, the program, coined Park Place, moved to a facility, first operating out of the local United Methodist Church, then to a home on Sewall Avenue, and later to a property on Bond Street.
The Park Place program continued to expand and adapt, integrating services and other programs until 2019 when it was merged with the Riverview Medical Center Behavioral Health Acute Partial Program.
For 50 years, Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Riverview Medical Center have been providing services, education, outreach, and support to individuals with mental health and substance abuse disorders Their efforts to improve the quality and availability of support services are important for the health and well-being of individuals and their families.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Riverview Medical Center for 50 years of providing comprehensive behavioral health services and thanking its staff and members for their extraordinary service to the community. ____________________
