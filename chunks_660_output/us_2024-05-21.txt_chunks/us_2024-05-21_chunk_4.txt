SHEILA JACKSON LEE OF TEXAS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, May 16, 2024 Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to ========================= END NOTE ========================= In 2004, Congress passed the Law Enforcement Officer Safety Act (LEOSA), permitting qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms and ammunition in certain places.
Every state allows the concealed carry of firearms subject to certain conditions, but the original LEOSA overrode whatever permit, training, or other requirements might be in place--with important, commonsense exceptions for National Parks, playgrounds, government buildings, private property, and other sensitive areas.
I should note that I was a member of the House Judiciary Committee when it passed the original LEOSA in 2004.
At that time, the Committee was under Republican control, but it still followed regular order.
We held a hearing on the bill in which we heard from several law enforcement organizations.
Some expressed support for the bill as a way for officers to protect themselves and be able to respond to a dangerous situation whether they were in their home jurisdiction or not, on-duty or off-duty, active or retired.
Other law enforcement organizations opposed the legislation, expressing concerns about creating confusion in the field that might even endanger law enforcement.
While some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle expressed concerns about the original LEOSA, I was satisfied that it struck an appropriate balance.
I supported the original LEOSA because it included limits for special places.
It had exceptions so that states would still have some control over whether retired and off-duty law enforcement officers would be allowed to carry concealed weapons in places like parks, playgrounds, Gun-Free School Zones, and state and local government buildings.
States should be allowed to regulate these places consistent with the needs of the state.
Allowing them to do so protects local law enforcement by making sure they know what to expect when responding to a scene.
The original LEOSA also respected the rights of private property owners to prohibit concealed weapons on their property if they chose to do so.
And with respect to retired officers, it ensured that they would continue to receive annual firearms training so that they would know how to safely use the concealed firearm that they were carrying.
The legislation before us today,

however, upsets the balance struck by the original LEOSA and it is being advanced without a hearing that would help us fully evaluate its strengths and weaknesses.
While I supported the original LEOSA, I oppose the legislation before us today because it would allow more concealed weapons in parks, playgrounds, Gun-Free School Zones, local government buildings, and on private property even when it is contrary to the judgment of state leaders and private property owners.
Today's bill also weakens the training standards for retired officers as set forth in the original LEOSA, which is especially concerning.
Marksmanship is a perishable skill that must be renewed through practice and training.
By relaxing the training standards, today's bill would allow retired officers to carry concealed firearms despite it being as many as three years since they last received training--and it could be that they retired from law enforcement more years before that.
I respect the rights of lawful and responsible gun owners, including the rights of retired and off-duty law enforcement.
We should allow these individuals to carry concealed weapons into many places, provided they meet certain qualifications including regular training.
But this bill would allow concealed weapons to be carried by those who have not received recent training.
And it would allow concealed firearms in spaces where a state may have a valid public safety interest in prohibiting them.
For these reasons, I must oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. ____________________
