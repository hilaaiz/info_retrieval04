Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Dev A. GnanaDev for his decades of service as a healthcare provider in the Inland Empire and to celebrate the naming of the Dr. Dev A. GnanaDev Trauma Center at the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.
Dr. GnanaDev started his over 40-year career serving the Inland Empire as a member of the medical staff at the San Bernardino County Medical Center, which eventually was renamed the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center.
At Arrowhead Regional, he played a key role in the development of the trauma center as the Founding Director of Trauma Services until being appointed as the Medical Director of the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in June 2000.
Under his 12-year leadership, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center took critical steps to expand its patient services and physician training programs.
Today, Dr. GnanaDev serves as the Associate Director of Medicine and the Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, a position he has held since 1989.
Dr GnanaDev has dedicated a lifetime to improving access to and the quality of health care in the Inland Empire.
As the Founding President of the California University of Science and Medicine and as a Clinical Professor of Surgery at Western University of Health Sciences and the California University of Science and Medicine, Dr. GnanaDev has taken tremendous steps in addressing the physician shortage impacting our communities.
This week, our community is coming together to celebrate Dr. GnanaDev's commitment to a healthy Inland Empire.
On Thursday, May 23rd, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center will officially be named the Dr. Dev A GnanaDev Trauma Center.
This honor will ensure that Dr. GnanaDev's profound impact on our community's health and wellbeing will be remembered for generations to come.
For his outstanding accomplishments, it is my honor to recognize Dev A. GnanaDev, M.D., M.B.A, F.A.C.S. His years of service and commitment to the people of the Inland Empire are worthy of the highest commendation. ____________________
