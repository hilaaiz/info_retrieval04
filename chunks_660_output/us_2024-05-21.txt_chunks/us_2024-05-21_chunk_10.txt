The Resolution claims that House members are responsible for exemplifying a respect for the rule of law and for law enforcement but overlooks hypocritical anti-police Republican actions: The failure of Republicans to unanimously vote to award the Congressional Gold Medal to all police officers who responded to the violent January 6th attack on the Capitol and efforts like H. Con.
Res.
106 to marginalize federal law enforcement officers.
Republican efforts to defund law enforcement, whether by opposing grant funding that supports state and local agencies, or by calling to abolish federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).
For these reasons I must oppose this fatally flawed resolution--and yet another missed opportunity to support and honor law enforcement personnel across the country and those who lost their lives in the line of duty, without engaging in partisanship on this solemn occasion. ____________________
