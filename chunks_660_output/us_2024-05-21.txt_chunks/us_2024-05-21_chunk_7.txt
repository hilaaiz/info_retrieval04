Since its founding on May 1, 1924--the first anniversary of the signing of the 1923 Border Convention between the United States and Mexico, the United States Border Patrol has been dedicated to defending the borders of our great Nation.
The members of the United States Border Patrol work day and night, hour upon hour, in harsh conditions and dangerous circumstances to ensure that terrorists, weapons, drugs and contraband do not make their way into the United States.
Today, I wish to shine a spotlight on one of the integral sectors within the United States Customs and Border Patrol--the Buffalo Sector.
Situated along the Northern border, the Buffalo Sector plays a pivotal role in securing our nation's perimeter Sprawling across vast landscapes, from the Great Lakes to the Appalachian Mountains, its agents stand as guardians of the gateway between the United States and Canada.
In the Buffalo Sector, CBP agents face unique challenges, navigating diverse terrain and weather conditions with unwavering determination.
From bustling urban centers to remote wilderness, they remain steadfast in their mission to uphold the rule of law and protect our communities Their tireless efforts have thwarted illicit activities, intercepted smugglers, and safeguarded our borders from potential threats.
But beyond their operational duties, the agents of the Buffalo Sector embody the swift of service and sacrifice They forge bonds with the communities they serve, building trust and collaboration to ensure the safety of all, Their commitment to excellence and their willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty exemplifies the finest traditions of the United States Customs and Border Patrol.
The United States Border Patrol embodies the highest standard of courage and dedication to duty, exemplified by serving in the most hazardous environment with professionalism, unmatched performance, and unwavering ethics.

I thank all agents of the United States Border Patrol, past and present, who bravely dedicated their efforts to guarding the borders of the United States and upholding the rule of law for the past 100 years. ____________________
