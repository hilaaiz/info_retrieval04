He also brought a new complex to the city to house its administrative offices, the police headquarters, community center, and the Children's Park.
One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of Niceville's first public library.
This led him to champion the first-ever cooperative effort in Okaloosa County by forming the Okaloosa County Library Cooperative, uniting 6 cities with the county, enabling them to increase the resources available to all the residents of our county.
I, along with all of Northwest Florida, thank Niceville City Manager Corbin for his dedication to public service and commitment to improving the quality of life in the city for all its residents and visitors.
His lifelong service exemplifies the very best of Northwest Florida.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am privileged to recognize City Manager Lannie Corbin on the occasion of his retirement.
I thank him for his service and offer my best wishes to him and to his family. ____________________
SECURING GROWTH AND ROBUST LEADERSHIP IN AMERICAN AVIATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
125



Date: 2023-07-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 125 Pages: E701 - E702 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E701-E702] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SECURING GROWTH AND ROBUST LEADERSHIP IN AMERICAN AVIATION ACT ______ speech of of michigan in the house of representatives The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3935) to amend title 49, United States Code, to reauthorize and improve the Federal Aviation Administration and other civil aviation programs, and for other purposes: Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Chair, I would like to include in the Record the following letter in opposition to Section 813 of H.R. 3935.
July 18, 2023.
Dear Members of Congress: We write to urge you to oppose the weakening of a law that protects the millions of sports fans and spectators who attend professional and collegiate sporting events each year.
The current statutory ban on aircraft--including unmanned aircraft systems (``UAS'') or drones--flying over large stadium sporting events throughout the country provides necessary safety and security protections against real and potential threats.
We are deeply concerned about section 813 of the House version of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'') Reauthorization Act.
If adopted, the language would establish a broad and complex waiver program that would permit countless aircraft to fly near and over stadiums during games, putting millions of fans at risk, and unnecessarily so.
Congress wisely eliminated a similar waiver program back in 2003, after discovering troubling and persistent failures, gaps, and vulnerabilities in the process for conducting background checks and issuing waivers.
The FAA first established flight restrictions over large stadium sporting events immediately following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in response to concerns about terrorists using aircraft as weapons.
Congress subsequently twice codified and strengthened these restrictions, providing specific criteria for aircraft operations permitted within the flight restricted area.
Section 813 would effectively eliminate the specific criteria and replace it with an open- ended waiver program.
The long-standing, congressionally mandated flight restriction enhances the safety and security of large stadium events, while minimizing the disruption to the National Airspace System (``NAS'').
Specifically, airspace over large stadiums--with a seating capacity of 30,000 people or more and where NFL, MLB, and NCAA Division 1 football games or major motor speedway events, such as NASCAR and INDYCAR races, are taking place--is closed to all aircraft from one hour before until one hour after a major sporting event.
The flight restrictions extend to three nautical miles from the center of the stadium and from the surface to 3,000 feet above the stadium.
The flight restrictions do not apply to authorized aircraft, such as Department of Defense, law enforcement or air ambulance flight operations, or those in contact with air traffic control for take offs and landings at nearby airports, among others.
