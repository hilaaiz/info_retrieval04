Specifically, airspace over large stadiums--with a seating capacity of 30,000 people or more and where NFL, MLB, and NCAA Division 1 football games or major motor speedway events, such as NASCAR and INDYCAR races, are taking place--is closed to all aircraft from one hour before until one hour after a major sporting event.
The flight restrictions extend to three nautical miles from the center of the stadium and from the surface to 3,000 feet above the stadium.
The flight restrictions do not apply to authorized aircraft, such as Department of Defense, law enforcement or air ambulance flight operations, or those in contact with air traffic control for take offs and landings at nearby airports, among others.
Having devoted substantial resources to secure our stadiums on the ground, we regard the stadium flight restriction as essential to safeguarding the airspace overhead.
Moreover, given

the proliferation of UAS in our NAS, as well as the continuing need to remain vigilant to other current and emerging risks, the stadium flight restriction is as vital now as ever to our national security and public safety.
We believe section 813 complicates the airspace over stadiums, compromises public safety and security, and courts potential disaster.
We, therefore, urge you to uphold current law and maintain existing flight restrictions that protect the safety and security of millions of fans who attend large stadium sporting events every year.
Sincerely, Cathy Lanier, Chief Security Officer, National Football League.
