Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of H.R. 3935, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act to reauthorize and improve important aviation programs in order to move the measure forward to the Senate.
While there was much good in the bill, I opposed provisions in the underlying bill calling for continued use of leaded aviation fuel.
I was pleased to work with the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on securing improvements to this language in the manager's amendment, which we believe will protect my constituents from exposure to leaded fuel used by small aircraft.
The Senate should further improve these provisions on continued use of leaded avgas before the bill comes back to the House for negotiations. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-20 Volume: 169, Issue: 125 Pages: E701 - E701 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MR.
LANNIE CORBIN ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Lannie Corbin, the City Manager for the City of Niceville, Okaloosa County, Florida.
On July 31, 2023, Mr. Corbin will be retiring after more than 52 years of service to the City of Niceville.
A native of Northwest Florida, Mr. Corbin began his civic service as City Clerk in August 1971.
He was then appointed City Manager/City Clerk in 1972, a position he has held since.
Mr. Corbin is the longest-serving city manager in the history of the State of Florida.
During his tenure, Mr. Corbin has been instrumental in improving the quality of life in Niceville and the surrounding area.
One of his many great accomplishments includes negotiating with local landowners to cede a portion of their land to the city, enabling the city to more than double its size.
This led to Nicevilles population growing from 4,300 residents in 1972 to over 16,000 today.
Lannie Corbin helped bring increased-quality-of-life projects to Niceville, such as the Turkey Creek Nature Trail, Lions Park, the Niceville Senior Center, the Twin Oaks Multi-use Sports Complex, the Children's and Spray Parks, and multiple city parks, such as Meigs and Rocky Runway Commons.
He also brought a new complex to the city to house its administrative offices, the police headquarters, community center, and the Children's Park.
One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of Niceville's first public library.
This led him to champion the first-ever cooperative effort in Okaloosa County by forming the Okaloosa County Library Cooperative, uniting 6 cities with the county, enabling them to increase the resources available to all the residents of our county.
