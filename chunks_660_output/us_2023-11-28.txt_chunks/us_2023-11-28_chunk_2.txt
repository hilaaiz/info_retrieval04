Mr. Speaker, today I want to honor 94-year- old Korean War veteran August V. Cosentino for his community accomplishments and life- long dedication to America's values.
In 1951, young August Cosentino enlisted in the United States Air Force and was assigned to attend radio and radar school at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, for one year of intensive training.
Following his training, he was assigned to a forward operations outpost on the 38th parallel of the Korean peninsula, where he aided in directing advanced bombing missions in North Korea.
After the Korean War, August Cosentino married the love of his life, Martha, and together they raised three children: Cindy, Ralph, and David, before Martha passed away on their 59th anniversary in 2012.
To support his family through a growing America, August worked in the sales business before forming his own company--August Cosentino Enterprises, where they supplied the automotive industry with custom made parts.
The Buffalo community played a large part in Mr. Cosentino's life.
August served as the president of Kenmore Rotary, where he tirelessly exemplified their motto of ``Service Above Self.''
As a talented musician, August can play the piano, accordion, and stand-up bass.
He has played in several military bands since 1951 and is well known in the Western New York music community.
Mr. Cosentino still plays stand- up bass weekly in the choir at the Newman Center mass.
I am excited to thank the guest of honor, veteran August V. Cosentino, for his service.
Mr. Cosentino served our country 70 years ago and our grateful community since then, and I hope for many more bright years to come. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, Georgina Cardona, affectionately known as Gina, was a woman of extraordinary kindness and caring, and left this world at the young age of 95.
Her constant commitment to community and family formed the pillars for who she was in life.
Gina moved into our community in the winter of 1952 from The Island of Puerto Rico with her husband Eliseo and only son Aureo.
The three lived in a rooming house owned by the Rivera family, this is where she came to love the South Bronx and all those who lived there with her, including her beloved ``Bronx Bombers''.
After settling in, Gina continued her dedication to service of others by graduating with honors from the Helena Fuld School of Nursing.
She started her career at Hunts Point Hospital as a surgical nurse, then worked at the Hospital for Joint Diseases until her retirement 40 years later.
During her years in healthcare, she was instrumental in groundbreaking medical procedures and became a highly respected leader in the industry.
While tirelessly working to improve the health of her fellow community members, she also fought for the Bronx we see today.
Her political activism was integral in rebuilding the South Bronx.
Gina always found the time and energy to campaign, mobilize, and organize her fellow community members to make lasting, positive changes for the South Bronx.
