Congress has recognized that the benefits of tax incentives for investment in economically distressed communities outweigh the costs, as it has continuously extended the national empowerment zone program.
The tax incentives for D.C. were the only tax incentives for a big city that were not extended, even though they were initially created by Republicans, with the help of several Democrats.
The expiration of the tax incentives for D.C. was tragically timed, as the low-income parts of D.C., which needed the incentives most, were ready for revitalization.
As we work to revitalize downtown D.C. and Wards 5, 7 and 8, the need for these incentives for D.C. is of paramount importance.
The tax incentives for D.C. were effective and their costs were de minimis.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
