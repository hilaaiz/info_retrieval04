Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Mary Ellen Stone for her many years of service for the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center (KCSARC) and congratulate her on her retirement as the Executive Director.
Mary Ellen has served as a steadfast advocate for survivors of sexual assault over the past 44 years throughout King County and Washington State.
She has been a visionary leader in changing the landscape of sexual assault services including prevention, education, and victim advocacy.
She was influential in establishing the state's first accreditation process for sexual assault providers, professionalizing service delivery and ensuring core services to be accessible; and publishing ``He Told Me Not to Tell,'' one of the first educational pieces in the nation for parents to talk with their children about sexual assault.
As a result, KCSARC is nationally recognized for its effective and innovative services.
Mary Ellen has shared her time and expertise in many ways to better inform systems and communities about the needs of victims.
This includes serving on the Seattle Archdiocese Review Board, Mental Illness Drug Dependence Oversight Board, Seattle Chief of Police Search committees, Washington Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs, Sex Offender Management Committee, Women's Funding Alliance, and Municipal League Seattle-King County.
My staff and I have had the privilege of working with Mary Ellen on multiple occasions.
Through her productive relationships with several elected officials, Mary Ellen has helped the KCSARC gain exposure at both the state and federal level.
Her passion, tenacity and leadership have shaped KCSARC into the strong, vibrant nonprofit it is today.
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank Mary Ellen Stone for her tireless work and contributions to the community, and I wish her a happy retirement. ____________________
RECOGNIZING MICHAEL MITROKA'S 100TH BIRTHDAY AND SERVICE TO OUR NATION; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
195



Date: 2023-11-28 Volume: 169, Issue: 195 Pages: E1131 - E1131 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MICHAEL MITROKA'S 100TH BIRTHDAY AND SERVICE TO OUR NATION ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Michael Mitroka, a longtime resident of Southgate, MI and veteran of the Second World War, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.
His service to our country is worthy of commendation.
Born on November 20, 1923, Michael enlisted in the Army as a Private in May of 1943.
Over the next two and a half years of service he would traverse the Pacific, seeing combat in places like New Guinea and the Philippines.
The Japanese conquest of the Philippines just a couple of years earlier was one of the worst military defeats in U.S. military history, and the retaking of the islands, though sure to be a long and hard affair, was a point of pride for General MacArthur and the Army.
By the time Michael left the Army as a Sergeant in December of 1945, he had earned the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, a good conduct medal, a purple heart, and two bronze stars, awarded for ``heroic or meritorious service in a combat zone.''
Michael carried on his service after the war by working in his local school district.
He retired in 1985 as the Supervisor of Maintenance, Custodial, and Transportation after 35 years with the Southgate School District.
Michael married his wife, Rosemary, just a few weeks before his discharge from the Army in 1945.
Though Rosemary passed away in 1994, her legacy carries on in their two sons, Paul and Michael Jr., three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
Still an active member of his current and former community, Michael is a member of St. Aloysius-Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Royaltown, IL, the American Legion Post 975 in Dowell, IL, and the Knights of Columbus Council Post 3965 in Southgate, MI.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the 100th birthday of Michael Mitroka.
