During his tenure, Mr. George Woodward led public relations efforts

on critical developments at Sheppard Air Force base, such as the base's

groundbreaking on a $27 million Child Development Center and the 82nd

Training Wing's overhaul of the Air Force's Wartime Training Plan.
Mr.

Woodward also supported visits to Sheppard, including from the

Secretary of the Air Force and Air Force Chief of Staff, Air Education

and Training Command leadership, and foreign dignitaries.
As the

Director of Public Affairs, Mr. Woodward also led the communications

efforts for the base's 75th anniversary and Guardians of Freedom

Thunderbirds Air Show.
On behalf of the entire Congress and a grateful Nation, as well as

the thousands of Airmen who served at Sheppard Air Force Base

throughout his eighteen-year tenure, I express my sincere gratitude and

appreciation to Mr. George Woodward for his outstanding leadership and

unwavering support for the missions of the U.S. Air Force.
