Additionally, JEB and Pete have been

named Conservationist of the Year in Chester County.
JEB credits the

family's success to their adaptability to challenges and willingness to

try new farming methods that will continue to decrease their

environmental impact.
The Wilson family continues to be devoted to their farm and are

looking forward to passing it down the family line.
On behalf of the

5th District of South Carolina, it is my most sincere pleasure to

recognize Cotton Hills Farm and the Wilson family for their great

service to our state.
Please join me in recognizing the farm on its

advancements in agricultural innovation and conservation.
