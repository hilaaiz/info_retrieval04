It is in the best interest of the United States

and Azerbaijan to maintain close bilateral ties with each other.
Because of this, I hope the friendship between our two countries will

flourish for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in somber remembrance of

Black January and the lives tragically lost during this saddening

event.
I also urge my colleagues to join me in strong condemnation of

the evils of communism, as well as in recognition of the stalwart

friendship between the United States and the Republic of Azerbaijan.
