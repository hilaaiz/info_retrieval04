As we welcome him, we are mindful that the challenges he faces are

immense.
Religious freedom is often denied to Orthodox Christians--and

under constraint in many of the lands they have inhabited for

centuries.
Christians and other minorities in many regions still face

persecution.
I thank His All-Holiness for his witness, courage, and example.
Washington welcomes him, not only as a guest, but as a brother, a

teacher, and a peacemaker.
May his visit strengthen the bonds between

our peoples, and may his ministry continue to inspire us all to walk

humbly, act justly, and love mercifully in the service of God and one

another.
