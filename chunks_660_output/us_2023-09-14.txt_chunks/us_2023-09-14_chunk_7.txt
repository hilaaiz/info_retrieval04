We need strength--not payoffs and appeasement--to deter future hostility from this rogue regime. ____________________

RECOGNIZING THE 45th ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONFERENCE OF WESTERN WAYNE; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-14 Volume: 169, Issue: 149 Pages: E852 - E852 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 45th ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONFERENCE OF WESTERN WAYNE ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Conference of Western Wayne on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of their founding.
The services that they have provided to 18 different communities in Western Wayne County are worthy of commendation.
The Conference of Western Wayne was created in 1978 to help integrate the local governments of Western Wayne County.
Encompassing 18 communities, 340 square miles and over 730,000 residents, the CWW coordinates 911 services and projects for the residents of Western Wayne.
CWW also represents its 730,000 residents by meeting monthly to discuss issues such as transportation, public safety, community and economic development, the environmental health of the region, and legislation.
The conference is constantly strategizing on potential legislation at the federal, state, and local level that impacts the communities of the conference.
This constant discussion allows for the conference to identify areas where their communities can work together and support each other.
In 2016, the CWW was the first 911 Service District in Wayne County to implement Text to 911, a service that has done wonders for those who are deaf, mute, or those for whom English isn't their first language.
On top of their 911 responsibilities, the CWW is also well involved in the communities they represent.
The CWW oversees the Rescue Recovery project in partnership with Growth Works and Trinity Health to provide substance use services to those in need, with a primary focus on opioid abuse.
Last year, the Western Wayne Rescue Recovery program met with over 1,100 clients, providing support through face-to-face and telehealth meetings, as well as coordinating services with healthcare providers and the court system.
CWW also partners with local Youth Assistance Programs to help provide families and youth within the CWW region with the knowledge and skills to make healthy choices.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the achievements of the Conference of Western Wayne over the last 45 years.
With the support of the CWW, the residents of Western Wayne County have had better response times to emergencies and have had access to a plethora of programs to enhance their daily life.
We thank the CWW for all the support they provide to our Western Wayne communities and hope to see another 45 years of tremendous service to those in need.
