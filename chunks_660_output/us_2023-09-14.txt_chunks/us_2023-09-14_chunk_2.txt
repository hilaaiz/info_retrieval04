As the first member of the AANHPI community to serve as an officer for Local 1107, she is an important representative for one of Nevada's fastest growing demographics.
Grace has a particular dedication to developing and supporting worker leaders, especially workers of color in her leadership with SEIU Local 1107 and the Nevada AFL-CIO.
Grace often says that she will always be an organizer at heart, so I am confident that her retirement will not be the last that I see of her.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Grace Vergara-Mactal on her outstanding service to Nevada and our Nation, and in congratulating Grace on her retirement. ____________________

Mr. Johnson, the former Chief of Police in Edwards, Mississippi for 39 years, parlayed his love of sports into coaching youth baseball and softball.
He was able to coach while also giving the children in his community a positive role model to follow.

He has been a great asset to his community, and his work never goes unnoticed.
