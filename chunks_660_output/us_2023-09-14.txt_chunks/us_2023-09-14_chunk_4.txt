Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Genevieve Ek, known as ``Jean'' by her beloved friends and family.
Jean passed away last month after a life full of love, friendship, and kindness.
She was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in December of 1941, growing up in Racine before moving to Two Harbors, Minnesota.
She opted to stay in Two Harbors even after her family moved to Oregon because of the strong and lasting relationships she had built with her friends and the love of her life, Harold.
Jean and Harold would go on to marry in 1963 and have 3 children--Adele, Lura, and John.
Jean was well known during her career in medical administration, helping mentor dozens during her tenure as she worked diligently to advance from receptionist to Executive Director of Crossroads Medical Center.
