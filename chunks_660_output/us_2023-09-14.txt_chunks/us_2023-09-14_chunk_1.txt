CONGRATULATING GRACE VERGARA-MACTAL; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-14 Volume: 169, Issue: 149 Pages: E849 - E849 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING GRACE VERGARA-MACTAL ______ of nevada in the house of representatives Ms. LEE of Nevada.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Grace Vergara- Mactal, Executive Director of SEIU 1107, for her upcoming retirement and a career of service to Nevada.
Grace was born and raised in the Philippines where she earned her bachelor's degree and worked as a medical technician.
Immigrating to the U.S. in 1989, her first job involved mopping floors for $3.50 an hour, but she worked her way back into the health care field as a hospital lab technician.
As a leader and organizer for her fellow lab workers, Grace was suspended from her job while circulating a petition.
Undeterred, she pursued this activism, climbing from volunteer, to organizer, Organizing Director, Chief of Staff, and eventually leader of Local 1107.
As one of the foremost leaders of the labor movement, both in Nevada and across the country, Grace has been a tireless advocate for good jobs and quality services during her incredible 3-decade career.
As Executive Director, she represents nearly 20,000 health care and public service workers across the state.
In this position, Grace has led with a commitment to mobilizing and empowering workers and families while fighting for economic, racial, and social justice.
Her work focused on growing Local 1107, passing historic legislation, winning major contract battles, and building vital community coalitions.
She also serves as Vice President and Executive Board Member of the Service Employees International Union, officer of the SEIU Asian Pacific Islander Caucus, and Executive Board Member of the Nevada AFL-CIO.
In addition to being an important union leader, Grace is a trailblazer in our community.
As the first member of the AANHPI community to serve as an officer for Local 1107, she is an important representative for one of Nevada's fastest growing demographics.
Grace has a particular dedication to developing and supporting worker leaders, especially workers of color in her leadership with SEIU Local 1107 and the Nevada AFL-CIO.
Grace often says that she will always be an organizer at heart, so I am confident that her retirement will not be the last that I see of her.
