She is dedicated to helping others rehabilitate and recover.
She will make repeated attempts to engage with a consumer, understanding they might need time to recognize and accept that they need help.
Denise is an empathic and dedicated peer who is an asset to the LifeStream family and to the residents of Citrus County.
It is clear that Ms. Aiello has made a profoundly positive impact on our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with in the fight against the horrific crime of human trafficking.
I am grateful for her service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions of one of my constituents, Jacqueline Vandyke, a volunteer with the Gulf Coast Manatees Homeschool Group.
Jacqueline has given so much of herself to make sure children in the program succeed.
As founder of the first non-profit homeschool group in Citrus County, she finds fun and interactive ways for the children to learn.
The children get to go on trips, learn hands-on life skills, all while making friends.
She also is committed to helping install the value of community service in children, spearheading: food drives, feeding programs for the homeless, beautification of church grounds, creating cards for soldiers, and wrapping gifts for cancer patients.
Jacqueline makes sure all kids get a moving up and graduation ceremony.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that Ms. Vandyke has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. ____________________
RECOGNIZING JE DUNN CONSTRUCTION GROUP'S CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-26 Volume: 170, Issue: 72 Pages: E393 - E393 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING JE DUNN CONSTRUCTION GROUP'S CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY ______ of missouri in the house of representatives Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with immense pride to recognize and celebrate the centennial anniversary of JE Dunn Construction Group.
This milestone is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and contributions that JE Dunn has made in the construction industry.
Founded in 1924 by John Ernest ``Ernie'' Dunn, this company that began in Kansas City, has now stretched across various generations of the Dunn family, and has only increased their reach beyond Missouri's Fifth Congressional District as the years have passed by.
With over 26 offices nationwide and being placed as the 8th overall largest contractor in the United States, this company has served its community through the principle of enriching lives.
Today, JE Dunn employs more than 1,200 people in Kansas City and 4,000 across the country.
In 1964 when Ernie Dunn passed, the company was worth $1.4 million and now the company is nearing a revenue of $6 billion.
The contributions in the local Kansas City area are important to job creation and sustaining economic growth as the city continues to grow and receive national and international attention.
Through JE Dunn's commitment to the local region, Kansas City began to see an increase in innovation and development in the 1960s with the development of Worlds of Fun, the Hy-Vee Arena then known as the Kemper Arena, among others.
As their mission to serve others in the pursuit of building perfection continues, JE Dunn has been vital in recent developments such as the Kansas City Zoo and building the world's first ever stadium for a women's pro sports team.
