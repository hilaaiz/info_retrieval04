That number is well over 850 today, with plans for a 900th home celebration in early summer.
Under his leadership, the agency has grown from 19 to 75 employees, allowing for sustainable and impressive growth.
His organization has also been recognized as one of the top 3 producers of new home builds among all 1,100 Habitat affiliates in the United States for several years in a row.
In addition to his work at Habitat Pinellas and West Pasco, Mike is an active community member of numerous organizations.
Mike is an active volunteer for the Valspar Championship, the University of South Florida Alumni Association, the Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity Education Foundation, and the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.
He has served on the Board of Directors for the Nonprofit Leadership Center of Tampa Bay, the Habitat for Humanity State Association of Florida, and the Pinellas Park Chamber of Commerce.
He also serves on the Pasco County Affordable Housing Advisory Committee and the Board of Directors for Amplify Cleanwater, formerly known as the Clearwater Regional Chamber of Commerce, which he chaired in 2020.
It is clear that Mr. Sutton has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. ____________________
