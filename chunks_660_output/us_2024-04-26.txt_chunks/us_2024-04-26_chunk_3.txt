Most recently, in 2023 Beverly was named one of the 50 greatest pro-life leaders in the past 50 years.
Mrs. LaHaye retired from her role as President of CWA in 2006.
She and Tim returned to Southern California, where they were closer to family.
She continued to serve as Chairman of the board for CWA until her retirement in 2020.
In addition, she continued to accept speaking engagements and served on various boards for Christian colleges and organizations.
Well into her eighties, Beverly still loved to be a voice in the cause and to educate future generations of Christian activists.
Throughout her life, Beverly's family was very important to her.
She invested in them personally and prayerfully.
While her life was very busy, whenever possible, she tried to carve out time to visit her children and grandchildren wherever they were living.
She organized family trips and opportunities for them all to be together.
In 2016, Beverly lost the love of her life, Tim, to a stroke at the age of 90.
They had been married for 69 years.
He was her greatest champion, her encourager, and true soulmate.
Ten months later, her son, Lee, also passed away.
It was a year of incredible loss for her.
She took great solace in the company of her remaining children, nine grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.
Beverly LaHaye was not born into privilege nor blessed with extraordinary skills and abilities.
Her life is a beautiful demonstration of what God can do with a person who is fully devoted to Him.
She was a faithful follower of Jesus Christ all the days of her life and God used her in extraordinary ways to make a difference in the world around her. ____________________

Date: 2024-04-26 Volume: 170, Issue: 72 Pages: E391 - E391 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE HOWELL ROTARY CLUB FOR 100 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I celebrate a remarkable milestone-- the 100th anniversary of the Howell Rotary Club--a century of selfless dedication to serving others.
Since its founding in 1924, the Howell Rotary Club has been a pillar of the community in Howell, the surrounding communities in Livingston County and across the state of Michigan.
Throughout its history, the Howell Rotary Club has truly embodied the Rotary's motto of ``Service Above Self,'' with its members playing a pivotal role in shaping the moral fabric of its community, fostering goodwill, peace, and understanding.
This vision is clear in the many Rotary Clubs that Howell Rotary has helped start throughout Livingston County, from Brighton Rotary in 1936 to M-36 Rotary in 2020.
Howell Rotary's legacy of community involvement is extensive.
In 1946, the Club provided the funding for the Howell High School football field, making it the first lighted football field in the state of Michigan.
The Club's commitment to supporting youth through education and forming international friendships is exemplified by the Club's foreign exchange student program.
In 1951, Howell Rotary hosted the first foreign exchange student in Livingston County.
Since then, Howell Rotary has sponsored these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for both inbound and outbound students to learn about different cultures and build international understanding.
Since 1978, Howell Rotary Club has awarded scholarships to Howell High School graduates who demonstrate their passion for learning and community service to continue their educational journeys.
In 2001, Rotarians established the Howell High School Interact Club, which helps students develop leadership skills and connect with their peers and community through acts of service.
