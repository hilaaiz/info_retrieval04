The contributions in the local Kansas City area are important to job creation and sustaining economic growth as the city continues to grow and receive national and international attention.
Through JE Dunn's commitment to the local region, Kansas City began to see an increase in innovation and development in the 1960s with the development of Worlds of Fun, the Hy-Vee Arena then known as the Kemper Arena, among others.
As their mission to serve others in the pursuit of building perfection continues, JE Dunn has been vital in recent developments such as the Kansas City Zoo and building the world's first ever stadium for a women's pro sports team.
The impact of these investments will have a positive ripple effect on our city and community for generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing this momentous celebration and thanking JE Dunn for their contributions to the Greater Kansas City area and beyond.
It is a distinct privilege to represent the JE Dunn Construction Group in the United States House of Representatives.
I speak with the voice of Missouri's entire Fifth Congressional District as we congratulate them and wish them many more years of success. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the unique contributions that have been made in our community by one of my constituents, Keith Vick, an active volunteer with Habitat for Humanity of Citrus County since 2022.
In his first full year as a core construction volunteer, Mr. Vick has already made an immense impact.
He believes in providing a hand-up, not a hand out to partner families.
As a U.S. Air Force Veteran and a retired first responder, Mr. Vick has contributed 434 hours of volunteer time.
He leads by example!
Mr. Vick has become a favorite of the family partners because of his compassion and willingness to share the skills he has acquired throughout life.
As each home is completed, Mr. Vick takes it upon himself to go through the final checklist, or ``punch list'', to make sure homes are finished to the high standards set by Habitat.
Each day Keith is out there, he's always in a great mood and ready to work and help others.
He's around enough to know what needs to be done each day.
Part of what makes our country so great is the willingness of ordinary Americans to go above and beyond to selflessly give back to others.
Volunteerism is one of the cornerstones of our society and part of the fabric that unites us.
It is clear that Mr. Vick has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for his service. ____________________
