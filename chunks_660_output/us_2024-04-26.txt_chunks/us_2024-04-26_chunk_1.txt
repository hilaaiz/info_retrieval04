BEVERLY JEAN LaHAYE ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, today I am grateful to honor the remarkable life of Mrs. Beverly Jean LaHaye, founder, and former chairman of Concerned Women for America (CWA), the Nation's largest public policy women's organization.
On Sunday, April 14, 2024, she passed from this life, leaving behind a legacy that will endure through the ages, shaping the lives of countless individuals.
I am grateful for the profound impact Mrs. LaHaye left upon us all and her unwavering commitment to God and public ministry and offer my sympathy to her family.
Included in the Congressional Record is the following obituary for Mrs. Beverly Jean LaHaye: Beverly Jean Davenport was born on April 30, 1929, in Detroit, Michigan, the second daughter of Lowell and Nellie Davenport.
Her father died when she was merely two years old, and her mother got remarried to a kindly neighbor man with whom she had two more children.
Raised in an evangelical household, Beverly's faith was a very important part of her life.
Beverly attended Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, where she met ministerial student Tim LaHaye, who was an Army Air Force veteran of WWII.
The two fell in love, and he was ready to propose marriage by Christmas break of their first year.
They married the following summer before returning to school, Not long after, they welcomed their first child, Linda, into their family.
After graduating, the young family moved to Minnetonka, Minnesota, where Tim pastored a small church, and together, they served the people of that community.
Their two sons, Larry and Lee, were born there.
In 1956, they relocated to San Diego, California, to begin their ministry at Scott Memorial Baptist Church.
Their youngest daughter, Lori, was born soon thereafter.
Throughout their ministry together, Beverly served as an integral part of whatever God had called them to do.
When the church needed a secretary, Beverly stepped up to fill the role.
When the junior Sunday school department needed a director, the young pastor's wife met the need.
During that time of life, Beverly had the opportunity to hear from a well-known Christian speaker who taught on the importance of being fitted with the Holy Spirit.
She was introduced to the concept that walking in the Spirit meant full dependence on Christ, no matter what she was called to do.
She was challenged to commit an aspects of her life . . .
her marriage, her parenting, her fears, and her insecurities, into the hands of her Savior.
This teaching changed her world.
God began to direct her steps to do more public ministry, including speaking at women's ministry events and working alongside her husband in his ministry to married couples through Family Life Seminars.
Additionally,

she was challenged to write, and over the course of her life Beverly had written or co-written many books, including The Spirit- Controlled Woman, How to Develop Your Child's Temperament, and The Desires of a Woman's Heart.
Her books were one more way she could communicate God's truth to women on subjects that were increasingly coming under attack in the culture around her, namely womanhood, motherhood, and devotion to family.
In 1978, Beverly saw Barbara Walters' interview with Betty Friedan, the founder of the National Organization for Women.
While watching, Beverly was convicted that she must speak on behalf of millions of women who were not being represented by the feminist philosophy.
Friedan's purpose, according to LaHaye, was to promote homosexuality, abortion on demand, and thoroughly ``undermine the core of American culture: the family.''
