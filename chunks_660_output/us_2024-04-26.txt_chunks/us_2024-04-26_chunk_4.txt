Since then, Howell Rotary has sponsored these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities for both inbound and outbound students to learn about different cultures and build international understanding.
Since 1978, Howell Rotary Club has awarded scholarships to Howell High School graduates who demonstrate their passion for learning and community service to continue their educational journeys.
In 2001, Rotarians established the Howell High School Interact Club, which helps students develop leadership skills and connect with their peers and community through acts of service.
Howell Rotary Club has demonstrated its dedication to improving the lives of others through charitable endeavors like the OLHSA Walk for Warmth, completing Habitat for Humanity home building projects, and raising over $350,000 over a 13-year period for Livingston County United Way.
For 100 years, the Howell Rotary Club has lifted up its community through its enduring commitment to service, integrity, and leadership.
From its original 17 founding members to its hundreds since, it is my honor to celebrate Howell Rotary Club's 100th anniversary and recognize its members' contributions. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today celebrate the brave first responders of the Pomeroy Fire Department in Meigs County, Ohio, as they are being honored as the Ohio Fire Department of the Year by the State Fire Marshall and the Ohio Department of Public Safety.
The 30 members of the all-volunteer Pomeroy firefighting force have consistently demonstrated a level of training, preparedness, and dedication second to none.
They've proven their commitment to excellence by pursuing advanced training, completing both in-service and multicompany training exercises, enhancing the force's efficiency, loss reduction, and ability to safeguard our community.
I cannot say enough about how much Pomeroy's Fire Department has given back to Meigs County, serving well beyond their roles as first responders--leading food drives, educating the community on fire safety and prevention, and distributing smoke detectors, among many other contributions.
I am pleased to honor the fine men and women of the Pomeroy firefighting force for their justly deserved recognition as the Ohio Fire Department of the Year.
Their service makes our community, Pomeroy, Meigs County, and Ohio, a better place--and I could not be more proud.
Congratulations to them on this well-deserved award. ____________________
