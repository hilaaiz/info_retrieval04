Naturally, he also became familiar with the Committee's practice of posting signs, gathering signatures, and distributing campaign literature.
Just 5 years into his involvement with ADC, the Amherst Democratic Chairman approached Ron to become a temporary treasurer.
Temporary, of course, is not an accurate description of Ron's time as treasurer--as he just handed the reins over after 22 years.
Ron also volunteers his time at the Buffalo and Eric County Naval Park as a docent and technical advisor.
He volunteers his knowledge and time to countless citizens and visitors, alike, so they can appreciate the fearless bravery of our veterans and the richness of our local history.
On the tours that he provides, Ron has the ability to capture the imagination of young Americans, so they understand the sacrifices that were made to ensure our collective freedom.
The staff at the Naval Park is undoubtedly grateful for his continued dedication to their endeavors.
Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention Ron's consistent involvement at the Niagara Frontier Radio Reading Service for the blind with his wife, Corine.
Throughout the week, this organization reads newspapers, magazines, and books for the visually impaired.
Ron's involvement with Niagara Frontier Radio Service, Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, and the Amherst Democratic Committee prove him to be a worthy candidate of recognition.
I am excited to honor Ron for his selfless efforts that have such a tangible impact on our community. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE OPERATION OF THE INTEGRATED WASTE TREATMENT UNIT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-09-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 150 Pages: E855 - E855 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE OPERATION OF THE INTEGRATED WASTE TREATMENT UNIT ______ of idaho in the house of representatives Mr. SIMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today, alongside my esteemed colleagues Senators Mike Crapo and Jim Risch, to recognize the committed staff at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site's Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU).
In the face of many challenges, the employees who supported IWTU demonstrated professionalism, expertise, dedication to the mission, and exemplified the spirit of American innovation.
IWTU engineers, scientists, crafts specialists, plant operators, and administration professionals always believed they could overcome the challenges of this first-of-a-kind radioactive liquid waste treatment facility.
Following its construction from 2007 to 2011, the IWTU underwent testing of its steam-reforming process, which was chosen to solidify 900,000 gallons of liquid sodium-bearing waste from an underground tank farm.
This waste was generated during the INL's spent nuclear fuel reprocessing mission during the height of the Cold War.
From the first demonstration run at the IWTU in 2012, mechanical problems were apparent as metal filters became plugged, resulting in a quick shutdown of the facility.
During subsequent runs, further mechanical problems surfaced as well as chemistry challenges within the IWTU's primary reaction vessel.
The Department of Energy (DOE) and its contractors didn't give up.
Together, they devised a plan to systematically identify and resolve all problems.
They employed some of the brightest scientists at the INL and across the country, worked with academia in several states, and utilized the resources of corporate and small businesses.
In all, engineers, scientists, and fabricators made hundreds of modifications to the IWTU, and with each subsequent demonstration run, the facility became more reliable and predictable.
On April 11, 2023, 16 years after construction began, IWTU operators were given permission to start radiological operations.
At first, 10 percent radioactive liquid waste was blended with 90 percent simulant.
This ratio was increased to 50:50 and later to 100 percent sodium- bearing waste.
For those on the project who sacrificed countless weekends, holidays, and quality time with family, this moment was the culmination of years of committed work for a greater cause.
I want to thank all the Idaho Environmental Coalition employees who have supported this project.
