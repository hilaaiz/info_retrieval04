Date: 2023-09-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 150 Pages: E857 - E857 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING CAPTAIN ANDRIY ``JUICE'' PILSHCHIKOV ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the life of Ukrainian fighter pilot Captain Andriy Pilshchikov, better known by his call sign ``Juice,'' who tragically lost his life at the age of 30 while fighting for Ukraine's freedom on Friday, August 25, 2023.
Born in February 1993, Andriy was a Captain in Ukraine's Air Force 40th Tactical Aviation Brigade and leader of the ``Ghost of Kyiv'' unit.
He flew MiG-29 fighter jets, protecting the central and northern Ukrainian air space from Russian attacks.
Andriy earned the call sign ``Juice'' during his time in California performing training exercises with the U.S. Air National Guard because he preferred juice over alcoholic beverages.
Juice boldly resisted the Russian air offensive despite using aging Soviet-era technology.
With destroyed ground-based navigation, Juice flew missions using simple Garmin GPS units.
Juice was one of the lead advocates for the delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine from allied countries.
His efforts included contacting American government officials to encourage support for this cause.
Many of us became familiar with Juice from his numerous interviews with prominent Western news outlets.
Luckily, allied countries, including the United States, agreed to send F-16s.
Juice was among the initial group of Ukrainian pilots slated for F-16 training due to his fluency in English.
Juice and 2 other pilots, Major Vyacheslav Minka and Major Serhiy Prokazin, tragically lost their lives on August 25 when a pair of L-39 Combat Trainer jets collided during a training accident near Zhytomyr.
In June 2022, I was introduced to Juice by actor and filmmaker Sean Penn.
Over dinner in Washington D.C., Juice shared his passion for Ukraine's freedom and the need for the United States to provide fighter jets to his country.
I promised Juice I would seek that.
And I plan to follow through on that promise.
Juice was a true Air Force leader, possessing tactical skills, confidence, and a calm demeanor under the immense pressure that war brings.
His bravery and courage went above and beyond, flying over 500 combat hours, never once backing away from a fight.
He is survived by his devoted girlfriend, Melaniya, and mother, Lillia.
May we never forget his service and the ultimate sacrifice he made for the freedom of Ukraine. ____________________
