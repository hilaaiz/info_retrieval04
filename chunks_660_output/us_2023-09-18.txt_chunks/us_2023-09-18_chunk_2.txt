Finally, MST is putting rolling stock and infrastructure in place today that includes enroute inductive charging stations, designing micro-grid technologies, and procuring battery electric buses as it moves to transition to a fleet of 162 buses to planet-friendly 100 percent zero-emission buses powered from renewable sources.
In addition, MST is at the forefront of forging partnerships with local stakeholders to expand public transit options throughout the community.
This past year, MST celebrated 30 years of partnership with the City of Monterey and Monterey Bay Aquarium in providing fast, fun, and free transit services to visitors and residents alike reducing visitor related traffic congestion, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing microplastics from vehicles traveling adjacent to the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary.
MST's partnerships also extend to local colleges, with a EcoSmart Pass program with California State University-Monterey Bay Hartnell Community College, and Monterey Peninsula Colleges, discount pass programs available to all Monterey County school districts.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to commend the Monterey-Salinas Transit District for providing 50 years of exemplary public service to the Central Coast and ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to wish them well on the next 50 years. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would exempt from federal government shutdowns the federal and independent agencies that are exclusively or primarily federally funded but have jurisdiction over local District of Columbia civil and criminal justice matters.
This bill is modeled on a provision I have gotten enacted each year since the 2013 federal government shutdown to exempt the D.C. government from federal government shutdowns.
This bill would exempt the following agencies from federal government shutdowns: Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for D.C., D.C. Courts, D.C. Public Defender Service, D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission and D.C. Criminal Justice Coordinating Council.
With one exception, these agencies are not under the District's control and are funded exclusively by the federal government.
These agencies provide critical local services to the District, including law enforcement, and should continue to function during a federal government shutdown.
Each of these agencies has been adversely affected by federal government shutdowns, including canceled services and furloughed employees.
My bill would allow these agencies to continue to function during a federal government shutdown, in much the same way that the D.C. government itself is now exempt from shutting down during a federal government shutdown. ____________________
