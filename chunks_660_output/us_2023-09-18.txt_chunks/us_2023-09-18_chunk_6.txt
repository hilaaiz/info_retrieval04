This ratio was increased to 50:50 and later to 100 percent sodium- bearing waste.
For those on the project who sacrificed countless weekends, holidays, and quality time with family, this moment was the culmination of years of committed work for a greater cause.
I want to thank all the Idaho Environmental Coalition employees who have supported this project.
Their contributions are protecting the Snake River Plain Aquifer, which is the primary source of drinking water and agricultural water for more than 300,000 Idahoans.
Furthermore, their actions in treating legacy Cold War waste and closing these sites pave the way for future nuclear research work in Idaho.
I would like to join my distinguished colleagues Senators Crapo and Risch, in congratulating the IWTU team on this extremely important achievement.
They represent the most talented and committed individuals in the DOE Complex.
Perhaps more importantly, they represent the greatest of our country and the ingenuity that makes the United States stand out in the world. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF SUSAN GRELICK; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-09-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 150 Pages: E856 - E856 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF SUSAN GRELICK ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. HIGGINS of New York.
Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the first woman elected Town Supervisor and Town Clerk of Amherst, Susan Grelick.
She embodies the very best of our community, and has shaped Amherst, NY into one of the best rated and safest places to live in the entire country.
A graduate of Union College, Susan would later earn her MBA, JD, and master's degrees in Information Science and American Economic History.
She utilized her extensive education to the town's benefit--always in search of ways to improve its financial stand, promote local businesses, and preserve neighborhoods and green space.
Indeed, during her 9 years as Supervisor, Amherst had the highest bond rating of any municipality in Western New York.
Susan also initiated the Town's first Vision Summits, a tool she used to develop a comprehensive plan for her future agenda.
Once her time had finished as a town official, Susan became the legislative director and counsel to New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins.
This is in addition to involvement in countless local organizations, including as a Trustee Emeritus of the Buffalo Niagara Heritage Village, as a Board member of the Amherst Youth Foundation, and as Vice President of the Chautauqua Institution Women's Club Board of Directors.
She previously worked as President of the Amherst Youth Foundation, President of the Buffalo Amherst Business and Professional Women's Association, and sat on the Board of Directors for YMCA of Greater Buffalo, the UB Alumni Association, and the Erie County Industrial Development Agency.
Her commitment to public service goes beyond the listed organizations.
She is unquestionably sincere in her desire to help others, and she has gone above and beyond to deliver for her neighbors and community.
Many groups have recognized Susan over the years, so it is only fitting that the Amherst Democratic Committee recognizes her efforts over the last 25 years as a member.
Susan Grelick has been a steadfast friend to so many in the Western New York area, and all its citizens (particularly those in Amherst), owe her a debt of gratitude.
She has been an asset to the growth of our region, and I am thrilled that she is being honored for her inspiring achievements.
I wish her the best in all her future endeavors. ____________________
