Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize a stalwart figure in the Buffalo community, Carl Thomas.
After roughly 4 decades of leading by example at Roswell Park Cancer Institute and Kevin's Guest House, it is only proper to acknowledge and give gratitude for a lifelong dedication to those in need of help.
A graduate of Lafayette High School, he has always put the needs of his hometown neighbors ahead of his own.
At the very beginning of his professional career, Carl recognized an unfortunate and common challenge for so many cancer patients--having a stable place to stay during treatment.
As a volunteer at Kevin's Guest House, a local hospitality guest house, he undoubtedly recognized that a community effort can make the bleak reality of cancer a little easier on a patient and their loved ones.
Of course, Carl was familiar with cancer treatment and hospital care due to his father's employment at Roswell.
As he began his own career at Roswell Park (later earning the role of Chief of Public Safety).
Carl devoted his time and energy toward the needs and safety of the entire Roswell campus.
He saw these 2 institutions, Kevin's Guest House and Roswell Park, as inherently intertwined and was one of the earliest to recognize Roswell Park's leading role in the fight against cancer.
Carl's passion for Roswell's success earned him the position as Chief Organizational and Community Liaison.
In essence, he has worked as an ambassador for Roswell with community organizations, government officials, churches, and block clubs in Western New York.
As an African American executive, Carl Thomas has often cited his responsibility to lead a new generation of achievers.
Those who know Carl understand retirement will not result in the end of his mentorship; as a resident of the University District, he has already expressed an interest in maintaining his position as a role model within the community.
Nonetheless, retirement will allow Carl some much-deserved time with his wife of over 4 decades.
Betty, along with their children, Mario, Samantha, and Phylicia.
Buffalonians and Roswell Park patients, alike, owe Carl an incredible debt of gratitude, and it is my pleasure to recognize his career as a capable worker and generous man. ____________________

Date: 2023-09-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 150 Pages: E857 - E857 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE EFFORTS OF RONALD GILSON ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. HIGGINS of New York.
Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to recognize the longtime treasurer of the Amherst Democratic Committee.
Ronald Gilson.
A resident of Amherst since 1962.
Ron has been an indispensable member oft he Committee since 1994.
He jumped in head-first, ensuring that technical operations like utilities.
internal telephone banks, and essential supplies were always cared for at headquarters.
His willingness to volunteer in this capacity was also incredibly valuable to Chairman Jeremy Zellner when the Erie County Democratic Committee moves its headquarters to Larkinville.
Ron was there to ensure a seamless transition with the proper technology setup.
Naturally, he also became familiar with the Committee's practice of posting signs, gathering signatures, and distributing campaign literature.
Just 5 years into his involvement with ADC, the Amherst Democratic Chairman approached Ron to become a temporary treasurer.
Temporary, of course, is not an accurate description of Ron's time as treasurer--as he just handed the reins over after 22 years.
