HONORING TIERRA DEL SOL HOUSING CORPORATION ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
GABE VASQUEZ

Mr. VASQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Tierra del Sol

Housing Corporation and commemorate their 50th anniversary.
Tierra del

Sol has proudly been serving the needs of low-income families in my

district since 1973 and has promoted economic and social empowerment

through homeownership programs, employment training, and access to

financial resources.
Their work has helped ensure financial security

for New Mexican families and build stable communities where all can

thrive.
Throughout their 50 years of service, Tierra del Sol has instituted

various programs to assist rural New Mexicans.
From rural farm rental

housing to supportive housing for the elderly to major subdivision

developments, Tierra del Sol Housing Corporation has tirelessly worked

towards their mission.
In recent years, Tierra del Sol has led the construction of single-

family housing under their self-help housing program.
That recent

construction has allowed community members access to affordable housing

and energy-efficient living, putting New Mexico well on the road to

becoming a leader in clean energy practices.
As we look to the future,

I am confident that Tierra del Sol will continue to find innovative

ways to reach out to New Mexicans, while promoting the health of our

State more broadly.
On behalf of the great people of New Mexico's 2nd Congressional

District, I thank Tierra del Sol for their service to the people of New

Mexico and congratulate them on celebrating 50 years of service.
Their

work has made our community stronger, safer, and more prosperous, and I

am excited to see what they accomplish for generations to come.
