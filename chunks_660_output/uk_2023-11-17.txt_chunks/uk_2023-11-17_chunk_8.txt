As the largest importer of ornamental reef fish, our country has both

responsibility for creating the demand that leads to such practices,

and the opportunity to channel that demand to sustainable collection.
The Saving Natural Ecosystems and Marine Organisms Act would do so by

prohibiting the import into our country of protected reef species taken

using unsustainable or destructive practices.
The enforcement mechanism

would be administrative certification, in conjunction with cooperating

collecting countries where possible, that ornamental reef fish and

species to be imported into our country were collected without

following those practices.
I ask for my colleagues' support of this bill which is one piece of a

much larger effort to save our oceans from their own worst enemy: us.
