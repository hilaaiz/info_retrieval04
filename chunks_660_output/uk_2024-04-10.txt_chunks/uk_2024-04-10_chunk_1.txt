COMMENDING JOHN KONIAR FOR HIS SERVICE TO ALABAMA DISTRICT ONE

_____

HON.
JERRY L. CARL

Mr. CARL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former Foley Mayor John

Koniar and his service to Alabama's First Congressional District.
John entered active duty in the United States Air Force as 2nd

lieutenant in 1965 and was honorably discharged as a Captain in 1969.
He joined Vulcan, Inc. in 1971, and he retired as a vice president of

sales after working there for 37 years.
John Koniar served on the Foley

City Council from 1980 until 2006.
He was then elected mayor in 2006

and served three terms until 2020.
John was incredibly influential to

the City of Foley due to his strong leadership.
His dedication to the

city was vital for the growth of Foley.
He took pride in his dedicated

employees and how well they represented their community.
His presence and leadership promoted a healthy work environment in

which people could succeed.
We are so grateful for all he has done for

Alabama's First Congressional District.

HONORING REPRESENTATIVE WILLIAM DELAHUNT

_____

HON.
BETTY McCOLLUM

Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy

his home in Quincy, Massachusetts.
Representative Delahunt, born in

that very same town, spent his life dedicated to its people.
Representative Delahunt was a lifelong public servant.
He began his

career as a Radioman for the Coast Guard, an honor he brought all the

way to the House as co-chair of the Coast Guard Caucus.
Representative

Delahunt progressed through a life of Public Service.
He served as a

Quincy Town Councilor, State Representative, District Attorney, and

finally House Representative, before his retirement in 2011.
Representative Delahunt always put the needs of his constituents

first.
When low-income residents in his home state struggled to pay

their heating bills during the winter of 2006, he got little assistance

from the Bush administration.
Instead of doing nothing, he famously

brokered an international fuel sale for approximately 50,000

Massachusetts residents in dire need.
His direct negotiation of this

sale ensured even his most vulnerable constituents could keep the heat

on that winter.
Well-respected for his lasting commitment to human rights,

Representative Delahunt served as the chair of the Subcommittee on

International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight in the 110th

Congress.
I had the distinct pleasure of serving with Representative

Delahunt, and I still carry a deep respect for Representative

Delahunt's strong principles and consistent defense of human rights.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his fiance, Julia Pagana, daughters

Kirsten and Kara, and two grandchildren.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in

honoring the life of a great man of this chamber.

Mr. LaMALFA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service,

and career of Tom Dauterman of Chico, California who passed away

peacefully after a three-year battle with cancer on February 26, 2024.
Tom was born on July 19, 1942, in Los Angeles, California.

graduated as a member of the class of 1960.
He worked as a carpenter

with his father building houses after high school.
On November 30, 1963, Tom married the love of his life, Sue Mathews,

and they began their life together, making their home in Chico.

garage in Chico in 1972.
Thomas Hydraulics followed in 1974 as well as

Thomas Manufacturing in 1996.
What was once Tom's small business idea

now stands as one of the largest machine shops north of Sacramento.
