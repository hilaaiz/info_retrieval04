Paopao also picked up All-

America recognition from the USBWA (Second Team) and the AP (honorable

mention).
Coach Staley, a legend in her own right, has transformed South

Carolina WBB into an absolute basketball powerhouse.
The Gamecocks have

won 8 regular season championships, 8 SEC tournament championships, and

3 national championships.
This year, Coach Staley was named the

Naismith Women's College Coach of the Year, AP Women's Coach of the

Year, WBCA Coach of the Year, and SEC Coach of the Year.
She also

became the first Black coach, male or female, to win three Division 1

basketball titles and the fifth coach to win at least three titles.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in celebrating

this remarkable University of South Carolina Women's Basketball team.
As the confetti settles and the celebrations continue, one thing is

certain: the future of South Carolina women's basketball is bright.
Go

Gamecocks.
