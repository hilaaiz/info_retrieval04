EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF MARCH 15, 2024, AS ``MORQUIO

A SYNDROME AWARENESS DAY''

HON.
NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS

Ms. MALLIOTAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following

proclamation:

Whereas: Morquio A syndrome, a classification of

Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) disorders, is a rare, progressive genetic

disorder that affects approximately 1 in every 300,000 births;

Whereas: individuals affected by Morquio A syndrome do not have or do

not produce enough enzymes that break down sugar chains naturally in

the body;

Whereas: the buildup of sugars negatively impacts the skeletal system

and eventually the organ systems;

Whereas the condition of Morquio A syndrome worsens over time and

there is no cure;

Whereas there is only one FDA-approved medication for Morquio A

syndrome, a synthetic version of the enzyme that patients lack;

Whereas this treatment is a four-hour weekly infusion that helps slow

the rapid progression of the disease;

Whereas patients receiving treatment for Morquio A syndrome often

need to see numerous specialty doctors frequently and may also require

many services for school-age children;

Whereas it is imperative that there be greater awareness of this

serious health condition, and more must be done to increase activity at

the local, state, and national levels;

Whereas ``Morquio A Syndrome Awareness Day'' is expected to be

observed in the United States for years to come, providing hope and

information for patients, caregivers, and families around the country:

Now, therefore, be it

Resolved, That the House of Representatives--

Supports the designation of ``Morquio A Syndrome Awareness Day''; and

Recognizes the importance of, with respect to Morquio A syndrome--

Improving awareness;

Encouraging accurate and early diagnosis;

Advancing research;

Developing new treatments, diagnostics, and cures; and

Identifying regulatory pathways for drug development of ultrarare

diseases like Morquio A syndrome.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT YSMAEL R. VILLEGAS 100TH BIRTHDAY

HON.
MARK TAKANO

Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Staff Sergeant

Ysmael R. Villegas, a distinguished American hero from California's

39th Congressional District.
Born in Casa Blanca in 1924, Villegas, the

eldest of 13 children, exemplified the values of our diverse community.
Formerly an ``orange picker,'' Villegas answered the call to serve

during WWII, displaying extraordinary bravery at the Battle of Luzon.
Tragically, on March 20, 1945, one day before his 21st birthday, he

made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
President Truman

posthumously awarded him the Medal of Honor on October 19, 1945.
Colonel G. B. Appleman presented the medal to his widow at Camp Haan

on November 1, 1945, in our very own Riverside district.
The ceremony

drew thousands, a testament to the profound impact of Villegas's

heroism on our community.
As we commemorate what would have been his 100th birthday, let us

remember Staff Sergeant Villegas's selflessness, dedication, and love

for family.
May his legacy inspire future generations, and the heroism

California's 39th Congressional District.
