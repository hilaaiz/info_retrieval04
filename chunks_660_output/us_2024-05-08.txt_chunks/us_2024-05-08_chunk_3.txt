EFRAIN CASILLAS ______ of arizona in the house of representatives Mr. GRIJALVA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable contributions of Mr. Efrain Casillas, the Coordinator of Music Programs for the Tolleson Elementary School District in Tolleson, Arizona.
For the past 24 years, Mr. Casillas has dedicated himself to the education and enrichment of his students, serving as a public-school music teacher and imparting his passion for music to countless young minds.
Mr. Casillas' own journey exemplifies what it means to break through barriers to achieve success through dedication and commitment.
Mr. Casillas has beaten the odds and was named the Arizona Teacher of the Year in 2024 by the Arizona Educational Foundation, representing the state of Arizona at the national level among many more recognitions.
Mr. Casillas has had a profound impact on countless students, pioneering innovative music programs, including the district's first Mariachi, Jazz, Marching, Concert, and Latin Jazz bands.
As a native of Puerto Rico, Mariachi was not part of his musical heritage, but Casillas made it a priority to learn it because it is part of the culture of many of his students who are native to Mexico.
Under Mr. Casillas' guidance, the Mariachi band has secured multiple awards, including the Tucson Mariachi International Conference Choice Awards for three consecutive years.
Notably, his dedication led to the Mariachi band performing at the 2024 Annual White House Easter Egg Roll event and the marching band proudly participating in the Disneyland Parade.
Additionally, Mr. Casillas directed the Tolleson Elementary School marching band in the Fiesta Bowl Parade for three consecutive years.
Mr. Casillas' commitment and talent have garnered numerous accolades and awards, including being named the Tolleson Elementary School District Teacher of the Year in 2015 and nominated for the Life Changer of the Year Award in 2017.
He has also received the Esperanza Award from Chicanos Por La Causa and Arizona's Esperanza Latino Teacher Awards in 2018, along with the 2019 Music Teacher of Excellence Foundation Award by the Country Music Association.
Furthermore, he was honored with the Music Teachers of Excellence from the Country Music Foundation Award (CMF) in 2020 and featured on the Kelly Clarkson Show.
Mr. Casillas' dedication to music education and advocacy for public education were further recognized when he received the Phoenix Arts Hero Award in 2022.
Mr. Casillas' commitment to music education extends beyond the classroom, as he is an active member of many notable and impactful organizations.
He has also served as a presenter for the National Symposium of Multicultural Music at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville in 2004 and as a clinician for the 2024 Tolleson High School Honors Mariachi Music Festival.
The highest honor Mr. Casillas has received is having many of his former students return to assist in the music program as teachers or instructors.
His impact is now extending to more students.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Efrain Casillas for his unwavering dedication to music education, his outstanding achievements as a teacher, and his tireless advocacy for public education.
His passion, talent, and leadership have enriched the lives of countless students and inspired us all.
I join my colleagues in expressing our deepest appreciation for Mr. Casillas' contributions and in wishing him continued success in all his future endeavors. ____________________
