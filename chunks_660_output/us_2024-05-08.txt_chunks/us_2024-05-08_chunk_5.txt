The original building for Doss School was officially designated a Texas Historic Landmark in 1985.
The first classes at Doss School began in 1884.
Mr. Tom Nixon donated land for the construction of a school building.
Upon completion, students at Squaw Creek and Onion Creek schools merged with Doss and shared the new building.
The school further expanded with a new building in 1927.
I would like to thank the Friends of Doss School for preserving local history and this community treasure.
I wish the students and faculty of Doss School well in the upcoming school year. ____________________
