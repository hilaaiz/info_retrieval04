Finally, the Motion Preservation Task Force ensures patients and

providers have access to lifechanging motion-preserving procedures,

focusing on artificial disc replacement.
The Foundation continues to be strongly committed to spine health

research.
Patient reported outcomes have long been part of fabric of

NSHF since its inception.
As they are deeply invested in supporting

evidence-based healthcare decisionmaking, it is important to be part of

the process of creating the evidence.
Their cloud-based research tool

called `Spine-online' enables them to conduct multi-center studies and

partner with research teams both in the U.S. and internationally.
Active studies are currently occurring on robotic surgery, enhanced

surgical recovery, augmented reality, a genetic basis for personalized

spine treatments, stem cell therapy, and more.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the

importance of good spinal health and thanking the NSHF and the

healthcare providers who help spine and neck patients, not just in

October, but all year long.

RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.
MARY'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN

LAMPASAS, TEXAS

_____

HON.
AUGUST PFLUGER

Mr. PFLUGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the

150th anniversary of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Lampasas, Texas.
Founded in 1873 during the turbulent years of Reconstruction, St.

Mary's has stood as a steadfast place of worship and community for a

century and a half.
From its beginnings under the leadership of Dr.

Thomas S. Denny and a small group of faithful families, the church

persevered through frontier hardships, local feuds, floods, and

economic trials.
Over the years, it has grown into a vibrant

congregation rooted in service, tradition, and faith.
The sanctuary itself, built of native limestone in the Victorian

Gothic style, is a testament to the perseverance of its early leaders,

including Capt.
A.H. Barnes, Dr. James Bierbower, W.T. Campbell, T.H.

Haynie, W.C. Price, and others whose dedication made possible the

construction of a permanent church home.
Generations of families, like

the Campbells, the Haynies, the Richeys, the Olivers, and many more

have sustained and enriched the life of St. Mary's across decades,

ensuring its continued presence as a spiritual cornerstone of the

Lampasas community.
Today, St. Mary's remains a thriving parish, carrying forward its

mission with more than a dozen families whose membership stretches back

multiple generations, while also welcoming new parishioners who bring

fresh perspectives and energy.
Together, this congregation embodies the

resilience, stability, and continuity that have defined St. Mary's

since its founding.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring St. Mary's

Episcopal Church for 150 years of faithful service to its members, the

people of Lampasas, and the greater Central Texas region.
May the

congregation continue to serve as a beacon of hope, light, and grace

for generations to come.

RECOGNIZING THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF MERRIFIELD ON THEIR 155TH

ANNIVERSARY

HON.
JAMES R. WALKINSHAW

Mr. WALKINSHAW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the First Baptist

Church of Merrifield on the occasion of the 155th anniversary of its

sanctuary.
For more than a century and a half, First Baptist Church of

Merrifield has served as a cornerstone of faith, service, and community

for the Northern Virginia region.
First Baptist Church of Merrifield

was started in a log cabin between 1871 to 1872.
FBCM had then branched

out and began worshipping on property owned by Mr. Robert Bradley of

Merrifield.
In 1891, the property was purchased from him by church

Trustees: John E. Coates, Joshua Ball, and Joshua Pearson for the sum

of five dollars.
FBCM is a church formed from strong community family

ties and has remained steadfastly community focused since.
FBCM remains a vital part of our district today by partnering with

neighbors and local organizations to fulfill local needs through

service projects, food and supply drives, youth programs, and many

other community-centered initiatives.
