CELEBRATING THE 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF COMMUNITY RESIDENCES INC. (
CRi)

_____

HON.
JAMES R. WALKINSHAW

Mr. WALKINSHAW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Community

Residences Inc. on the occasion of their 50th anniversary.
For half a century, this remarkable organization has stood at the

forefront of the movement to expand opportunity, ensure dignity, and

promote independence for individuals with intellectual and

developmental disabilities in Northern Virginia.
What began in 1975 as a grassroots response to the lack of community-

based housing for people with disabilities has grown into one of the

region's most respected providers of inclusive services.
In its

earliest days, CRi, then Arlington Community Residences, challenged

outdated models of institutionalization by creating homes where

individuals could thrive as valued members of their neighborhoods.
Over

the decades, the organization evolved, broadening its programs and

reaffirming its mission in a new name Community Residences Inc, with

the tagline, choice, respect, and independence; that reflects the core

principles guiding their work.
As the organization celebrates 50 years of service, it also looks

forward to the launch of its Champions Campaign: a bold initiative to

secure the resources needed to expand housing, enrich community

programs, and prepare the next generation of advocates.
The campaign is

not only an investment in facilities and services, but in the vision

that every individual deserves the right to self-determination,

belonging, and a life of purpose.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing CRi for 50

years of leadership, compassion, and impact.
Their history is a

testament to the power of community action, and their future promises

to carry forward the values of choice, respect, and independence for

generations to come.

HONORING CHRISTOPHER FEARON AS A DISTINGUISHED FIRST RESPONDER LEADER

IN CENTRAL FLORIDA

_____

HON.
DARREN SOTO

Mr. SOTO.
Mr. Speaker, earlier this summer in Altamonte Springs,

while off-duty and spending time with his family, Firefighter and

Paramedic Christopher Fearon witnessed a five-year-old boy slip under

the water and begin to drown.
Within seconds, he pulled the child out,

cleared his airway, and helped him take a lifesaving breath.
The boy

was purple in the face and struggling to breathe, but thanks to Chris's

training, instinct, and calm under pressure, he survived and recovered.
Chris embodies: Skill and decisiveness under pressure--drawing on

years of fire-rescue and paramedic training; Service beyond duty--never

hesitating to act, even off the clock; Humility and compassion--later

reflecting, ``All I wanted to do since I was little was help people . .
.
and I love it.''
This act of quick thinking heroism, covered by local

news, not only saved a life but also drew attention to the importance

of water safety in Central Florida.
The boy has since received a

scholarship to learn to swim, creating a ripple effect of safety and

prevention beyond the incident itself.
