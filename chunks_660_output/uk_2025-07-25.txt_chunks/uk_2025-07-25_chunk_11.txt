A native of Carroll County, John H. Davis has dedicated his life to

teaching others about the importance of agriculture.
After several

years in the classroom in Ashtabula County, he was tapped to oversee

vocational agriculture education statewide.

John is a former

Carroll County Commissioner and a member of the Carroll County Farm

Bureau Hall of Fame.
Selection for the Hall of Fame is a high honor that has been accorded

to only 257 Ohioans since 1966.
Consideration for induction is given to

those who have made outstanding contributions to agriculture, Ohio's

top industry.
On behalf of the people of Ohio's Fourth Congressional District, I am

pleased to join in the accolades for these four remarkable inductees as

they are recognized for their commitment to agriculture and their

lifetime of service to others.
I also thank the members of the Ohio

Agricultural Council for their ongoing work to honor Ohio's agriculture

leaders.
