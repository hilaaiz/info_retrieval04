Mr. Bradford started trying to make a difference early in the NAACP youth chapter.

It was during that selfless act of service he created the concept ``You can recognize what's the right thing to do . . .
because the right thing is rarely comfortable, convenient or popular''.
Sammy graduated from Douglass High School and began his freshman year in 1960 at the esteemed Tougaloo College in Tougaloo, MS where he studied music.
His love for music and beautiful tenor voice is what joined him with the love of his life, his wife, Shirley Ann Faulkens.

They were married for 53 years and 10 months and had two children together, Ako and Pili.
