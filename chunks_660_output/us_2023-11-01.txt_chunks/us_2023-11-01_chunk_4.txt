INTRODUCTION OF THE WORDS MATTER FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS ACT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-11-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 180 Pages: E1038 - E1038 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE WORDS MATTER FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Words Matter for the District of Columbia Courts Act, which would remove the term ``retarded'' from Title 11 of the District of Columbia Code and replace it with more appropriate and respectful terminology.
I am pleased that Representative Marc Molinaro is the co-lead of this bill.
Removing the term from the law has bipartisan support.
In 2010, Congress removed several instances of the term from federal law by passing Rosa's Law (P.L. 111-256).
Earlier this year, I joined both Republican and Democratic colleagues in introducing the Words Matter Act, which would remove several more instances of the term from federal law.
The term is used three times in Title 11 of the D.C. Code, and, under the D.C. Home Rule Act, only Congress can amend Title 11 of the D.C. Code.
There was a time when the term was a clinical term, but in more recent years, it has become a slur used against people with intellectual disabilities.
Words indisputably matter, and I know our country is better than keeping such language in our law.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
RECOGNIZING CVSOA PRESIDENT BRUCE WILBER; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 180 Pages: E1038 - E1039 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1038-E1039] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CVSOA PRESIDENT BRUCE WILBER ______ of wisconsin in the house of representatives Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Bruce A. Wilber, who has dedicated his life to serving both his country and his community.
Mr. Wilber's journey is one of resilience, dedication, and unwavering commitment to those he serves.
Born in June 1957 on the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshana, Wisconsin, Mr. Wilber emerged as a beacon of leadership, being the oldest of seven children.
His father's legacy as a Korean War veteran instilled in him a profound sense of duty to his country and eventually inspired him to join the military.
After answering the call to serve, Bruce Wilber became a motor transport operator stationed in Caserma Ederle, a base in Livorno, Italy.
Upon concluding his military service, Mr. Wilber transitioned to the civilian sector, where he contributed to the logging industry and later served in law enforcement.
Unfortunately, his law enforcement career was cut short due to an injury.
However, this setback did not deter him.
Mr. Wilber's tenacity shone through as he pursued an associate degree in alcohol and other drug abuse (AODA) counseling from the College of Menominee Nation.
His journey took a significant turn as he assumed the role of an AODA counselor at the Maehnowesekiyah Wellness Center, the treatment facility for the Menominee Nation.
In this capacity, he was instrumental in establishing and maintaining mental and physical wellness programs for veterans and members of the Menominee Tribe for a decade.
At each stop in his career, he continued to serve a greater purpose and those around him.
In August 2016, Mr. Wilber became the Tribal Veterans Service Officer (TVSO) and a County Veterans Service Officer (CVSO) for the Menominee Nation and Menominee County, respectively.
He extended his service by joining the Wisconsin County Veterans Service Officers Association (CVSOA), a vital organization that represents all 11 recognized tribes and 72 counties in Wisconsin.
After several years as a CVSO, it is with great pride that we acknowledge Mr. Wilber's election as the first Native American president of the State County Veterans Service Officer Association (CVSOA).
