Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) for receiving its highest ranking for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) according to U.S. News & World Report.
Under the leadership of UMES President, Dr. Heidi M. Anderson, U.S. News ranked UMES in the top 6 of public HBCUs, number 200 among all public colleges and universities, and number 14 among 78 HBCUs in their 2023-2024 report.
UMES ranked two spots higher than last year's report and is the university highest ranking since U.S. News created its HBCU category in 2007.
As the representative of Maryland's Eastern Shore, it is my distinct honor to recognize UMES for its remarkable achievement and I look forward to seeing the university continue to shape the minds of our Nation's future.
Congratulations to UMES and Go Hawks. ____________________
