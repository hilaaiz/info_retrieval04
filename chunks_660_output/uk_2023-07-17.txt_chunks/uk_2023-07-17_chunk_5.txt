RECOGNIZING THE 225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WASHINGTON COUNTY AGRICULTURAL

FAIR

HON.
GUY RESCHENTHALER

Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Washington

County on the 225th anniversary of its agricultural fair and celebrate

its importance to southwestern Pennsylvania's agricultural industry

over the years.
The Washington County Agricultural Fair is the oldest in

Pennsylvania, having started in 1798.
Since its creation, the annual

fair has promoted our community's achievements in agriculture,

horticulture, homemaking subjects, arts, and sciences.
It is also an

opportunity for 4-H clubs, FFA chapters, and many other community

organizations to share their work with friends, neighbors, and

visitors.
Today, the 8-day event attracts over 65,000 attendees each

year.
Thc fair is an important part of Washington County's history and

heritage.
Over 1,700 individual farms operate in the region, making

agriculture the largest industry in the county.
Generations of families and farmers have worked to build a thriving and

prosperous agricultural community, which is now a defining

characteristic of Washington County's economy and culture.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District,

I congratulate the Washington County Agricultural Fair on its 225th

anniversary.
I thank the staff, volunteers, and exhibitors for the

important services they provide to southwestern Pennsylvania

communities and hope for their continued success over the next 225

years.
