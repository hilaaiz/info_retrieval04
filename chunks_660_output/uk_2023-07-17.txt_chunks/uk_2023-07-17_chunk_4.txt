He supports all

local leaders of Nevada by providing them with information regarding

the Army Reserve and the economic impact to states and cities.
He has

also supported the Army Reserve Ambassador Program, which supports

students with full-ride scholarships to any ROTC program in the Nation

with the hope that they will one day return to the Southwest as

tomorrow's leaders.
In his over 30-year military career, including 10 different

assignments and 2 different services, Col.
Brown has shared his

knowledge and experience with hundreds of officers and enlisted

Soldiers, helping them to develop as leaders and enhance their careers.
Col.
Brown is an exceptional leader who will be greatly missed by the

U.S. military when he moves into retirement, while his service will be

long remembered by those he worked with.
There is no doubt that the

soldiers he helped train and mentor over his 30 years will continue to

build on his legacy of service and working to make our Nation stronger.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Colonel Jerry A. Brown

on his outstanding service to our Nation and in congratulating him on

his retirement.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO REQUIRE THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT SERVICES

AND OFFENDER SUPERVISION AGENCY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE

DIRECTOR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PRETRIAL SERVICES AGENCY TO RESIDE

IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would require

the Directors of 2 federal agencies, the Court Services and Offender

Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the

District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), to reside in the

District of Columbia during their terms.
Residency requirements for

certain government positions are found in federal law, D.C. law and the

laws of jurisdictions throughout the United States.
The primary reason

such laws exist is so that government officials have a connection to

the residents they serve and in-depth knowledge of the unique issues

and challenges faced by residents.
Last Congress, the House Committee

on Oversight and Reform passed this bill.
CSOSA and PSA are federal agencies that focus exclusively on D.C.

CSOSA supervises individuals on probation, parole or supervised release

under D.C. law.
PSA makes recommendations regarding pretrial release

and supervises defendants for the D.C. Superior Court and the U.S.

District Court for D.C. The Directors of CSOSA and PSA should be

required to be D.C. residents since these agencies serve only D.C.

Congress has justifiably required that certain federal officials live

in the jurisdictions to which they are appointed, including U.S.

district court judges, U.S. Marshals and U.S. Attorneys.
Similarly,

Congress, which controls the local D.C. court system, has justifiably

required local D.C. judges and members of the D.C. Judicial Nomination

Commission and the D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure

to reside in D.C.

There is no reason that the Directors of CSOSA and PSA, federal

agencies that uniquely serve D.C., should not be required to live in

D.C. These federal officials need to be part of the community they

serve.
A D.C. residency requirement for these federal officials will

lead to better outcomes in the criminal justice system and is a matter

of fairness for D.C. residents.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.
