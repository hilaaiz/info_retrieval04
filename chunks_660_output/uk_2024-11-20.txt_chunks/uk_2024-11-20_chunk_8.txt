On behalf of my colleagues, I extend heartfelt congratulations to

David and Phyllis Bell and their family for being named the Farm of the

Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association.
Their dedication to

preserving Michigan's agricultural heritage and fostering a sense of

community through farming serves as an inspiration to us all.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS

Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, agreed to by the Senate of February

4, 1977, calls for establishment of a system for a computerized

schedule of all meetings and hearings of Senate committees,

subcommittees, joint committees, and committees of conference.
This

title requires all such committees to notify the Office of the Senate

Daily Digest--designated by the Rules Committee--of the time, place and

purpose of the meetings, when scheduled and any cancellations or

changes in the meetings as they occur.
As an additional procedure along with the computerization of this

information, the Office of the Senate Daily Digest will prepare this

information for printing in the Extensions of Remarks section of the

Congressional Record on Monday and Wednesday of each week.
Meetings scheduled for Thursday, November 21, 2024 may be found in

the Daily Digest of today's Record.
