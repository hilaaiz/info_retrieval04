RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOOD SHEPHERD HOUSING & FAMILY

SERVICES, INC.
HON.
GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate

Good Shepherd Housing (GSH) on their 50th anniversary of dedicated

service to Fairfax County, Virginia, and to the thousands of

individuals and families whose lives have been transformed by their

efforts.
For half a century, Good Shepherd has been a cornerstone in our

community, providing safe, stable housing and vital support services to

those at risk of homelessness or struggling to remain in their homes

due to rising housing costs.
Their work has unlocked doors to brighter

futures for countless individuals and families, and they remain a

beacon of hope for those facing housing insecurity.
Good Shepherd is more than just a provider of affordable housing--it

is a catalyst for self-sufficiency and community resilience.
Through a

unique approach that focuses on the purchase and transformation of

properties into affordable housing, GSH has not only provided shelter

but has built a foundation for personal growth and long-term success.
By offering a comprehensive suite of support services--including case

management, financial education, and referrals to specialized

assistance--GSH helps families and individuals chart a path to

stability, independence, and empowerment.
Each year, GSH manages the needs of over 1,000 families and

individuals, helping them overcome obstacles and build a better future.
With a small but dedicated team--just 9 full-time staff, 3 part-time

staff, and over 40 volunteers--Good Shepherd Housing has managed to

accomplish extraordinary things.
The work they do, however, is made

possible not only by their staff but by the unwavering commitment of

their board members, volunteers, and the community that supports them.
As we celebrate Good Shepherd Housing's remarkable 50-year legacy, I

would like to extend my deepest gratitude to everyone who has played a

part in this incredible work--past and present board members, staff,

volunteers, and all the partners who have worked hand-in-hand with GSH

to strengthen our community.
I would also like to recognize the

outstanding leadership of Executive Director Genee Hayes and Deputy

Executive Director Candice Bennett.
Their dedication and vision have

been integral to the organization's growth and success, earning well

deserved recognition from the Washington Post, Leadership Fairfax, and

the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Their collective

impact serves as a reminder that when we invest in affordable housing

and support services, we unlock the potential for families to thrive,

not just survive.
Good Shepherd Housing is a true example of how innovative approaches

and community partnerships can make a tangible difference in the lives

of those who need it most.
The organization's case management team

works individually with residents to set personal goals, pursue

education, and improve financial literacy, helping to break the cycle

of poverty and create lasting change.
As we look to the future, I have no doubt that Good Shepherd Housing

will continue to be a leader in providing affordable housing solutions

and support services in our community.
