Good Shepherd Housing is a true example of how innovative approaches

and community partnerships can make a tangible difference in the lives

of those who need it most.
The organization's case management team

works individually with residents to set personal goals, pursue

education, and improve financial literacy, helping to break the cycle

of poverty and create lasting change.
As we look to the future, I have no doubt that Good Shepherd Housing

will continue to be a leader in providing affordable housing solutions

and support services in our community.
Their work is a testament to the

power of compassion, collaboration, and commitment to social justice.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Good

Shepherd Housing on their 50th anniversary and in expressing our thanks

for their tireless dedication to Fairfax County, Virginia.

RECOGNIZING THE LEONARD & SARAH BELL FARM IN UNIONVILLE

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Leonard and

Sarah Bell Farm in Unionville, Michigan, which has been named the Farm

of the Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association for 2024.
This

prestigious recognition honors farms that exemplify exceptional

qualities in five key areas: longevity, stewardship, historic

preservation, community involvement, and organizational membership and

promotional activity.
The Bell family's 76-acre farm, now owned and operated by David and

Phyllis Bell, is an enduring testament to Michigan's agricultural

heritage.
The farm's origins trace back to 1919, when Leonard and Sarah

Bell established the farm as part of their contribution to the

agricultural development of Tuscola County.
Leonard, a descendant of

some of the county's earliest families, cultivated a variety of crops,

including wheat, corn, navy beans, oats, and hay, supporting both his

livestock and the local economy.
In the decades since its founding, the farm has remained in the Bell

family for six generations, with David and Phyllis continuing the proud

legacy of sustainable farming.
Under their stewardship, the farm grows

a diverse range of crops--sugar beets, corn, navy beans, soybeans, and

wheat--carefully rotated each year to maintain soil health and

productivity.
The Bell farm has also earned several prestigious environmental and

historical designations, including a federal Certificate of Farm War

Service during World War II, a National Wildlife Federation Certified

Wildlife Habitat, a Monarch Waystation, and a Certified Butterfly

Garden.
These efforts not only preserve Michigan's natural beauty but

also demonstrate the Bell family's deep commitment to environmental

stewardship and biodiversity.
Beyond their agricultural achievements, the Bell family has been

active in their local community, participating in farm organizations

and sharing their story to promote the importance of preserving

Michigan's farming history.
Their farm is a living example of the

values that the Michigan Centennial Farm Association seeks to honor

each year.
It is also worth noting that the next generation of Bells, including

great-grandchildren, continue to take part in the farm's daily

operations.
Whether helping with the animals, or assisting with

planting and harvesting, their involvement in the farm ensures that

this important piece of Michigan history will continue to thrive for

many years to come.
On behalf of my colleagues, I extend heartfelt congratulations to

David and Phyllis Bell and their family for being named the Farm of the

Year by the Michigan Centennial Farm Association.
Their dedication to

preserving Michigan's agricultural heritage and fostering a sense of

community through farming serves as an inspiration to us all.
