When I was a young member of the General

Assembly, struggling to balance my law practice, service as a

legislator, and raising two young daughters, Jerry took me in.
He gave

me an office in his firm and was always there to help me with a case or

give advice about a tricky legal issue.
Jerry received many awards and accolades, but he would say that his

biggest success was his family.
He and Rosemarie were married for over

60 years, and they raised two sons, Sean and Brian.
Over the years,

Jerry spoke to me with such pride about the success of his boys.
Truly,

his family was the center of his life.
To scores of Colorado lawyers, Jerry was a guiding light and voice of

reason.
He gave us advice, set an example through his work, and showed

us what it meant to fight for people who needed a strong advocate.
His dedication to fairness and justice had a lasting impact on

generations of trial lawyers.
I am proud to have known Jerry and to

call him my friend.
Colorado's legal community mourns the loss of a giant.
