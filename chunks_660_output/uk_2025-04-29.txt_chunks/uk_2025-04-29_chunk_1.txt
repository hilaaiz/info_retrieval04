CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF THE RAILROAD MUSEUM OF PENNSYLVANIA

HON.
LLOYD SMUCKER

Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate and recognize

the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania for their 50th anniversary.
Originally created by an act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly,

the Railroad Museum opened its doors 50 years ago in April 1975.
The

first structure in North America specifically built as a railroad

museum, the Railroad Museum has since added building restorations, an

education center, a museum store, and many new exhibits.
The museum is

affiliated with the Smithsonian and the Pennsylvania Historical &

Museum Commission, and has received generous community support from an

aptly named nonprofit, the Friends of the Railroad Museum of

Pennsylvania.
Today, the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania's world-class collection

includes over 100 historic locomotives and railroad cars, a vast

library with half a million photographs and documents, a working

restoration shop, and 20,000 smaller items relating to Pennsylvania

railroads.
As the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania celebrates their golden

anniversary year, I would like to thank the museum for the educational

opportunities they provide and for their work in keeping not just our

community's history, but Pennsylvania's history, alive.

COMMEMORATING COACH GREG HEIAR AND THE TRINITY VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE

MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM ON THEIR HISTORIC NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP VICTORY

HON.
LANCE GOODEN

Mr. GOODEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the incredible

accomplishment of the Trinity Valley Community College Men's Basketball

Team, who, under the leadership of Coach Greg Heiar, secured their

first-ever national championship in 2025.
In his first season as head coach, Coach Heiar led the Cardinals to a

69-61 victory over Connors State in the NJCAA D1 Men's Basketball

National Championship in Hutchinson, Kansas.
This victory concluded a

dominant 34-3 season, marking the best in the program's history.
The Cardinals showed remarkable resilience, determination, and unity

throughout the season.
They embraced the tough, defense-first mentality

instilled by their coach, and each player's commitment to the team's

success played a critical role in bringing home this historic title.
I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Coach Heiar, his coaching

staff, and the entire men's basketball team.
Their hard work,

dedication, and pride in their community have made this championship a

lasting symbol of excellence for the Trinity Valley community.

HONORING JESSICA AROCHO

HON.
NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ

Ms. VELAZQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jessica Arocho, an

exceptional individual who has devoted her life to serving the North

Brooklyn community.
As the Director of Community Affairs at NYC Health

+ Hospitals/Woodhull, Jessica exemplifies the spirit of service that

defines our community leaders.
Jessica is a true product of Williamsburg, following in the footsteps

of her strong Puerto Rican mother, Dona Carmen Gines, and other

influential community leaders.
Her lifelong commitment to service began

in her childhood, when she frequently accompanied her mother to

Woodhull Hospital, their trusted medical home.
It is also where her

youngest daughter was born, and where Jessica began her career in the

Youth Outreach program.
Since taking on the role as Director of Community Affairs in January

2020, Jessica has been instrumental in enhancing the hospital's

outreach and building partnerships with local organizations.
She

advocates for good health and promotes positive energy within the

community, ensuring that residents have access to essential health

resources.
Her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic was particularly

noteworthy; she ensured that hospital staff received essential

supplies, including meals and personal protective equipment.
Additionally, she organized successful initiatives that provided

thousands of coats, toys, backpacks, and school supplies to families in

need.
Jessica's dedication extends beyond her professional

responsibilities.
