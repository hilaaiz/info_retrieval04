RECOGNIZING VADA CARAWAN

HON.
JENNIFER A. KIGGANS

Mrs. KIGGANS of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a

very brave young woman from Virginia's Second District.
Vada Carawan is

an 11-year-old Virginia Beach native who recently showed courage beyond

her years when she saved her father's life.
On November 23, 2024, Vada

was spending time with her father, Clinton, when he started to

experience what doctors later called ``sudden cardiac death,'' which

comes with no warning.
Just 11 days earlier, Clinton had driven Vada to

girl scouts where she learned how to perform CPR.
The moment Clinton

started to experience the cardiac event, Vada told herself that she

could cry once the EMT came, but before that she had to focus on saving

her dad's life.
Vada thinks she performed CPR for around 5 to 7

minutes, which doctors said was critical to saving her dad's life.
For

her heroism, Vada received the National Medal of Honor--Lifesaving

Award from the Girl Scouts of the United States of America.
Her bravery

and quick action in a time of distress is truly remarkable.
Virginia's

Second District is truly lucky to have such a fearless and impressive

member of the community and we are so thankful that her father is ok.
Please join me in recognizing Vada for her heroism.
