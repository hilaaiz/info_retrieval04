CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF DR.
JAMES WEST

HON.
WILEY NICKEL

Mr. NICKEL.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor the

life and legacy of a true champion of the people, Dr. James West, a

revered Wake County Commissioner and a beacon of hope for many in our

community.
It's with deep sorrow that we mark his passing, but with

immense gratitude that we celebrate his legacy.
Dr. James West dedicated his life to public service, always striving

to uplift those in need.
From his early days as a college student in

the 1960s, peacefully protesting segregation in Greensboro alongside

Jesse Jackson, to his extensive service as a Raleigh City Councilman

and Wake County Commissioner, his journey was marked by a relentless

commitment to justice and equality.
His academic achievements, including a doctorate in education, and a

three-decade-long career at the North Carolina Cooperative Extension

Service at NC State University laid the foundation for his deep

understanding of the issues facing our community.
Dr. West was proud to

be the first black person in the U.S. to become Director of County

Operations for the North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service, with

the responsibility of supervising over 1,000 faculty and staff members.
Dr. West's tenure on the Raleigh City Council, including his time as

Mayor Pro Tem, was characterized by his visionary leadership and his

ability to forge meaningful partnerships.
His work with the Southeast

Raleigh Alliance, which he co-founded, exemplified his commitment to

economic empowerment and community development.
In his role as a County Commissioner, Dr. West was instrumental in

the creation of the Live Well Wake initiative, aimed at enhancing the

health and wellbeing of the community.
His efforts to expand affordable

housing and his leadership in the Health and Human Services Committee

highlight his holistic approach to public service and his belief that

every individual deserves dignity and stability.
Dr. West's legacy is not just in the programs he initiated or the

policies he championed, but in the countless lives he touched, the

community leaders he inspired, and the unquantifiable impact of his

compassion and leadership.
We remember Dr. West for his ``Dr. West-isms,'' his wisdom, and his

unwavering faith in the power of community.
He taught us the importance

of strengthening our ``spiritual infrastructure,'' and he believed

deeply in the potential of every individual.
As we mourn Dr. James West's passing, we also celebrate his

extraordinary life--a life dedicated to service, equality, and the

betterment of Wake County and its people.
My thoughts are with his

family, friends, and all those who were fortunate enough to know him.

HONORING THE 26TH ANNIVERSARY PASSING OF FORMER MAYOR COLEMAN YOUNG

HON.
SHRI THANEDAR

Mr. THANEDAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the

longest serving mayor of the city I so proudly represent, Mayor Coleman

A. Young, on the 26th anniversary of his passing.
Born in the throes of segregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mayor Young

rose from the humble beginnings of the Great Migration to become a

beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for the city of Detroit.
His

journey was marked not just by the offices he held, but by the

indomitable spirit he embodied--a spirit that challenged inequality,

fought for justice, and tirelessly sought to uplift every resident of

Detroit.
As Detroit's first African-American mayor, he broke barriers and

built bridges.
He led our city through times of challenge and change,

always with an unwavering vision for a more inclusive and prosperous

Detroit.
His efforts to integrate the Detroit Police Department and to

fight excessive use of force were not just administrative actions, but

bold steps towards healing and unity.
