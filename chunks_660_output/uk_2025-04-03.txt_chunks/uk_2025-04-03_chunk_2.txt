CELEBRATING PASTOR KENNETH SIMMONS' 12TH PASTORAL ANNIVERSARY

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the

remarkable leadership and service of Pastor Kenneth Simmons as we honor

his 12th Pastoral Anniversary at Cold Spring Bible Chapel.
Pastor

Simmons' influence extends far beyond the walls of the church, making a

lasting impact on the lives of those in need.
Along with First Lady

Jamelle Simmons, Pastor Simmons has touched the hearts of countless

individuals throughout our community.
His work has inspired many to

pursue positive change, creating a ripple effect of compassion and

support that continues to shape the future of Western New York.
For over two decades, Pastor Simmons has dedicated his life to

mentoring youth, aiding returning citizens in their re-entry to

society, and supporting local organizations.
He has worked tirelessly

with little league sports organizations, block clubs, and street

outreach programs, bringing hope and opportunity to countless families.
One of his most notable contributions has been his work with the Youth

Detention Center, where his efforts have transformed the facility,

earning recognition from the State Office of Child and Family Services

for turning it into a model for the entire state.
Pastor Simmons has also made it a priority to reach out to the less

fortunate in our community, providing critical support for those who

need it most.
For over a decade, he and his congregation have blessed

thousands of youth with school supplies and book bags, ensuring they

have the resources needed to succeed in their education.
His dedication

to helping the youth in our community, especially in the 14208 area and

along Jefferson Avenue, has changed lives and inspired many to follow

in his footsteps.
It is an honor to recognize Pastor Kenneth Simmons for his unwavering

commitment to serving our community and exemplifying the power of

faith, service, and love.
Pastor Simmons' work continues to uplift

those around him, and I am proud to stand with him in celebrating this

incredible milestone.
I thank him for all that he has done, and may God

continue to bless him and his ministry.
