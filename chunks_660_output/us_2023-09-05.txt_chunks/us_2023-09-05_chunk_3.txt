From the Levon and Satenig Nazarian Primary School in Lebanon to the Levon and Claudia Nazarian Radiology Center, to name just a few, Mr. Nazarian's philanthropic endeavors support Armenians across the globe.
Likewise, his vision to connect and promote the Armenian community led to the construction of the Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in Lebanon and the AGBU Armenia building in Yerevan.
He also focused his philanthropic endeavors to serve the Church, supporting the construction of St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral in New York and the St. Dertad chapel at St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral in Yerevan, among others.
His commitment to faith, culture and the arts, as well as social and humanitarian causes have left an indelible mark on the community.
Mr. Nazarian lived his life in service to his community and his passion to help others is evident.
Born in Aleppo, Syria and raised in Lebanon, Mr. Nazarian immigrated to the United States in the 1950s.
Together with his late wife Artemis Topjian, Mr. Nazarian instilled in their children the importance of hard work and community service.
Mr. Nazarian leaves behind a loving family, including his daughter Seta, son Levon and his wife Claudia, 5 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren, who will no doubt continue the Nazarian legacy of charity and compassion.
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will join me in honoring Nazar L. Nazarian for his devotion to family, faith, and community.
His generous spirit and impact on the Armenian community both here and abroad will continue to be felt for generations to come. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE PROTECTING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FROM DISCRIMINATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
142



Date: 2023-09-05 Volume: 169, Issue: 142 Pages: E810 - E811 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E810-E811] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE PROTECTING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FROM DISCRIMINATION ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Protecting Independent Contractors from Discrimination Act, which would extend to independent contractors the same federal antidiscrimination protections provided to employees.
This bill would extend the following antidiscrimination statutes, which apply to employees, to independent contractors: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 7 percent of workers are considered independent contractors.
Independent contractors, who often do the same work as employees, have almost none of the workplace protections provided to employees, including health insurance, collective bargaining, retirement security and even antidiscrimination.
This bill focuses only on discrimination, from which every worker is entitled to be free. ____________________
