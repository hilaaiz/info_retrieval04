Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero Krissy Sarine-Van Brunt, who founded the non-profit organization Just Because, which is dedicated to giving back to under- resourced communities in North Texas.
Krissy founded Just Because after she and her daughter observed the hardship of homelessness in the scorching Texas heat.
She compiled a list of several necessities that the homeless desire and went to Facebook to seek help.
Through that act, Just Because was started after she received overwhelming support online.
Krissy has also partnered with Bombas to donate over 8,000 pairs of socks to the homeless in our community.
In addition to providing Blessing Bags to the homeless, Krissy also volunteers at nursing homes and animal shelters in her spare time.
I'd like to thank Krissy for going above and beyond for our community.
Her selflessness and dedication do not go unnoticed. ____________________
