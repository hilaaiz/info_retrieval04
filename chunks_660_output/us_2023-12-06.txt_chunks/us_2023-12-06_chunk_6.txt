Bessie was a loving mother who used a tragic experience to effect meaningful change in the name of Justice here in North Texas.
On July 24, 1973, Bessie's life changed forever, when her 12-year-old son, Santos, was fatally shot by Dallas law enforcement.
Santos meant everything to Bessie.
However, she turned tragedy into action.
She used the death of her son to start a movement to boost accountability and transparency in the police and community relations here that is still being felt in North Texas today.
Just this year, Dallas commemorated the 50th anniversary of Santos' murder by holding multiple events to push for justice.
The commemoration of this solemn anniversary would not have been possible without Bessie's work.
I once again rise today to commemorate Bessie's legacy.
I am praying for her extended family during this time. ____________________

HOPE KIRKENDALL ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss and honor the legacy of a World War II heroine from Lakeland, FL, Lt.
Hope Kirkendall.
She passed away at the age of 103, carrying her spiritedness, heart of service and witty sense of humor until her final days.
During World War II, Lt.
Kirkendall was a nurse in the U.S. Army and was one of the first women to land in Normandy shortly after the Allied Forces' D-Day invasion.
She arrived one month after the initial invasion and achieved the rank of first lieutenant, working around the clock with her surgical team to care for soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifices in the Battle for Brest and the Battle of the Bulge.
Decades after her service, Lt.
Kirkendall recounted getting involved in military life because she was young and wanted to see everything.
She certainly achieved that goal Among her adventures, Kirkendall traveled in an ambulance convoy, using a gas can for a seat.
She moved with field hospitals, taking in the wounded near the front lines.
And amongst the chaos and the tragedy, she said she found a home.
In 2017, Lt.
Kirkendall received the French Knight in the Legion of Honor award for her expertise and bravery during bombings and in the line of fire.
Lt.
Kirkendall went on to raise five children after the war and continued her duties off the battlefield caring for patients who needed psychiatric assessments.
She is survived by two siblings, five children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
Sadly, we are losing more of the greatest generation each day.
May Hope rest in peace.
She is truly an American hero. ____________________
