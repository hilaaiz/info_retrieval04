I was fortunate enough to call her my friend, and as her sudden passing leaves a deep hole of grief for so many, it is fitting that we pause to reflect on all she gave to our state.
Kathy began her career in the Michigan Legislature, where she served as chief of staff to former Senator Bill Sederburg.
From the start, she was known for her prowess in communications and policy issues, and she went on to serve in the administration of former Michigan Governor John Engler, heading up three different departments during her tenure--the only woman in Michigan history to do so.
In the early 2000s, she began the next chapter of her career with our state's public universities, first at Central Michigan University where she served as interim president, vice president of advancement and external relations, and vice president for government relations.
But of the many titles Kathy held over her decades-long career, one the closest to her heart was Spartan.
Kathy was a super-alumna, holding not one, not two, but three degrees from MSU: a bachelor's degree in Journalism, a master's degree in higher education administration, and a Ph.
D in the same, and even served one term on the university's Board of Trustees.
In 2018, she joined Michigan State University's staff, where she served as senior vice president for government relations.
Under her tenure, the university secured funding and support for landmark projects, including the Engineering and Digital Innovation Center, the MSU greenhouses, and the MSU Apple Academy.
Her steady hand helped guide the university through good times and bad, driven by an unshakable faith in the power of higher education, clothed in green and white.
Over the years, Kathy was a mentor to so many, and I personally benefited from her knowledge and her wisdom.
Her door was always open, her invitation to coffee sincere, her cup of kindness bottomless.
She graciously shared her experience with all, and was truly invested in seeing others succeed.
From Kathy, I learned what it means to advocate, and the power of active listening.
Her life was a testament to the power of getting things done, and the role one person can play to make positive change.
I send my deepest condolences to all who knew and loved Kathy, particularly

her husband, Tom, their four sons, Tom, Will, Sam, and Ray; her granddaughter, Mary; and the entire Michigan State University family.
Kathy Wilbur's accomplishments, her passion, and her compassion will live on in our hearts and on the banks of the Red Cedar in East Lansing. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Claude Morse, who sadly passed away November 12, ========================= END NOTE ========================= Claude was a selfless example of volunteerism, and not the kind of symbolic of volunteerism that simply amounts to adding his name to a group.
When a need and a project arose, Claude was never just a worker; he was a planner, an organizer, a manager, and a participant.
