Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Claude Morse, who sadly passed away November 12, ========================= END NOTE ========================= Claude was a selfless example of volunteerism, and not the kind of symbolic of volunteerism that simply amounts to adding his name to a group.
When a need and a project arose, Claude was never just a worker; he was a planner, an organizer, a manager, and a participant.
Morse was actively involved with several nonprofit organizations throughout Coffee County.
Honor Flight, Project Appleseed and the Arnold Community Council are just a few of the organizations to which Morse devoted his time and efforts.
As President of Honor Flight Middle Tennessee, Claude worked tirelessly to take eligible World War II, Korean War and Vietnam veterans on a free trip to see war memorials in Washington, DC.
It remains my great honor to personally welcome as many of these heroes as I can when they come, and it was always a special treat to get to spend time with Claude as well.
Over the past several years, Claude has sponsored hundreds of hero veterans and hundreds of hours of work to see it accomplished.
Yet to him, it was simply time well spent to recognize those who deserved it.
In addition, Claude also was a long-time member and President of the Arnold Community Council, a group that promotes, protects, and preserves the Arnold Engineering Development Complex (AEDC) in Tullahoma, Tennessee and to facilitate interaction and cooperation between the complex and surrounding communities.
Claude and many of his colleagues would spend time every year visiting the Tennessee Congressional delegation, other key members of Congress, members of the Tennessee General Assembly, and officials with the Department of Defense to advocate for and advance the mission of the facility.
His group would also sponsor awards for AEDC personnel, the annual AEDC veteran's picnic, the ACC job fair, the Honor Flights and the AEDC children's Christmas party.
Claude was also a committee member for Wreaths Across America, an organization that places wreaths on fallen veterans' graves during Christmas.
He was also a natural candidate for public service and was selected as

a Commissioner for the Coffee County Government.
He was a recipient of the Governor's Volunteer Star Award for all his efforts and selected as an AEDC lifetime achievement fellow.
I am proud to represent a community that has the utmost respect for all the men and women who have served our country with valor and honor as members of our armed forces.
Claude never took a day off in making sure that we always prioritized that commitment to all of those who have served, are serving, and will serve.
I will miss Claude and his hard work, and most importantly, his friendship and support.
I ask all Members of Congress to join me in paying respect to Claude Morris for a lifetime of service to country and community, and I ask this institution to join me in sending the deepest sympathies to all his family and friends. ____________________
