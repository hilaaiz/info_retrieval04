JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my constituent Frank J. Thornton for his 28 years of service on the Henrico County Board of Supervisors representing the Fairfield Magisterial District.
Frank is a history maker, becoming the first African American elected to the Henrico Board of Supervisors in 1995 representing the Fairfield Magisterial District.
He was elected as the Board's chairman for the sixth time in January 2023 and will complete his tenure with his retirement at the end of this year.
A native of Richmond, Mr. Thornton co-founded and served as president of the Henrico Civic League.
His academic accomplishments include a bachelor's degree from Virginia Union University and a master's degree from American University.
Mr. Thornton retired in 2014 after a distinguished 40-year career as a professor of French at Virginia Union, where he earned accolades such as the Teacher of the Year award.
Mr. Thornton left an indelible mark on his students, community members, and our Commonwealth.
In 1987, Mr. Thornton initially sought election to represent the Fairfield District, and though unsuccessful, he played a pivotal role in a successful federal lawsuit alongside the Henrico Civic League and the American Civil Liberties Union.
This lawsuit challenged and overturned Henrico's magisterial district lines, with the court ruling against county officials who had ensured that Black residents were the minority in every district.
As Henrico County Supervisor, Mr. Thornton demonstrated unwavering commitment to the residents of the Fairfield District.
Under his leadership, initiatives were implemented to expand the Greater Richmond Transportation Company (GRTC) bus service to Short Pump, construct several libraries and recreation centers in the county, and expand access to public health services.
Beyond his local responsibilities, Mr. Thornton extended his public service to various organizations, including the Richmond Regional Transportation Planning Organization, the Capital Region Collaborative Organizing Council, and the Maymont Foundation Board of Directors, among others.
Virginia's Fourth Congressional District has been privileged to benefit from the passionate and devoted advocacy of Mr. Thornton for civil rights and social change.
Mr. Speaker, I commend Mr. Thornton for his outstanding leadership and extend my best wishes for a fulfilling retirement from the Henrico County Board of Supervisors.
His legacy, marked by tireless dedication, will undoubtedly endure. ____________________
HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF SERVICE OF KATHLEEN M. WILBUR; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-12-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 201 Pages: E1185 - E1186 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1185-E1186] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF SERVICE OF KATHLEEN M. WILBUR ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr Speaker, today I pay tribute to a remarkable woman who dedicated her professional career to making the state of Michigan, its government, its institutions, and its character stronger and better.
Kathy Wilbur was a fierce advocate and a devoted public servant in both government and higher education, and brought her two passions together in the role she held for the past five years at her alma mater, Michigan State University.
I was fortunate enough to call her my friend, and as her sudden passing leaves a deep hole of grief for so many, it is fitting that we pause to reflect on all she gave to our state.
Kathy began her career in the Michigan Legislature, where she served as chief of staff to former Senator Bill Sederburg.
From the start, she was known for her prowess in communications and policy issues, and she went on to serve in the administration of former Michigan Governor John Engler, heading up three different departments during her tenure--the only woman in Michigan history to do so.
