Mr Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 50 years of marriage between Jimmy and Hava McClintock of Heath, Texas.
They have made significant contributions to our community and are longtime advocates for the U.S.-Israel alliance.
Jimmy is a native Texan, while Hava was born in a small town outside of Tel Aviv.
They first met each other in Israel, where they married in 1973.
For seven years, they lived in Israel.
In 1983, Jimmy and Hava moved to Rockwall, Texas, before settling in Heath.
During their many years together, Jimmy and Hava have made it their life's mission to advocate for our shared Judeo-Christian values.
Since 1976, they have organized private and congregational tours to Israel.
These tours have strengthened the friendship between communities and highlighted Israel's important struggle for peace and security.
Furthermore, Jimmy and Hava are board members of their local chapter of the Friends of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), where they provide material support to the IDF and support Israel's right to defend itself.
They also serve on the boards of God's Grace International and Netivyah, where they coordinate humanitarian assistance for Holocaust survivors in Israel and those in need.
I commend Jimmy and Hava for working diligently to aid those facing difficult circumstances so that they will not be overlooked.
I have requested the United States flag to be flown over our Nation's Capitol in recognition of Jimmy and Hava McClintock's impressive milestone.
It is truly wonderful to commemorate their five decades of happiness and joy, and here's to many more.
May God Bless them. ____________________
