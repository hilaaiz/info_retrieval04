Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the

50th anniversary of Ann Arbor Meals on Wheels.
For the last half-

century, the program has been diligently serving homebound members of

the community when they need it most.
We thank Ann Arbor Meals on

Wheels and its team members for their service, and we are excited to

see how the program will continue to serve the community.

Ms. FOXX.
Mr Speaker, I rise to acknowledge members of the Associated

Equipment Distributors from all over the country who came to D.C. for

their annual fly-in.
These great men and women are entrepreneurs who

provide millions of pieces of equipment to all kinds of industries in

our country every year that help our country's economy.
They deserve

our admiration and thanks.
They certainly have mine.
