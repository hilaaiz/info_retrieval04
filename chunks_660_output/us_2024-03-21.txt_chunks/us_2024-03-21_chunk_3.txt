HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-21 Volume: 170, Issue: 50 Pages: E275 - E276 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E275-E276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL ______ of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Mr. MEUSER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 100th anniversary of Battery Council International or commonly known as BCI.
In March of 1924, 25 firms launched the National Battery Manufacturer's Association--the group that would eventually become Battery Council International.
Since then, BCI has been the leading trade association for unlocking the potential of energy storage and supporting the commercial integration of essential products.
BCI members are committed to safe, responsible battery manufacturing and sustaining the world's most successful circular economy.
The domestic lead battery industry is an American manufacturing story that should make us all proud to be a part of.
The industry in the United States has more than 165 GWh of manufacturing capacity, 39 lead battery manufacturing facilities, over 250,000 lead battery collection and distribution sites, and 9 lead battery recycling facilities.
Lead batteries have a nearly 100 percent recycling rate, an industry sustainability achievement deserving of our recognition.
The U.S. battery industry powers roughly $8.1 trillion worth of domestic industrial economic output annually, or roughly 20 percent of the U.S. economy.
Forty-eight million jobs are related to or reliant on the battery industry and related downstream businesses.
And the industry continues to invest to meet the future.
The batteries made by BCI members over the past century have powered nearly a billion vehicles in the U.S. alone--a staggering contribution to American mobility.
