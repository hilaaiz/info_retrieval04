She was born on July 15, 1971.
She was employed with the King George Sheriff's Office as an Animal Control Officer from 2013 to 2020 and was employed with the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Office at the time of her passing.
While with the Westmoreland County Sheriff's Office, she served as the Animal Shelter Manager, Animal Control Officer, and Animal Advocate.
In every position, Teresa was a dedicated worker.
Even when she was not working with the Sheriff's Office, she would often answer text messages about dangerous dogs in the middle of the night and help the community with animal related matters.
Teresa was often described as a sweet and kind lady, often assisting her family, friends, and the community.
While Teresa was a genuinely kind and sweet natured person, she was also very straightforward-- leaving little room for misinterpretation.
If Teresa said it, she meant it.
She was a protector of her family and what was right.
Teresa leaves to cherish her precious memory, her husband, Kevin McDowney of Colonial Beach, VA, and son, Nathaniel Pittman of Williamsburg, VA.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in celebrating the life of Teresa McDowney.
May God bless her family and her community during this time. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the outstanding contributions and public service of Mr. Joe Mislinski.
Joe Mislinski is as a distinguished graduate of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, Class of 1978.
A trailblazer in his own right, Joe was pan of the inaugural class that permitted members to select specialties beyond combat-arms, choosing the Ordnance Corps.
Notably, Joe became the first CSMA graduate to attend the joint service Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) school, reflecting his courage and readiness for challenging assignments.
Joe served with distinction throughout his active-duty tenure, including deployments in the United States supporting the Secret Service and in Germany with the Combat Engineers in the 3rd Armored Division during the Cold War.
Joe exhibited unwavering commitment to national defense and global security, championing America's priorities on the world stage.
Following his military service, Joe continued to epitomize the values of Duty, Honor, Country as an active member of the West Point Society of Chicago.
Over two decades, in various capacities, including serving as board member and ultimately president, Joe was dedicated to mentoring new cadets and fostering connections among West Point alumni in Chicago.
Joe has also served as chair of my Military Service Academy Selection Committee for the 10th Congressional District.
As Representative for the 10th District of Illinois, one of my most significant responsibilities is nominating students to our Nation's esteemed military academies.
Since my first term in the 113th Congress, Joe has generously volunteered his time and extensive institutional knowledge to assist me in interviewing and ultimately nominating our future military leaders.
