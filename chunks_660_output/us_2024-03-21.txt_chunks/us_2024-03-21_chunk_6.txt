Joe has also served as chair of my Military Service Academy Selection Committee for the 10th Congressional District.
As Representative for the 10th District of Illinois, one of my most significant responsibilities is nominating students to our Nation's esteemed military academies.
Since my first term in the 113th Congress, Joe has generously volunteered his time and extensive institutional knowledge to assist me in interviewing and ultimately nominating our future military leaders.
As Joe embarks on a new chapter with his family in Connecticut, his commitment to service remains undiminished, as he will serve as coordinator for admissions to West Point for the state of Connecticut Joe's legacy will continue to inspire us all, underscoring the profound influence of one individual on our communities.
Once again, I extend my deepest gratitude to Joe Mislinski for his distinguished service to the Nation, the 10th District of Illinois, his tireless efforts in support of West Point, and his continued commitment to excellence in all endeavors. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-21 Volume: 170, Issue: 50 Pages: E278 - E278 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MRS.
AMY BUSH ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Mrs. Amy Bush for her dedicated service to the Hanford community and to congratulate her on her well-earned retirement as Head Coach of the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball Team.
Mrs. Bush, a teacher at Kings River Hardwick Elementary School in Hanford, became the Head Coach of the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball program in 2015.
Under her leadership, the Golden Bears have won an impressive 213 games and maintained a winning percentage of almost 80 percent.
Over the past nine seasons, the Golden Bears have also earned two undefeated Tri- County Conference Championships and six East Sequoia League Championships.
In 2017, the team won their first California Interscholastic Federal (CIF) Section Championship and advanced to the CIF Semi-Finals.
Just one year later, Mrs. Bush led the team to victory at the CIF State Southern Regional and Division V State Championships-- the first in Sierra Pacific High School's history.
During her tenure, Mrs. Bush has received numerous awards to recognize her accomplishments as Head Coach.
In 2018, she was named the Cal-Hi Sports Division V State Coach of the Year.
Two years later, she earned the CIF Central Section National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) Coach of the Year and was nominated for Federation's State NFHS Coach of the Year.
This season, Mrs. Bush has been honored as the Tri-County Conference Co-Coach of the Year.
In addition to her achievements on the court, Mrs. Bush has worked hard to ensure the Golden Bears are active in the Central Valley community.
Over the years, the team has put together several donation drives to support local residents, including drives to support the families of fallen firefighters and police officers.
The team also volunteers every year at the Episcopal Church of the Savior Parish Soup Kitchen.
During the COVID-19 Pandemic, the team donated food items to the Kings Pantry to give back to local families.
The success of the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball Team is a true testament to Mrs. Bush's character and dedication to the program.
While she will be missed as Head Coach, I am confident that her leadership will have a lasting impact on the Golden Bears for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Mrs. Amy Bush for her dedication to the Sierra Pacific High School Girls Basketball Team and the Central Valley.
I wish her a happy and well-deserved retirement. ____________________
