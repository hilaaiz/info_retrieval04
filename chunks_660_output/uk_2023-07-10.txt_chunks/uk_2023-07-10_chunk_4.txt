RECOGNIZING THE 2022-2023 MID VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS SOFTBALL TEAM'S

STATE CHAMPIONSHIP

HON.
MATT CARTWRIGHT

Mr. CARTWRIGHT.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the incredible

achievements of the 2022-2023 Mid Valley High School softball team.
During this year's season, the Spartanettes brought great pride to our

community by winning the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic

Association (PIAA) 3A State Championship for the first time in school

history.
As the Member of the U.S. House representing the Mid Valley School

District, I'm proud to celebrate the hard work, leadership, and

comradery of the Spartanettes that led to their championship.
They

played with passion and a sense of faith in one another which was

evident in every game.
They demonstrated that when a group of

individuals support each other with a common goal, anything is

possible.
I want to acknowledge the coaching staff, led by Coach Mike Piercy,

and Assistant Coach Joseph Bour, who have instilled a culture of

commitment, integrity, and respect in these athletes.
Under their

guidance, Mid Valley truly played a season worthy of the first-ever

softball state title in Mid Valley history.
The success of the 2022-2023 team is also a reflection of the support

they received from their school and locality.
From parents and families

who cheered them on in every game, including traveling to Penn State

from Mid Valley for the championship.
By teachers and staff who have

provided guidance and encouragement, and by the businesses and

organizations that also supported the team, the Mid Valley Spartanettes

have been lifted up and given confidence by the entire community.
In Northeastern Pennsylvania we believe in the power of working

together and showing civic spirit.
The Mid Valley Spartanettes

championship is a testament to the strength of that belief.
These

athletes demonstrated what can happen when we support our young people

to the fullest.
So, I congratulate the 2022-2023 Mid Valley High School softball team

on their historic season and thank them for inspiring us all.
I'm proud

to represent Mid Valley and look forward to celebrating many more

successes in the future.
