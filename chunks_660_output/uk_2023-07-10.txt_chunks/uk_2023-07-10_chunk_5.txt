========================= END NOTE =========================

NABI brings together thousands of students each year to compete, but

its legacy goes far beyond the basketball court.
NABI inspires our

youth through education and empowerment programs that instill the

values of being a good teammate, friend, and citizen.
This minority and

women-led organization has created opportunities for Native American

athletes to shine at the collegiate and professional levels.
NABI's

advocacy on and off the courts has resulted in nearly half a million

dollars in scholarships for youth through its College Scholarship

Fund--breaking down barriers to allow students to pursue their highest

ambitions.
I thank the NABI founders GinaMarie Scarpa and Mark West, its

community partners and those involved in this commendable endeavor.
Our

community is stronger because of them.
I am confident that their

passion and service will continue to empower and inspire generations to

come.

RECOGNIZING THE RAPPAHANNOCK HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS TENNIS TEAM STATE

CHAMPIONSHIP

HON.
ROBERT J. WITTMAN

Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the

Rappahannock High School Girls Tennis Team for capping off their

undefeated season with the VHSL Class 1 State Championship.
On June 8th, the Raiders ended their season on a high note.
At the

Burrows-Burleson Tennis Center at Virginia Tech, each member of the

Rappahannock High School Girls Tennis Team had high level performances,

defeating George Wythe 5-3.
Leading up to the title match, the team had

a 5-1 win over Buffalo Gap in the state semifinals and a 5-0 win over

Riverheads in the state quarterfinals.
I would like to recognize Head Coach Ms. Taylor Yeatman for her great

leadership throughout the season.
Next, I would like to recognize the

student-athletes themselves for their hard work: Mackenzie Ferguson,

Layla Gaines, Haley Haydon, Ciera Mundie, Sadie Packett, Virginia

Trible, Averil Vaughan, Addison Vaughn, Laney Williams, and Maggie

Wonderling.
And finally, I would like to recognize the assistant coaches: Mr.

Jamie Pritchard and Mr. Jackie Morris.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the accomplishments

and hard work of the student-athletes, coaches, and volunteers of the

Rappahannock High School Girls Tennis Team.
I look forward to seeing

their continued excellence on the court.
