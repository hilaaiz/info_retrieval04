Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Illece Buckley

Weber, Mayor of the City of Agoura Hills, and an inspirational public

servant who has dedicated her career to being a voice for the people

who call this beautiful and vibrant community home.
Throughout her tenure, Mayor Buckley Weber has been a tireless

advocate for her community, prioritizing the values of collaboration,

service, and progress.
Her leadership has not only guided Agoura Hills

through challenging moments but has also laid the foundation for

continued growth and prosperity.
In 1992, Illece moved to Agoura Hills with her husband Joe and their

two children, Sara and David.
Seeking that quintessential small-town

feel and an excellent school district, Illece and Joe knew Agoura Hills

was the right fit for their family.
We are so fortunate that they chose

to make this wonderful city their home.
At the heart of public service is the burning desire to create a

better world for our children--a world where they can learn and grow to

reach their fullest potential.
Illece's commitment to serving this

unique city was only strengthened by her deep appreciation and

admiration for Agoura Hills' bountiful natural beauty.
It is no

surprise that she decided to take the next step and immerse herself in

local governance.
In 2006, she was appointed to the Agoura Hills

Planning Commission, and in 2011, she was elected to the City Council,

where she has dutifully and faithfully served the Agoura Hills

community for nearly 13 years.
Illece has served on all of the city's subcommittees with an emphasis

on Public Works, Environmental Sustainability, and Community Services.
A fierce defender and protector of the city's natural landscape, Illece

currently serves as the Chairperson and Agoura Hills representative on

the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Advisory Committee as well as

the Chair of the CalCities Environmental Quality Policy Committee.
In addition to her prominent committee roles and leadership positions

across our region, Illece has had the honor of serving as the City of

Agoura Hills Mayor in 2015, 2020, and 2024.
Her steadfast and positive

leadership has been enjoyed not only by the residents of Agoura Hills,

but also by the many families, businesses, and organizations of the

Conejo Valley.
Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work with

Illece to bring to fruition two projects near and dear to her heart--

and to the heart of this community.
In partnership with the City of

Agoura Hills, we successfully secured $3 million in federal funding for

the civic center microgrid and the design and construction of critical

infrastructure of the city's bicycle master plan.
Mayor Buckley Weber's commitment to enhancing the quality of life for

the residents of Agoura Hills is evident in every initiative she has

championed.
Whether working on preserving the city's open spaces,

improving public services, or fostering a strong sense of community,

she has always placed the needs of her constituents and her neighbors

at the center of her work.
Beyond her achievements on the Agoura Hills City Council, Mayor

Buckley Weber has also served as a role model for civic engagement.
Her

dedication and passion for public service have inspired countless

individuals in Agoura Hills to get involved and make a positive impact

in their own community.
As she steps down from her seat on the City Council, I am proud to

join our community in acknowledging her profound contributions and

expressing our gratitude for her leadership.
Agoura Hills is a better

place because of her vision and hard work, and her legacy will continue

to inspire those who follow in her footsteps.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great admiration and respect that I recognize

Illece Buckley Weber for her remarkable service to the City of Agoura

Hills.
We thank her for her dedication and wish her all the best in the

next chapter of her journey.
