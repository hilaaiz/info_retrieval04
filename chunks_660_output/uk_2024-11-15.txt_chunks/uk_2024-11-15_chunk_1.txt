CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF SERVICE AT ERIE COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER'S CENTER

FOR OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the

Erie County Medical Center's Center for Occupational and Environmental

Medicine as they commemorate a decade of service to the public.
Established in 2014, the Center for Occupational and Environmental

Medicine was created as a state-of-the-art medical resource dedicated

to the occupational and environmental health field.
Over the past decade, the Center has steadfastly fulfilled its

mission to provide high-quality healthcare services for all in the

Western New York legion.
With a commitment to preventing work-related

illnesses and injuries, the Center has become an invaluable asset to

our community, ensuring that workers receive the comprehensive care

they deserve.
The Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine team has

diligently served thousands of patients, addressing a wide range of

health issues related to the workplace.
The Center offers an array of

clinical services tailored to meet the needs of our dynamic Western New

York workforce.
The inclusion of social work and wellness programs is

often reflected in their holistic approach to health, recognizing that

well-being extends beyond mere medical treatment.
The impact of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine

reaches far beyond individual patients.
By managing the broad spectrum

of diseases associated with workplace exposures, they contribute to a

healthier workforce and a stronger community.
Each patient treated,

each injury prevented, and each illness managed helps to uphold the

fabric of our community and ensures that all who contribute to our

local economy can do so with the assurance of care and support.
Today, as we look back on the past ten years, let us also look

forward with hope and determination.
The need for occupational and

environmental health services is as critical as ever.
Congratulations

to the Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine as they

continue to innovate, adapt, and expand our services to meet the ever-

evolving needs of our community.

CELEBRATING WARREN B. GELMAN'S INDUCTION INTO THE GREATER BUFFALO

SPORTS HALL OF FAME

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Warren B.

Gelman's induction into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame--a

fitting tribute to his lifetime of service, leadership, and dedication

to the athletic community of Western New York.
Mr. Gelman's life is a

testament to the power of passion, hard work, and a commitment to

others.
As one of the founding members of the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of

Fame, Warren has been integral to the organization's growth and success

since its inception in 1991.
As chair of the Nominating Committee for

the Hall of Fame, Warren helped shape its structure, bringing together

a group of passionate volunteers who sought to honor the legion's

greatest athletes and sports figures.
His tireless work over the years

has contributed to the Hall of Fame's enduring legacy.
Mr. Gelman's contributions to Buffalo extend far beyond his work with

the Hall of Fame.
A former three-sport athlete, Warren excelled in

soccer, hockey, and baseball before continuing his athletic journey at

Yale University.
There, he captained both the undefeated 1963-1964

freshman hockey team and the 1966-1967 varsity hockey team, which

earned a ranking as the 5th best team in the East.
Mr. Gelman is also a trailblazer for girls' sports in our community.
In 1986, recognizing a void in opportunities for female athletes, he

founded the Bison Girls Hockey Program, the first of its kind in

Western New York.
His efforts opened doors for countless young women to

compete in hockey at the highest levels.
