Since joining the legislature in 2021, Justin has been a force to be

reckoned with, setting a first-year freshman record with eight

sponsored bills being signed into law by Arizona's governor.
Justin understands the issues and values that matter most to our

great state, and he is working every day to protect our laws.
From

securing the border, to enhancing economic prosperity, to defending our

Second Amendment, to fighting for election integrity and transparency,

Justin has proven to be a relentless warrior for conservative

principles and policies, making his constituents very proud of his

efforts.
Arizona's Eighth Congressional District is thankful for

Representative Justin Wilmeth's endeavors on behalf of his district and

our state.

TRIBUTE TO SHAWNNA BOLICK

HON.
DEBBIE LESKO

Mrs. LESKO.
Mr. Speaker, Shawnna Bolick serves as an Arizona State

Senator for Legislative District 2, covering the North Valley.
Throughout her time in public service, Shawnna has been a strong

champion for promoting school choice and protecting the most vulnerable

among us.
Thanks, in large part, to her work, Arizona is one of the premier

states in the nation for school choice and for safeguarding those who

cannot defend themselves.
She has served on Arizona's Early Childhood

Education and Health Board, the Arizona State Board of Education's

Academic Standards Development Committee, and the Arizona Juvenile

Justice Commission.
Shawnna is a `can-do' conservative fighter.
She

will always stand on her principles, but she looks every day for

consensus and for opportunities to enact meaningful policy reforms and

enhancements for her constituents.
Arizona's Eighth Congressional District is grateful for Shawnna's

commitment and passion for public service, and I am thankful for the

example she has left for many to follow.
