Sgt.
Drake and his Company fought through Luxenberg, Belgium,

Germany and Czechoslovakia until the end of WWII in 1945.
Sgt.
Drake's distinguished service has earned him many medals,

including this institution's highest expression of national

appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions--the

Congressional Gold Medal.
Upon returning to the United States in October of 1945, Sgt.
Drake

was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in December and started a

family with his late wife, the former Lydora LaTournous, in Hawley.
They were married on September 23, 1950, and raised two daughters and

one son.
Life gifted them with many grand and great-grandchildren.
Shortly after arriving back home, Sgt.
Drake joined the U.S. Postal

Service and worked there for 34 years, 15 of which he was the Hawley

postmaster.
He's proud to be the first person from Hawley, and without

a political appointment, to have served in this position.
Sgt.
Drake was active in his community, serving as Quartermaster and

Treasurer with the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 5823 in Hawley,

founded by his late brother Robert J. Drake.
He worked with the Mayor

of Hawley and others to plan parades and carnivals.
After the post

disbanded in 2008, he made arrangements to have the post headquarters

on Park Place turned over to the County of Wayne, for the Hawley Senior

Center.
Sgt.
Drake's devotion to our Nation is evident in his exemplary

military career, and I thank him for his service while wearing, and

after hanging up his uniform.
He truly embodies what it means to be one

of the few remaining members of the ``Greatest Generation.''
Sgt.
Drake is a true American hero whose commitment to duty and

service distinguishes him as an individual whose character represents

the very best of Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, and I am

proud to be his Representative in Washington.
