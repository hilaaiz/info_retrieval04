REMEMBERING MRS.
DORETTA BROWN

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life

of Mrs. Doretta Brown.
She was a woman of quiet strength, deep faith,

and unwavering love for her family, students, and community.
Her

presence brought warmth, wisdom, and a gentle grace that touched the

lives of all who knew her.
Born on March 26, 1953, in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mrs. Brown was the

eldest daughter of Tommie and Daisy Royster.
She moved through life

with a deep sense of purpose and compassion, grounded in the values

instilled in her from a young age.
She was baptized in 1966 at Linwood

Church of Christ, a moment that reflected the faith that would anchor

her life.
What truly defined Mrs. Brown was her deep love of family.
As a

devoted wife, mother, and grandmother, her greatest joy was spent with

her late husband, Mr. Ivory Brown, and their two children, Anthony and

Duryea Doran.
She later became a proud grandmother to Anthony, Jaxon,

Skylar, and Hudson.
She was also a loving aunt to two nephews and four

nieces, nurturing them with the same kindness and care she gave to

everyone in her life.
Mrs. Brown cherished every moment spent with her

family--a life filled with love and partnership until her passing.
Mrs. Brown worked as an occupational therapist at Cataract Elementary

School in Niagara Falls, New York, where she was admired for her

dedication and gentle, healing spirit she brought to her work and

students.
Her love of reading reflected her lifelong commitment to

learning and the power of education.
Perhaps one of the most treasured

memories for those who knew her was hearing her sing the song

``Grace''--a simple yet powerful testament to the faith and love she

carried within her heart.
Mrs. Doretta Brown lived a life of compassion, service, and enduring

faith.
Her legacy lives on through the countless lives she touched, the

family she loved so dearly, and the grace with which she walked through

the world.
Her strength, kindness, and dedication will always be

remembered, and her legacy will continue to inspire all those whose

lives she touched.
