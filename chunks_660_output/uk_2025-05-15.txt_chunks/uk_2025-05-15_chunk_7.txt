She

is a great example of how professional excellence can be paired with

deep community investment.
The Community Impact Award honors two remarkable individuals: Elena

Jordon and Ron Kowalski, both of whom have made lasting contributions

to South Fairfax.
For more than a decade, Elena Jordon has volunteered with the South

County Athletic Booster Club, raising over $40,000 annually and helping

organize major community events such as the Lorton Holiday Extravaganza

and the Spring Fling.
As co-founder of The Emma Jordon Kidz Fighting

Cancer Foundation named in honor of her daughter, Elena has raised over

$140,000 in support of pediatric oncology research and families at

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Her legacy of service is

driven not only by experience, as a veteran of the Army Nurse Corps,

but also by her compassion.
Ron Kowalski, founding member of the Chamber and leader of the Ron K

Real Estate Group, has also played a pivotal role in the community.
For

the past ten years, he has served on the Board of the Lorton Community

Action Center and organized the popular Monopoly Tournament fundraiser,

now in its 16th year.
His dedication to civic life exemplifies the

spirit of leadership that strengthens our community.
The Chamber also supports the next generation of business leaders

through its Student Pro-Growth Business Scholarships, which recognize

outstanding high school seniors who have demonstrated entrepreneurial

spirit and academic achievement.
I am proud to congratulate and include

in the Record the 2025 scholarship recipients:

Gavin Flynn, South County High School

Christine Le, Mount Vernon High School

Ella Ridgway, Lake Braddock Secondary School

Zachary Allen, South County High School

Aidan Barker, West Springfield High School

These students represent the best of South Fairfax's future, and

their achievements give us great hope for the years ahead.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the

2025 honorees and thanking the South Fairfax Chamber of Commerce for

its ongoing work to support local businesses and recognize community

champions.

RECOGNIZING THE JAMES MADISON HIGH SCHOOL ROBOTICS TEAM

HON.
GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. CONNOLLY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the James

Madison High School Robotics Team, Team 620, known proudly as the

Warbots.
The Warbots participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition, an

international high school robotics competition.
This year, Team 620

qualified for the FIRST Robotics World Championship held in Houston,

Texas, marking only the fourth time in the team's 25-year history that

they have achieved this honor.
At the Championship, the Warbots and their robot, ``Dory,'' delivered

a remarkable performance, finishing 11th in the Galileo Division's

qualification rounds.
The team went on to serve as captain of a three-

team alliance, selecting partners from India, Canada, and Michigan.
They then went against the 5th seeded alliance and won with a score of

228-227.
In addition to their success in Houston, the Warbots had an extremely

successful regional competition season.
In January, FIRST released this

year's challenge, ``Reefscape,'' prompting teams to design, build, and

automate their robots in under two months.
During District Competitions

in March and District Championships in early April, Team 620 captured

the Excellence in Engineering Award and the Autonomous Award.
Their

alliance won the Alexandria event and earned the highest score of the

year in the FIRST Chesapeake District.
I include in the Record, the eighteen students who represented James

Madison High School at the World Championship:

Josh Lauro; Graduating Senior

Annabelle Hallworth; Graduating Senior

Nick Abbott; Graduating Senior

Daphne Jaillon; Graduating Senior

Davin Meggers; Graduating Senior

These talented students were supported on their journey by lead

mentors and parent volunteers.
Mr. Speaker, I commend the Warbots for their innovation and teamwork.
