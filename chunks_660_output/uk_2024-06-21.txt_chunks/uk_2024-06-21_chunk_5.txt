RECOGNIZING BUCKS COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE BUCKS COUNTY CHIEF

OF DETECTIVES MARTIN McDONOUGH'S RETIREMENT

HON.
BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a profound sense of

admiration and gratitude to recognize an exceptional constituent from

my district, Detective Martin McDonough of the Bucks County Police

Department who is retiring after over three decades of unwavering

dedication to the wellbeing of citizens in the community.
Martin is a native of Holland, Pennsylvania.
In addition to his

studies at Spring Garden College and Temple University, his commitment

to professional growth led him to achieve a remarkable milestone in

2015 when he graduated from the prestigious FBI National Academy.
This

achievement not only showcased his relentless pursuit of excellence but

also underscored his resolve for helping others.
Detective McDonough

eventually settled in Jamison, where he and his wife of nearly forty

years, Joanne, still live today.
It was here

where they raised their two daughters, Megan and Emily.
Their steadfast

support has undoubtedly provided a foundation that allows Martin to

serve to the best of his ability.
Detective McDonough has always been called to a life of service.
Martin's journey in public service began as a member of the Warwick

Township Fire Company.
In 1981, he took the first steps towards his

lifelong commitment to public safety by joining the esteemed ranks of

the Northampton Township Fire Department, where he has served as a

dedicated firefighter for over 40 years.
His selfless contributions to

the fire department exemplify his commitment to safeguarding the lives

and property of our community members.
Transitioning seamlessly from firefighting to law enforcement, Martin

embarked on a distinguished career within various Police Departments.
During his tenure, Detective McDonough has held titles of dispatcher,

patrolman, detective, and later chief of detectives, demonstrating

exemplary leadership and integrity at every turn.
Martin worked as a

dispatcher for Northampton Township for five years before becoming a

patrol officer in Warrington Township in 1987.
A year later he joined

the Warwick Township Police Department where he climbed the ranks from

Patrolman, Corporal, Detective, and lastly to Detective Sergeant.
He

dedicated 13 years of tireless service to this department, touching

numerous lives in the community.
In 2000, Detective McDonough's career led him to the Bucks County

District Attorney's office where he was a county detective for nineteen

years.
