YOLANDA AMADEO

HON.
SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR.
Mr. BISHOP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a distinguished

scholar, passionate community advocate, and dedicated educator, Ms.

Yolanda Amadeo, who celebrated her 30th anniversary as Chief

Meteorologist at WALB-TV in Albany, Georgia, on June 15, 2025.
Ms. Amadeo graduated from Jackson State University with a Bachelor of

Science in Atmospheric Sciences and also earned a Bachelor of Science

in Speech Communications from Florida State University.
She proudly

holds the prestigious American Meteorological Society's (AMS) Seal of

Approval and has contributed extensively to the AMS community.
Her

service includes roles on the Broadcast Board of the AMS, the AMS Board

on Pre-College Education, and the AMS Minority Scholarship National

Committee.
Throughout her career, Ms. Amadeo has been recognized with numerous

accolades.
In 2012, she received the Martin Luther King Jr. Dream Award

from the Albany King Day Committee, as well as the Women of Purpose

Award.
In 2010, the Georgia Association of Broadcasters honored her

with an Honorable Mention for Best Weather Reporting.
She is also a

recipient of the 2007 National Mark Trail Award, recognizing her

efforts to promote weather safety through the use of weather radios.
That same year, I had the privilege of awarding her a Certificate of

Special Congressional Recognition for her outstanding achievements,

dedicated service, and public distinction.
Furthermore, U.S. Senator

Johnny Isakson acknowledged her important work educating the public on

the life-saving role of NOAA Weather Radios during severe weather.
In

2004, Ms. Amadeo was celebrated as one of Southwest Georgia's ``Steel

Magnolias'' at the Women Making Magic Event.
Perhaps most inspiring is her dedication to mentoring aspiring

meteorologists.
She cherishes the relationships she has built through

sharing her expertise, providing guidance, and offering both

motivational and emotional support.
Yolanda is deeply committed to the

success of those seeking career advice.
Beyond her professional work,

she actively shares her passion for meteorology with the community by

educating students on the science of weather forecasting and promoting

weather safety at civic and social events.
Ms. Amadeo's community involvement extends to her volunteerism with

the Southwest Georgia Chapter of the American Red Cross, where she has

served as both a volunteer and board member.
She is also an active

member of St. Teresa's Catholic Church, serving as a lector and member

of the Parish Council, and volunteers at St. Clare's Soup Kitchen,

helping those in need within our neighborhood.
As former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm wisely said, ``Service is

the rent we pay for the space we occupy here on this earth.''
In

celebrating Ms. Amadeo's 30 years as Chief Meteorologist, it is clear

she has paid her rent and paid it well.
Her unwavering commitment to

informing and uplifting her community is truly commendable, and both

Albany and the state of Georgia are stronger and safer because of her.
Yolanda's many accomplishments would not have been possible without

the grace of God and the steadfast love and support of her family.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me,

along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second District,

in recognizing and commending Ms. Yolanda Amadeo for 30 remarkable

years as Chief Meteorologist at WALB-TV, and in wishing her many more

years of success and service.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM (BILL) THOMPSON BAGLEY

HON.
JARED HUFFMAN

Mr. HUFFMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor William (Bill) T.

Baglietto who passed away on June 9, 2025, at the age of 96, after a

remarkable life of public service, legal distinction, and civic

leadership.
Born in San Francisco in 1928, Bill's early years were shaped by

hardship.
After his family faced bankruptcy during the Great

Depression, they relocated to a cabin in Woodacre, California.
From

these humble beginnings, Bill's extraordinary work ethic and intellect

carried him far.
