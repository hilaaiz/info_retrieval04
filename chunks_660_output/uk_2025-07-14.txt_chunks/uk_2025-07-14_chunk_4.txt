Born in San Francisco in 1928, Bill's early years were shaped by

hardship.
After his family faced bankruptcy during the Great

Depression, they relocated to a cabin in Woodacre, California.
From

these humble beginnings, Bill's extraordinary work ethic and intellect

carried him far.
He worked his way through high school, college, and

law school as a member of the Marin County Fire Department, ultimately

graduating as valedictorian from the University of California, Berkeley

in 1949.
He earned his J.D. from Berkeley Law in 1952, where he served

on the California Law Review--a foundation for what would become a

distinguished legal career.
Bill practiced law for 63 years, including 35 years as a partner at

Nossaman LLP.
He became one of California's leading experts in

business, water, transportation, and public policy law.
Among his many

legal contributions, he successfully defended First Amendment rights

before the United States Supreme Court.
His commitment to justice,

transparency, and public accountability informed both his legal

practice and his public service.
From 1960 to 1974, Bill represented Marin and Sonoma Counties in the

California State Assembly.
A moderate Republican and tireless advocate

for civil rights, he received an outstanding voter rating from the

NAACP throughout his legislative career.
Notably, he authored landmark

legislation on transparency including the California Public Records Act

and the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act--cornerstones of open government

in California.
Following his time in the Assembly, Bill was appointed by President

Gerald Ford as the first chair of the newly created Commodity Futures

Trading Commission.
Under his leadership, the CFTC helped modernize and

globalize the futures market.
He traveled to Europe and Tokyo

advocating for fair, well-regulated markets, and served on the Futures

Industry Association Board of Directors.
His public service extended to

the California Transportation Commission, the Public Utilities

Commission, and the University of California Board of Regents--each

role reflecting his lifelong commitment to the public good.
Bill received numerous accolades throughout his life, including the

UC Berkeley Alumnus of the Year award in 2002.
But to those who knew

him well, he will be remembered for his character: principled,

pragmatic, and endlessly generous with his time and wisdom.
Bill is survived by his wife of 60 years, Diane; their children Lynn,

Bill, Jr., Walter, Shana, and Tracy, and his grandchildren Nicholas,

Julian, Nathaniel, Grant, and Layli.
Mr. Speaker, Bill Bagley embodied a rare blend of intellect,

humility, and commitment to public service.
He believed government

could work to improve quality of life for everyone--and he worked

tirelessly to prove it.
I respectfully ask that you join me in honoring

his enduring legacy and extending our deepest condolences to his

family, friends, and all who had the privilege to know him.
