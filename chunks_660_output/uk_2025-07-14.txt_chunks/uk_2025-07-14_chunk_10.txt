SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF COLDWATER HIGH SCHOOL'S GIRLS 4X400 METER RELAY

TEAM FOR WINNING THE DIVISION III STATE TRACK AND FIELD TITLE

HON.
ROBERT E. LATTA

Mr. LATTA.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pride that I rise

to pay a very special tribute to an outstanding high school track and

field relay team in Ohio's Fifth Congressional District.
The young

women of the Coldwater High School's Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team have

represented their school ably on their way to achieving the Division

III State Track and Field Title.
The team overcame the challenges posed

by intense competition in their effort to surpass all other relay teams

in their event.
In pursuing the State Championship, Audrey Alig, Lana Kaiser,

Kiersten Keller, and Isabella Zahn defeated their outstanding

competitors to win with an impressive time of 3:53.94.
The members of

this very special team have shown that their sport requires an

individual effort for a team result.
Their hard work and dedication,

both on and off the track, in achieving this accomplishment should be

commended.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Coldwater

High School Girls 4x400 Meter Relay team.
On behalf of the people of

the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great

achievement.
