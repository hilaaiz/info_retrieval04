COMMEMORATING NATIONAL HERITAGE ACADEMIES

HON.
BILL HUIZENGA

Mr. HUIZENGA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate National

Heritage Academies, or NHA as they are known, as they celebrate their

30th anniversary.
It is critical that every child, regardless of income, background, or

zip code, has access to a quality education.
National Heritage

Academies delivers on this goal!
NHA prepares students from all walks of life for academic success

while opening doors to trade schools, community colleges, and four-year

universities.
Since 1995, National Heritage Academies has offered quality education

opportunities to more than 60,000 K-12 students.
NHA runs over 100

charter schools primarily in my home state of Michigan, but has also

expanded into 8 additional states.
One of those schools in Michigan is Vanderbilt Charter Academy in

Holland, Michigan, where I served on the board for 5 years.
Charter

schools provide families with a tuition-free alternative that offers

greater choice in the education their children receive.
National Heritage Academies strives to put kids on a trajectory to

reach their full potential and achieve success both in and out of the

classroom.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating National Heritage

Academies as they celebrate their 30th anniversary.

CONGRATULATING THE GANADO MAIDENS SOFTBALL TEAM

HON.
MICHAEL CLOUD

Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Ganado

Maidens softball team--2025 UIL 2A State Champions.
With a final score of 5-4 over Riesel, the Maidens capped off a 33-5-

1 season marked by grit, discipline, and heart.
They entered the

postseason on a 19-game winning streak and held their opponents to just

9 total runs across 10 playoff games.
This championship wasn't handed to them.
In the title game, they were

down to their final out then delivered a two-run rally that turned the

tide.
That's the kind of resilience that defines Texas athletics and

Texas values.
It wasn't just one team on the field--it was an entire community

behind them.
Coaches, families, classmates, and neighbors, each playing

a role.
As one local paper put it, ``lt took all of Ganado.''
And it

did.
In a time when the spotlight so often falls on the wrong examples,

these young women reminded us what it means to fight for something

bigger than yourself.
Their victory is more than a trophy.
It's a

testament to hard work, unity, and the enduring spirit of Texas.
I congratulate the Maidens.

HONORING HEATHER MILLETT

HON.
CHUCK EDWARDS

Mr. EDWARDS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Heather

Millett, who has served with distinction as Legislative Director in

both my state senate and congressional offices.
Heather embodies the

very best of public service.
You will see from her educational

background that for years she has been preparing for a career dedicated

to serving the citizens of our great Nation.
By earning her Bachelor's

Degree in Political Science at Campbell University, her Master of

Public Administration and Policy at American University, and continuing

her education in law studies at Syracuse University College of Law, it

becomes evident that Heather's long-term goal has been a passion to

help improve the lives of others.
Heather's intelligence, integrity, and tireless work ethic have

guided our legislative efforts with purpose and precision.
Whether

navigating the complexities of committee work, building coalitions

across the aisle, or championing the priorities of our constituents,

Heather has brought both strategic insight and deep compassion to every

task.
Perhaps Heather's most important contribution to the people of North

Carolina's Eleventh Congressional District was after September 27,

2024, when Hurricane Helene made landfall in the peaceful and serene

mountains of Western North Carolina.
