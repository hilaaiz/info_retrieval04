Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Electrician's Mate 3rd Class Richard Alan Danculovich of Jefferson City for his valiant military service during the Vietnam War.
Following in his WWII veteran father's footsteps, EM3 Danculovich's dedicated service in the United States Navy began on November 29, 1965, at the RTC Great Lakes for Bootcamp and later EM-A School for electrician training.
Upon completion of his naval training, EM3 Danculovich served aboard the U.S.S. Piedmont (AD-17), ported out of San Diego, where he was assigned to the Electrical Repair Division.
The U.S.S. Piedmont (AD-17) was a Dixie-class destroyer tender that served and maintained all ships engaged in combat operations during naval battles.
While aboard the U.S.S. Piedmont, EM3 Danculovich conducted electrical repairs on ships in the Western Pacific region, including Pearl Harbor, the Subic Bay in the Philippines and Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and many of these ships previously spent months in service off the coast of Vietnam.
After 3 years of distinguished military service, he was discharged from Active Duty in November of 1968.
He is proud to share that his grandson continues the family tradition of military service in support of our country.
Please join me in celebrating Electrician's Mate 3rd Class Alan Danculovich for his distinguished military service to the United States of America. ____________________

Date: 2023-09-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 151 Pages: E861 - E862 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E861-E862] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING PASTOR CHUCK HORNER ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pastor Chuck Horner of Calvary Baptist Church in Hayward for his service to the community for over 30 years.
Chuck graduated from Woodlawn High School in 1969, then enlisting in the United States Navy serving as an Anti-Submarine Warfare Operator from 1970 to 1974 in Coronado, California.
Upon discharge, Chuck enrolled at the California Baptist University, earning a Bachelor of Arts in Religion and Behavioral Science in 1978.
He later returned to school to earn a Master of Divinity in Theology from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary.
In October 1990, Chuck moved to Hayward from Dixon, California, to become the Senior Pastor of Calvary Baptist Church.
Through his role, he profoundly contributed to the faith community within Hayward and the East Bay at large.
In fact, I fondly remember walking with Chuck through Hayward to deliver prepared Thanksgiving meals to the homeless, something he loved doing every year.
Chuck is heavily involved in community service programs.
As Chair of the Clean & Green Task Force, Chuck worked to improve the city of Hayward by reducing graffiti vandalism.
