JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival in Leominster, Massachusetts on Saturday, September 23, 2023.
While many have heard the tales of Johnny Appleseed--the American folk hero who wandered our early Nation planting apple seeds--not many know the man behind the story.
John Chapman was born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1774.
From a young age, his father taught him to cultivate trees.
That's where his story starts.
Back then, frontier law allowed anyone to earn a claim to the land by developing a permanent homestead on it.
Chapman established his homesteads by planting apple orchards, just like his father.
He ventured more than 100,000 square miles from Massachusetts to Illinois, all the while planting apple seeds in his wake.
At the time of his death in 1845, John Chapman owned over 1,200 acres of land, leaving behind hundreds of apple trees.
Every year since 1993, thousands of people have gathered in Leominster to celebrate the life and work of John Chapman.
Through live music and apple crisp, the festival aims to honor Chapman's legacy of abundance, bravery, and cultivation.
Mr. Speaker, this year is special.
Under the dedication and expertise of Festival Coordinator Rick Marchand, the event has blossomed year after year.
This year, the festival will provide 1,000 complimentary meals to children and their families, accommodate 230 local vendors, and welcome several dozens of organizations and artists to interface with their community.
The Johnny Appleseed Arts and Cultural Festival is a chance to celebrate our rich land across generations.
Mr. Speaker, Johnny Appleseed is a treasured National figure that we in Central Massachusetts are proud to share.
I commend the Johnny Appleseed Festival on its 30th anniversary and am proud of the staff, volunteers, and community members that work to make this such a beloved annual event.
We look forward to welcoming tens of thousands of neighbors to this beloved festival. ____________________
