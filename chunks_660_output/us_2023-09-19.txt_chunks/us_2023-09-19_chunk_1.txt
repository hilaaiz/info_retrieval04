Today, the village serves as the third largest municipality in Boone County with a population of 1,400 residents.
The village celebrated significant achievements throughout its history, such as the drilling of its first municipal well in 1881, the building of its original water tower in 1900, and electricity coming to the village in 1911.
We are grateful for Capron's commitment and investment in agriculture and business development in northern Illinois.
The Village of Capron is known throughout northern Illinois for the services that it has provided for the community over the last 150 years.
Today, we celebrate the village and their residents for their dedication to their community.
I extend my sincere congratulations to the Village of Capron, Illinois for a successful 150 years, and I wish them even more success going forward. ____________________
