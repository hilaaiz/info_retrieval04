In fact, I fondly remember walking with Chuck through Hayward to deliver prepared Thanksgiving meals to the homeless, something he loved doing every year.
Chuck is heavily involved in community service programs.
As Chair of the Clean & Green Task Force, Chuck worked to improve the city of Hayward by reducing graffiti vandalism.
When graffiti taggers were caught, Chuck offered to mentor and help them change course to prevent property vandalism.
Chuck also founded HayWallKru in 2010, empowering graffiti taggers to become artists through abatement, education, and additional development opportunities.
Chuck served in the community through his various roles in other community service organizations, such as director of the Hayward Coalition for Healthy Youth, the Ashland Cherryland Health Community Coalition, the Hayward Rotary Club, the Salvation Army Meal Project Coordinator, Vice President of the Hayward Education Foundation, and an Ambassador for the Hayward Chamber of Commerce.
Chuck has been a beloved member of the Hayward community for over 30 years, and known as the big guy with a booming voice, and a personality to match.
Chuck has battled prostate cancer for ten years while remaining involved in various outreach roles and has recently started hospice care.
I join the Hayward community in recognizing the contributions of Pastor Chuck and send my sincerest well wishes to Linda, his wife of over 50 years, and their two children, Christal and Aaron. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
151



Date: 2023-09-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 151 Pages: E862 - E863 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E862-E863] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PRISON RAPE ELIMINATION ACT ______ HON.
ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge that 20 years ago, on September 4, 2003, President George W. Bush signed the Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, into law.
This law recognized the difficult truth of rampant and completely unacceptable sexual abuse of people in our jails, prisons, and juvenile detention facilities, and endeavored to address it.
PREA sought to end these abuses by creating research mandates, promulgating National standards, and providing grant funding to meet those standards.
Ending prisoner rape remains one of the increasingly rare topics on which people on both sides of the aisle can continue to agree.
I joined forces with my Virginia colleague, Congressman Frank Wolf, to sponsor the bill in this chamber, and Senators Ted Kennedy and Jeff Sessions sponsored PREA in the Senate.
PREA passed with unanimous support in both the House and Senate.
Fighting against institutional abuse and protecting those who cannot advocate for themselves should never be a partisan issue, and I have been gratified by the coalition of support PREA has inspired over the years.
Since PREA's passage, we've seen dramatic improvements in how adults and children in detention are treated.
Thousands of corrections professionals have been hired and trained to ensure the safety of people in their custody through the implementation of PREA's National standards.
The U.S. Department of Justice is now required to gather data on sexual abuse in custody that provides corrections facilities, advocates and policymakers with invaluable information on the dynamics of sexual abuse in detention, and how it can be stopped.
Hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people are educated every year about their right to be safe and respected, and how to speak out if they are not.
Incarcerated people, their families, and advocates now have more effective methods of reporting sexual abuse, as evidenced by the dramatic increase in the number of reports we have seen since PREA's enactment.
This is a clear sign that incarcerated survivors understand that people care about their experiences, that they have mechanisms to advocate for themselves, and that their voices should no longer go unheard.
