CELEBRATING THE VILLAGE OF FRANKLIN

_____

HON.
RASHIDA TLAIB

Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize the Village of

Franklin in Michigan's 12th District as they celebrate their

bicentennial anniversary.
Established in 1824, the Village of Franklin is a very special place

in our community.
The village grew out of increased travel through the

region after the completion of the Erie Canal, and its first residents

were practical tradespeople skilled in smithing, carpentry, and

masonry.
To this day, Franklin residents embrace and preserve its

beautiful, rural landscape, fondly calling it the ``Town That Time

Forgot.''
Because of its numerous original 19th-century properties,

Franklin was designated as Michigan's first Historic District, and is

listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Please join me and the 12th Congressional District in celebrating the

Village of Franklin's 200th birthday.

HONORING AND CONGRATULATING JUDGE ROBERT O. BOWEN ON HIS RETIREMENT

_____

HON.
RUDY YAKYM III

Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Judge Robert O. Bowen

of the Marshall County Superior Court No.
1 as he prepares to retire

from serving on the bench.
A 1974 graduate of Indiana University, Judge Bowen obtained his Juris

Doctor from Valparaiso University in 1977.
In addition to his service

on the bench, Robert also served as a Legislative Assistant in the

Indiana General Assembly.
Since his tenure on the Marshall County

Superior Court No.
1 began on January 1, 1995, Judge Bowen has

dedicated himself to advancing the principles of justice and ensuring

that Hoosiers get a fair shake before the law.
The Rule of Law tradition we have inherited helps secure individual

liberty and promotes the conditions necessary for human flourishing.
It

is incumbent on us to do our part to make sure these principles of

justice and Rule of Law precepts are passed seamlessly from one

generation to the next.
That mission is one Judge Bowen has embraced

wholeheartedly and worked tirelessly to advance.
While serving on the Court, Judge Bowen has also demonstrated his

steadfast commitment to the local community, most especially in his

church membership where he taught adult education over the years.
Additionally, the Sagamore of the Wabash Award he has been honored with

is another testament to Judge Bowen's leadership abilities and his

civic-oriented nature.
As Judge Bowen's career comes to a close, I have no doubt that the

Marshall County community is better off because of his service.
I know

that Robert's wife Patty and their three children--Andrew, Chris, and

Betsy--are all very proud of him, and I am too.
I join Hoosiers

throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our

gratitude to Judge Robert O. Bowen for his service and in wishing him a

very happy retirement and all the best going forward.
