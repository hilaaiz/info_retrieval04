As

Assemblymember Carillo's Legislative Aide, he worked hard on

legislation to help improve the lives of Californians.
Mr. Garcia was a

valuable asset and a strong leader on both Assemblymember Wilson's and

Carrillo's teams, and he was at the beginning of an impactful career in

California politics.
Mr. Garcia will be remembered by his family,

friends, and colleagues as a kind and compassionate young man who

always put the needs of others before his own.
His passion for

politics, dedication to his community, and service to the State of

California will never be forgotten.
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my

incredible life of Mr. Aldo Javier Garcia.
My thoughts and prayers are

with his family during this difficult time.
