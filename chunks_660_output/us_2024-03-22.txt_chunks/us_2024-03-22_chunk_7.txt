Under his guidance, the church has flourished spiritually, numerically, and in its physical facilities.
Rev. Aniton's impact extends beyond the church walls, with his involvement in various community organizations and leadership roles.
He has been recognized with awards such as the NAACP Religious Affairs Award and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Lifetime Achievement Award, among others.
His commitment to service and leadership exemplifies the quote by George Washington Carver when he said ``How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong.
Because someday in your life you will have been all of these.
Rev. Aniton has used his ministry to reach people from all walks of life.
Spurred by the example of Jesus, he has used his life's work to help the ``Least of These.''
In reflecting on his achievements, Rev. Aniton acknowledges the unwavering support of his late wife, Mrs. Dorothy Rigby Aniton, his children, grandchildren, and extended family.
Personally, I have been blessed to benefit from Rev. Aniton's wisdom and friendship for over four decades.
He never told me what I wanted to hear; he always told me what he felt I needed to hear.
Rev. Aniton has inspired and mentored many with his sterling example of what a man of God should look like.
He is truly a man after God's own heart.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in The U.S. House of Representatives to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 765,000 people of

Georgia's Second Congressional District in expressing our deepest gratitude and best wishes to Reverend Dr. Emmett Scott Aniton, Jr. as he embarks on a well-deserved retirement after 45 years of devoted service at Friendship Missionary Baptist Church.
May God continue to bless him and his loved ones as he enters this new chapter in his life. ____________________
RECOGNIZING SENATOR JEAN BREAUX; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
51



Date: 2024-03-22 Volume: 170, Issue: 51 Pages: E283 - E283 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SENATOR JEAN BREAUX ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of Indiana Senator Jean Breaux, who lived a life of selfless and profound service to the Indianapolis community.
For decades, Senator Breaux served our community with her signature fierce advocacy and fighting spirit.
Prior to holding office, Senator Breaux worked for the Indiana Department of Economic Development, where she fought for Hoosiers of all backgrounds.
In 2006, she was elected to the Indiana Senate--following in the footsteps of her mother, Billie Breaux--and served as assistant Democratic leader for the Senate Democratic Caucus from 2012 to 2020.
In her role, Senator Breaux fought tirelessly for vulnerable and disadvantaged Hoosiers.
In particular, she worked to improve Black infant and maternal mortality, increased access to healthy food in food deserts, protected Hoosiers from rising utility costs, fought for reproductive justice, passed policies to address poverty, advocated for gun violence prevention to keep our communities safe, and so much more.
In her role on the Senate Health Committee, she helped combat health disparities in the Black community and pushed for comprehensive access to care.
Equity was always at the center of her service.
Senator Breaux's initiative to eliminate school textbook fees passed last year, which will help Hoosier families for generations to come.
Senator Breaux's impact on our community is reflected in the outpouring of grief and support as the entire Indiana community mourns this substantial loss.
She was a great friend, mentor, and confidante to so many, including myself.
On many occasions, I relied on her wisdom to guide me, and the lessons she taught us all will continue to endure.
On behalf of the entire 7th Congressional District, we offer our condolences to those grieving this significant loss, especially her beloved mother, former Senator Billie Breaux.
