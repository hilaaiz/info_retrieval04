Date: 2024-03-22 Volume: 170, Issue: 51 Pages: E285 - E285 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING WESTERN ENERGY ALLIANCE'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a champion of our nation's abundant energy resources.
Western Energy Alliance is celebrating 50 years of unifying stakeholders and policymakers in support of oil and natural gas in the West.
Their work has helped balance the environment by providing citizens with the energy they need.
Today, just as in 1974, energy policy is vital to America's success.
Today, as back then, we also see regulators going out of their way to hamstring innovative solutions from small, independent companies focused on harnessing our Nation's mineral resources--companies that constitute the Alliance's membership.
Fortunately, the Alliance has been a guiding voice and valuable resource for members of Congress and has helped consumers combat high prices at the pump and lower their utility bills.
Congratulations to Western Energy Alliance for reaching the 50-year milestone and I thank them for being a credible advocate of western oil and natural gas. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the accomplishments of Hermelinda Sapien.
She has dedicated 55 years to the Center for Employment Training, and the past 25 years she has displayed her unwavering leadership as President and Executive Director.
The Center for Employment Training is an economic and community development corporation.
Their job training and placement programs teach marketable skills to people of all educational levels and backgrounds, supporting them through the process of job placement.
With 12 locations, including San Jose's, CET's impact is monumental.
Mrs. Sapien's work with CET began as an Administrative Assistant, and her commitment served her well as she moved up to Human Resources Director, Chief Administrative Officer, Deputy Director, and ultimately, President and CEO.
CET's ability to work with our community and support the dignity of self-sufficiency is largely due to Sapien's hard work.
She dedicated her career to ensuring CET's financial stability and guaranteeing that the needs of students at CET were being met.
Thousands of people have received the training and support they needed to find meaningful employment that supports them and their families.
Hermalinda's work and that of all the CET staff has changed lives and our community for the better.
Hermelinda's leadership has made a profound difference.
Hermelinda Sapien will be retiring in June of this year, and it is with great pride and respect that I recognize her accomplishments.
I share with the CET's Board of Directors in their heartfelt farewell to Mrs. Sapien, and we will always remember her impact on the Center for Employment Training's success.

In high school, his family moved to California, where Matthew obtained a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
