Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a native son of Herkimer County, Vincent Bono, and to wish him well as he begins a new chapter in his storied career.
Mr. Bono was born in Ilion, and he never strayed too far from home.
In 1985, he settled in Schuyler, which has been his home ever since.
In 2002, Mr. Bono was elected to represent Herkimer's 11th district in the county legislature, where he quickly became a fixture.
He immediately earned the nickname ``Mr. IDA'' for his support for the county's Industrial Development Agency, which he now chairs.
Vincent has been a fighter for the economic betterment of his beloved county since day one.
Under his leadership, business parks in Schuyler and Frankfort were built, bringing new jobs and residents with them.
Vincent has also been a champion for students and young people.
One would be hard-pressed to find a more vocal advocate for Herkimer Community College than Mr. Bono.
He takes pride in the fact that he began the Children's Center initiative which will be carried on by his trusted colleagues and go on to have a positive impact on the community.
Vincent's service has not been limited to elected leadership.
He has also served his community as a volunteer firefighter, risking his life to protect others.
He has also contributed greatly to the work of numerous organizations tackling issues close to his heart.
Whenever there has been a need for a reliable voice in Herkimer, Vincent has readily provided that voice.
Vincent Bono has proven himself to be a true statesman.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I thank him for all he has contributed to life in the North Country and wish him luck as he begins a new chapter of his public service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Press Secretary, Taylor Deacon, for her work on behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
This week, Taylor will depart my office for a new opportunity serving as Deputy Communications Director and Press Secretary in the Office of Rep. Don Davis, and I could not be more proud or grateful for her service.
A Michigan native, Taylor's Midwest work ethic shines through in everything she does.
From earning a Girl Scout Gold Award to graduating Magna Cum Laude from Elon University, her grit was as evident early in life as it is now on Capitol Hill.
As my Press Secretary, Taylor served as a trusted advisor and liaison to the media, using her sharp communications skills to articulate the accomplishments of our office and forge productive relationships with members of the press.
