This would prove to be a formative experience for Jim who, upon graduation in 1989, took a job at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
During his time at Fort Campbell, Jim served in a variety of roles including the Chief of Community Mental Health and the Chief of Discharge Planning.
In these roles, Jim assumed responsibility for the well-being of countless troops and their family members.
He flourished in Kentucky, but when Americans were called to serve during Operation Desert Storm, Jim followed the 101st Airborne-- the mighty Screaming Eagles--across the waves as the division's social work officer.
While deployed, he went above and beyond, providing counseling services to the troops and even establishing a mental health clinic similar to the one in which he had once worked in.
Jim stayed with the 101st until 1993, afterward continuing his service at various installations across the nation.
Though his capacity differed at each station, the quality of service he delivered never diminished.
His nine-year journey concluded in 2002 when he settled in with the North Country's own 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum.
During the height of the global War on Terror, Jim provided the Division with the same essential, high-quality care that had defined his time with the 101st years prior.
After serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, he returned to his roots at the very same Erie VA Hospital where his career had started.
Eventually, Jim would return to the North Country, first as the chief of the Watertown Veterans Center and then as a clinical social worker with Fort Drum's Soldier Recovery Program.
After a long career tending to our warfighters in their hours of need, Jim is ready for one last transition: on March 14th, he celebrated a richly deserved retirement after a lifetime of service.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, it is my distinct honor to thank him for all he has done in service of the North Country, the 10th Mountain Division, and our Country. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Robin S. Reed.
Robin was a giant in the Arizona business community: a trusted mentor, a visionary leader and a staunch advocate for minority entrepreneurs and community development.
From a young age, Robin's mother instilled in him and his four siblings the belief that life's obstacles were simply opportunities in disguise.
At age 11, Robin lent his voice to Franklin Armstrong in A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, portraying the first Black character in the Peanuts.
He embraced the opportunity with pride, recognizing the significance of breaking barriers and advocating for inclusivity.
