COMMEMORATING GRAND RIVER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR WINNING AP PROGRAM

AWARDS

_____

HON.
HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the excellence

of Grand River Preparatory, a High School of Michigan's Third

Congressional District.
I commend the faculty at this high school for

their dedication, perseverance, and performance.
They were recently

awarded with the 2023 AP Honor Roll Platinum Award and the 2023 AP

Access Award for their ability to go above and beyond in making college

preparatory resources accessible to students.
These awards are given to schools in which the percentage of

underrepresented and low-income students involved with the school's AP

Program is the same or greater than the percentage of underrepresented

students in the school's graduating class.
In 2023, over 4,000 schools

participated in the consideration of this award.
On behalf of myself

and our West Michigan community, I applaud Grand River Preparatory for

becoming the only high school in Michigan to achieve this major

accomplishment.
The Grand River Preparatory High School has been a constant example

of excellence by outperforming peers in surrounding schools by 3.5

months each year, according to research done by Stanford University.
The school's teachers, students and employees have worked tirelessly to

assure that all students can pursue their dreams in an equitable way.
Mr. Speaker, once more I ask my colleagues to join me in commending

the Grand River Preparatory High School.
There is no doubt that these

young students have a prosperous future ahead of them.

HONORING KARL KREISER FOR 28 YEARS OF COACHING AT COLUMBIA SCHOOL

DISTRICT

_____

HON.
LLOYD SMUCKER

Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Karl Kreiser

on his retirement after serving as a coach to Columbia High School

Basketball for 28 years.
Karl served a total of seventeen years as the Girls Varsity Head

Coach, while also coaching the varsity boys' team for four years and

acting as the skipper for the boys' junior high team for an additional

seven years.
Karl followed in the footsteps of his father, Elmer Kreiser, the

Columbia Boys Basketball Coaching legend who established the program's

legacy across the Commonwealth.
Respected on and off the court, Karl's coaching was defined by his

mentorship.
The focal point of his leadership was ensuring his players

knew the importance of giving back to the people in the community.
The legacy of Coach Karl Kreiser is displayed all around the Crimson

Tide gymnasium in the form of banners and trophies adorning the walls.
Over his nearly three decades of coaching, Karl won 431 games.
In his

last four seasons with the Girls Varsity Team, Columbia won three

section crowns, a league title, while making it to four district

championships, and three state playoffs.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Coach Karl Kreiser on a

remarkable career and wish him well as he begins his well-deserved

retirement.

HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TENNYSON CENTER FOR CHILDREN

_____

HON.
DIANA DeGETTE

Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 120th

anniversary of the Tennyson Center for Children in Denver, Colorado.
Established in 1904, Tennyson Center for Children has been committed

to serving Colorado's most neglected and abused children.
Their high-quality programs have changed lives and led to successful

outcomes for many of those who use their services.
Supporting at-risk

youth and keeping families together helps to secure bright futures for

children and puts them on a path to success, and Tennyson has worked to

support families across Colorado.
Ninety-one percent of the children who rely on Tennyson services have

experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse.
