Their high-quality programs have changed lives and led to successful

outcomes for many of those who use their services.
Supporting at-risk

youth and keeping families together helps to secure bright futures for

children and puts them on a path to success, and Tennyson has worked to

support families across Colorado.
Ninety-one percent of the children who rely on Tennyson services have

experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse.
To address the complex needs of

this population, Tennyson offers a breadth of services, including child

and family therapy, parenting support, behavior management, education

support, and childcare.
Thanks to these services, 98 percent of families who sought

assistance at Tennyson stayed together.
In 2023, I worked with Tennyson to secure federal funding to assist

in the construction of the mental health residential treatment center.
This center focuses on the urgent and unmet mental health needs of

vulnerable, low-income children with intellectual and developmental

disabilities.
The new center will help Tennyson better serve vulnerable

youth in our communities by increasing access to essential mental

health treatment.
I look forward to our continued partnership to ensure Tennyson can

continue to provide life-changing care to those most at risk of abuse

and trauma.
One hundred and twenty-nine years of service to Colorado is a

tremendous accomplishment, and I congratulate the entire staff at

Tennyson on achieving this milestone.
Tennyson Center for Children is a

fixture of our community, and I am honored to recognize its 120th

anniversary.

OPPOSING H.R. 6603 AND H.R. 5826

_____

HON.
JOAQUIN CASTRO

Mr. CASTRO of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise concerning my votes on H.R.

6603 and H.R. 5826 on April 16, 2024.
With regard to H.R. 6603, I fully support the use of the Foreign

Direct Product Rule to restrict Iran's ability to develop weapons

technologies, especially technologies used by Iran for its April 2024

attack on Israel.
However, H.R. 6603 would represent a

counterproductive restriction of the flexibility that has enabled the

Commerce Department to effectively restrict Iran's access to materials

and technology that can be used to produce drones and missiles.
While I

have no concerns about expanding the application of the Foreign Direct

Product Rule to include the additional categories enumerated within the

bill, I believe this expansion must be done in coordination with U.S.

partners to avoid creating an outcome that hurts our allies without

addressing Iranian proliferation.
This bill would threaten

relationships with key partners, including the United Kingdom,

Australia, Canada, and others that have allowed the United States to

effectively counter malign actions by the Iranian government and I

voted no as a result.
With regard to H.R. 5826, I voted no out of concern that Section 8 of

the bill could result in reciprocal actions from Iran to restrict the

travel of Iranians to the United States--preventing asylum-seekers and

others from escaping Iran's authoritarian government.
The bill would

additionally prevent thousands of Iranian Americans from being able to

visit family in Iran and similarly restrict visas by journalists,

educators, and other visitors who contribute to positive connections

between the people of Iran and the outside world.
I also oppose

provisions in Section 6 of H.R. 5826 that would break with decades of

diplomatic precedent and undermine U.S. capacity to negotiate with Iran

by restricting how Iranian government officials can travel to the

United States to attend meetings at the United Nations Headquarters in

New York City.
