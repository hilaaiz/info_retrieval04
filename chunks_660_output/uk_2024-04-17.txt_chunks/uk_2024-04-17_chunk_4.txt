businesses in my home state of Indiana.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the PEO industry for all

they do to help our Nation's small businesses and their employees

prosper.

RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL ``EDUCATION AND SHARING DAY''

_____

HON.
MARCUS J. MOLINARO

Mr. MOLINARO.
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the significance and

importance of Education and Sharing Day, a commemoration in honor of

The Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, and the values of

education and moral cultivation for which he stood.
The Rebbe emphasized the significance of moral and ethical education

as the foundation of humanity and an essential characteristic of a

thriving society.
Throughout his lifetime, his work cultivated hope for

a brighter future through the establishment of more than 6,000

educational and social institutions across all 50 states and in 100

countries spanning six continents.
Over the last four decades, the U.S. Congress has set aside

``Education and Sharing Day,'' and the recognition is proclaimed

annually by presiding U.S. presidents on the anniversary of the Rebbe's

birth, in honor of his commitment to teaching the next generation of

Americans the values that make our country strong.
Remembering the

Rebbe's message of education and contribution to society, Education and

Sharing Day provides the opportunity to recognize our responsibility in

ensuring that our Nation's youth have the tools to live a life of

purpose and fulfillment.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in

celebrating April 19, 2024 as Education and Sharing Day, to honor the

birthday of Rabbi Schneerson.
