RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PEO WEEK

_____

HON.
ERIN HOUCHIN

Mrs. HOUCHIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate National PEO

Week, which starts May 19 and ends May 25, 2024.
National PEO Week will celebrate the important contributions of the

professional employer organization (PEO) industry, which provides

payroll, employee benefits, compliance assistance, and HR services to

hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized businesses that employ

more than 4.5 million people.
PEOs play a critical role in helping businesses grow and thrive,

during good times and bad.
PEOs help their small business clients grow

7-9 percent faster, have employee turnover that is 10-14 percent lower,

and are 50 percent less likely to go out of business than businesses

that do not use a PEO.
PEOs help small businesses improve productivity and profitability and

focus on their core mission.
Through a PEO, the employees of small

businesses gain access to important employee benefits such as: 401(k)

plans; health, dental, life, and other insurance; dependent care; and

other benefits they might not typically receive as employees of a small

company.
I know the value that PEOs provide.
Before coming to Congress, I

worked for a PEO and witnessed the positive impact they had on small

businesses in my home state of Indiana.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the PEO industry for all

they do to help our Nation's small businesses and their employees

prosper.
