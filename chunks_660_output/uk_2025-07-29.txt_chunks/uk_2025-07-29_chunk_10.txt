In addition to her work with the AANA and VANA, Setnor has

contributed to the Accreditation Association of Ambulatory Health Care

as a member of the Governance Unit-Standards Development Committee and

served as the CRNA Advisor to the Virginia Board of Nursing's Committee

of the Joint Board of Medicine and Nursing.
Ms. Setnor earned her Master of Science in Nursing from Old Dominion

University in Norfolk, Virginia.
During her AANA presidency, Ms, Setnor has been a prominent advocate

for the patients and practice of nurse anesthesia before federal

agencies and members of Congress.
She has worked tirelessly to promote

anesthesia patient safety and the value of CRNAs to our healthcare

system.
Ms. Setnor has advocated to eliminate burdensome regulations

for CRNAs, to have CRNAs recognized as full practice providers in the

Veterans Health Administration, and to address underlying causes of

surprise billing such as provider discrimination.
I extend my sincere congratulations to Ms. Setnor today on a job well

done.
Her service to AANA and her commitment to safe, quality

anesthesia care nationwide, are highly commendable.
I ask my colleagues

to join me in recognizing Ms. Setnor's notable career and outstanding

achievements.
