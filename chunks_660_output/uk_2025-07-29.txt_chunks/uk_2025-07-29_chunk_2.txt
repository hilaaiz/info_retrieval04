Browntown in the Making

Browntown in modern times has been a part of Hookerton

Township, which lies within a deeply historical corridor that

connects the lived experiences of tri-racial descendants

throughout eastern North Carolina.
The Browntown Community

stands as a living testament to the enduring spirit of people

of tri-racial heritage.
Forged not by municipal charter but

by the shared tenacity of descendants from African, European,

and Tuscarora people of rural eastern North Carolina.
Browntown's legacy is one of resilience and unity.
Established as a free, autonomous, and safe haven before and

after the Civil War, it was home to pioneers of land

stewardship and mutual aid, all woven together by distinct

cultures into a thriving, mixed-rural community.
The

Browntown community is also not far from Wheat Swamp, as the

wooded wetlands offered natural seclusion for worship and

reflection during antebellum times.
This uncharted

settlement, born outside the boundaries of conventional

towns, cultivated a unique social fabric that honored mixed

people while cherishing common purpose.
Place of Worship and Study

Before the formalization of land deeds and property

holdings in Browntown, the people came together to worship.
Although not located in Browntown, Shady Grove Church is

closely linked to the community's history and identity, as it

was the first organized church established nearby as a place

of worship near Hookerton Town in Greene County.
Shady Grove

Church is the oldest known church serving people of mixed

race in the community, established in 1867 as a bush shelter

(a bush arbor) made of leaves and branches to offer shade

during worship.
Considered the mother church, Shady Grove

gave rise to several churches, reflecting its profound

spiritual influence.
The founding landowners Ellis Dixon, Ellis Suggs, Lewis

Dunn, Squire Turnage, and Ephraim Dixon laid the groundwork

for faith-based resilience in post-Civil War Greene County.
It is located approximately 6 to 9 miles from Browntown.
Shady Grove church represents the early roots of communal

worship that would later continue within Browntown itself

through Brown Chapel, Oak Grove, McCoy's Chapel Church, and

other churches in the community.
Established in 1899 and

formally deeded by Richard Brown in 1918.
The creation of

this church further cemented the community's spiritual

legacy.
As a central landholder and patriarch of the

Browntown community, by deeded land ``for church purposes

only'' to the United America Free Will Baptist Church, Brown

Chapel, later known as Brown Chapel.
This land, situated

along the public road from Brown's Crossroads to Glenfield

Road and near the cemetery road, served as sacred ground for

religious practices, fellowship, and ancestral remembrance.
The deed signed and witnessed on February 28, 1918,

represents one of the earliest documented acts of faith-based

land transfer by a mixed landowner in the county, reinforcing

the continuity of spiritual life that began at Shady Grove

and anchoring a new generation of worship in Browntown's

evolving identity.
Additionally, Browntown School served as an educational

center for generations of children in this rural tri-racial

community.
Though no longer standing, the school's memory

lives on through oral history and preserved photographs.
Its

foundation may remain buried on the original site, offering

future potential for archaeological or cultural recovery.
Browntown School was more than a building; it represented

self-determination, literacy, and intergenerational legacy

during a time when rural education for African American and

mixed, heritage children was underfunded and overlooked by

formal systems.
Its presence reinforces the longstanding

footprint of Browntown residents in shaping Greene County's

educational and civic landscape.
Living Summary of Browntown

A living testament to the complexity of North Carolina's

and America's rural past, it includes Richard Brown, a

cornerstone figure in Browntown's development.
Born in 1852,

to formerly enslaved or free parents, after living through

Emancipation and Reconstruction, a photograph taken of him

highlights a prominent figure.
It captures not just his face

but also his determination.
