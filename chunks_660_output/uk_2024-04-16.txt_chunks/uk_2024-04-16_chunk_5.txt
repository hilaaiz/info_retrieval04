RECOGNIZING DAVID GONZALEZ

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the

unique contributions made in our community by one of my constituents,

David Gonzalez, who is a valued volunteer with several community

organizations in Hernando County and has been a long-time employee of

our community's electric cooperative, Withlacoochee River Electric

Cooperative.
In this capacity, he has served as the face of the

organization in the community, presenting millions of dollars if credit

refunds to local governments and school boards.
Mr. Gonzalez has also

served in key leadership roles on the Board of Directors for several

non-profits in Hernando with the highest levels of dedication,

including: the Hernando Chamber of Commerce, Hernando Education

Foundation, Hernando Economic Development Council, Oak Hill Hospital

Board, and the United Way of Hernando Board.
Whenever there has been a

need, Mr. Gonzalez has stepped forward to address it, without concern

for who gets the credit.
A truly humble problem-solver, Mr.

Gonzalez embodies the concept of servant leadership and has made a

lasting impact on the organizations and communities he has served.
While we wish him all the best in his upcoming retirement, we know that

his departure from the cooperative will leave behind a void that will

not easily be replaced.
It is clear that Mr. Gonzalez has made a profoundly positive impact

on our community, and I am grateful for his service.

RECOGNIZING JANINE KELL

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the

unique contributions of one of my constituents, Ms. Janine Kell.
Ms.

Kell is an engaged and dedicated volunteer with Warrior 321, an anti-

human trafficking awareness group.
Most recently, Janine was

instrumental in hosting the community's second annual Light Up the

Night Hernando event to bring awareness about human trafficking to the

county.
Janine never sleeps and has truly dedicated her life in every way to

fighting on behalf of the vulnerable.
In addition to her work to

prevent the horrific crime of human trafficking, Janine regularly

speaks at local schools, educating students on the Monique Burr

curriculum.
The Monique Burr curriculum is a

comprehensive, evidence-based program for kids in grades K-5.
It

empowers children and relevant adults with information and strategies

to prevent, recognize, and appropriately respond to bullying,

cyberbullying, abuse, and digital abuse dangers.
Beyond advocacy,

Janine will often work directly with children who have been victims of

abuse to help ensure they get the support they need to fully recover.
Her compassion and empathy know no bounds.
It is clear that Ms. Kell has made a profoundly positive impact on

our community and on the lives of countless people she has worked with.
I am grateful for her service.
