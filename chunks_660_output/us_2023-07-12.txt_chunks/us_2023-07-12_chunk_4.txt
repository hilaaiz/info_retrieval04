The American Veteran is one of our greatest treasures.
The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen, who traveled here on June 12th answered our Nation's call to service during one of its greatest times of need.
From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the Korean Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave service and sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a hero.
We owe them more gratitude than can ever be expressed.
I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.
I am proud to include in the Record the names of these men and women for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and join me in expressing gratitude.

169, No.
119



Date: 2023-07-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 119 Pages: E666 - E667 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E666-E667] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH CHANCELLOR PATRICK GALLAGHER ON HIS RETIREMENT AFTER A DECADE OF SERVICE ______ of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Ms. LEE of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Patrick Gallagher of Pittsburgh, PA.
After nearly a decade serving as Chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, a tenure that included tremendous gains in Pitt's academic profile and demand, solidified the University's role as a community partner and anchor, and elevated Pitt's research stature, impact, and activity to near-peerless echelons of excellence, Mr. Gallagher will step down on July 15, 2023.
Over the course of Mr. Gallagher's Chancellorship, he enhanced the University of Pittsburgh's reputation as an economic engine for Pennsylvania.
One out of every 32 Pennsylvania workers earns their degree from Pitt, resulting in $5.2 billion in economic impact during his time.
He has also positioned Pitt to continue this record, shaping the University's future through facilities like The Assembly, Pitt BioForge, and Victory Heights.
