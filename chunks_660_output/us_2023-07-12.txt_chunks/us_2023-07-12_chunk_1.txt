Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Dickerson Park Zoo located in Springfield, Missouri.
The zoo was founded in 1923 on 100 acres of land that was acquired from the estate of Jerome Dickerson.
It houses more than 500 animals that represent 160 different species.
Last year alone, some 200,000 people visited the zoo.
But the zoo is more than a location where visitors can see exotic animals.
A staff of about 60 full-time and 25 seasonal employees, as well as 100 volunteers, are dedicated to the mission of connecting people with animals to encourage discovery and inspire conservation.
In 1985, the park became involved with the Species Survival Plan, a consortium of groups working to save animals from extinction.
The following year, the zoo became accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
More than 60,000 people a year participate in the zoo's conservation education programs held in the park's educational center.
Additionally, its Zoo to You programs visit schools, libraries and residential care centers around the state.
The zoo also provides outstanding research and medical care for all the animals and rehabilitates injured or orphaned native raptors through its Raptor Rehabilitation Program.
Once the birds are deemed healthy enough to survive on their own, they are released back into their natural habitat.
The zoo also is one of only five in the country that participates in a giraffe blood bank, and it recently became home for an orphaned cougar cub from the state of Washington.
Just like humans, preventive care is paramount for the animals and the zookeepers play an important role in the wellness staff as they spend a great deal of time with the animals and become very perceptive to subtle changes in an animal's health.
The Dickerson Park Zoo is a vital part of animal education, conservation and enjoyment for thousands of people living in and visiting the Springfield area.
We celebrate them and wish them the best for another 100 years. ____________________
