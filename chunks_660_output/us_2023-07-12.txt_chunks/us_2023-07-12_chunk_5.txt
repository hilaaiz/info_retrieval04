Over the course of Mr. Gallagher's Chancellorship, he enhanced the University of Pittsburgh's reputation as an economic engine for Pennsylvania.
One out of every 32 Pennsylvania workers earns their degree from Pitt, resulting in $5.2 billion in economic impact during his time.
He has also positioned Pitt to continue this record, shaping the University's future through facilities like The Assembly, Pitt BioForge, and Victory Heights.
These future projects are part and parcel of Mr. Gallagher's commitment to the University's student body.
Pitt student-athletes flourished under Patrick Gallagher's watch, earning 4 ACC championships in volleyball, 2 College Cup appearances for men's soccer, 1 conference championship in football, and 1 national wrestling championship.
And while the University's applications for admission rose to record highs under his tenure, he ensured that tuition rates would remain affordable for Pennsylvanians through Pitt's strong relationship with the Commonwealth.
Under Mr. Gallagher's leadership, the University provided unprecedented support to its world-class researchers and its surrounding community.
Today, the University ranks third in the country in terms of funding from the National Institutes of Health and secured its status and is one of just 24 universities nationwide to reach and exceed $1 billion in sponsored research expenditures.
With these numerous accomplishments, Mr. Gallagher departs with the sincere appreciation and respect of the Board of Trustees as well as the admiration of Pitt's administration, faculty, staff, students, and alumni.
Now, therefore, let it be proclaimed that the retirement of Chancellor Patrick D. Gallagher by celebrated and commended by all for exemplary leadership and remarkable contributions to higher education in Pennsylvania. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 119 Pages: E664 - E665 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E664-E665] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CALIFORNIA'S VERY FLAWED K-12 MATH FRAMEWORK ______ of california in the house of representatives Mrs. STEEL.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article written by Williamson M. Evers of California.
His works explains major flaws in the draft of the California State Board of Education's K-12 mathematics instructional framework.
The Board is having a final hearing today.
1.
Unscientific Teaching Methods Just as there is a science of reading instruction, there is a science of math instruction.
The scientific way of teaching math includes: having students memorize math facts (like multiplication tables and addition and subtraction facts) and standard algorithms (time-tested math procedures): teaching computational procedures and conceptual understanding together (and not as progressives would have it, concepts before procedures); stressing that getting answers to problems right and doing so quickly are components of math fluency; and bearing in mind that committing math facts and procedures to long-term memory frees the student's mind to handle novel problems.
Instead, the progressive-education authors of the math framework want students to learn through their own inquiry and self-discovery.
The authors give little emphasis to mastery of facts and standard algorithms.
The authors want to organize math instruction not in the architectonic system of increasing abstraction in which it has traditionally been taught, but instead in accordance with vague, billowy ``big ideas.''
Educational researcher Tom Loveless (retired from the Brookings lnstitution) says: ``The previous framework was very clear that math fluency involves speed and accuracy.
The proposed framework rejects speed as being even part of fluency, and that's a problem.''
The newly revised framework delays fluency in multiplication and division tables until late in elementary school.
This delay will spill over into subsequent math learning, and Loveless believes that many students will be unprepared for Algebra I even by ninth grade.
As I have written before (with my co-author, the late Ze'ev Wurman): The framework promotes only the progressive-education approach to teaching math, calling it ``student-led'' instruction, ``active learning,'' ``active inquiry,'' and ``collaborative'' instruction.
But evidence from the 1950s through recent times shows that this way of teaching math is ineffective.
