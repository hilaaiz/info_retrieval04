Then they should learn to use mathematics to transform the world--a rather inappropriate task for math class.
Conclusion There are close to

6 million students in California.
What is done in California public schools influences practices in the rest of the country.
Parents and taxpayers want math to be taught sensibly.
It's just a scientific reality that children need to learn math facts and standard algorithms.
This current California counterproductive math instructional framework will produce a repeat of the Math Wars of the 1990s or a deeper rebellion against public schools and in favor of parental choice. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE ARREST OF MR.
GAJENDRAKUMAR PONNAMBALAM; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-07-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 119 Pages: E662 - E662 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE ARREST OF MR.
GAJENDRAKUMAR PONNAMBALAM ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. RASKIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with Mr. Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam, a member of the Parliament of Sri Lanka.
Mr. Ponnambalam has recently been subjected to harassment and wrongful detention by Sri Lankan law enforcement.
Despite video evidence contradicting the official account and lack of an official arrest warrant, Mr. Ponnambalam was arrested for behaving in an unruly manner towards state intelligence officers during a public meeting.
Fortunately, he was released on bail shortly after his arrest.
While I am glad to hear of Mr. Ponnambalam's release, his harassment by Sri Lankan authorities remains highly troubling, and is part of a stream of attacks on minority members of the Sri Lankan parliament.
Mr. Ponnambalam is a member of the minority Tamil ethnic group who has advocated for the marginalized and spoken at the United Nations Human Rights Council about the killing of Tamil journalists.
Other members of the Sri Lankan parliament have faced harassment because of their activism over the past few months on the destruction of Tamil places of worship, militarization in the Northeast, and other crimes against members of the Tamil ethnic group.
Mr. Speaker, we must stand with the victims of human rights violations in their advocacy for their rights.
I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing support for Mr. Ponnambalam and in calling for the Sri Lankan government to commit to democratic values and practices. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the Erwin Township Historical Society and their newly constructed walking trail and artifact building in Erwin Heritage Park.
Erwin Township Historical Society has played an instrumental role in the preservation of Erwin's culture and history, and I'm confident their newest offerings will continue to have a lasting impact on residents for years to come.
Named as the first grant recipient from the Michigan History Alliance, the Erwin Township Historical Society has been deservingly recognized for their part in protecting and cataloguing Michigan's rich history.
From erecting park benches to the restoration of the East End Schoolhouse to become their museum, the Erwin Township Historical Society has expanded their reach in the community and has become a familiar and trustworthy service for all residents to utilize.
We are blessed to have organizations of this caliber in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, and I am appreciative of their work and service.
On July 1, 2023, the Erwin Township Historical Society will celebrate the completion and dedication of their new walking trail and artifact building in Erwin Heritage Park.
I want to thank all involved in the Erwin Township Historical Society for making these endeavors possible and for facilitating a successful ceremony.
