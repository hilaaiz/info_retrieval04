She and her husband, attorney William F. ``Willie'' Garcia, devoted their later years to the preservation of the ``Centro.''
Earlier in their lives, Vera and Willie were active in state and local politics, running campaigns, attending rallies and always supporting Democratic candidates at the local, state and federal levels.
At home, they would adorn Christmas gifts with handmade themed ornaments that they would spend months creating.
Their marriage was filled with love and support for each other, accompanied by humor that made their bond stronger.
The eldest of three girls, Vera was born to Francisco ``Pancho'' and Honorina ``Nora'' Tamargo.
She and her two sisters, Junis and Sandra, shared a room as children and their lives as adults.
Her devotion to her family was shown in her commitment to spend Christmas together with her two sisters and cousin Mary Louise.
Vera was beloved by her many

nieces, nephews and cousins who could call or stop by her home to say hello, help with a chore, or take her to a family gathering.
For her two sons, William and Joseph, Vera was that unshakable support who got them where they needed to pursue their interests from swim meets to Scouting camping trips.
Her grandchildren called her ``Bueli'', and they will remember her love and the way she lit up just hearing their voices.
Vera is survived by her sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren and many loved ones to whom I extend my deepest sympathies.
She will be remembered not only for her many years of selfless service, but also for her genuine compassion and kindness.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my sincere condolences to Vera's family and friends.
She impacted the lives of countless members of the Tampa Bay community and her steadfast leadership and patient mentorship undeniably enhanced the lives of my neighbors.
Tampa Bay is grateful for her contributions and the legacy she leaves. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 176 Pages: E1014 - E1015 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1014-E1015] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING WHITNEY ANDERSON'S APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERALLY-INSURED CREDIT UNIONS ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Whitney Anderson on her recent election to the Board of Directors of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU).
Credit unions play a vital role in our nation's banking ecosystem allowing more people to access capital, obtain mortgages, and receive other financial tools that are otherwise difficult to obtain.
Additionally, I've seen firsthand in my district, how credit unions provided vital services during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that the smallest of businesses received the necessary aid to assist during such trying times.
Whitney currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of Elements Financial, headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana.
She previously served as Chief Community Development Officer at Michigan State University Federal Credit Union, served as President of the Desk Drawer Fund, and President of Ever Green 3C. Additionally, Whitney has had significant community involvement on boards such as the African American Credit Union Coalition (AACUC) National Board, MLK Commission of Mid-Michigan, and United Way.
Her years of leading a broad range of teams, projects, and responsibilities provide a solid foundation and will add a unique perspective in her new role.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Whitney Anderson and wishing her the best of luck in her new role on the NAFCU Board of Directors.
I look forward to working with her and NAFCU members to better serve our constituents across Indiana's 7th Congressional District. ____________________
