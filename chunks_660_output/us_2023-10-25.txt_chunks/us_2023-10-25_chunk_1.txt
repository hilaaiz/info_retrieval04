Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Van Raalte Farmhouse.
The Van Raalte Farmhouse has been a staple of our West Michigan community for generations, and we thank the City of Holland for preserving not only this site but the legacy of the Van Raalte family.
The farmland was purchased by the founder of Holland, Reverend Albertus Van Raalte, in 1847.
The Reverend split the land between two of his children, Albertus and Benjamin, as a gift for their valiant service during the Civil War.
Benjamin, a soldier in the Union Army who served in Michigan's 25th Infantry, purchased his brother's half of the land and constructed a beautiful neoclassical farmhouse on the property in the early 1870s.
Benjamin cultivated the land for the remainder of his life, producing peaches and peony flowers.
The farm became known as ``The Maples'' due to the large sugar maples grown on the property.
The farm stayed in the family for multiple generations until it was sold in the 1980s to the city of Holland, Michigan.
Holland helped transform the farmhouse and its land into a beautiful park.
In 1989, Van Raalte Farmhouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Today, community members continue to enjoy hikes and picnics as well as cross-country skiing and sledding in the winter at the park.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in commemorating 150 years of history at the Van Raalte Farmhouse as the Van Raalte family's story and the farmhouse's beauty continue to inspire the people of Michigan's Fourth District. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Cook Out on being named one of the top ten regional fast-food restaurants in the country according to USA Today's Readers Choice 2023.
Cook Out opened in 1989 in Greensboro, North Carolina and has since spread nationwide, operating more than 300 locations across the Southern United States.
However, Cook Out has remained true to its Carolina roots and is a regional staple, best known for its famous tray combos and delicious milkshakes.
I have been a big fan of Cook Out since I was growing up in North Carolina.
To this day, one of my favorite parts about going home after a long stint in Washington is being able to sit down and enjoy Cook Out with my family, friends, or staff.
Cook Out is a cultural icon and an esteemed member of our community in North Carolina.
Its economic and community impact on our state is astounding and I look forward to continuing to work with them to see what they will accomplish in the future.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing Cook Out, its leaders, and employees on this momentous occasion and thanking them for all they do for our shared home of North Carolina. ____________________
