INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GIFT SHOP TAX ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
176



Date: 2023-10-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 176 Pages: E1014 - E1014 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GIFT SHOP TAX ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Gift Shop Tax Act, which would allow state and local governments to impose a sales tax at gift shops on federal property.
These governments would be able to generate millions of dollars in new tax revenue.
When the federal government engages in activity that is not inherently governmental, such as operating a gift shop, there is no reason to exempt customer purchases from a sales tax.
The items sold at federal gift shops, such as jewelry, apparel, accessories, games and books, are subject to a sales tax if sold on private property.
Customers are often unaware of the exemption from a sales tax at gift shops on federal property, so the introduction of a sales tax is unlikely to have a significant impact on gift shop sales.
It would, however, create a valuable revenue stream for state and local governments.
In addition, state and local governments often provide uncompensated services on federal property, such as fire service, and allowing them to impose a sales tax at gift shops on federal property would allow them to recoup some of these costs.
This bill is of particular importance to the District of Columbia, which is home to a number of gift shops on federal property, such as at the Smithsonian Institution and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
ISRAEL AT WAR; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-10-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 176 Pages: E1014 - E1014 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ISRAEL AT WAR ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. KIGGANS of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following message I shared on October 11 at a meeting of Jewish leaders with Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia at the offices of the United Jewish Federation of Tidewater in Virginia Beach.
Thank you Governor Youngkin for your initiatives to fight the precipitous rise of anti-Semitism in these United States and around the world.
Your very timely visit with us so shortly after the October 7 terrorist Hamas vicious attacks on Israel's innocent civilians near the Gaza border is deeply appreciated along with ordering the lowering of the flag throughout the Commonwealth.
We turn to our shared one God of life's blessings who always brings us together to be one caring family, gratefully united and gloriously diverse, ever harkening onto the divine commandments of loving-kindness.
At this painfully trying time of excruciating anguish and an over-whelming sense of violation by heartless enemies of humanity and civilized society, evoking terrifying images of the Holocaust deeply seared within us and to which I can personally testify as son of Polish survivors who lost hundreds of murdered relatives, and one who spent his early childhood in Europe's transit and DP Camps, later growing up in Haifa, Israel and serving in the IDF in the 1960s.
