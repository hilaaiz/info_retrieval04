Date: 2023-10-25 Volume: 169, Issue: 176 Pages: E1015 - E1015 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE REMARKABLE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ELVIRA ``VERA'' TAMARGO GARCIA ______ of florida in the house of representatives Ms. CASTOR of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of Elvira ``Vera'' Tamargo Garcia, who passed away at the age of 88 on August 8, 2023.
She was a lifelong Tampa native and devoted teacher who dedicated her life to civic service.
Vera's contributions and tireless dedication to the Tampa Bay community will forever be remembered.
Vera embodied the true spirit of public service, exemplifying the values of compassion, dedication and mentorship.
Throughout her 48-year career as a teacher at Broward, Ballast Point and Mendenhall elementary schools, she left a mark on hundreds of students she taught, their parents, and new teachers she mentored.
Throughout her career, Vera taught in every elementary grade.
Her passion was for early childhood education, and she played an important role in launching kindergarten instruction in Hillsborough County schools.
Her talent and experience as an educator were evident in the numerous accomplishments she achieved.
Vera's recognitions included Florida's Outstanding Young Educator in 1966 and was ranked fourth at the national level.
She attended the University of Tampa for her bachelor's degree and subsequently earned a master's degree from the University of South Florida.
In her classroom, Vera strived to teach her students the values of respect and friendship along with phonics and counting, and her selfless service is manifested in the good principles of my Tampa Bay neighbors.
Her tenacious determination as an instructor to future generations shaped much of her perspective and identity, but her work as a caregiver extended beyond the classroom.
Many knew Vera for her work advocating for Tampa's Latino heritage, protecting and preserving the Centro Asturiano de Tampa's original cemetery and its 121-year-old building.
Vera took the role of president for the historic social club for immigrants and their descendants, making her the first woman to hold that position at the ``Centro.''
She and her husband, attorney William F. ``Willie'' Garcia, devoted their later years to the preservation of the ``Centro.''
Earlier in their lives, Vera and Willie were active in state and local politics, running campaigns, attending rallies and always supporting Democratic candidates at the local, state and federal levels.
At home, they would adorn Christmas gifts with handmade themed ornaments that they would spend months creating.
