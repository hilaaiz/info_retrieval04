Mr. Speaker, today I want to recognize Covenant Community Care, a well-known and trusted healthcare provider, as they celebrate the grand opening of their newest health clinic on Joy Road in Detroit in the 12th Congressional District.
Covenant Care grew from humble beginnings in southwest Detroit when a doctor and pastor joined forces to with the simple idea of providing free healthcare access to the uninsured.
The doctor delivered on her promise to provide free healthcare to the uninsured and many more rallied behind the cause, creating Covenant Community Care in 2000.
The need for more resources was evident, and Covenant Community Care has been steadfast in its mission to remove barriers to high quality healthcare services.
Over the years, Covenant Community Care has leveraged partnerships with other medical service providers and now has several locations across metropolitan Detroit.
I had the honor of securing House-appropriated Community Project Funding for Covenant Community Care in FY2023 to support the construction of their newest clinic to provide critical services to our community.
Covenant has operated a small health clinic at 18917 Joy Rd in Detroit for nearly eight years that has limited their ability to expand services.
This project will be impactful not only tripling the clinical footprint in the community but providing accessibility to essential care like primary medical, dental, and behavioral health services to the Cody-Rouge neighborhood and surrounding communities.
I am always incredibly honored to serve as a partner for the Covenant Community Care team and appreciate the ongoing high level of care and compassion you provide to our communities across the district and region.
We offer congratulations and wish them well on the opening of their new clinic. ____________________
