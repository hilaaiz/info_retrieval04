HONORING JUSTINA SALINAS

HON.
MIKE THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor

Justina Salinas, whom I have named the California 4th District's 2025

Climate Crisis Champion of the Year for Solano County in recognition of

her visionary leadership in regenerative agriculture, habitat

restoration, and environmental advocacy.
Born in Sacramento, California, Ms. Salinas graduated from the

American School of London and earned her bachelor's degree from Santa

Clara University, where she majored in both E-commerce and Studio Art,

with additional minors in Entrepreneurship and Retail Management.
Inspired by her grandparents who immigrated to California from

Guanajuato, Mexico, in the 1960s and worked in the fields with a

profound respect for nature, Ms. Salinas founded Araceli Farms in 2017,

a small lavender farm in Dixon.
What began as a family-run venture evolved into a model of

environmental restoration for all.
Ms. Salinas has transformed her farm

into a thriving native grassland meadow, prioritizing regenerative

agriculture practices including soil health restoration, dry farming,

biodiversity conservation, no till farming, integrated rotational

grazing, natural pest management, and native plant reintegration.
Her

farm has become a haven for the native species of our Solano County,

with blue belly lizards, egrets, herons, red-tailed hawks, barn owls,

and other species all thriving on the property.
By intentionally

choosing not to disturb the soil, Ms. Salinas has fostered a living,

nutrient-rich environment that has become a sanctuary for wildlife and

a beacon of sustainable land stewardship.
Ms. Salinas views farming as an act of healing.
Her practices reflect

a commitment to ethical farming, water conservation, and environmental

justice, embodying a new model of agriculture that harmonizes

production with ecological renewal.
Ms. Salinas also acknowledges the

privilege of her access to land.
She has made it a mission for Araceli

Farms to serve as a space for reflection, learning, and community

connection, fostering opportunities for young people and aspiring

farmers to engage with the natural world.
Beyond her farm, Ms. Salinas is an active member of the Community

Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF) Policy Committee and the California

Native Plant Society.
She volunteers with organizations like the

Research Conservation District, participates in native plant

restoration projects, and has lent her voice to lobbying efforts in

Sacramento, advocating for regenerative agriculture and sustainable

food systems to leaders at the California State Capital.
Additionally,

Ms. Salinas donates gift baskets to schools, hospitals, and animal

rescues, cares for the elderly, supports underprivileged youth, and

regularly participates in trash cleanups in our community.
Mr. Speaker, Justina Salinas reminds us that farming is more than a

profession, rather a relationship with the land and a call to

stewardship.
Her resilience, kindness, and unwavering dedication to

ecological justice make her a powerful role model in Solano County and

beyond.
For these reasons and more, it is fitting and proper that we

recognize her today as Solano County's 2025 Climate Crisis Champion of

the Year.
