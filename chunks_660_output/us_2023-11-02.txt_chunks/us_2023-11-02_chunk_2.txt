Mr. Speaker, while I strongly oppose a nuclear Iran, I will vote against this Resolution because it states that U.S. policy is ``to use all means necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.''
That language allows for an open-ended war authorization, using all means necessary, which I deem inappropriate.
I believe that America's military commitments must be tied to clearly defined strategies, and vague war authorizations have, unfortunately, been used as justifications for unwarranted military actions in recent history.
I will vote against this Resolution, the majority of which I agree with, because I do not want to see foreign policy mistakes mirrored. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, this month, I had the honor of attending the New Jersey Dogs of Honor Graduation ceremony.
The New Jersey Dogs of Honor is a nonprofit program founded in 2018 with a noble mission: to provide rescue service dogs, who faced the prospect of euthanasia, to military veterans diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress.
This initiative is a collaborative effort involving Maurice River Township Firefighters, Ted's Pet Country Club, Veterans Affairs, local businesses, and individuals who hold a deep appreciation for the courageous men and women who have served our nation.
During the recent graduation ceremony on October 14th, we had the honor of witnessing the bond between these veterans and their loyal canine companions.
On this day, we celebrated Roger Asher with his dog Gunny, Diana Pitman with Finn, Thomas Huck with Sasha, David Clemenko with Milo, William Hannum with Bailey, and Mario Bellasci with Tucker.
These veterans and their dogs represent the spirit of resilience, hope, and companionship.
As we commemorate this occasion, let us recognize the significance of such initiatives in supporting our veterans as they navigate the challenges of Post-Traumatic Stress.
God Bless the Dogs of Honor and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________
