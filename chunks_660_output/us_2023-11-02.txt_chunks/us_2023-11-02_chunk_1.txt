Mr. Speaker, today, I share an inspiring tale of dedication and unity surrounding the construction of a magnificent Hindu temple in central New Jersey, embodying the values of seva and bhakti.
This temple, now celebrated as the largest Hindu temple outside India in the modern era, stands as a tribute to these enduring values.
Crafted from marble and limestone, it required about 4.7 million hours of meticulous hand-carving by artisans and volunteers.
These stones, originating from Italy and Bulgaria, traveled 8,000 miles to find their place in New Jersey.
The Robbinsville temple is one of many built by the BAPS, a worldwide religious and civic organization within the Swaminarayan sect.
This project exemplifies volunteerism, personal growth, and universal values that transcend religious boundaries.
It symbolizes unity, service, and devotion, reflecting the core principles shared by people worldwide.
May it serve as a reminder of the common values that bind humanity together, inspiring us to embrace unity, service, and devotion in our own lives. ____________________
