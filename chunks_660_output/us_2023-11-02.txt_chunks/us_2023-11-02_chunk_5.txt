On October 1, 1973, the late Thomas Gartland founded the firm with an emphasis on teamwork and a focus on client success.
Sticking to these founding principles, the company quickly became Northern Michigan's largest, full-service, public accounting firm.
For the past 50 years, DGN has been committed to elevating their clients, providing extraordinary attention to detail, and hands-on service to businesses and individuals in their community.
DGN has expanded to boast more than 55 professionals, 2 offices, and 12 partners who serve Northern Michigan.

As exemplified by the staff, DGN's community-centric values are what distinguishes them in their endeavor to serve and improve the lives of those in Northern Michigan.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Dennis, Gartland, & Niergarth on their 50th anniversary.
I'd like to thank them for their continued dedication to the people of Northern Michigan and wish them and their staff all the best in their future endeavors. ____________________
