Lisa has prioritized recognizing and serving overlooked

constituencies in the military community, especially women veterans.
She testified before Congress to raise awareness for the lack of

funding for military sexual trauma veterans.
In 2017, she was honored

by the State of Indiana with the Torchbearer Award, and in 2023, she

was inducted into the Indiana Military Veterans Hall of Fame.
Lisa

Wilken has established a legacy in the Indianapolis and surrounding

communities that will be felt and deeply appreciated for future

generations of service women and men.
Even within the veteran community, women veterans tend to be

overlooked and underrecognized.
That is why I am proud to honor the

many Hoosier women veterans who selflessly serve our community.
Beginning with its namesake, the Sheila Corcoran Hoosier Women Hero

Award was created to highlight exemplary Hoosier women veterans whose

service to their community and Nation is unparalleled.
I ask my

colleagues to join me in recognizing Lisa Wilken.
I thank Lisa for her

service and for her advocacy as she continues to be a voice of her

peers, for her persistence, and for her commitment to the veteran

community.
