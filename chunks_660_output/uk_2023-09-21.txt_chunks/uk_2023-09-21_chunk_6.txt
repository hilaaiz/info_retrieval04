RECOGNIZING SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JERRY LEE LORTON, USA, RETIRED, WITH A

CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN COMMENDATION

HON.
PETE SESSIONS

Mr. SESSIONS.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present retired U.S. Army

Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, of Cameron, Texas, with a

Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His servant's life reflects the

hard work and dedication that exemplifies the best of our Central Texas

values.
Jerry Lorton entered active duty at Atlanta, Georgia in May of 1977--

a young 20-year-old about to embark on a distinguished Army career that

would span the next two decades of his life.
Retired Sergeant Lorton's Army career would take him on 5 overseas

tours, including to the Persian Gulf War and 2 tours in Korea.
His

dedication was rewarded many times.
Recognized for expert marksmanship

with rifle, pistol, and grenade, he earned an Army Commendation Medal,

Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), National Defense Service Medal,

Southwest Asia Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, Master

Aircraft Crewman Badge, and an Air Assault Badge.
Since retiring in 1997, Jerry Lorton has been a dedicated servant

leader in his community.
For more than a quarter century he has helped

protect his neighbors and community as a volunteer firefighter with the

Cameron Volunteer Fire Department.
He serves as a Deacon in his faith

community, Cameron's Grace Church, where he continues to protect his

neighbors as one of a four-person church security team.
He works as a

school bus driver for the Cameron Independent School District.
A

patriot and a leader, he currently serves as the Commander of Cameron's

VFW Post 2010, having long been the kind of member that, in the words

of the Texas District 28 Commander, ``exemplifies everything the VFW

wants in its leaders.''
I proudly commend Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, USA, (Ret,)

to his friends, family, and colleagues, and salute his service to the

Army and Texas by awarding him a Congressional Veteran Commendation

from the 17th Congressional District of Texas.
