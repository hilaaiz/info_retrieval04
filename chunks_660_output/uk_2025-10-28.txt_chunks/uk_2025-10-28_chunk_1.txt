CONGRATULATING THE TABB HIGH SCHOOL TIGERS GOLF TEAM

_____

HON.
ROBERT J. WITTMAN

Mr. WITTMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Tabb High

School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia, for winning the

Virginia Class 3, Region A Golf Championship--their first regional

title since 2001.
The Tigers were led by Cooper Guldin, whose round of 74 earned him

the individual medalist honor followed by outstanding performances from

Jack Houseknecht and Brodi Bartee, who each contributed standout

performances shooting their lowest scores of the season, Ethan

Thompson, Chriss Bassett, and Ainsley Asbury.
Competing among seven strong teams at Dogwood Trace Golf Course in

Petersburg, the Tigers captured the championship by narrowly edging

York High School by just three shots for the victory.
This hard-fought

win secured Tabb a well-earned berth in the Virginia High School League

(VHSL) state tournament and marked a historic return to regional

prominence for the golf team.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in congratulating the Tabb High

School Tigers Golf Team of York County, Virginia.
May they continue to

represent their school with great pride.

Mr. SUBRAMANYAM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend

Bishop Leslie Patterson, Jr. and Co-Pastor Dr. Francene Patterson on

the occasion of their 30th Pastoral Anniversary at First Baptist

Church.
Under their leadership and guidance, First Baptist Church has grown

into a flourishing ministry rooted in service, fellowship, and

community.
Together, they have transformed lives, strengthened

families, and built a legacy grounded in compassion, responsibility,

and faith.
Bishop and Co-Pastor Patterson have shown exceptional dedication to

the Northern Virginia community through their ministry's outreach and

impact.
They have nurtured over one hundred children through the

church's childcare center, provided food assistance to more than 5,000

families through the Manna from Heaven Food Pantry, and hosted a COVID-

19 vaccine clinic during a time of great need.
Their partnerships with

small and minority-owned businesses, schools, nonprofits, and civic

organizations have created lasting connections that continue to uplift

lives across the region.
Mr. Speaker, Bishop Leslie Patterson, Jr. and Co-Pastor Dr. Francene

Patterson exemplify what it means to lead with faith and purpose.
I ask

my colleagues to join me in congratulating them on this milestone

anniversary and commending their outstanding service to their

congregation and the broader community.
