He was also instrumental in leading the effort last Congress to

modernize leadership roles and succession planning in the Office of the

Legislative Counsel.
While Noah's service over the years has benefited

the House in many ways, his dedication to teaching staff the art of

legislative drafting has left an indelible and lasting mark on this

institution.
Teaching is a talent that Noah exemplifies as thousands of

current and former House staffers will attest.
While Noah has been recognized by friends and colleagues for his

steadfast commitment to public service and his expertise in the

legislative drafting process, it is his unparalleled sense of humor

that truly sets him apart.
Over the course of his nearly four decades

of service, the House saw a lot of change.
Noah's ability to constantly

adapt and consistently excel--all while maintaining his sense of

humor--is a bold testament to his dedication to the House of

Representatives and the people it serves.
I wish Noah the best for his

well-earned retirement.
On behalf of my colleagues and the entire House community, I thank

him for his leadership and longstanding commitment to serving the

People's House.
