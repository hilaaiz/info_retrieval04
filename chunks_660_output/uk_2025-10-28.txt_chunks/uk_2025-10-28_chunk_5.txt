In pure economic

terms alone, in 2022 immigrants generated some $1.6 trillion in

economic activity and contributed more than $579 billion in local,

state and federal taxes, and today millions of American workers are

employed at immigrant-founded and immigrant-owned companies.
Immigration is and will increasingly be essential to meeting workplace

demand.
Our immigrant communities maintain ties to their countries of

origin and thus strengthen our Nation's indispensable international

bonds.
At a time when too many immigrant communities here and elsewhere are

being unfairly targeted and villainized, it is more important than ever

that we recognize, celebrate and extend our support to our dynamic,

diverse and thriving immigrant community and thank all immigrants for

your belief in and contributions to our country.
Mahalo.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF MARGARET HOPSON BROWN

_____

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

life and legacy of Margaret Hopson Brown, a beloved member of our

community whose warmth and kindness touched the lives of many.
Born on

December 19, 1954, to David and Mary Hopson, Margaret lived a life rich

with love, adventure, and purpose.
Margaret passed away on September 8, 2025, leaving behind a legacy of

love and laughter.
A Celebration of Life service was held on Saturday,

September 13, 2025, at Valley Queen M.B. Church, officiated by Rev.

Lesta Anderson and Rev. Dexter Davis, with interment at Booker

Cemetery.
Margaret was a lifelong member of Shady Grove M.B. Church, where she

served faithfully, embodying the spirit of a true servant of the Lord.
Her life was a testament to her faith, as she accepted Christ at an

early age and lived out her beliefs through acts of kindness and

service.
Known for her ability to turn everyday moments into celebrations,

Margaret's presence was a gift to all who knew her.
Whether she was

spinning wild stories, sharing a perfect joke, or ensuring no one left

her table hungry, Margaret's warmth drew people in and made strangers

feel like lifelong friends.
Margaret was preceded in death by her parents; her husband Royal

Brown, Jr.; and five siblings.
She leaves behind a loving family,

including her four sisters, Dorothy, Frances, Brenda, and Pinky; her

brother, Andrew Lee; and a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, aunts, and

special friends, including the Class of 1970 and the Golden Hearts

Social club.
Though Margaret's time with us has ended, her story lives on in every

lesson taught, every memory shared, and every heart she touched.
Her

legacy is proof that some people never truly leave us.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of

Margaret Hopson Brown, whose kindness, resilience, and love will

continue to inspire us all.

HONORING THE REPUBLIC DAY OF KAZAKHSTAN

_____

HON.
SYDNEY KAMLAGER-DOVE

Ms. KAMLAGER-DOVE.
Mr. Speaker, as Ranking Member of the House

Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on South and Central Asia, I

rise today alongside my colleague and Chair, Mr. Huizenga of Michigan,

to honor and congratulate the people of Kazakhstan as they mark the

Republic Day of Kazakhstan, which commemorates Kazakhstan's declaration

of sovereignty independent of the Soviet Union on October 25, 1990.
The

United States has remained committed to Kazakhstan's sovereignty,

independence, and territorial integrity.
Now, as a valued strategic

partner of the United States, our nations work together to advance

security, peace, and prosperity.
Kazakhstan inherited a massive nuclear stockpile and legacy sites for

chemical and biological weapons research following the dissolution of

the Soviet Union.
The voluntary commitment to rapidly remove these

weapons from its territory and accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty

and other key arms control measures was a model for the region and the

world.
Kazakhstan has also made significant contributions to UN

peacekeeping missions, including independent deployments of

peacekeepers from 2024.
