Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a special man, Reverend Dr. Keith G. Tyler, Sr.

He launched a live radio broadcast in 2022.
He is a motivating speaker, an inspiring preacher, and an innovative leader.
He enjoys traveling across the nation evangelizing.
Reverend Tyler is an active leader in the community.
He serves many organizations, including the Speigel Hill Community Center, the Black Faith Leaders of Lexington and Vicinity, and the Central KY Council for Peace and Justice.
In addition, he is a trustee of Simmons College of Kentucky, and he serves on the Community Police Chaplain ``Response Team.''
He is the proud father and grandfather of four children and three grandchildren.
Reverend Tyler is to be commended for his ministry over 25 years at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church.
I congratulate him and all the members of the congregation and wish them many more years of serving our Lord.
