A graduate of Hempfield Area High School and the University of Pittsburgh-Johnstown, Mark joined the family business at Smail Auto Group and spent the next 40 years establishing the company as an institutional pillar of the Westmoreland County business community.
Mark replaced his father as General Manager in 2018 and became the third generation of the Smail family to lead the business.
Mark distinguished himself through his leadership, business acumen, and dedication to the community.
The Westmoreland County Chamber of Commerce named Smail Auto Group the 2021 Business of the Year, largely due to the company's ability to keep all 500 employees on staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mark's continuous participation in industry and community associations also earned widespread praise.
In recognition of his commitment to civic engagement, the Pennsylvania Automotive Association awarded Mark the 2021 Bud Smail Political Advocacy Award.
The award pays homage to Mark's late father, who inspired him to work hard and give back to his community.
Mark shared his father's determination to give back to the community and strived to make southwestern Pennsylvania a better place to live.
As a philanthropist, Mark raised millions of dollars for local nonprofits.
He contributed to and volunteered with many organizations, including the Pittsburgh Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, the Magee-Women's Research Institute and Foundation, the Troops First Foundation, the Westmoreland Cultural Trust, and the Westmoreland Food Bank.
As a devoted husband and father, Mark cherished his friends and family.
Mark will be remembered by his wife of 35 years, Kelly, and their children, Taylor and Marcus.
His memory will undoubtedly serve as an example of love, devotion to one's family, and selfless service.
Mr. Speaker, Mark Smail dedicated his life to the people of Westmoreland County and southwestern Pennsylvania.
His legacy is the epitome of a life well-lived.
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I wish his family healing during this difficult time. ____________________
