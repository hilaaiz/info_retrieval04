Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the Job Corps program on 60 years of dedicated support in changing the lives of young Americans.
2024 marks six decades of ambition and hope for our young Mainers at the centers in Limestone and Bangor, and throughout the United States of America.
Maine's Job Corps programs are vital for preparing young people in the Great State of Maine for high demand industry sector employment as well as furthering educational opportunities.
I join my congressional colleagues in honoring and supporting their mission to better the lives of Mainers through technical and academic training.
Since the first class of students in 1997, the Loring Job Corps Center in Limestone has helped students from Maine and across the Nation earn high school diplomas, construct long-term careers, and obtain great jobs.
The Penobscot Job Corps has maintained the same mission for the past 45 years.
Education and community service alike are two of the cornerstones of both Job Corps Centers in Maine, resulting in the students not only changing their lives but the lives of those around them.
The program's outreach and development with workforce partners has only enhanced its ability to reach out and enrich the lives of young Mainers.
The Job Corps program encourages the vital education and creativity of bright young students throughout our country.
It is with great pride and appreciation that I congratulate our two Maine Centers and Job Corps for 60 years of critical work. ____________________

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. McCOLLUM.
Mr. Speaker, today I joined thousands of people in Minnesota who gathered for the public funeral for Burnsville Police Officers Paul Elmstrand and Matthew Ruge, and Firefighter-Paramedic Adam Finseth who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.
On Sunday, February 18, 2024, these courageous public servants answered a call to protect a family and our community, and were gunned down in a horrific act of violence.
This heartbreaking incident occurs amid a crisis of gun violence and domestic abuse, and our first responders are on the front lines every day.
Officers Elmstrand and Ruge dedicated their lives to protecting our community.
Firefighter-Paramedic Finseth was committed to saving lives, as he was attempting to do that day.
He also served our Nation proudly in the U.S. Army, twice deploying on tours of duty in Iraq.
Their deaths in the line of duty are a devastating tragedy that touches their families, their fellow first responders, the Burnsville community, the state of Minnesota, and our Nation.
I extend my deepest condolences to their families and friends who loved them.
Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered and honored. ____________________
