RECOGNIZING THE MARITIME SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE COUNCIL'S PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE USMMA CAMPUS; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-28 Volume: 170, Issue: 36 Pages: E189 - E190 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E189-E190] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE MARITIME SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE COUNCIL'S PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE USMMA CAMPUS ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. GARBARINO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Congressional Board of Visitors to thank the experts of the Maritime Security Infrastructure Council.
Recognizing the vital role of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in our national security and concerned about outdated and deteriorating conditions across campus, they assembled a straightforward, multi-year plan to bring the campus up to a standard commensurate with its crucial function.
I am pleased to include in the Record a summary of their plan to modernize the Academy's 80-year-old infrastructure as well as a link to the Full Speed Ahead Plan in its entirety, which can be found at https://wearetheusmma.com/fullspeedahead/ .
Graduates of the USMMA, one of our Nation's five federal service academies, make up more than 80 percent of the U.S. Navy Strategic Sealift Officer Force.
Without these service-committed mariners, the Nation would have no assured source of trained, licensed officers to crew the vessels which move materiel, fuel and supplies to foreign shores in wartime.
Without a comprehensive capital improvement plan and its timely execution, conditions on the USMMA's Kings Point, New York campus will continue to worsen, adversely impacting mission-critical training and hindering recruitment of dedicated service-obligated midshipmen.
For far too long, Congress has ignored the infrastructure required to provide USMMA midshipmen the specialized education and training they need to fulfill their mission.
It is now time to make the institution worthy of their commitment to serve our Nation.
Maritime Security Infrastructure Council U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Full Speed Ahead Plan Full Speed Ahead: A Plan to Address Critical Infrastructure Needs at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Background: In January 2021, the Maritime Security Infrastructure Council (MSIC), a group with expertise in major construction project management and concerned about the deterioration of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) infrastructure, developed a comprehensive plan to bring the campus up to the standards necessary to prepare USMMA Midshipmen to lead our Nation's maritime mission in the 21st century.
The Full Speed Ahead Plan is an intensive 8-year program to execute a decades overdue, comprehensive modernization: new academic buildings, physical readiness/training facilities, midshipmen morale and welfare spaces, parking structures, faculty and senior staff housing, utilities, IT, and campus security upgrades, and renovations of many existing buildings.
This plan is adaptable, e.g., it can be adjusted for longer construction timelines and funding schedules, and--importantly--it is intended to be executed while keeping USMMA fully operational throughout construction.
Previous cost estimates were $611M in January 2021 and $820M in March 2022.
The estimated cost when adjusted for inflation has now risen to $1.02B; additional delay will only further increase the cost of this urgently needed modernization.
The need: With over 80 years

in service to our nation, a comprehensive modernization is long overdue if USMMA is to continue producing world-class, service-committed merchant marine officers who are the backbone of the U.S. Navy's Strategic Sealift Officer Force and a crucial element of defense readiness.
Congress has rightly recognized the necessity of and supported funding modernization projects at the other federal service academies, especially West Point and Annapolis.
