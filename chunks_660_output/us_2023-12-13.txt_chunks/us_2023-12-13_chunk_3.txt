Additionally, she was tasked with several special missions directly supporting the Secretary of the Army.
From these successes she was ultimately promoted to Chief of the Congressional Inquiry Division in 2018.
During her tenure, Mrs. Cromwell has guided the division and organization through numerous major events.
Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Cromwell has loyally served the Department of the Army throughout the Cold War, Operations Just Cause, Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Noble Eagle, the September 11, 2001 tragedy, Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, Inherent Resolve and Freedom's Sentinel.
For her indelible contributions to our country, Mrs. Cromwell received the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal, Superior Civilian Service Award, Commander's Award for Civilian Service, and the Civilian Service Achievement Medal.
She did not serve because she wanted awards and accolades, however.
She served because she believed in the vital importance of her work.
Mrs. Cromwell has been an invaluable asset to our government, our men and women in uniform, and the American people.
Although many will be sad to see her departure, she deserves a long and happy retirement.
As she starts this next chapter, I wish her, her husband Stewart, her two sons, and the rest of their family and friends well.
I am certain that all my fellow Members of the

House will join me in thanking Mrs. Michelle Cromwell for her commitment and contributions to our Nation. ____________________

Date: 2023-12-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 205 Pages: E1223 - E1223 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ABRAHAM SCHNITZER ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. BABIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th birthday of First Lieutenant Abraham ``Abe'' Schnitzer of Houston, Texas, and his service as a navigator in the United States Army Air Corps during the Second World War.
Mr. Schnitzer was born in Port Arthur, Texas, on August 18, 1923.
After graduating from Port Arthur High School, he went to work for Bethlehem (previously called Pennsylvania) Shipyard in Beaumont, Texas.
In 1942, while working as a foreman overseeing shipbuilding operations, Mr. Schnitzer felt called to quit his ``safe job'' and join the military to defend his country.
He did so and was commissioned in the United States Army Air Corps.
He specialized as a navigator on the B-17 Flying Fortress.
He was first assigned to the 445th Bombardment Group of the 2nd Air Division of the Eighth Air Force to continue training on B-17 bombers.
He was soon designated the lead navigator of the entire group and guided many bombing missions over Nazi-occupied France and Belgium.
As the war continued, he was eventually placed in the B-24 Liberator, where he and his crew carried out 20 dangerous missions over Germany.
In fact, his bombardment group led the first bombing mission on Berlin.
American actor and icon Jimmy Stewart was one of the officers in that group, and he would join Mr. Schnitzer and the other airmen in their downtime.
During his time in the European Theater, Mr. Schnitzer flew 24 combat missions and accumulated 165 combat flight hours.
According to his service records, he ``navigated B-24 aircraft over land and sea by dead reckoning, pilotage, celestial, and radio navigation.''
