American actor and icon Jimmy Stewart was one of the officers in that group, and he would join Mr. Schnitzer and the other airmen in their downtime.
During his time in the European Theater, Mr. Schnitzer flew 24 combat missions and accumulated 165 combat flight hours.
According to his service records, he ``navigated B-24 aircraft over land and sea by dead reckoning, pilotage, celestial, and radio navigation.''
For his military duty, Mr. Schnitzer was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with four Bronze Service Stars, and a commendation from the French government.
Interestingly, two of Mr. Schnitzer's missions over Kassel, Germany, carry personal significance, as it was the very town that his future wife and her Jewish family fled during the early years of what would be known as the Holocaust in 1937.
He met Edith Isenberg as an Air Force Cadet in 1942 and sent her a daily postcard from Europe until he returned home in 1945.
They were married for 68 years and had three children: Robert, Dinah, and Alan.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to honor Abraham ``Abe'' Schnitzer, a centenarian and distinguished patriot of our great Nation.
May God continue to bless Mr. Schnitzer--a proud member of the Greatest Generation. ____________________
