Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Brent Robinson and his service to Virginia's First District and the Nation.
Brent got his start on the Hill in 2002 working for my predecessor, Jo Ann Davis.
Brent joined my office in 2007 as a Legislative Assistant, and subsequently worked his way up to Legislative Director and Deputy Chief of Staff.
Brent served as my chief policy advisor during his time in my office and helped introduce key pieces of legislation.
Over 20 years after getting his start on the Hill, Brent has become an expert on various policy issues and an integral member of my D.C. staff.
From meeting with constituents to managing our legislative team, Brent has spent countless hours serving Virginia's 1st District.
Brent has been an excellent mentor; always willing to offer advice to interns and staff.
Both current and former members of my staff are improved public servants due to Brent's leadership.
Brent's wisdom, humor, and perspective will be dearly missed in my office.
I wish Brent the best as he starts his new position with FGS Global.
Mr. Speaker, I ask you to join me in recognizing the service and accomplishments of Brent Robinson.
May God bless Brent as he embarks on a new challenge, and I look forward to seeing his continued success in the future. ____________________
