Yet, she also possesses a deep affection for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, many of whom she views as family.
All this eventually led to her appointment as Assistant Sergeant at Arms, where she serves in the important role as Keeper of the Mace of the House of Representatives.
Joyce's impact on the history and character of this chamber is without question.
I was elated to hear that, upon her retirement, she will be moving to Sanford, North Carolina, a town in the heart of my district.
I look forward to serving as her representative and can't wait to welcome her into our community.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in congratulating Joyce Hamlett on her retirement and to thank her for her decades of dedicated service to this chamber. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 129 Pages: E728 - E728 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JUDGE ROBERT L. MILLER, JR. ______
of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize and congratulate Judge Robert L. Miller, Jr. upon his retirement from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.
Born and raised in South Bend, Indiana, Judge Miller has served the Hoosier state and our Nation with distinction for more than 4 decades.
Nominated to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, Judge Miller is now retiring as a Senior Judge as well as a Judge of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a position he was appointed to by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts in 2020.
Some of the awards and accolades Judge Miller has been recognized with over the course of his career are the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, the American Inns of Court Professionalism Award for the Seventh Circuit, and an induction into the South Bend Alumni Hall of Fame.
As John Adams famously observed, our constitutional republic is supposed function as a ``government of laws, not of men.''
Our Nation depends on dedicated public servants who faithfully uphold the rule of law and ensure that Lady Justice remains blind.
Judge Miller is 1 such person and jurist.
As he prepares to retire and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to congratulate Judge Miller on a distinguished career and a job well done.
I join Hoosiers throughout the Second District and beyond in expressing our gratitude to Judge Miller for his service and in wishing him and his family nothing but the best going forward. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the service and accomplishments of Olivia Morales, my fellow who has fought to protect and improve our education system.
A Florida native, Olivia came to my office ready to protect and nurture the minds of all from kindergarten to post-Grad.
Within Olivia's first few weeks in my office, her passion and intellect shined through.
She immediately got to work developing ideas to help students in dual-enrollment programs, drafting legislation in various areas of education, and assisting in the introduction of the LOAN and American Teacher Acts.
Her dedication has been powerful as we have fought for the minds of underserved and disadvantaged communities.
Oliva's commitment to educational equity led her to complete her undergraduate degree in Public Policy at Duke University and spend a year working as a College Adviser with the Duke College Advising Corps.
