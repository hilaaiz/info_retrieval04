JOYCE HAMLETT ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mrs. CAMMACK.
Mr. Speaker, today we honor the career of Ms. Joyce Hamlett, our beloved Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms and our ``Keeper of the Mace.''
After nearly 5 decades of public service in the House of Representatives and at the U.S. Capitol, Ms. Hamlett will enjoy her well-deserved retirement as we thank her for all she's done.
In the 1980s, Ms. Hamlett started on Capitol Hill alongside her mother in the Capitol Cafe, working first as a sandwich maker and then as a grill cook.
Within 5 years she was promoted to hostess and handled the cash register for thousands of visitors and hundreds of Members each week.
She later became an elevator operator at the Capitol before becoming a security guard in the House Chamber in 1994.
In 2007, she was elected to serve in her current role as Assistant to the Sergeant at Arms and has served dutifully for the last 16 years.
We all love her for her strict adherence to House Rules and decorum on the House Floor but know she's just as sweet once you get to know her and hear all her amazing stories from her career on the Hill.
On behalf of my colleagues and Florida's Third Congressional District, we wish Ms. Hamlett all the best in her retirement and hope she returns to visit us and this amazing place she's served with honor and integrity during her long career.
I congratulate Ms. Joyce Hamlett, and thank her for all she has done to contribute to the history of this institution.
We are forever grateful and hope she enjoys her well-deserved retirement. ____________________
HONORING JOYCE HAMLETT OF BROADWAY, NORTH CAROLINA FOR HER MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-26 Volume: 169, Issue: 129 Pages: E729 - E729 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JOYCE HAMLETT OF BROADWAY, NORTH CAROLINA FOR HER MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ______ of north carolina in the house of representatives Mr. HUDSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Joyce Hamlett on her retirement from the House Office of Chamber Security and honor her many years of faithful service to the U.S. House of Representatives and the American people.
A native of Broadway, North Carolina, Joyce was raised in a home where faith and integrity were cherished above all else.
These virtues remain the guiding principles of her life and helped to define her time here on Capitol Hill.
Joyce left North Carolina for Washington in the early 1980s to begin a job as a sandwich maker at the Capitol Cafe.
She quickly rose through the ranks and eventually took a position with chamber security.
She is known for her hard work ethic and stark reputation as a no-nonsense enforcer of the House's many rules and traditions.
She has no issue being tough on journalists, visitors, and members alike when they step out of line.
Yet, she also possesses a deep affection for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, many of whom she views as family.
All this eventually led to her appointment as Assistant Sergeant at Arms, where she serves in the important role as Keeper of the Mace of the House of Representatives.
Joyce's impact on the history and character of this chamber is without question.
