CELEBRATING DAVID KRUG'S EXCEPTIONAL CAREER

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate David Krug and

his illustrious career at the City of Buffalo's Department of Permits

and Inspection Services.
After a career spanning almost four decades,

Mr. Krug retires from his position as Coordinator of Plans.
Mr. Krug began his journey four decades ago when he achieved the top

score on the 1986 Building Inspector Examination.
This outstanding

achievement foreshadowed the next foul decades of an exceptional career

of service and dedication.
Throughout his time at the Department, Mr. Krug has provided

excellent service to the citizens of the City of Buffalo, ensuring each

project is diligently worked on and completed.
While Mr. Krug was officially the Coordinator of Plans, his

benevolence and helpful nature extended far beyond the department.
He

would consistently lend a hand to his coworkers and help them find

solutions for a myriad of code-related matters.
He became the go-to

person within the office due to his positive approach and willingness

to help.
It is difficult to sum up a career of nearly 40 years, but during his

tenure, Mr. Krug served under nine different commissioners, issued tens

of thousands of permits, witnessed the construction of countless large-

scale projects, including the HSBC building, and played a pivotal role

in enhancing the city's landscape through his involvement in

initiatives such as the Green Code and the implementation of the Hansen

System.
Continuing the trend of kindness and cooperation, Mr. Krug has also

been an active and respected member of the AFSCME Local 650 Union and a

cherished participant in the

Badge Brothers, fostering camaraderie and unity among his colleagues.
Today, Mr. Krug is a proud South Buffalo native.
His unwavering

commitment and dedication extends beyond his work, which is evident in

his role as a devoted husband to the late Teresa Dougherty, proud

father to Liz and Abbie, and loving grandfather to Addison.
His

children have followed in his footsteps by serving their community as

firefighters with the Buffalo Fire Department.
Please join me in congratulating David Krug on a career well spent,

and wishing him well as he enters this new chapter of his life.

COMMEMORATING THE TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF ELLINGTON

HON.
NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the

bicentennial of the Town of Ellington, New York.
Founded in 1824,

Ellington has proudly stood the test of time, exemplifying the

quintessential qualities of small-town America.
Ellington, nestled in Chautauqua County, was named after Ellington,

Connecticut, reflecting the origins of many of its early settlers who

brought with them a pioneering spirit and a commitment to building a

new life in the burgeoning frontiers of New York State.
From its

inception, Ellington has been characterized by its picturesque

landscapes, rolling hills, lush forests, and fertile farmland.
These

natural features have shaped the town's identity and continue to be a

source of pride and beauty for its residents.
Agriculture has always been the cornerstone of Ellington's economy.
The town's long tradition of dairy farming, crop production, and

livestock rearing has sustained its residents and fostered a deep

connection to the land.
Family-owned farms, some of which have been

passed down through generations, are a testament to the town's enduring

agricultural heritage.
The people of Ellington are the heart and soul of this town.
It is a

close-knit community where tradition, hard work, and neighborly support

are valued and celebrated.
Annual events such as the Ellington Town

Picnic bring residents together, reinforcing the bonds of friendship

and community spirit that have always been a hallmark of this town.
Ellington is home to several historical sites that reflect its rich

heritage.
