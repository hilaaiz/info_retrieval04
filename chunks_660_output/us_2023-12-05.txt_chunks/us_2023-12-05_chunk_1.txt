Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brigadier General Michael ``Mike'' Cates of Frisco, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
General Cates honorably served in the United States Army as the 23rd Chief of the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps.
In 1980, General Cates followed in his family's footsteps and joined the Army after obtaining his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree at Texas A&M University.
He specialized in veterinary services in South Korea and Germany, and was the first veterinarian to command the Army's Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine.
I commend his extensive efforts to improve public health and the wellbeing of animals in the military.
For his exemplary service, General Cates was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, and several other awards.
In 2005, he was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Texas A&M's College of Veterinary Medicine.
After his retirement in 2008, General Cates continued to make profound impacts in his community in many ways.
He became a professor at Kansas State University's College of Veterinary Medicine and served as their Master of Public Health Graduate Program Director.
As the Program Director, General Cates helped prepare students for success in public health careers.
When he retired from academia, he served as a board member for the Heritage Association and Pet Partners in Frisco.
In these roles, General Cates helped preserve Frisco's rich history and supported local animal shelters so that they may have a safe place to call home.
These actions highlight his commitment to uplifting the world around him and being a voice for those in need.
I am honored to represent BG Cates in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Anderson of Denison, Texas, and award him a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
CPO Anderson served in the United States Navy, and his impressive career experience highlights his genuine passion for helping our community.
CPO Anderson was inspired to join the Navy after gaining a deep respect and appreciation for our nation's veterans of prior conflicts.
Originally, CPO Anderson wanted to stay in the Navy Reserves, but after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, he wanted to do more to bring the perpetrators of this attack to justice.
To accomplish this, he pursued a deployment to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2008, where he served in numerous support roles, including the Naval Security Forces and Navy Customs.
Furthermore, CPO Anderson qualified as a Seabee Combat Warfare Officer.
Seabees are well known for being able to build infrastructure anywhere around the world at a moment's notice.
If you needed a military base, airfield, or bridge halfway around the world, CPO Anderson is the person you'd call to get the job done.
For his service to our nation, CPO Anderson was bestowed the Bronze Star, Army and Navy Commendation medals, and many more awards.
In 2005, he met his future wife Teresa, and they married three years later.
Together, they raised two children.
