She always knew that she could count on the support of her family--especially her husband of 53 years, Rudy.
As Dean of the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park, and as a prominent academic and entrepreneur, Rudy was another crucial leader in our community.
We all mourned with Linda when he passed away earlier this year, and we continue to keep him in our prayers.
As Linda brings her career to a close, we find ourselves at another pivotal moment for American elections.
We see leaders openly cast doubt on the outcome of free and fair elections.
Some people deliberately try to erode our electoral system and other democratic institutions.
Linda Lamone serves as an example of the countless hardworking, principled elections

officials across the country who help uphold our democracy in the face of these threats.
Their work isn't easy, but it is absolutely essential.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Linda and the democratic principles she devoted her career to protecting. ____________________

INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-12-05 Volume: 169, Issue: 200 Pages: E1167 - E1167 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE NO FENCING AT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the No Fencing at the United States Supreme Court Act, which would prohibit the installation of permanent fencing at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Earlier this year, I introduced a bill that would prohibit the installation of permanent fencing at the U.S. Capitol complex.
After the Supreme Court's draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health was leaked in May 2022, the Supreme Court installed temporary anti-climb fencing around its grounds, which remained in place until late August 2022.
While the Supreme Court has not announced plans to install permanent fencing, temporary security measures often become permanent.
While I understand the importance of protecting the Supreme Court building, Supreme Court Justices and Supreme Court employees, we can and must maintain our commitment to security without sacrificing public access by using the least restrictive means necessary to address security.
