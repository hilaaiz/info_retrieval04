In 2005, he met his future wife Teresa, and they married three years later.
Together, they raised two children.
After his retirement from the Navy in 2013, CPO Anderson continued to serve his nation through various civilian roles, and even supported counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan.
When he returned to Texas, CPO Anderson worked at the Denison Dam Power Plant to help maintain Texas' electrical grid.
Today, he continues his career with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers providing emergency power relief to those affected by natural disasters.
In his recreational time, he is a Scoutmaster for Troop 55 in Pottsboro and Denison, where seven boys have attained the rank of Eagle Scout under his guidance.
I am honored to represent CPO Anderson in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
