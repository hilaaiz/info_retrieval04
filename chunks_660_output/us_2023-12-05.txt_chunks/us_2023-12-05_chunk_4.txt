Shortly after, Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams was appointed as lead pastor for the historic Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, a role he held for more than fifty years.
As pastor, he dedicated his life and mission to service, fighting for justice for our communities and improving the lives of residents in Northwest Detroit.
He was a tireless advocate in the fight for safe housing for all and for affordable childcare for working families.
Pastor Adams served as President of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP in 1984 and served on its executive board consecutive years until 1992.
His bold and grounded leadership is a testament to his impactful work and legacy.
The 12th Congressional District sends our deepest and heartfelt condolences to Pastor Adams's family and to the entire Hartford Memorial Baptist Church family on this significant loss to our community.
Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Agnes Adams and his children, Dr. Tara Adams Washington and Reverend Charles Christian Adams.
Please join me in remembering Pastor Charles Gilchrist Adams for his incredible spiritual leadership and impact on our district and the community.
May he rest in love and his legacy continue to impact our community. ____________________
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF MARYLAND ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATOR LINDA LAMONE; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
200



Date: 2023-12-05 Volume: 169, Issue: 200 Pages: E1169 - E1169 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF MARYLAND ELECTIONS ADMINISTRATOR LINDA LAMONE ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of my friend Linda Lamone: Maryland's longest-serving Elections Administrator and the second-longest-serving chief elections official in America.
In September, she retired after overseeing our elections for more than a quarter century.
Linda is a woman of tremendous vision, integrity, and reverence for our democratic institutions, and we appreciate her outstanding service.
After serving Marylanders for decades as a Counsel to the Maryland State Assembly, the Chief Legal Counsel to Governor Schaefer's legislative office, a private attorney, and an Assistant Attorney General under Governor Glendening, Linda started as Elections Administrator in 1997.
She oversaw 13 federal general elections, including six presidential elections, over the course of her impressive career.
Linda started the role at a pivotal moment for American elections.
New digital technologies offered new opportunities to enhance our electoral system.
Around the same time, the 2000 presidential election revealed how vulnerabilities in our elections can undermine the American people's faith in our democracy.
That experience led me and a bipartisan group of Members to pass the Help America Vote Act to keep our elections secure, accessible, and transparent.
Linda was instrumental in helping the Election Assistance Commission and I implement HAVA in Maryland and beyond.
From modernizing and standardizing our state's voting machines to digitizing campaign finance and voter registration resources, Linda brought our elections into the twenty-first century.
She helped other states make progress in these areas through her involvement with the National Association of State Election Directors.
Linda also helped our state and our democracy weather unprecedented crises.
She led the effort to ensure that Marylanders could vote safely in the 2020 election during the Covid-19 pandemic.
She also sought to maintain Americans' faith in their democratic system amid a wave of election denialism.
We were fortunate to have Linda's leadership in 2020 and all the years before and since.
No matter the task at hand or the challenge before her, Linda tackled it with determination.
She always knew that she could count on the support of her family--especially her husband of 53 years, Rudy.
As Dean of the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park, and as a prominent academic and entrepreneur, Rudy was another crucial leader in our community.
We all mourned with Linda when he passed away earlier this year, and we continue to keep him in our prayers.
