Dr. Deer's service has been simply outstanding, he was an effective

legislator, helped promote and pass Second Chance, helped nationalize

the idea that gun violence is a Public Health Crisis, he was an

outstanding community leader, he was the most loyal, most trustworthy

and most likeminded political ally I have ever had, he was my friend

and a representative of the people.
He was also an outstanding

businessman before becoming a County Commissioner, I remember when we

took a business delegation to the Arab Emirates and Dennis was meeting

with Warren Buffett and other top businesspersons in our country.
Yes,

our friend and brother from West Grenshaw Street has moved on but he

has left an indelible mark on the North Lawndale Community and on

Government in Cook County that can and will never be erased or

forgotten.
Yes, Brother Dennis, he has been the best, he has done the

best.
Now, yes, we will keep working to keep the candles lit and the fires

burning.
May he be at peace.
