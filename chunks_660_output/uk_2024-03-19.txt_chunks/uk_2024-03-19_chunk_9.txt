He researched

nuclear physics at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment; plasma

physics at St. John's College, Cambridge; microwave tubes at Stanford

University; and accelerator physics at the European Organization for

Nuclear Research.
He invented a number of implements, including a novel

microwave tube later dubbed the ``Free electron laser.''
In 1961, Dr. Sturrock was appointed Professor of Applied Physics at

Stanford University, where he lived for nearly 40 years with his wife

Marilyn.
He is Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford and

Emeritus Director of the Center for Space Science and Astrophysics.
In

1990, he was awarded the Arctowski Medal from the National Academy of

Sciences.
Dr. Sturrock founded and then served as president for many

years at the Society for Scientific Exploration.
He also served as

Chairman of the Plasma Physics Division and the Solar Physics Division

of the American Astronomical Society.
In 2009, Dr. Sturrock published his autobiography, A Tale of Two

Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist, which covered both his

research in conventional physics and his less mainstream

investigations.
In 2013, he published AKA Shakespeare: A Scientific Approach to the

Authorship Question.
In this book, he lays out a method for weighing

evidence which he developed for studying pulsars.
Dr. Sturrock then

invites the reader to apply the method to tabulate their own ``degree

of belief'' in three different candidates for authorship of the works

usually attributed to Shakespeare.
He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society

in 2020 and has a deep interest in unidentified flying objects.
Mr. Speaker, I ask the entire House of Representatives to join me in

honoring Peter

Sturrock on achieving this extraordinary milestone and in thanking him

for his lifetime of superb scientific endeavors.
He is, indeed, a

national treasure.
