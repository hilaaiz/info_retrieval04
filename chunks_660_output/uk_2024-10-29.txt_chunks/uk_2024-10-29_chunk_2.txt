HONORING THE CONSECRATION OF DR.
PAUL L. BINION II TO THE OFFICE OF

BISHOP

HON.
JIM COSTA

Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great honor and excitement

on behalf of the Westside Church of God Consecration Planning Teams'

announcement of Dr. Paul L. Binion II.
Today, we will witness the

Episcopal Consecration of Dr. Paul L. Binion to the esteemed office of

Bishop.
Elevating an individual to the position of Bishop is a recognition of

their exceptional leadership, unwavering service, and unblemished

integrity.
Dr. Paul L. Binion, fondly known as Pastor Binion, has

dedicated over four decades of his life to serving both his local

community and the state of California.
He is not only a spiritual

leader but a mentor, confidant, and guiding light to countless

individuals.
Pastor Binion's remarkable journey began in Fairfield, Alabama, where

he was born to Paul Lawrence Binion, Sr.
and Sara Ellafair House

Binion.
As the eldest of five siblings, he embarked on a path that

would lead him to Los Angeles, California, and eventually to Fresno,

where he assumed the role of Senior Pastor at the Westside Church of

God in 1977.
His educational achievements include a Bachelor's Degree

in History from California State University, Los Angeles, and a

Master's Degree of Divinity from Fuller Theological Seminary in

Pasadena, California.
His profound commitment to faith and education

was acknowledged when the Southern California School of Ministry

conferred upon him the honorary title of ``Doctor of Divinity.''
Pastor Binion's impact extends far beyond the walls of his church.
He

has been an active leader in various organizations and initiatives,

demonstrating his dedication to the betterment of the community.
Some

Fellowship of Churches, participating in the African American Clergy

Task Force, contributing to the Southwest Fresno Development

Corporation, and advising the President of Fresno Pacific University on

Clergy and Church Development.
He has also been an advocate for social

justice through his involvement with Central California Evangelicals

for Social Action in addition to his contributions to the City of

Fresno Mayoral Advisory Board and the Police Advisory Council.
Pastor

Binion's deep commitment to mental health and well-being is exemplified

through the establishment of the Westside Community Counseling Center,

which has served as a vital resource for the community.
His dedication to education and career development has shone through

the Education and Career Initiative, a program designed to empower

students in the pursuit of their educational and professional

aspirations.
Throughout his journey, Pastor Binion has been a source of

guidance and wisdom, not only for his congregation but also for fellow

pastors and community leaders.
He has shared his knowledge and faith as

a conference speaker, preacher, and teacher of the Bible, leaving a

lasting impact on both local and national levels.
In addition to his

remarkable professional achievements, Pastor Binion is a devoted

husband to Valarie Jean Metoyer Binion, and a loving father and

grandfather.
He and Valarie have been married since 1978 and have three

daughters, Tiffany, Crisandra, and Kimberley, along with several

grandchildren.
As we come together to witness the Episcopal Consecration of Dr. Paul

L. Binion, we recognize not only a spiritual leader but a dedicated

servant of the community.
His journey is a testament to the enduring

impact that one individual can have when guided by faith, compassion,

and a commitment to the betterment of others.
Mr. Speaker, I invite my esteemed colleagues to join me in

commemorating this significant moment in the life of Dr. Paul L.

Binion, a man whose contributions have touched the hearts and souls of

many.
