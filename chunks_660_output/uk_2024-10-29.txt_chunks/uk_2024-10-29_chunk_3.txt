HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF IRENE DeVAN PELOIAN

HON.
JIM COSTA

Mr. COSTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of Irene

DeVan Peloian, a remarkable individual whose journey from Belleville,

New Jersey, to Fresno, California, was filled with love, family, and a

deep commitment to serving others.
Irene, born on June 27, 1927, in

Belleville, New Jersey, was an astonishing individual whose life

touched many hearts.
Her legacy, marked by grace, resilience, and

unwavering devotion to her loved ones, will forever be cherished.
Irene's early years were shaped by her parents, George and Armen

DeVan.
Her father, an Armenian-Turkish immigrant, and her mother, a

survivor of the Armenian genocide, instilled in her a strong sense of

heritage and determination.
She carried this with her throughout her

life's adventures.
Completing her high school education in 1945,

Irene's fondest memories included attending dances featuring Frank

Sinatra.
These dances, enjoyed with her best friend and cousin, Alyce,

added a touch of magic to her youth.
Driven by dreams of a career in film, Irene pursued her passion by

enrolling at the New York American Academy of Dramatic Arts in

Manhattan.
Her aspirations led her on a unique path.
After two years,

she relocated with her family to Fresno, California, where she embarked

on a career in retail, notably working at Cahns Women's Clothing store

on Fulton Street.
Additionally, Irene ventured into the world of runway

modeling.
In 1952, Irene married Simon (Sam) Marootian, and together

they raised their family on a vineyard ranch in Fowler, California.
Irene's warmth and culinary talents made her a beloved hostess, and the

couple enjoyed their evenings playing card games with close friends.
The close-knit community of Fowler held a special place in her heart,

and she often reflected on those years as the best of her life.
Irene

had a desire to travel, with Hawaii and Las Vegas being among her

favorite destinations; she had quite an impressive reputation as a

blackjack player.
Passionate about politics, Irene dedicated 30 years of her life to

various Democratic Party campaigns.
She organized numerous political

events at her home, where she would cook Armenian delicacies for

visiting governors and senators, showcasing her remarkable hospitality.
Beyond her political involvement, her heart belonged to the San

Francisco Giants, and she had a deep love for rescue dogs and stray

cats.
Irene held a special affinity for children and young people,

often adopting ``sons,'' ``daughters,'' and ``grandchildren'' into her

extended family.
Above all, Irene was a devoted wife, mother, daughter,

sister, cousin, ``aunty,'' and friend.
Following the loss of her first

husband, Sam, Irene found love and companionship with Edward Peloian,

whom she married in 1988.
Their enduring love and partnership lasted

almost 30 years until Ed's passing in 2016.
They shared a passion for

the arts, providing support to the Fresno Philharmonic and Fresno Art

Museum.
Irene DeVan Peloian's legacy lives on, leaving behind cherished

memories in the hearts of her loved ones.
She is survived by her son

and daughter-in-law, Marcus and Anchalee Marootian; daughter, Robyn

Marootian; sister-in-law, Scotty DeVan, of Washington; nieces Jaymie

DeVan of Los Angeles and Jordan DeVan of Washington; and three nephews,

Mike Shahbazian, Steven Shahbazian, and Robert Shahbazian.
She is also

survived by her godson, Dr. Jordan Howard, of Atlanta, and her best

friend, Diane Mosesian, of Colorado.
Mr. Speaker, I extend an invitation to my esteemed colleagues to join

me in honoring the life and legacy of Irene.
Her remarkable time,

filled with resilience, love, and devotion, leaves an indelible mark on

our hearts and in the tapestry of our community.
