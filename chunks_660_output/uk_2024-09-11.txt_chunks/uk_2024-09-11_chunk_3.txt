HONORING AMY BEGAYE, MISS NAVAJO NATION

HON.
ELIJAH CRANE

Mr. CRANE.
Mr. Speaker, last week, contestants competed in the 72nd

Annual Miss Navajo Nation Pageant in my district.
To become Miss Navajo, contestants participate in a rigorous week-

long annual competition, which requires contestants to demonstrate

proficiency in both the Navajo and English languages, knowledge of

Navajo culture and beliefs, business interviews, contemporary talents,

and traditional skills such as sheep butchering and preparing

traditional foods.
I'd like to recognize Amy Naazbah Reeves-Begaye, who has served as

Miss Navajo for the past year.
I met Amy last year during her first trip to the U.S. Capitol and

learned about her experience and background and the process of becoming

Miss Navajo.
We've had a few chances to connect throughout the years and I've been

impressed with her hard work and professionalism.
She's been a strong leader and advocate for Navajo history and

culture.
I thank Amy for her leadership as Miss Navajo over the last year.
I

wish her the best in her future endeavors and know that she will

continue to make the Navajo Nation proud.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.
JOHN BILLY PURRY, SR.
HON.
TRENT KELLY

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life

of a remarkable man, Mr. John Billy Purry, Sr.,
who passed away on July

31, 2024, at the age of 90.
Mr. Purry was born on May 30, 1934, and

from that moment, his life became a testament to hard work, dedication,

and a commitment to his community.
Mr. Purry was more than just a resident of Brandon, Mississippi.
He

was a pillar, a foundation upon which countless lives were built.
His

kindness and generosity were unmatched.
No matter the task or the need,

Mr. Purry was always there, leading with a helping hand.
His influence

touched the lives of so many who had the pleasure of knowing him, and

his legacy will continue to shape his family, friends, and the

community for years to come.
Whether volunteering, providing guidance to the younger generations,

or simply being a neighbor people could count on, Mr. Purry's presence

was always felt.
His leadership wasn't formal or announced--it was

quiet, steady, and strong.
He led by example, demonstrating that real

success comes not from personal gain but from the positive impact one

can make on others.
He was a devoted family man, a loyal friend, and a respected figure

in the community.
Mr. Purry lived his life with humility, integrity,

and an unmatched love for the people

around him.
His passing leaves a void that will be difficult to fill,

but his spirit will forever remain in the hearts of those who knew him.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of

Mr. John Billy Purry, Sr.
His legacy of kindness, service, and

selflessness is a model for us all, and his memory will continue to

inspire generations to come.
May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING FLAGS FOR HEROES IN ORANGE PARK, FLORIDA

HON.

Mr. BEAN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, when I was a boy, I thought that

heroes were imaginary characters who wore capes or masks that hide

their secret identity.
