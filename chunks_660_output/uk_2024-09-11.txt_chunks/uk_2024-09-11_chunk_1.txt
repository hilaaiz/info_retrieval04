COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ALBERT J. ``SKIP'' GAZY

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life and legacy

of Albert J. ``Skip'' Gazy of Niagara Falls, NY.
On September 3, 2024, Albert J. ``Skip'' Gazy, 95, of Niagara Falls,

NY, passed away peacefully at Our Lady of Peace Nursing Care Residence.
Born and raised in Niagara Falls, he was the son of the late Nasri and

Victoria (Jacob) Gazy, and the devoted husband of Ramona Gazy, whom he

married on June 15, 1968.
Albert served proudly in the United States

National Guard.
He worked alongside his brothers at Gazy Brother's

Texaco Station until it closed in 1981, later retiring after many years

of service with the Niagara Falls City School District.
As a passionate boxing enthusiast, Albert boxed at the Niagara Falls

Boys Club in his youth.
Known for his sharp sense of humor, Albert

found great joy in bringing laughter to those around him.
His greatest

joy, however, was spending time with his family, especially his three

beloved granddaughters.
Albert was preceded in death by his wife, Ramona, but survived by his

children, Monique (Keith) Crossley and Louis DalPorto; his

granddaughters, Danielle DalPorto, Samantha DalPorto, and Elise Gazy;

daughter-in-law Joanne DalPorto; as well as numerous nieces, nephews,

loved ones and friends.
As we remember Albert ``Skip'' Gazy, we grieve the loss of a

dedicated husband, father, and grandfather and a beloved member of our

community.
