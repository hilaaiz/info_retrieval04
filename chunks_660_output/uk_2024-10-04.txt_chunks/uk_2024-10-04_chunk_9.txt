Bob and Celeste were dedicated members of the First Baptist

Church of Fort Payne.
For 36 years, Bob taught a bible class at the

church that consistently saw more than 100 members attend.
Bob's call to be a spiritual guide to others was realized when he

began teaching a college-level class on spiritual development.
Guiding

those who took his class by proclaiming the teachings of Jesus Christ

led Bob to complete a six-volume work expanding on the Gospels found in

the Bible.
As counsel to the DeKalb County Board of Education, Bob was lead

counsel in America's foremost school prayer case.
The United States

Supreme Court decided this case, which allowed student-initiated prayer

in public schools.
Bob has received numerous awards through his church, civic

organizations, his profession, and other organizations.
I am honored, not only to represent, but to also recognize such an

incredible individual and great American.
He is a shining example of

the accomplishments that can be realized when life is built on hard

work and great faith.
This Nation is blessed by men such as Robert B. French, Jr. and we as

a Nation are thankful for his dedication to making Alabama and the

United States a better place to live.
We wish him many, many years of

success and congratulate him on his retirement.
