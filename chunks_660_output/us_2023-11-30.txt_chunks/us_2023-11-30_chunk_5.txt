Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mickey Wilson of Golden, Colorado, for receiving a Carnegie Medal after saving his friend's life in a daring act of heroism.
In January 2017, Mr. Wilson, a professional slackliner, was skiing in Dillon, Colorado, when a friend and fellow skier got caught leaving a ski lift.
The skier was left dangling unconscious from the lift, out of reach from help.
Mr. Wilson realized the gravity of the situation and selflessly sprung into action.
Despite danger warnings, he climbed the chairlift pole and traversed 30 feet along the lift's two-inch cable to reach the chair.
He then swung down onto the chair and, after catching a knife thrown by a rescue crew member, cut his friend free.
The skier fully recovered with only a broken rib, while Mr. Wilson was uninjured.
Mr. Wilson's slacklining experience proved life-saving that day.
The Carnegie Medal is given to people who risk their own safety in an attempt to save the lives of others.
There is no doubt that Mr. Wilson is incredibly deserving of this award and it is an honor to congratulate him on this life-saving act of bravery. ____________________
