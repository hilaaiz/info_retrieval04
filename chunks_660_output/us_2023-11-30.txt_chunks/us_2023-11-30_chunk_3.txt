After Reed was sent back overseas on duty, Lilly was bored of the shirt factory and her life in Tennessee.
On the lookout for more adventure, she moved to Wisconsin to join her brother Calvin learning the trade of photography.
Lilly learned how to take photos, print them, and colorize the photos.
With a new job and a new life, Lilly began to find her place in the world.
While in Wisconsin, Lilly and Reed were constantly exchanging letters.
As Lilly worked in the photography shop, many men and women would come in to take pictures for their Navy identification cards.
Lilly saw them coming in with their nice Navy uniforms day-in and day-out.
Feeling adventurous, Lilly decided to join the Navy, too.
With her photography skills, she enlisted with the goal of becoming a war photographer.
Encouraged by her brother to join, Lilly went off on a new adventure in Washington.
D.C During the process of joining the Navy, it became clear that Lilly excelled at math and was pulled from the

photography route and placed in a decoding role.
Lilly had no idea what the future held, but she underwent investigation for a top security clearance.
In Washington, D.C., the Pentagon had not been completed, and Lilly worked in an underground facility nearby.
Lilly decoded enemy messages in Naval Intelligence.
Her work was important to the war, and she knew it.
She worked around the clock taking messages and typing them on a card to be slid into what was a very primitive and early version of the modern computer.
In 1944, Reed came home wounded and made his way to Washington, D.C., to find Lilly.
They were married on March 16, 1944, not many days after Reed returned.
When the war ended, Lilly and Reed used the G.I. Bill to go to college.
They attended the University of Tennessee together and both majored in business--Lilly in business education and Reed in business administration.
Lilly and Reed were in some of the same classes and would compete against each other for the best grades.
Lilly and Reed had four children--Mary Beth, Reed Jr., Jeannie, and Kim--and made their home in Mississippi.
Later in life, Lilly moved into the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi.
Keeping with her adventurous spirit, Lilly stayed at the facility while residents cleared out during Hurricane Katrina in 2005 stating she had never seen a hurricane.
The water rose to the third story, and Lilly and several of the other residents had to be rescued.
Lilly's life legacy of adventure, courage, and bravery lives on in her four children, seven grandchildren, and fifteen great- grandchildren.
I am proud to honor the life of a woman who made an impact not just during World War II but throughout her entire life. ____________________
