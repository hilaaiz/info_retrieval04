Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the commitment of a devoted Central Washington public servant, Kevin Fuhr.
Formerly the Chief of Police for Moses Lake, Chief Fuhr has concluded an illustrious 32-year career in law enforcement and is now ready to move on to the next chapter of his life.
While other regions of Washington State had trouble hiring new police officers, Chief Fuhr's leadership drew people to Moses Lake Police Department in the pursuit of working underneath him.
Chief Fuhr's force also spearheaded an exceptional outreach program, and his leadership on my Central Washington Fentanyl Taskforce has fostered a remarkable level of trust within our communities.
When most folks retire, they look forward to all the spare time they will have.
However, the call to public service continues to ring for Chief Fuhr, as he has recently been hired as the city manager of Moses Lake, underscoring his unwavering dedication to Central Washington.
I have known Kevin for a long time, and I am proud to call him a dear friend, His leadership, integrity, and commitment to the prosperity of our region has resulted in a wonderful career with more than enough to show for it.
It has been a pleasure working with him, and I am looking forward to continuing our collaboration in his new role. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-30 Volume: 169, Issue: 197 Pages: E1149 - E1149 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF 103-YEAR-OLD LILLY LOISE CULP HOGAN ______ of mississippi in the house of representatives Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Lilly Loise Culp Hogan.
Lilly lived a life of adventure and at age 103 was the oldest veteran at the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Gulfport, Mississippi.
She was born on February 5, 1920, in Obion County, Tennessee, Lilly was the second youngest child of eleven children.
Growing up during the Great Depression, Lilly learned the value of hard work by making clothes for all the children at home.
She made her own patterns and designed her own clothing.
Lilly had many siblings to look up to and who were a part of her life.
Attending the local one- room schoolhouse, Lilly was taught by her older sister Zora.
Lilly loved math and was always competing with her classmates for the best grades.
When she finished the eighth grade, Lilly attended high school at the local Dixie School.
Having no car, Lilly and her brother Fred would walk to school every day, except on the rare day when her father would allow them to ride the horse.
Fred and Lilly would stable the horse in the barn attached to the school while they did their studies.
In 1938 Lilly graduated as valedictorian and Fred graduated with her the same year as salutatorian.
After high school, Lilly wanted to attend college, but her family did not have the resources, so she started working.
Lilly and her sister Kitty rented an apartment close to Union City, Tennessee, and together they worked at a nearby shirt factory.
While working at the shirt factory, her landlord introduced Lilly to her cousin, Reed Hogan.
Reed was on leave from the U.S. Navy.
After Reed was sent back overseas on duty, Lilly was bored of the shirt factory and her life in Tennessee.
On the lookout for more adventure, she moved to Wisconsin to join her brother Calvin learning the trade of photography.
Lilly learned how to take photos, print them, and colorize the photos.
