Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate over 70 years of the Azteca Wedding Plaza as the Torrez family heads into retirement.
Founded in 1950 by Adolfo and Kay Torrez, their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren have kept the family business thriving over the decades.
Family has been at the center of everything at Azteca.
For generations, the Torrezes have proudly served Phoenix families through quinceaneras, weddings.
and many other special moments.
To be part of memorable occasions and serve their community has been their motivation and constant goal throughout the years.
Prolific entrepreneurs, Adolfo and Kay's first business was Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix.
From there, they opened a bar, flower shop.
furniture store, and eventually grew into Azteca Wedding Plaza-- an entire city block dedicated to the bridal industry.
Azteca has been a mainstay in Phoenix's Latino community, providing a welcoming environment for generations of brides and grooms.
Now, as a family, they have determined it is time to retire Azteca.
Reaching this conclusion has not been easy, but their decision was fueled by one factor--family.
Now, their plan is to spend more time with friends and family and to watch their community grow and prosper.
I would like to congratulate the Torrez family on over 70 years of business and wish them all the best in their future endeavors. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate my friend David Whisenant on his retirement from WBTV after 32 years of service.
David Whisenant started his news career at Salisbury-based radio station WSTP while in high school in 1976.
He went on to attend Appalachian State University, earning degrees in both Political Science and English.
Throughout his four years, he worked at a radio station in Boone, North Carolina.
After graduation, David returned to Salisbury and started a full-time job at WSTP.
When WBTV first created their bureau in Salisbury, David sent a handwritten letter to the news director expressing his interest in working for the station.
David started at WBTV as a stringer and within a year was promoted to General Assignment Reporter.
David would go on to provide coverage for Charlotte as well as Salisbury, Concord, and Kannapolis.
In his words, he would go ``wherever they send me.''
Some of David's biggest stories include the Pillowtex/NC Research Campus developments, the tragic fire at Salisbury Millworks, the funeral of President Ronald Reagan, NASCAR-related stories, and coverage and updates of Hurricane Katrina.
I think I speak for the whole of our community here in North Carolina in wishing David all the best as he begins this next chapter of life.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in recognizing David Whisenant's retirement from WBTV and his 32 years of service to the people of North Carolina. ____________________
