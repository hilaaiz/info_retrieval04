In his last post, Col.
Brown also provided support to the 7-state region as a board member for the 2022 Service Academy.
He supports all local leaders of Nevada by providing them with information regarding the Army Reserve and the economic impact to states and cities.
He has also supported the Army Reserve Ambassador Program, which supports students with full-ride scholarships to any ROTC program in the Nation with the hope that they will one day return to the Southwest as tomorrow's leaders.
In his over 30-year military career, including 10 different assignments and 2 different services, Col.
Brown has shared his knowledge and experience with hundreds of officers and enlisted Soldiers, helping them to develop as leaders and enhance their careers.
Col.
Brown is an exceptional leader who will be greatly missed by the U.S. military when he moves into retirement, while his service will be long remembered by those he worked with.
There is no doubt that the soldiers he helped train and mentor over his 30 years will continue to build on his legacy of service and working to make our Nation stronger.
Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring Colonel Jerry A. Brown on his outstanding service to our Nation and in congratulating him on his retirement. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO REQUIRE THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT SERVICES AND OFFENDER SUPERVISION AGENCY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PRETRIAL SERVICES...; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 122 Pages: E679 - E680 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E679-E680] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO REQUIRE THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURT SERVICES AND OFFENDER SUPERVISION AGENCY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PRETRIAL SERVICES AGENCY TO RESIDE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill that would require the Directors of 2 federal agencies, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia (CSOSA) and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), to reside in the District of Columbia during their terms.
Residency requirements for certain government positions are found in federal law, D.C. law and the laws of jurisdictions throughout the United States.
The primary reason such laws exist is so that government officials have a connection to the residents they serve and in-depth knowledge of the unique issues and challenges faced by residents.
Last Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill.
CSOSA and PSA are federal agencies that focus exclusively on D.C. CSOSA supervises individuals on probation, parole or supervised release under D.C. law.
PSA makes recommendations regarding pretrial release and supervises defendants for the D.C. Superior Court and the U.S. District Court for D.C. The Directors of CSOSA and PSA should be required to be D.C. residents since these agencies serve only D.C. Congress has justifiably required that certain federal officials live in the jurisdictions to which they are appointed, including U.S. district court judges, U.S. Marshals and U.S. Attorneys.
Similarly, Congress, which controls the local D.C. court system, has justifiably required local D.C. judges and members of the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission and the D.C. Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure to reside in D.C. There is no reason that the Directors of CSOSA and PSA, federal agencies that uniquely serve D.C., should not be required to live in D.C. These federal officials need to be part of the community they serve.
A D.C. residency requirement for these federal officials will lead to better outcomes in the criminal justice system and is a matter of fairness for D.C. residents.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
