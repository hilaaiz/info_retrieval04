Not only did she win one race but conquered her next two events as well.
Zoe led the pack in the girls 1600-meter run, then won the 800- meter run less than two hours later in addition to the 300-meter hurdles.
Zoe should be commended for all her hard work throughout the past year and for bringing home the state championships to her school and community.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing Zoe Martonfi for a job well done. ____________________
HONORING ANEIRA BANWAR FOR HER VOLUNTEERISM; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-07-17 Volume: 169, Issue: 122 Pages: E679 - E679 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ANEIRA BANWAR FOR HER VOLUNTEERISM ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Aneira Banwar for her volunteerism, service, and acts of kindness.
Aneira started volunteering at the age of 5.
As she began this journey, she realized that there are limited opportunities for children to donate their time.
This gap led her to create the ``12K plan''--12 months of kindness.
This plan consists of 12 monthly kindness projects that kids can do at home.
Recently, Aneira assembled and donated more than 500 ``boredom buster kits'' for patients at a local children's hospital.
She accomplished this project by inspiring others in her community to join her in making the kits.
Now 7 years old, Aneira has logged more than 100 hours of community service.
Her hope is to encourage other children to volunteer in their community, because she believes that kids ``hold the power to shape and change the future in a positive way by performing random acts of kindness 1 month at a time.''
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Aneira Banwar.
Her commitment to others is noble and inspiring--and I look forward to all that she will accomplish in the future through her volunteer work. ____________________
