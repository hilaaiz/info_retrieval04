Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the retirement of Colonel Adam J. Czekanski, who will retire from his post as Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Pittsburgh District on August 4, 2023.
Colonel Czekanski served honorably in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for 25 years.
He began his career in 1998 after earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural and Biological Engineering from Cornell University as well as a Master of Science degree in Environmental and Water Resources Engineering from the University of Texas.
Colonel Czekanski has served in a variety of important roles since joining the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
He was the Deputy District Commander for the San Francisco region, the Operations Officer for the South Pacific Division, and the Commander of the Buffalo District before finally taking a post as the Commander of the Pittsburgh District.
During his time in leadership, Colonel Czekanski mobilized the Corps's workforce and operational capacity to confront a variety of environmental and engineering challenges unique to western Pennsylvania.
During his command of the Pittsburgh District, Colonel Czekanski also traveled around the country on multiple Temporary Emergency Power Deployments to help rebuild communities after hurricanes and wildfires.
His eagerness to serve those in need is an example to us all.
Over the course of his service, Colonel Czekanski was awarded a Purple Heart, 3 Bronze Stars, and a Soldier's Medal.
These awards are a testament to his dedication to the United States, our nation's military, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
Mr. Speaker, Colonel Adam J. Czekanski's diligent service to his brothers at arms, our communities, and our entire nation is evidence of a life well-lived and a retirement well-earned.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I congratulate him on his retirement and many impressive accomplishments throughout a successful military career. ____________________
