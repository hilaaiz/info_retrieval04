HONORING WORLD HARVEST UNITED CHURCHES

HON.
ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER

Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the work of World

Harvest United Churches during their 2023 National Holy Gathering in

Dumfries, Virginia.
An annual event, the National Holy Gathering brings people together

in the spirit of service.
This year's theme is ``Ignite 2023,'' and it

is guided by Matthew 5:14-16: ``You are the light of the world.
A town

built on a hill cannot be hidden.
Neither do people light a lamp and

put it under a bowl.
Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives

light to everyone in the house.
In the same way, let your light shine

before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your

Father in heaven.''
Guided by Presiding Prelate Bishop Calvin B. Davis, Sr.,
and hosted

by Virginia State Bishop Kenneth W. Jones, Sr.,
this gathering provides

attendees with activities, classes, and worship events.
It culminates

with a day of volunteerism and outreach in conjunction with Habitat for

Humanity ReStore, Women of Worth, and Project-Mend-A-House.
Finally, ``Ignite 2023'' would not be possible without the hard work

of community leaders like Bishop George W. Thigpen, III, Bishop of

Outreach, Pastor Kathleen Deane, National Director of Outreach, Elder

Daniel M. Deane, Sr.,
Adjutant General, Bishop Rick Boykin, Co-Adjutor

to the State Bishop, and Lady Michelle Thigpen, Director of Women of

Worth Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, l ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating World

Harvest Churches on 11 years of service to the community through their

annual National Holy Gathering.
Their outreach and community-oriented

mindset is invaluable to Virginia.

MARC FOGEL

HON.
GLENN THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy

heart on Marc Fogel's 62nd birthday.
Marc, a native of Butler County,

Pennsylvania, isn't celebrating with his family today because he's

wrongfully detained in Russia.
On August 14, 2021, Marc was returning to Russia for the start of the

school year at the Anglo-American School in Moscow, where he teaches.
But instead, he was arrested at the airport.
Since his arrest, Marc was sentenced and is currently serving an

exorbitant 14-year hard labor sentence.
His situation qualifies for a

``wrongly detained'' status from the U.S. Department of State, yet this

determination has not been made despite repeated requests from

lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including me.
Mr. Speaker, I proudly support a resolution calling for Marc's

immediate release and I urge my colleagues to do the same, today, on

his birthday.
I also encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4388, the Marc Fogel

Act, to ensure transparency and accountability at the State Department

when wrongful determinations are considered.
Mr. Speaker, we have not forgotten Marc.
It is time to bring him home

and I implore the President and Secretary of State to do everything

they can so he may rejoin his family--his wife, Jane, and sons Sam and

Ethan--as soon as possible.
