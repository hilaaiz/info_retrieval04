Currently, the

county encompasses roughly 553 square miles and has a population of

over 55,000.
The county is an asset to the great State of Ohio through

its many contributions in the fields of manufacturing and agriculture.
Mr. Speaker, by remembering the 200th Anniversary of Seneca County,

community members recognize the outstanding achievements, maintain the

pioneer attitude, and strive to better their county through the

principles on which it was founded.
I thank and congratulate Seneca

County on this significant milestone.
