HONORING JACKSONVILLE MAYOR SAMMY PHILLIPS

HON.
GREGORY F. MURPHY

Mr. MURPHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a faithful public

servant, Mayor John (Sammy) Phillips of Jacksonville, North Carolina.
Recently, celebrating his 50th anniversary of service to the city,

Mayor Phillips dedicated most of his adult life to helping the people

of Jacksonville.
Everyone who knows him can attest to his strong work

ethic and selfless devotion to his community.
In 1974, Mayor Phillips started his career as an officer with the

Jacksonville Police Department and, after serving for over thirty

years, retired as Deputy Chief of Police.
Thanks to his leadership and

dedication, the Jacksonville Police Department became a nationally

accredited law enforcement agency in 1991.
While Mayor Phillips served

in the Police Department, he also worked to complete academic studies.
He graduated from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National

Academy, a premier law enforcement training program in Quantico,

Virginia.
Taking night classes, he earned a Bachelor's degree in

criminal justice from North Carolina Wesleyan College.
Mayor Phillips

also completed a Master's in Public Administration from East Carolina

University.
Mayor Phillips's sacrifices during his law enforcement

career to further his profession and knowledge base are quite laudable.
In 2004, when Mayor Phillips retired from the Police Department, he

couldn't resist his love for his community and commitment to public

service.
After a few months of working around his house and playing

golf, he filed for a seat on the City Council in 2004.
After a stint on

the City Council, he decided to run for Mayor and was elected in

November 2007.
Now going on 17 years, Mayor Phillips is the longest-

serving Mayor of Jacksonville since W. Bruce Teachey.
