As we celebrate this incredible 100 years Bertha has lived, we

reflect on the many achievements that have shaped her life.
Through it

all, her love for her family has been a constant source of strength and

joy.
Married for over 60 years, she raised 4 children--Mark, Sonja,

Frankie, and Linda, and her family continues to grow.
Bertha has also faced profound loss, including the loss of her son

Frankie when he was just 17.
His spirit lives on through the

generations of the Mazon family.
Her deep love for her family and

support for her community is a constant source of inspiration to all

who know her.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing the many contributions Ms.

Mazon has provided for our community and celebrate this incredible

milestone by wishing her a happy 100th birthday.

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown

Hero, Thomas Owen.
Thomas is a senior at Jesuit College Preparatory

School in Dallas.
With his graduation quickly approaching, instead of

making the celebration about him, he is organizing a graduation party

to benefit Make-A-Wish North Texas.
Thomas serves on the Make-A-Wish Youth Leadership Council, and has

brought together a team of students from local North Texas high schools

to help support this cause.
He is inspiring others to take action and

give back to their communities.
I thank Thomas for inspiring his fellow North Texans through his

selflessness and leadership.
Through the use of his entrepreneurial

skills, he is making a difference in our community.

Jayapal, Kim Schrier, Adam Smith, and Marilyn Strickland, to recognize

and commend the distinguished tenure of Dr. Kirk Schulz as President of

Since 2016, President Schulz has

guided WSU through a period of immense growth, advancing research,

secure funding for key university initiatives.
Each of Washington's ten congressional districts has benefited from

President Schulz's leadership, reinforcing WSU's role as an institution

that serves all Washingtonians.
I would like to highlight a few key

impacts across the state.
1st District: WSU has built strong partnerships with the region's

tech industry, working with companies in King and Snohomish counties to

prepare students for careers in artificial intelligence, software

development, and semiconductor manufacturing.
These efforts ensure

Washington remains at the forefront of technological advancement.
2nd District: WSU's agricultural extension programs in Northwest

Washington have played a vital role in supporting farmers and

sustaining fisheries in the region.
WSU's Everett campus provides

entrepreneurs critical business management skills and trains engineers

for the world-class aerospace and high-tech industries in Northwest

Washington.
3rd District: WSU Vancouver has expanded opportunities in STEM

education, creating new pathways for students to enter high-demand

fields like engineering and healthcare.
By connecting with local

industries and healthcare providers, WSU is strengthening Southwest

Washington's workforce and economic outlook.
4th District: Home to some of the Nation's premier vineyards, Central

Washington has benefited from WSU's viticulture and enology programs.
Through cutting-edge research and collaboration with winemakers, WSU

has

helped the region maintain its reputation as a world-class wine

producer.
