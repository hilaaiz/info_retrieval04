HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF OFFICER OSMAR RODARTE

HON.
DOUG LaMALFA

Mr. LaMALFA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, service,

and memory of Officer Osmar Rodarte, a dedicated law enforcement

officer, a U.S. Army veteran, and a loving husband and father.
Officer

Rodarte made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty while serving

with the Marysville Police Department, tragically taken from us at just

27 years old.
Osmar Rodarte was a proud graduate of Rio Linda High School, Class of

2016.
He answered the call to serve his country, enlisting in the

United States Army before returning home to continue that service in

law enforcement.
As an officer with the Marysville Police Department,

he was known for his dedication, professionalism, and commitment to

keeping people safe.
On the day he was taken from us, Officer Rodarte was participating in

a multi-agency operation targeting transnational drug trafficking

organizations, work that is critical in keeping our streets safe from

the influence of dangerous criminals.
His sacrifice is a reminder of

the risks our law enforcement officers take every day to protect the

people they serve.
Officer Rodarte was more than a public servant.
He was a father, a

husband, a brother, and a friend.
His fellow officers described him as

a true hero, and those who knew him best spoke of his unwavering

dedication to his family and loved ones.
In the aftermath of this

tragic loss, the people of Marysville, Rio Linda, and the entire North

State have come together in mourning, offering prayers and support to

his family.
