HONORING TERRI ``WINDTALKER'' CLAH AS A 2025 SHE LEADS AMERICA

CHRISTIAN WOMAN OF DISTINCTION

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Terri

``WindTalker'' Clah as a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman

of Distinction award.
Terri ``WindTalker'' Clah of the Dine (People of the Land) Nation and

Ute Mountain Ute Tribe was raised in the Four Corners region on her

ancestral lands, immersed in the beauty, resilience, and painful

history of her people.
Listening to the elders' stories from a young

age--some filled with hope, others scarred by struggle--shaped her deep

understanding of cultural identity, spiritual strength, and the need

for healing across generations.
Leadership is woven into Terri's heritage.
Her great-uncle, Deshna

Clah, served as the second Chairman of the Dine Nation, while her

uncle, Peter McDonald, was both a President of the Dine Nation and is

one of the last living U.S. Marine Code Talkers.
Inspired by her

mother, Bessie Clah, who modeled a life of service, Terri embraced her

own path of advocacy and reconciliation.
At age 26, she encountered Jesus Christ, whose message of love and

restoration affirmed her Native identity and calling to bridge

cultures.
Through her Moccasins Across America Prayer Walk--from

California to Washington, DC, May through October 2025--Terri has

ignited a national movement for prayer, justice, and healing.
Today, as

a She Leads America Christian Woman of Distinction, she continues to

inspire others to walk in faith and carry the love of God to the

Nation.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this

outstanding woman of distinction.

Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

60th anniversary of the Diocese of Brownsville, a community of faith

that has for decades served as a spiritual home and source of strength

for the people of the Rio Grande Valley.
Since its founding in 1965, the Diocese of Brownsville has grown into

one of the most vibrant Catholic dioceses in the nation.
Through its

parishes, schools, and ministries, the Diocese has nurtured the faith

across South Texas.
The Diocese has long been a committed voice for justice and

compassion in our region.
Its leaders and parishioners have worked

tirelessly to support immigrant communities, provide disaster relief,

and advocate for the dignity of all people.
This commitment reflects

not only the teachings of faith, but also the values of service and

solidarity that define the Rio Grande Valley

As the Diocese marks its 60th anniversary, it does so with a proud

legacy of compassion, inclusivity, and unwavering dedication to the

people of South Texas.
Its clergy, religious, and lay leaders have

carried forward a mission rooted in faith and community, inspiring

generations to service others and live lives of devotion.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful South Texas, I congratulate the

Diocese of Brownsville and all those who have contributed to its

mission over the past six decades.
May the Diocese continue to serve,

inspire, and strengthen our communities for many years to come.
