HONORING KAYLEIGH BUSH AS A 2025 SHE LEADS AMERICA YOUNG CHRISTIAN

WOMAN OF DISTINCTION

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Kayleigh Bush as

a 2025 She Leads America Young Christian Woman of Distinction award

recipient.
In 2025, Kayleigh Bush competed and won the Miss America preliminary

title of Miss North Florida.
Just four weeks after being crowned, she

faced a decision that tested her faith, her courage, and her

convictions.
Pageant directors presented a newly revised contract that

redefined what it means to be female.
Choosing truth over a title,

Kayleigh courageously declined to sign.
Following the Matthew 18 model, she privately pleaded with the

organization's leaders, urging them to return to truth and biological

reality.
Her appeal was met with indifference, but Kayleigh remained

steadfast, accepting the loss of her title rather than compromising her

faith.
