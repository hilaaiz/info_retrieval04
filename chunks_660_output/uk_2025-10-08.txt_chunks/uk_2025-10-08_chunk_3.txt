Choosing truth over a title,

Kayleigh courageously declined to sign.
Following the Matthew 18 model, she privately pleaded with the

organization's leaders, urging them to return to truth and biological

reality.
Her appeal was met with indifference, but Kayleigh remained

steadfast, accepting the loss of her title rather than compromising her

faith.
Kayleigh represents a modern-day Esther: one who is willing to speak

when the culture demands silence.
Her story reminds us that courage is

contagious, truth is not negotiable, and that no earthly crown compares

to the one given by Christ.
Her boldness has been recognized nationally.
In 2025, She Leads

America is honoring Kayleigh with a Young Christian Woman of

Distinction award, celebrating her as a rising leader who demonstrates

unwavering faith, integrity, and moral clarity.
This recognition places

her among a network of accomplished Christian women leaders who are

shaping culture with courage and conviction.
Today, we honor Kayleigh Bush--not just as the Canceled Crown, but as

a living testimony of 1 Timothy 4:12: ``Let no one look down on you

because of your youth, but be an example for the believers in speech,

in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.''
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this

outstanding woman of distinction.
This outstanding woman of

distinction.

HONORING MAJOR GENERAL LAURA M. CLELLAN

HON.
JASON CROW

Mr. CROW.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize a truly

remarkable leader and dedicated public servant, Major General Laura M.

Clellan, on the occasion of her retirement as The Adjutant General of

Colorado.
For over three decades, Major General Clellan has served our

Nation and the State of Colorado with unwavering commitment, integrity,

and distinction.
Major General Clellan's exceptional career began in 1989 when she was

commissioned as a Second Lieutenant through the Army ROTC program.
Her

journey has been one of exemplary leadership and selfless service,

marked by numerous key assignments and deployments that have taken her

across the globe in defense of our freedoms.
She has answered the call

of duty in Afghanistan, Hungary, Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Honduras,

leading our troops with courage and compassion.
Her command of the 193rd Military Police Battalion during Operation

Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan stands as a testament to her leadership

under the most demanding of circumstances.
She has consistently

demonstrated a profound dedication to the well-being and readiness of

our Soldiers and Airmen.
In her most recent role as the 44th Adjutant General of Colorado,

Major General Clellan made history as the first woman to hold the

position.
She has been a transformative leader for the Colorado

National Guard.
Assuming command in 2020, she expertly guided the

organization through a period of unprecedented challenges, including

the state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, devastating wildfires,

and floods.
Her steady hand ensured the safety and security of our

communities while fostering a climate of excellence and inclusivity.
As

Executive Director of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs,

her strategic vision enhanced not only the readiness of our forces but

also the support for our state's veterans.
Mr. Speaker, Major General Clellan's career is a shining example of a

life dedicated to service.
Her leadership has left an indelible mark on

the Colorado National Guard and our Nation.
On behalf of a grateful

state and Nation, I extend my deepest gratitude to Major General Laura

M. Clellan for her more than 35 years of distinguished service.
