Despite legendary driver

Dale Earnhardt leading the pack for a majority of the Busch 500,

Morgan-McClure racer Ernie Irvan pulled ahead for the win.
Following this 1990 victory, Morgan-McClure Motorsports continued to

win.
The next year, Morgan-McClure Motorsports won NASCAR's ``Crown

Jewel'' by finishing in first place at the Daytona 500 and beating some

of NASCAR's finest.
Most notably, Morgan-McClure Motorsports took home back-to-back

Daytona 500 titles in 1994 and 1995, cementing the team as a powerhouse

in the sport.
Between 1990 and 1998, Morgan-McClure Motorsports won 14 races at the

NASCAR cup level.
Mr. McClure favored drivers that were not afraid to

take risks and captivated audiences with the famous No.
4 Kodak

Chevrolet.
Despite most teams being based around Charlotte, Mr. McClure

was proud of his roots in Virginia and found great joy in running his

team out of Washington County.
While many associate Mr. McClure with racing excellence, others

remember Mr. McClure for his compassion and humility.
In 2004, fellow

Virginian and opposing driver Hermie Sadler's only engine gave out at

Chicagoland.
Without hesitation, Mr. McClure gave Sadler a spare

engine.
Sterling Martin, who spent multiple years driving for Morgan-McClure

Motorsports and won the 1994 and 1995 Daytona 500 events, attributed

his racing success to Mr. McClure.
After McClure's passing, Martin

shared how much Mr. McClure meant to him.
He described McClure as

``innovative, smart and a hell of a guy.''
Mr. McClure is survived by his loving wife of 58 years, Ginny;

brothers Ed (Lee), Teddy (Sarah), Jerry (Sue), and Gerald (Ruth), all

of Abingdon; Jim of Chevy Chase, Maryland; and Michael of Florida;

sister Betsy (Roy) of Las Vegas; sister-in-law Wilma; along with many

aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and special friends.
He also leaves

behind his cherished fur baby, Prissy.
Today, we recognize Mr. McClure's impact on NASCAR and his influence

in Southwest Virginia.
As a lifelong native of the region, we will

forever celebrate the accolades and feats of a NASCAR legend from

Southwest Virginia.
