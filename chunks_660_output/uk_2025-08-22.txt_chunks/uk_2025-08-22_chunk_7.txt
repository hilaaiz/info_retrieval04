With a passion for fostering rescue horses, Phillip worked closely

with the MS Horse Rescue.
His support for the Dixie National Rodeo,

Ducks Unlimited, and Heart of the Horse were passion projects of his.
Phillip will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and the Southern

Ag Credit family.
I was honored to have had the opportunity to work

alongside him through the years.
His dedication to the Ag industry will

continue through his legacy.
