Key

investors in that company were brothers Horace and John Dodge, who

would go on to found their own brand of vehicles in 1914.
The moving

assembly line that Ford introduced in 1913 at their Highland Park Plant

would revolutionize not only industry, but labor as well.
Daily wages

were more than doubled to $5, shifts were reduced from 9 to 8 hours

long, and the mass production of vehicles allowed automobiles to become

much more accessible to the average American.
Major international

automotive brands, like GM (1908), Chevrolet (1911), and Chrysler

(1925), were also founded in the Detroit region at that time.
Decades

later, car factories were converted to produce bombers in order to help

in the Second World War.
The factories of this area, like Willow Run in

Ypsilanti, were so crucial to the effort that this region came to be

known as the ``Arsenal of Democracy''.
Over the last 25 years, the MCNHA has built an appreciation in both

residents and visitors for how the automobile changed Michigan, the

nation, and the world.
With the vast number of heritage sites across

the region, the MCNHA started a grant program to focus on partnerships,

connecting organizations and providing resources critical for

preservation and promotion.
It has directly provided over $1 million in

grants to over 100 organizations to make these preservation, tourism,

and educational projects a reality.
The MCNHA has also been a boon for

the State of Michigan, generating over $400 million in economic impact

annually while supporting over 4,500 quality jobs.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the

25th anniversary of the MCNHA.
Our auto and labor industry helped

establish and expand the United States as an industrial power and was a

driving force for the creation of the middle class, and we thank the

MCNHA for their great work in promoting and preserving our unique

legacy.
Just last year they were reauthorized for another 15 years, and

we are excited to see how they will continue to tell our incredible

story.
Thank you to MCNHA.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LEGENDARY COACH BOB KNIGHT

HON.
JIM BANKS

Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy

of a legendary Hoosier, Coach Bob Knight, I would like to include

in the Record the obituary provided by Indiana University Athletics:

Coach Bob Knight Passes Away at 83

Indiana University Athletics

Bloomington, Ind.--Bob Knight, one of the most successful

and influential figures in the history of college basketball,

passed away on Nov. 1, 2023 surrounded by family and friends.
He was 83 years old.
Knight's coaching accomplishments are legendary.
He went

902-371 during a 42-year head coaching career that included

stops at Army (1966-71), Indiana (1972-2000), and Texas Tech

(2002-08).
Those 902 wins ranked No.
1 all-time when he

retired in 2008, and currently ranks sixth.
He was a four-

time National Coach of the Year, a five-time Big Ten Coach of

the Year, and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall

of Fame (1991), the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006),

and the IU Athletics Hall of Fame (2009).
While he enjoyed tremendous success at each of his three

head coaching stops, he became a larger-than-life figure in

the sport thanks to his accomplishments in Bloomington.
Hired

by IU at the age of 30 in 1971, he led the program to three

NCAA titles (1976, 1981, 1987), five Final Fours (1973, 1976,

1981, 1987, 1992), and 11 Big Ten Regular Season

Championships (1973-76, 1980-81, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991,

1993) in his 29 years as head coach.
Knight's 1976 team,

which went 32-0 on its way to the NCAA title, remains the

most recent to go undefeated on its way to an NCAA title.
