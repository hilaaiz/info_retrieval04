While he enjoyed tremendous success at each of his three

head coaching stops, he became a larger-than-life figure in

the sport thanks to his accomplishments in Bloomington.
Hired

by IU at the age of 30 in 1971, he led the program to three

NCAA titles (1976, 1981, 1987), five Final Fours (1973, 1976,

1981, 1987, 1992), and 11 Big Ten Regular Season

Championships (1973-76, 1980-81, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991,

1993) in his 29 years as head coach.
Knight's 1976 team,

which went 32-0 on its way to the NCAA title, remains the

most recent to go undefeated on its way to an NCAA title.
His

1975 and 1976 teams, meanwhile, each went undefeated (18-0)

in Big Ten play, and no Big Ten team has gone undefeated in a

single season in league play since.
Indiana's 37 consecutive

Big Ten wins during that period also established a new

conference standard that has never been seriously threatened.
Knight's dominance at IU stretched through all three

decades that he coached in Bloomington.
The 1970s included

four Big Ten titles, two Final Fours, and one of the greatest

teams in college basketball history with the undefeated 1976

national champions.
As great as the 1970s were, the 1980s

were even better.
College basketball's most successful team

during the decade, Knight's teams captured two NCAA titles

and five Big Ten championships.
In the 1990s, the Hoosiers

won two more league crowns, advanced to another Final Four,

earned 10 NCAA tourney bids, and four straight Sweet 16

trips.
The 1990s also featured one of Knight's greatest teams

to not win an NCAA title, as the 1993 team went 17-1 in the

Big Ten, was the No.
1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament,

and featured four players that would eventually be first-

round NBA Draft picks.
In addition to his accomplishments representing Indiana

University, Knight also enjoyed similar success on the

international level.
He assembled and coached arguably the

greatest amateur men's basketball team in history, as he led

the 1984 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in Los Angeles,

and guided the U.S. team to the 1979 Pan American Games gold

as well.
While his teams excelled on the court, Knight's student-

athletes also embodied what it meant to be a student-athlete.
During his IU coaching career, 98 percent of his four-year

players earned their degrees.
Besides being one of the sport's most successful coaches,

Knight was also one of the most innovative.
He revolutionized

and popularized the `motion offense,' an offensive style

originally credited to one of Knight's mentors, Henry Iba.
Unlike traditional `set' offensive plays, the motion offense

relied on player movement, proper spacing, passing, cutting,

and screening to create scoring opportunities, It's a style

of play that became synonymous with Knight and his IU teams,

and it remains very much a staple of many of the game's most

successful coaches to this day.
Defensively, Knight was

equally committed to a single style, as he had a deeply-

rooted belief in the merits of the man-to-man defense.
The successes of both styles were enormous throughout his

IU tenure, as his Hoosier teams were traditionally one of the

Big Ten's most efficient offensively and one of the most

difficult to score against defensively.
As a result, Indiana

won 73.5 percent of its games during Knight's tenure, the

best among all Big Ten programs during that period.
IU also

earned 24 invitations to the NCAA Tournament during his 29

years, going 42-21 (.667) in those games.
Overall, 28 of

Knight's 29 IU teams earned postseason invitations.
While Knight's system and his unwavering belief in those

coaching philosophies were a big part of his success at IU,

an even more important component of his success was the

abundance of exceptional student-athletes that he attracted

to and developed in Bloomington.
In all, Knight coached nine Big Ten MVPs and 27 All-

Americans at IU.
