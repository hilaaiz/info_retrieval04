RECOGNIZING THE OPENING OF THE CAMBODIAN EXPERIENCE: OUR JOURNEY TO

AMERICA, FINDING FREEDOM AT THE HAGGIN MUSEUM IN STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA

HON.
JOSH HARDER

Mr. HARDER of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the

opening of The Cambodian Experience: Our Journey to America, Finding

Freedom at the Haggin Museum in Stockton, California.
This exhibit

documents the experiences of Cambodian Americans, tracing their journey

from the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge regime to refugee resettlement

and community building in the United States.
Developed and curated by the United Cambodian American Network

(UCAN), a nonprofit organization based in Stockton, the exhibit

presents a comprehensive narrative through oral histories, archival

materials, artifacts, and multimedia storytelling.
It highlights the

contributions of Cambodian Americans and underscores the role of

refugee communities in the broader American story.
Stockton, which became a major resettlement site during the 1980's

and 1990's, is home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the

United States.
This exhibit reflects the significance of the city as

both a destination and a foundation for Cambodian American life.
Key contributors include Sophy Reese, President of UCAN and project

manager; collaborating organizations such as the Khmer Language Arts

and Culture Academy and A Khmer Buddhist Foundation; and survivors and

descendants who provided firsthand accounts and materials for display.
The Haggin Museum provided exhibition space, curatorial support, and

logistical coordination for the project.
This exhibit is the fourth in a continuing series of Cambodian

cultural exhibits presented in partnership with the Haggin Museum.
It

serves both as a remembrance of a difficult history and a testament to

cultural preservation, community strength, and intergenerational

resilience.
I commend the individuals and organizations whose efforts have

resulted in this important public exhibit and recognize its role in

fostering historical understanding and cultural appreciation.
