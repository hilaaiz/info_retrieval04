HONORING SCHUYLER FALLS' 175TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
ELISE M. STEFANIK

Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a momentous

occasion in the history of New York State, the Town of Schuyler Falls'

175th anniversary.
In the early 19th century, a group of visionaries established a

settlement bordered on the north and east by the Saranac River.
Through

their determination and perseverance, these settlers laid foundations

for what would become the prosperous town of Schuyler Falls, formally

erected from the Town of Plattsburgh on April 4, 1848.
Residents have

preserved its unique heritage, embraced progress, and fostered a

vibrant spirit of unity that continues to this day.
Schuyler Falls has beautiful rolling hills, accessible agriculture,

timber, and waterpower, all of which provided early residents with key

resources in the Town's founding industries.
The initial successes of

the Town's founders paved a way for a stalwart, close-knit community

that values hard work and dedication.
Today, Schuyler Falls continues to flourish with a plethora of local

farms, small businesses, and a growing commercial businesses sector.
On

behalf of New York's 21st District, it is my honor to recognize and

celebrate the

175th anniversary of Schuyler Falls, a hallmark of the North Country.

HONORING THE WORK OF ZACHARY ISAKOWITZ

HON.
MICHAEL T. McCAUL

Mr. McCAUL.
Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a valued staff

member and trusted advisor, Zachary Isakowitz, as he leaves to embark

on the next steps in his career.
Although he will be greatly missed, I

could not be happier for the impact he will continue making within the

technology sector.
Zach has served as my Legislative Director for the last two and a

half years.
His role has been vital to the passing of some of my most

important legislation, including the CHIPS for America Act.
Zach's work was, foremost, dedicated to promoting the growth of

semiconductor manufacturing in America.
Together, we have seen billions

invested in the technology industry in Texas and across the nation.
We

have secured funding for dozens of projects in Texas-10, including many

at institutes of higher education.
And we've passed crucial legislation

combatting childhood cancer.
I would like to thank Zach for a job well done.
I am grateful for the

dedication and support he has given to me, the staff, and the people of

Texas' 10th Congressional District.
I wish him all the best, both in

life and throughout the remainder of his career.
While his presence in my office will certainly be missed, I know Zach

will continue to leave a positive mark on D.C. and our Nation.
And

remember, once a member of team McCaul, always a member of team McCaul.
