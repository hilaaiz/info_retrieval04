RECOGNIZING GERALD ``JERRY'' DANFORTH

HON.
TONY WIED

Mr. WIED.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of

Gerald ``Jerry'' Danforth, a distinguished Tribal leader, a decorated

Navy veteran, and a beloved husband, father, and grandfather, who

passed away on the morning of June 1, 2025, at the age of 78.
Born on December 24, 1946, in Oneida, Wisconsin, to Leslie and Eva

Schuyler Danforth, Jerry devoted his life to service--first to his

country, and then to his people.
He served honorably in the United

States Navy for over three decades, retiring in 1994 with the esteemed

rank of Force Master Chief, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.
He was a veteran of both the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, embodying

courage, commitment, and leadership throughout his military career.
Jerry brought the same conviction and discipline to his leadership

within the Oneida Nation.
He was elected Chairman of the Oneida

Business Committee in 1995 and again in 2005, where he advocated

tirelessly for policies that advanced Indian gaming, economic

development, healthcare, higher education, and the preservation of the

Oneida language.
His long-term vision was to build a strong,

sustainable economy not solely reliant on gaming and to enhance

communication between tribal governance and the General Tribal Council.
A public servant in every sense, Jerry also served his Nation as a

judge on the Oneida Judiciary, where his wisdom, fairness, and devotion

to justice left a lasting impact.
Beyond his public service, Jerry was a man of deep personal warmth

and abiding family values.
He is survived by his loving wife, Pamela

Johns Danforth, and their children Paul Jameson (Virna), Steve Jameson

(Cathy), Tanya Wood (Steve), Gerald Danforth Jr. (Chitra), Patrick

Danforth, and stepson Keith Bimosae Johns Herman.
He is also survived

by his brother James Danforth (Joanne), sister Joanne Smith (late Bruce

Smith), and many grandchildren who brought him great joy.
He was

preceded in death by his son Thomas Danforth and his parents.
Jerry lived a life rich with passion and purpose--he loved fishing,

golf, entertaining with his prized green egg grill, red wine,

chocolate, and pie.
He cherished winters spent in South Padre Island

with Pam and was happiest when surrounded by family and friends.
Mr. Speaker, Gerald ``Jerry'' Danforth's life was defined by service,

leadership, and love.
He exemplified the highest ideals of his people

and of this Nation.
His legacy will endure in the lives he touched, the

institutions he shaped, and the Nation he served so faithfully.
I offer

my deepest condolences to his family, his community, and the entire

Oneida nation.
May his memory be a blessing.
