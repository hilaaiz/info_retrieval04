After earning her doctorate from the University of Massachusetts in 1971, Dr. Smith's journey brought her to Michigan State University where she joined the faculty of the Department of Education.
Throughout her tenure at MSU, Dr. Smith distinguished herself as a trailblazer and champion of equity, especially for women of color.
Her footprint at MSU is immeasurable.
In 1972, she played a pivotal role as a member of the steering committee for the Black Women Employees Association of MSU, where she passionately advocated for the hiring of more Black women professors.
Her achievements, including becoming the first Black woman to attain full professorship at MSU and being recognized on the university's Distinguished Wall of Professors, serve as a testament to her contributions and enduring influence.
She lent her leadership and expertise as she served as the Director of African American and African Studies, as a member on the MSU Athletic Board, and on the university's presidential search committee.
In 2007, Dr. Smith retired from MSU as professor emeritus in the Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, and Special Education.
Dr. Smith's incredible legacy extends beyond the classroom.
She was the first Black President of the Michigan Counseling Psychology and Supervision Professional Organization.
She has also been a proud member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first intercollegiate historically African American sorority, since 1958.
She served as the organization's 18th Great Lakes Regional Director and has truly embodied her sisterhood's mission to cultivate and encourage high scholastic and ethical standards and to be of service to all mankind.
Dr. Smith continues to show her commitment to education and serving others as a member of her local chapter of the Links, Incorporated, an organization dedicated to promoting quality education, civic responsibility, and enhancing the quality of life of their communities.
She is also a cherished member of her church, The Friendship Baptist Church, where she lives their cote value of serving without restraint.
With profound gratitude for her extraordinary contributions to Michigan State University and her lifelong mission to uplift her community, it is my honor to recognize her service here, in the People's House.
