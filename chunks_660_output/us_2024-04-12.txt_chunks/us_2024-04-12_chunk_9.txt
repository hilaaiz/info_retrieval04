Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Katelyn O'Connell of Arvada, Colorado.
Katelyn was selected as one of 250 high school students across the country to participate in the Department of State's prestigious Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange (CBYX) Program.
Launched in 1983, CBYX selects high achieving youth from both Germany and the United States to live in each other's country for one academic year.
During their year abroad, students will foster meaningful relationships between America and Germany, while giving participants new perspectives on peoples and cultures beyond their own.
Many CBYX alumni go on to distinguished careers in foreign affairs and public service using the language skills gained through this scholarship program.
This year, Katelyn will travel to Germany, attending school, living with a host family, and collaborating with the Department of State to integrate into her host community and promote mutual understanding between Americans and the German people.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's Seventh Congressional District, it is my honor to congratulate Katelyn O'Connell for this impressive accomplishment and wish her all the best in her upcoming year in Germany. ____________________
