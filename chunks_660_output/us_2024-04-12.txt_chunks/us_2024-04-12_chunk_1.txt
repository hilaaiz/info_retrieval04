Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mississippi State University (MSU) Veterans Business Outreach Center (VBOC) on being recognized as the 2024 Veterans Business Outreach Center of the Year.
Director Mark Scott has worked tirelessly to make the MSU VBOC a place where Veterans are served well.
Natalie Rhode, the program director, has also played a key role in the center's success.
The Veterans Business Outreach Center is focused on small business development for Veterans and their spouses.
The center was founded in 2015 and covers Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
The Small Business Administration selected the MSU VBOC this year for its successes and unique contributions to the local community.
Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy.
The MSU VBOC is committed to excellence while supporting many local Veterans as they invest in their communities.
This award is a testament to the hard work by the outstanding team on the front lines at the VBOC.
I am thankful to have the opportunity to congratulate the Mississippi State University Veterans Business Outreach Center on the occasion of this award, and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress on behalf of our Veterans. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the lives of the six construction workers who passed away as a result of the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore.
Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, Dorian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, Miguel Luna, Jose Mynor Lopez, and Carlos Hernandez.
These men who lost their lives while working on the Bridge were everyday heroes.
These men could've been our fathers, brothers, grandsons, or nephews.
That evening, they arrived at work proudly as immigrants, ready to help build this country with their own two hands by undertaking hazardous and challenging tasks that others refused.
Their dedication reminds us that immigrants should be celebrated and acknowledged for contributing to this country--not vilified and attacked for where they come from, the color of their skin, or their accent.
They deserve to be praised and remembered.
We should be inspired by their tenacity and dedication to pursuing the American Dream for themselves and their loved ones.
We will continue to work on behalf of our immigrant community in honor of these brave souls.
We will rebuild the Bridge and help build an immigration infrastructure that celebrates our workers. ____________________

GLORIA SMITH ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr. Speaker, today I pay tribute to a trailblazing member of the Michigan State University community: Dr. Gloria Smith.
Her lifelong dedication to education, advocacy, and service has left an indelible mark on the university and beyond.
After earning her doctorate from the University of Massachusetts in 1971, Dr. Smith's journey brought her to Michigan State University where she joined the faculty of the Department of Education.
Throughout her tenure at MSU, Dr. Smith distinguished herself as a trailblazer and champion of equity, especially for women of color.
Her footprint at MSU is immeasurable.
