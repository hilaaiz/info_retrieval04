In recent years, the

Central Cabarrus Vikings have been the dominant force to reckon with in

North Carolina boys' basketball.
Local Charlotte news anchor Jim

Tritsch described it perfectly when he said, ``there is no defense they

cannot breach; there is no level of dominance they can't unlock.''
Led by Coach Jim Baker, the Vikings put up an astounding record of

95-1 over the past three seasons.
The Vikings' most recent win not only

earned them a second consecutive championship but raised Central

Cabarrus' winning streak to 65 straight games, the longest current

winning streak in the country.
Once again, on behalf of the 8th District of North Carolina,

congratulations to Coach Baker and Viking Nation on this outstanding

achievement.

RECOGNIZING MR.
EFRAIN CASILLAS

HON.
RAUL M. GRIJALVA

Mr. GRIJALVA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable

contributions of Mr. Efrain Casillas, the Coordinator of Music Programs

for the Tolleson Elementary School District in Tolleson, Arizona.
For

the past 24 years, Mr. Casillas has dedicated himself to the education

and enrichment of his students, serving as a public-school music

teacher and imparting his passion for music to countless young minds.
Mr. Casillas' own journey exemplifies what it means to break through

barriers to achieve success through dedication and commitment.
Mr.

Casillas has beaten the odds and was named the Arizona Teacher of the

Year in 2024 by the Arizona Educational Foundation, representing the

state of Arizona at the national level among many more recognitions.
Mr. Casillas has had a profound impact on countless students,

pioneering innovative music programs, including the district's first

Mariachi, Jazz, Marching, Concert, and Latin Jazz bands.
As a native of

Puerto Rico, Mariachi was not part of his musical heritage, but

Casillas made it a priority to learn it because it is part of the

culture of many of his students who are native to Mexico.
