Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Alex Ramos, an 8th grade student at Legacy School in Arizona's 6th District.
Each year on Veterans Day, Alex places flags on headstones at the Holy Hope Cemetery, a tradition his brother started 7 years ago.
That year, his brother started with just 25 flags.
This year, Alex placed 600 flags at graves across the cemetery.
My team had the pleasure of joining him in November, helping to place the flags and honoring those who served.
During the rest of the year, Alex goes door-to-door to collect donations for flags.
At only 13 years old, he and his brother have started a rich tradition in our community.
Our district is home to over 70,000 veterans.
I am incredibly proud to know that because of kids like Alex, the next generation will keep their legacies alive. ____________________
