Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the longest serving mayor of the city I so proudly represent, Mayor Coleman A. Young, on the 26th anniversary of his passing.
Born in the throes of segregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Mayor Young rose from the humble beginnings of the Great Migration to become a beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for the city of Detroit.
His journey was marked not just by the offices he held, but by the indomitable spirit he embodied--a spirit that challenged inequality, fought for justice, and tirelessly sought to uplift every resident of Detroit.
As Detroit's first African-American mayor, he broke barriers and built bridges.
He led our city through times of challenge and change, always with an unwavering vision for a more inclusive and prosperous Detroit.
His efforts to integrate the Detroit Police Department and to fight excessive use of force were not just administrative actions, but bold steps towards healing and unity.
His advocacy for affirmative action and his dedication to economic development were testament to his belief in a Detroit that offered opportunity for all.
Under his leadership, Detroit saw the rise of vital infrastructure and community projects, laying the groundwork for the city's future.
As we reflect on Mayor Young's legacy, let us remember his courage, his unwavering commitment to civil rights, and his enduring love for Detroit.
His life's work reminds us of the power of resilience, the importance of visionary leadership, and the unyielding pursuit of equality.
Mayor Young's legacy is not confined to the past; it is a guiding light for our future, motivating us to continue building a city that is as strong, as vibrant, and as inclusive as the remarkable leader we commemorate today.
May his memory continue to inspire us all. ____________________

Lauren has dedicated her life to advancing good public policy and the betterment of those who serve on Capitol Hill.
A native of New Brunswick, New Jersey, Lauren grew up in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Iowa, and Florida.
After graduating Magna Cum Laude from Wake Forest with a B.A. in English, Lauren moved to Washington, D.C. Like many congressional staffers, she started as a Staff Assistant in the Office of Rep. John Shadegg (AZ-4), where she was quickly promoted to Legislative Assistant.
Then.
in 1997, she joined the Office of Rep. Joe Pitts (PA-16), becoming his Legislative Director in 1998.
During her time with Rep. Pitts, Lauren helped establish the Values Action Team (VAT).
One of the most meaningful aspects of her time on Capitol Hill was participating in Faith and Law--an organization founded in 1983 that encourages and equips Christian policymakers to more fully understand the Biblical worldview and its implication for their calling to public service.
In 2001, Lauren left Capitol Hill and continued her distinguished career at The Heritage Foundation, where she served in multiple roles until 2008.

Lauren returned to Capitol Hill as Faith and Law's new Executive Director in 2017.
