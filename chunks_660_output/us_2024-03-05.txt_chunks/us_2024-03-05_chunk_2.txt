An inspiration to the Arizona arts community and the world, Ed will forever be remembered as the originator of some of the most iconic depictions of the desert landscape.
A Phoenix native, Ed was born in 1942 and at a very young age was drawn to the arts.
He went on to graduate from Phoenix Junior College and the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena.
After a six-year stint in New York City where he pursued his interest in commercial advertising, Ed aspired to have greater creative freedom which he was only able to find back in his home state of Arizona.
In 1970, Ed accepted a teaching position on the Hopi Reservation during which he rediscovered the charm and beauty of the desert.
Ed then relocated to Phoenix and in the decades that followed, he became one of the most respected and venerated artists of Arizona, dedicated to capturing the Southwest desert landscape.
Throughout his long career, museums and galleries around the globe exhibited his work, while private collectors sought the chance to add one of his pieces to their possessions.
Although recognized globally for artistic accolades, Ed will always be remembered as generous and kind.
He was a devoted friend and a loving and proud husband and father.
Beyond his personal relationships, Ed's impact can be seen in numerous city projects including the imposing bronze rider astride a bucking horse in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and his U.S. Postal Service Centennial stamp.
Ed's depictions of the vibrant Arizona sunsets, sweeping vistas, and dramatic mountains will forever cement him as one of the greatest landscape artists of all time.
Ed is survived by his wife, Rose Marie, and his son, Carson, along with a deeply admiring and extensive fan base.
I thank Ed for his years of inspiration and dedication.
Godspeed.
