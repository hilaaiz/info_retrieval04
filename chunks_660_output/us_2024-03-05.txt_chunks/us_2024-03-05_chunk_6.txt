Date: 2024-03-05 Volume: 170, Issue: 39 Pages: E214 - E214 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE RETURN OF SHEN YUN TO THE DAVID H. KOCH THEATER AT LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. RYAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the return of the Shen Yun Performing Arts Company to the David H. Koch theater at Lincoln Center in New York City in April 2024.
Shen Yun Performing Arts was established in New York in 2006 and has become a worldwide phenomenon as they travel to 180 cities every year to perform.
Millions of people travel to see this unique performance time and time again and with the development of new dances each year, the performers, choreographers, and conductors continually develop an amazing show for all to enjoy.
The ancient Chinese traditions that are rooted in virtue, faith, and moral values are brought to life in the performances that feature dancing and singing with performers wearing intricate costumes.
Artistic freedom is essential to a society and Shen Yun expresses that ideal in the face of continued opposition from the Chinese government.
I had the privilege of meeting many members of the Shen Yun community located in my distict and watched the performance in Washington, D.C. It was a huge honor to see such talent.
I want to thank the members of Shen Yun for their great success thus far and wish them all the best performing at Lincoln Center. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA HELICOPTER NOISE INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-03-05 Volume: 170, Issue: 39 Pages: E215 - E215 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE WASHINGTON, D.C. AREA HELICOPTER NOISE INFORMATION EXCHANGE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I introduce the Washington, D.C. Area Helicopter Noise Information Exchange Act, which would require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to create and implement a helicopter noise-sharing mechanism for all helicopter operators in the National Capital Region (NCR) and to make such mechanism accessible to the public online.
I got this bill included in the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act (H.R. 3935), which the House passed last year.
Residents of the NCR have been plagued by helicopter noise for years.
Yet, there is no centralized complaint system nor any comprehensive data about helicopter noise in the NCR Helicopter noise can harm health, quality of life, and the structural integrity of homes.
In 2019, I led members of the NCR in requesting that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study helicopter noise in the NCR.
In 2021, GAO recommended that the FAA implement a noise sharing mechanism for helicopter operators in the NCR.
In 2022, the FAA initiated a pilot program with a private company to create a helicopter noise sharing mechanism in the NCR.
After the end of the pilot program, Fairfax and Arlington Counties contracted with the private company to maintain such a mechanism solely for Northern Virginia.
However, the company is not required to share the collected data with any jurisdictions, other than those in Northern Virginia, or the public.
The FAA must be involved in the collection and analysis of helicopter noise data in the NCR to effectively address the impacts on the public, and the public has a right to know the source of the noise.
