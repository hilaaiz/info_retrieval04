He wanted to ensure people knew that libraries are not just places with books but offer something for everyone.
Through his social media posts, Mr. Threets shared stories about the vital role libraries play in people's lives and the ``library joy'' he sees in action every day.
Mr. Threets used his viral social media presence to spread kindness and inspire American youth to fall in love with reading and libraries, just as he did.
For his advocacy and outspoken love of libraries, Mr. Threets was one of 10 librarians across the country to win the I Love My Librarian Award for Public Service.
While Mr. Threets will be stepping away from his role in the Solano County Library, I know he will continue striving to improve the Solano community and increase literacy rates for young children.
I look forward to seeing his work to expand access to educational resources and make our communities more inclusive. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-05 Volume: 170, Issue: 39 Pages: E212 - E213 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E212-E213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF BETTY HOLZENDORF ______ of florida in the house of representatives Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ.
Mr. Speaker, it is in the spirit of bereavement that I rise to recognize the remarkable life of former Florida State Senator Betty Holzendorf.
As a dedicated public servant, community leader, and advocate for social justice, her impact on the city of Jacksonville and the great State of Florida and its people will be felt for generations to come.
Senator Holzendorf passed away on February 29, 2024 at the age of 84.
As a lifelong resident of Jacksonville, Senator Holzendorf dedicated her life to the betterment of her community.
She received her bachelor's degree from Edward Waters University and her master's in educational administration from the University of North Florida, the latter of which has a road named after her on campus.
As a former public school teacher and administrator at her alma mater, Edward Waters University, she was committed to quality education and began her career in public service in 1975 as an affirmative action officer under Jacksonville Mayor Hans Tanzler.
Following several years of service in this role, she joined the staff of Jacksonville Mayor Jake Godbold as City Council liaison, where she developed the political skills that would catapult her into the Florida House of Representatives in 1988.
Throughout her esteemed career, Senator Holzendorf championed causes that uplifted the most vulnerable members of her community.
Whether it was fighting for affordable housing, advocating for quality education, or promoting access to healthcare, she never wavered in her dedication to improving the lives of her constituents, especially children.
Senator Holzendorf's passion for justice and equality was matched only by her unwavering determination to create positive change.
After four years in the Florida House, she served with distinction in the Florida State Senate from 1992 to 2002, where her leadership earned her the respect and admiration of colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
Beyond her legislative accomplishments, Senator Holzendorf was a pillar of her community, known for her kindness, compassion, and incredible cooking.
Her impact extended far beyond the boundaries of Tallahassee and Jacksonville, truly touching the lives of countless individuals throughout Florida.
My heart is with Senator Holzendorf's family during this time of mourning.
May they find solace in knowing that her legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of all who had the privilege of knowing her, and may her memory be for a blessing. ____________________
