He was a fighter for working families his entire life and used every

ounce of grit to deliver for his beloved community every day he was in

office.
He was an uncompromising champion of the environment, of bilingual

education, of the rights of immigrants, and of the rights of Native

Americans.
He was also a genuine human being to the very last, committed to what

he believed in, who never let the petty politics of the day make him

cynical, or hard, or mean.
I am grateful for his commitment and unwavering courage that he used

to make our country better.
I will miss him greatly.
I am sending love and light to his family, Ramona, Adelita, Marisa,

and Raquel, his staff, and all who loved him.

RECOGNIZING HOSKINS DRUG STORE'S 95TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
CHARLES J. ``CHUCK'' FLEISCHMANN

Mr. FLEISCHMANN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a remarkable

milestone in the history of Hoskins Drug Store & Soda Fountain, a

cherished community institution in Clinton, TN.
For nearly a century,

Hoskins Drugstore has been a cornerstone of the community, providing

not only essential services but also a deep sense of connection and

tradition.
On April 4, 2025, Hoskins Drug Store will celebrate 95 years of

service.
Founded by R.C. Hoskins in 1930, Hoskins Drug Store quickly

became more than just a place to fill prescriptions; it became a

trusted destination where people could count on personalized service,

quality products, and a warm, welcoming environment.
R.C. Hoskins built

a legacy that has endured for generations, one founded on integrity,

commitment, and community care.
As the years passed, the legacy of Hoskins Drug Store was carried

forward by R.C. Hoskins' daughters, Dudley Hoskins Bostic and Molly

Hoskins Scarbrough, who continue to lead the business today with the

same dedication and vision that their father demonstrated nearly a

century ago.
Their hard work and dedication have ensured that Hoskins

Drug Store remains a beloved part of the community, staying true to its

principles while adapting to the changing needs of the times.
