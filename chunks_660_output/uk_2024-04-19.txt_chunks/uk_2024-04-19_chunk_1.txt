BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH WEEK AND CRISIS

HON.
JOYCE BEATTY

Mrs. BEATTY.
Mr Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Black

Maternal Health Week, to urgently address the ongoing epidemic

surrounding the mortality and health of Black mothers, and to implore

this esteemed body to take decisive action on legislation that can help

reverse this alarming reality.
Women in America are tragically dying at a higher rate from

pregnancy-related causes than in any other developed nation.
The

disparities are even more stark for Black women, who are three times

more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than their white

counterparts.
This heartbreaking statistic is rooted in a long history

of systemic racism and bias.
Studies reveal that Black women facing

severe injuries or pregnancy complications, or simply seeking

assistance, are often dismissed or overlooked in healthcare settings

that should prioritize their care--a stark truth regardless of

socioeconomic status.
A recent study highlighted that even the

wealthiest Black mothers and their babies face twice the risk of

mortality compared to their white counterparts.
This disparity

transcends income, as high-income Black women and low-income white

women experience similar rates of childbirth-related deaths.
Additionally, many nonaffluent Black mothers lack access to safe

housing, affordable transportation, and nutritious food--essential

elements that profoundly impact maternal health.
Systemic injustice in

our health care and other national capabilities threatens the lives and

well-being of all Black mothers, who are unequivocally American

mothers.
We cannot allow these inequities to persist when potential solutions

exist.
I urge my esteemed colleagues to rally behind the efforts and

legislation of the Black Maternal Caucus, dedicated to addressing these

pressing concerns and championing the welfare of Black mothers.
A

crucial step forward is the passage of The Black Maternal Health

Momnibus Act, H.R. 3305 comprising 13 vital bills aimed at tackling

this crisis and promoting healthcare equity for Black mothers.
The

Momnibus encompasses measures to enhance healthcare and economic

support for Black mothers, bolster our federal and community capacity

to understand and rectify this crisis, and expand and diversify our

perinatal workforce to better serve Black mothers.
This monumental

legislation is cosponsored by 193 of my House Democratic colleagues, 32

senators, and backing from 200 stakeholder organizations.
The Momnibus Act can be a vital first step in forging an America

where Black mothers can flourish.
Let us unite in our commitment to

ensure the health and well-being of all mothers, regardless of race or

socioeconomic status, as we strive towards a future where every mother

receives the care and support she deserves.

CELEBRATING THE GRAND OPENING OF THE FOOD SHED CO-OP

HON.
BILL FOSTER

Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt

congratulations to the Food Shed Co-op family on their achievement in

organizing and establishing a community-owned grocery store.
The

concept of establishing a cooperative emerged from discussions among a

group of friends seeking to strengthen their community.
They

collectively decided to create a community-owned store in McHenry

County, embarking on an unpredictable and awe-inspiring journey.
Their

dedication to bringing this dream to fruition is truly commendable.
Food Shed Co-op is more than a simple grocery store, it is a symbol

of the determination of the community.
It is committed to providing

everyone with access to fresh, locally sourced, and sustainably

produced food.
With a mission to support local farmers and producers,

reduce environmental impact, and foster a sense of community, Food Shed

Co-op is a shining example of what can be achieved when like-minded

individuals come together for a common cause.
Nearly 2,100 people purchased equity shares in the co-op, reflecting

the strong support of the community during the project's development

and grand launch.
