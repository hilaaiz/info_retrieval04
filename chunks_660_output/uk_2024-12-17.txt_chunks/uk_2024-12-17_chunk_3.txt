HONORING EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK'S DISTRICT DIRECTOR DEE ROSARIO

HON.
BARBARA LEE

Ms. LEE of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Board

Director Dee Rosario as he prepares for retirement after an

extraordinary 37 years of dedicated service to the East Bay Regional

Park District.
A proud native of the East Bay, Dee's journey began at

Mt. Eden High School in Hayward, followed by an associate's degree from

Chabot Community College and further studies at California State

University, East Bay.
His deep roots in this community have shaped both

his personal and professional life, driving a career that has had a

profound and lasting impact on our region.
Dee's career with the Park District began in 1975, where he took on a

series of vital roles, including park ranger, firefighter, fire

lieutenant, and ultimately, park supervisor of Reinhardt Redwood

Regional Park.
His unwavering commitment to preserving our natural

resources and serving the public has left an indelible mark on the East

Bay community.
During the 1991 Oakland Firestorm, his bravery and leadership were

instrumental in mitigating the devastation.
His steadfast dedication to

both protecting lives and safeguarding our natural landscapes proved

invaluable during that critical time, demonstrating his remarkable

courage and deep sense of responsibility.
In November 2016, Dee transitioned to a new chapter as a Board

Director, where his visionary leadership has shaped the direction of

the Park District.
Notably, he co-chaired Measure FF, a successful

initiative that secured crucial funding for park improvements, wildfire

prevention, and public safety--investments that will benefit

generations to come.
Dee's exceptional contributions to the Park

District were recently recognized with the 2024 California Special

Districts Association Board Member of the Year award, a fitting honor

for his tireless work and dedication.
One of Dee's most lasting legacies is his role in renaming Redwood

Regional Park in honor of Aurelia Reinhardt, a pioneering figure in the

Park District's history.
This thoughtful and meaningful tribute not

only celebrated Reinhardt's contributions but also underscored Dee's

commitment to preserving the rich heritage of our community and our

parks.
Throughout his career, Dee has exemplified what it means to be a true

leader.
He has consistently sought to cultivate growth, creativity, and

compassion in others, mentoring the next generation of public servants

to continue his legacy of excellence and service.
His belief that

leadership is about empowering others will continue to resonate long

after his retirement.
On behalf of the entire community, I extend our deepest gratitude to

Board Director Dee Rosario for his outstanding service, leadership, and

unwavering commitment to enhancing our natural and recreational

resources.
His legacy will continue to inspire us all.
