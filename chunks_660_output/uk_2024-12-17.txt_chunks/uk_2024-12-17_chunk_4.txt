HONORING THE LIFE OF RACHEL ABRAHAM

HON.
JAMAAL BOWMAN

Mr. BOWMAN.
Mr. Speaker, today I want to remember the beautiful life

of Rachel Abraham of Mamaroneck.
Rachel passed recently at the young

age of 25 from complications due to pulmonary hypertension, a condition

she was diagnosed with at birth.
Our community in Mamaroneck and across New York's 16th district is

devastated by Rachel's passing.
I want to send love and strength to

Rachel's parents, Deborah and Stephen, her siblings, Leah and Joshua,

and her fiance, Dylan.
I know that they are proud of Rachel's

incredible life and all that she was able to accomplish.
After graduating from Mamaroneck High School, Rachel attended

American University and was in the process of getting her masters

degree from George Washington University.
She was also working at the

Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society as a Government

Relations Manager, pursuing her goal of changing healthcare in the

United States.
Before her time at HIMSS, she worked for the National

Council for Mental Wellbeing and ADvancing States and interned here in

Congress.
We are all grateful for the contributions Rachel made to improving

our healthcare across the country, work informed by her own experiences

with the healthcare system throughout her life.
Her commitment to

public service and advocating for others is clear and we are all better

for it.
My thoughts are with her family, friends, and loved ones in this

difficult time.
Rachel was a beautiful soul and an incredible part of

our Mamaroneck community.
It has been an honor to represent her and her

family.
