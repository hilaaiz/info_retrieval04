HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF JAMES MILTON HAWKINS

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

remarkable life and enduring legacy of Mr. James Milton Hawkins of

Bolton, Mississippi--a gifted musician, devoted educator, and man of

deep faith.
Mr. Hawkins served his community, his students, and his

church with unwavering passion and humility for more than four decades.
Born on August 12, 1950, in Bolton, Mississippi, James was the son of

Mae Lillie Atkinson Hawkins and Eldridge Hawkins, Sr.
He was a 1968

graduate of Sumner Hill High School and went on to earn both his

bachelor's and master's degrees in music, with a concentration in voice

and performance, from Jackson State University.
A product of

Mississippi's rich musical and spiritual traditions, James dedicated

his life to uplifting others through song, mentorship, and education.
Mr. Hawkins was best known as the longtime choral director at Jim

Hill High School in Jackson, where he built one of the most respected

public school choir programs in the country.
Under his leadership, the

Jim Hill Choir earned national and international acclaim, performing at

Carnegie Hall, the Mormon Tabernacle, the White House, and

internationally in Vienna, Italy, Great Britain, and Canada.
His

students sang for presidents, dignitaries, and at major festivals,

consistently earning top honors and recognition.
Beyond his classroom, Mr. Hawkins was a devoted church musician at

Orange Hill and Rose Hill M.B. Churches, where he led choirs and

inspired generations with his spiritual gifts.
He also served as music

director for the General Missionary Baptist State Convention of

Mississippi and was a longtime supporter of youth and music ministries

across the state.
In 2023, he founded the Sumner Hill Alumni Choir--one

of his final gifts to the community he cherished.
He is remembered lovingly by his devoted wife, Barbara Ann Thurman

Hawkins; his cherished grandsons, James Hyche and Jason Butler, his

siblings, extended family, and the countless students, friends, and

church members whose lives he enriched.
His legacy is found in the

voices he trained, the dreams he nurtured, and the faith he lived

daily.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. James Milton Hawkins was a true servant of the

people--a Mississippi treasure whose influence reached far beyond any

stage.
His life was a symphony of purpose, faith, and excellence.
On

behalf of Mississippi's Second Congressional District, I honor his

memory and extend my heartfelt condolences to all who loved him.
