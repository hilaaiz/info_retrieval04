But today that argument, if it has any merit at all, is being

dangerously undermined, and not by our adversaries, but by the very

companies benefiting from the monopolistic protections of the Jones

Act.
Specifically, Jones Act loopholes allow for supposedly minor parts

fabrication and supposedly minor repairs to be conducted in foreign

shipyards using foreign workers with no condition or restriction as to

country.
But these are not minor parts but whole sections, and not

minor repairs but full retrofits.
And the preferred source of this

fabrication and these repairs in the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Jones Act vessels such as the Daniel K. Inouye, Kaimana Hila and

Manukai have undergone major structural conversions, including

liquefied natural gas (LNG) engine retrofits, at PRC-based shipyards

like COSCO's Nantong facility, which has known ties to the Chinese

government and military-industrial complex.
These modifications are

frequently reclassified as mere ``major modifications'' to avoid

triggering the 50 percent U.S. import duty intended to disincentivize

foreign work.
But AIS data, company filings, U.S. Coast Guard

correspondence and even photographs confirm that these are anything but

routine.
This poses a significant and immediate national security concern.
First, by enabling vessels critical to U.S. domestic supply chains to

undergo major upgrades in foreign-controlled shipyards of adversaries,

we introduce unnecessary strategic risk.
These ships support domestic

commerce, but they also arguably constitute the backbone of sealift

capacity that would be required during any military mobilization.
Second, the continued outsourcing of vessel modification and

construction undermines the U.S. shipbuilding and repair base, leaving

us with fewer than 100 Jones Act--compliant vessels in active service

nationwide, many of which are aging or specialized.
And third, it sends

U.S. dollars, jobs and technological investments directly into the

hands of a strategic competitor identified by out National Defense

Strategy as the most significant long-term challenge to U.S. interests.
Nowhere are the consequences of this policy failure more acute or

more strategically dangerous than in my home state of Hawaii.
Located

in the middle of the Indo-Pacific, Hawaii is not just a remote island

economy dependent on maritime commerce.
It is the linchpin of U.S.

power projection and force posture across the Indo-Pacific.
Any

disruption to Hawaii's shipping system is not only an economic risk to

our residents but a direct vulnerability in America's strategic

readiness.
Moreover, while Jones Act supporters continue to claim the law

protects U.S. jobs, the evidence says otherwise.
According to the

Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, maritime employment in the U.S.

shipbuilding and repair sector has declined by 15 percent over the past

23 years.
This steady erosion is not due to foreign competition alone,

but to deliberate business decisions by Jones Act carriers who choose

to take advantage of legal loopholes that let them outsource high-value

work overseas while still reaping the benefits of domestic

protectionism.
Despite these clear defects in the law, Hawaii and other islands and

noncontiguous parts of our country remain a fully captive market, with

no viable alternatives to a Jones Act duopoly that prioritizes profit

over preparedness.
We see no meaningful return on this federal maritime

policy.
The economic burden of this broken system, including inflated

shipping costs driven by duopoly protections and foreign outsourcing,

is borne daily by Hawaii's families and businesses.
We have previously

introduced three separate measures to address these specific

consequences.
The overall answer for our country to this national security risk is

not to force any and all fabrication, repair and operation exclusively

into our country since that just compounds a problem we can't

effectively fix.
It is instead to cease rewarding our adversaries and

start incentivizing our international friends and allies to assist us

with our domestic merchant marine and related defense sealift needs.
Our Merchant Marine Allies Partnership Act addresses these problems

through a targeted, security-conscious realignment of incentives.
