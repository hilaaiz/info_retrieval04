RECOGNIZING FLORIDA'S EIGHTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT VETERANS

HON.
MIKE HARIDOPOLOS

Mr. HARIDOPOLOS.
Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize and honor seven

remarkable Americans whose military service embodies the very best of

our Nation.
Colonel Mark R. Baaden, Colonel John W. Mansur, Sergeant Raymond L.

Burkard, Chief Warrant Officer Thomas W. Thompson, Sergeant Jeff

William Patterson, Specialist Pascuale F. Coniglio, and Sergeant Lloyd

Lasenby each served our country with honor and unwavering commitment.
Though their paths and ranks differed, all shared a common purpose,

to defend our freedoms and protect the values that define the United

States of America.
Their careers reflect decades of sacrifice and discipline.
They

represent the strength and resilience of our Armed Forces and the

patriotism of those who serve out of a deep sense of duty.
Some among them have borne the scars of war.
Others have shaped the

lives of those they led and mentored.
All have left a lasting impact on

their units, their communities, and this country.
It is my distinct privilege to include their names in the Record.
May

their example inspire future generations to serve with the same

courage, integrity, and selflessness.
