As a servant leader, Ms. Pemberton has been at the forefront of several initiatives such as, the City of Dallas' Teen Curfew Ordinance and the Cielo Ranch Apartment Crime Prevention Outreach program.
These programs are just a small part of the expansive work that Ms. Pemberton has produced in the Dallas community.
Ms. Pemberton's faith in the power of community service has led her to work relentlessly across the city of Dallas to reach communities in need and to never back down from doing what's right.
She's won numerous awards from various organizations recognizing her community service--all of which is a testament to her commitment to improving the lives of our neighbors across Dallas and abroad.
In addition to her efforts around community service, Ms. Pemberton has another special gift which includes seeking out the issues that are most pressing our communities and putting action behind them.
From organizing food drives to moderating conversations between members of the community and local police, she always puts herself at the heart of several impactful issues.
In an environment where social justice is needed now more than ever, acknowledging the impact that relationships between local community members and law enforcement have, Ms. Pemberton eased tensions by creating a foundation of communication between the groups.
Equipped with the knowledge, patience and compassion of her community, Ms. Edna Pemberton has continued to enrich the lives of others.
She is an outstanding example of the underappreciated heroes that we have all across our City, State, and Country.
I am confident that because of her impact and service that our communities are a better place. ____________________
