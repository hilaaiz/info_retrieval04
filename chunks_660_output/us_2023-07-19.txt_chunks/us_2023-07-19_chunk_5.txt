Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Christopher Raker who passed away at the age of 78 on July 5, 2023.
Christopher was a longtime resident of Mill Valley and beloved member of the community.
Born in San Francisco to John and Elda Jane Raker, Christopher, nicknamed Chris, lived in the Palace Hotel where his grandfather was a general manager.
The family later moved to Concord, Massachusetts and Chris enrolled at Columbia University before joining the Navy and serving as a lieutenant during the Vietnam War.
After his military service Chris earned a master's degrees in English Literature from the University of Virginia, and a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University.
He settled in Mill Valley, California in 1975.
In 1989, Chris opened Raker Architects in Mill Valley.
The firm contributed to key modernizations in Southern Marin, including the Corinthian Yacht Club, Mill Valley Lumber Yard, and most notably, Mill Valley Miller Avenue Precise Plan, which resulted in the development of a pedestrian-friendly reconfiguration of the prominent and highly trafficked Miller Avenue.
Beyond his architectural profession, Chris made notable contributions to the town as a Planning Commissioner.
After 2 years, he served on the Mill Valley City Council from 1996 to 2007, including as its mayor.
Chris also served as president of the American Institute of Architects San Francisco chapter and board president of the Corinthian Yacht Club.
In his free time, he was active in the performing arts and enjoyed skiing, swimming, and time spent as a soccer coach.
Chris was known by his colleagues on the Planning Commission and City Council for his direct and open-minded approach to difficult issues and great sense of humor.
He was a respected mentor to many.
He is survived by his daughter Bianca Raker, wife Donna Raker, brother Edmond Raker, and 3 nephews.
Mr. Speaker, Christopher Raker was a dedicated public servant and active community member who was committed to improving the quality of life for Mill Valley residents.
I respectfully ask that my colleagues join me in extending condolences to Chris's family and friends and in expressing my appreciation for his decades of good work. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Hempfield Township of Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania on the 250th anniversary of its founding.
Since 1773, Hempfield Township has grown into 1 of the largest municipalities in Pennsylvania.
Currently, it is home to over 40,000 people and is the largest municipality in Westmoreland County.
While Hempfield Township is an important hub for business and industry, the township never forgot its rich agricultural heritage.
Hailing from southeastern Pennsylvania, its early settlers were largely of German descent and worked to refine grain.
