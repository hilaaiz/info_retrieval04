MICHAEL ROBBINS ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. PANETTA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Michael Robbins for his bravery and service as a U.S. merchant mariner during World War II.
Serving from July of 1943 to May of 1946, Mr. Robbins sailed with the U.S. Merchant Marine aboard the SS Olney, the SS Pendleton, the SS O. Henry, and the SS Hoke Smith.
During World War II, nearly 250,000 civilian merchant mariners were activated to serve as part of the U.S. military and to delivered troops and supplies by ship to foreign countries engulfed in the war.
They faced treacherous conditions along their routes.
Between 1939 and 1945, 9,521 U.S. merchant mariners gave their lives--a higher proportion than those killed than in any military branch--in defense of our nation.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt called their mission the most difficult and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken.
Hailing from Atlantic City, New Jersey, Mr. Robbins enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine at only 15 years old.
He began his wartime efforts as an ordinary seaman, chipping away rust and old paint from the ship.
While aboard SS O. Henry and transporting supplies in the Mediterranean Sea, his convoy was attacked by air.
Mr. Robbins, still a teenager, acted to defend his ship by delivering 20mm ammunition to the ship's crew.
Mr. Robbins would go on to serve in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific theaters.
Mr. Robbins received several decorations during his service, including 3 War Zone medals awarded to Merchant Marines for their service in the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean and Middle East.
He also received the World War II Victory Medal for honorable service while on active duty, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon, the Combat Bar, the Honorable Service Button, a Presidential Testimonial Letter, and the Battlin' Pete Patch.
Mr. Robbins and the U.S. merchant mariners of World War II who played crucial roles in the country's war effort were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2020, the highest honor Congress can bestow on civilians.
It was an honor to present the medal to Mr, Robbins then, and it is an honor to recognize him here again today.
Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in honoring and celebrating the dedicated service of Mr. Michael Robbins for his valor and service in defending our country.
May his legacy continue to inspire us for generations to come. ____________________
