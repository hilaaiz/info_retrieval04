Date: 2023-07-19 Volume: 169, Issue: 124 Pages: E695 - E695 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MATTHEW LIPTRAP ON WINNING THE EVELYNE VILLINES NATIONAL AWARD ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Mr. LAMBORN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend an exceptional individual who exemplifies unwavering dedication to supporting our servicemen and servicewomen: Matthew Liptrap.
Recently bestowed with the prestigious 2023 Evelyne Villines Award, Matthew's achievements are truly deserving of recognition.
Evelyne Villines, a champion for meaningful employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, left an indelible mark through her influential work.
From advising politicians to advocating both nationally and globally, she played a crucial role in shaping initiatives like the Americans with Disabilities Act, and her legacy lives on through this award.
It honors individuals who have not only attained employment despite significant disabilities but have also excelled in management roles within AbilityOne contracts.
Considering Matthew's accomplishments, I firmly believe he is a perfect recipient of this esteemed award.
Matthew's journey began with over 10 years of dedicated service in the U.S. Army as an infantryman.
Unfortunately, combat injuries cut short his military career.
Nevertheless, he found a new purpose at Professional Contract Services Incorporated (PCSI), an organization committed to supporting both individuals with disabilities as well as veterans.
At Schriever Space Force Base, working on an AbilityOne Contract, Matthew dedicated himself to serving his brothers and sisters in arms once again.
Starting as a ground's maintenance worker and general clerk, Matthew's determination, willingness to learn, and leadership qualities caught the attention of PCSI, propelling him to the role of Quality Control Manager.
In this capacity, he successfully revamped the Quality and Training programs, resulting in decreased injuries, enhanced safety measures, and flawless internal audit reports.
Matthew's exceptional achievements have set him apart from his peers, serving as an inspiration to both employees and colleagues.
I take great pride in acknowledging Matthew's unwavering commitment to service, both within and beyond his military career.
It brings me great satisfaction to witness his national recognition from SourceAmerica for his outstanding contributions at Schriever through the AbilityOne Program.
His story is a testament to the transformative power of dedication and perseverance, and I am confident that his accomplishments will continue to inspire others to follow in his footsteps.
Matthew Liptrap embodies the caliber of hardworking and talented individuals that make our great nation, and my home state of Colorado, a better place. ____________________
