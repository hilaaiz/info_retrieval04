His first-hand knowledge of the military, its culture, and traditions has been a tremendous benefit to our Congressional offices.
His dogged determination and exceptional coordination enabled the USTRANSCOM Commander to accomplish over 40 office calls with Members and Staff in preparation for her annual posture testimony.
Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Colonel Pitliangas during his time representing the United States Transportation Command on Capitol Hill.
On behalf of our grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the selfless service and sacrifice of Mark, his wife, Eleni, and their children, Stephanos, George, and Nicholas.
I wish them the very best as they continue their journey in our United States Air Force.
They have dedicated their lives to the service of our great Nation.
Aim High . . .
Fly, Fight, and Win. ____________________
