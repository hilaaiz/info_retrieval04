She established a new Evening Lions Club and served as its first President.
She has spent countless hours investing in the lives of the members and youth, teaching leadership, character, and kindness.

Her leadership will have a long-lasting effect on young people for years to come--and it is my honor to award Ellen M. Brooks of Crockett, Texas, a Congressional Veteran Commendation. ____________________

Date: 2023-09-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 153 Pages: E876 - E876 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING SERGEANT FIRST CLASS JERRY LEE LORTON, USA, RETIRED, WITH A CONGRESSIONAL VETERAN COMMENDATION ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. SESSIONS.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to present retired U.S. Army Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, of Cameron, Texas, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His servant's life reflects the hard work and dedication that exemplifies the best of our Central Texas values.
Jerry Lorton entered active duty at Atlanta, Georgia in May of 1977-- a young 20-year-old about to embark on a distinguished Army career that would span the next two decades of his life.
Retired Sergeant Lorton's Army career would take him on 5 overseas tours, including to the Persian Gulf War and 2 tours in Korea.
His dedication was rewarded many times.
Recognized for expert marksmanship with rifle, pistol, and grenade, he earned an Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award), National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service Stars, Master Aircraft Crewman Badge, and an Air Assault Badge.
Since retiring in 1997, Jerry Lorton has been a dedicated servant leader in his community.
For more than a quarter century he has helped protect his neighbors and community as a volunteer firefighter with the Cameron Volunteer Fire Department.
He serves as a Deacon in his faith community, Cameron's Grace Church, where he continues to protect his neighbors as one of a four-person church security team.
He works as a school bus driver for the Cameron Independent School District.
A patriot and a leader, he currently serves as the Commander of Cameron's VFW Post 2010, having long been the kind of member that, in the words of the Texas District 28 Commander, ``exemplifies everything the VFW wants in its leaders.''
I proudly commend Sergeant First Class Jerry Lee Lorton, USA, (Ret,) to his friends, family, and colleagues, and salute his service to the Army and Texas by awarding him a Congressional Veteran Commendation from the 17th Congressional District of Texas. ____________________
