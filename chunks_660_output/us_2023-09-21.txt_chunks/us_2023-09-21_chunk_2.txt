As the 68th president of the CTA, she is only the third woman to hold the position.
In her over 3 decades of involvement in the industry, President Ades has seen enormous progress in her industry.
As she leads the organization, I know she will continue to grow CTA's membership and successfully guide CTA's ``transition to the future.''
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking President Devon Ades for her commitment to the California Trucking Association.
Her tireless service will have a lasting impact on the Central Valley and the Nation for generations to come. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 2023; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
153



Date: 2023-09-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 153 Pages: E876 - E876 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF 2023 ______ of the northern mariana islands in the house of representatives Mr. SABLAN.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Northern Mariana Islands Entrepreneurship Act of 2023, which would extend eligibility for the Small Business Administration's microloan program to the Marianas.
My bill ensures that small businesses in our islands are treated equitably and have access to the same assistance available in other parts of our Nation.
The opportunity for people to find and grow small businesses is the pathway to achieving the American dream.
The SBA's microloan program was created to help everyday Americans do just that--with loans of up to $50,000, small business owners can jumpstart their dreams by investing the micro loan towards inventory, supplies, machinery, equipment, and more.
And when our small businesses thrive, we all stand to benefit.
According to a 2019 report from the SBA, small businesses create two-thirds of net new jobs and drive U.S. innovation and competitiveness.
Yet this opportunity is not available to all Americans.
My home, the Marianas, is the only jurisdiction in the Nation that is ineligible for the microloan program.
My bill ends this inequity and provides a path to entrepreneurship for all small business owners, no matter where they choose to live in the U.S. I thank my colleague, Ms. Radewagen, who joined me in introducing this important bipartisan legislation. ____________________
RECOGNIZING AGEISM AWARENESS DAY; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
153



Date: 2023-09-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 153 Pages: E875 - E875 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING AGEISM AWARENESS DAY ______ of nevada in the house of representatives Ms. TITUS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saturday, October 7th, as Ageism Awareness Day.
Ageism Awareness Day provides us all with an opportunity to recognize the existence and impact of ageism in our country.
We are fortunate to live in a time in which medicine and technology can allow individuals to live long and full lives.
As society begins to grow older, however, too many individuals experience ageism, or stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based on age.
Ageism is the most widespread and socially accepted form of prejudice.
It can be found throughout society, from our workplaces to our health systems to stereotypes broadcast in the media.
Not only is ageism harmful in and of itself, but it also exacerbates many of the other ``isms'', including racism, sexism, and ableism, which compound and worsen mental and physical health outcomes for affected individuals.
I am proud to represent Southern Nevada, a place that has long been a welcoming home to nearly 375,000 seniors.
They enrich our community tremendously, and their value should not be diminished by undue prejudice and discrimination.
Organizations such as Nevada Senior Services provide essential services to individuals across Southern Nevada as they age and ensure that aging is not viewed with fear or hostility.
