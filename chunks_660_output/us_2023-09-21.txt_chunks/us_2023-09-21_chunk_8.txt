The hard work and spirit shown by generations of students and faculty have made Owens an outstanding educational institution.
Originally, Owens Community College was founded in 1965 in Wood County.
The college was name after Michael J. Owens, a Toledo-based inventor of automated glass bottle-making technology.
In 1983 Owens opened their Findlay Campus which occupies more than 60 acres.
With their new campus, Owens was able to expand its coverage and continue to provide education to students from all walks of life.
Currently, Owens's service district includes Lucas, Wood, Hancock, and parts of Ottawa counties.
Owens Community College offers more than 160 programs and certificates to its students who are preparing for a career, retraining for a new career, seeking professional development, or obtaining credits to transfer to a 4-year college or university.
Their dedicated faculty members bring industry knowledge, information, and ideas into the classroom to provide students with a better understanding, how studies will translate into careers.
Outside the classroom, students can experience an enriching campus life through student activities, clubs and organizations, athletics, and volunteer activities.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Owens Community College and its students, faculty, and administration on this remarkable occasion.
By celebrating the 40th anniversary, community members and Ohio residents recognize Owens's contribution to its students and the surrounding communities.
Congratulations to Owens Community College on this significant milestone. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today I recognize Lieutenant Colonel Mark Pitliangas of the United States Air Force for his extraordinary dedication to duty and service to our Nation.
Lieutenant Colonel Pitliangas recently transitioned from his assignment as a Deputy Director of Congressional Affairs for United States Transportation Command to fly the KC-46 Pegasus at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey as Chief of Safety, 305th Air Mobility Wing.
Lt Col Pitliangas is the first member of his family to serve in our U.S. Air Force.
Mark attended the United States Air Force Academy and was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 2008 before attending pilot training.
From there, he went on to fly the mighty C-130 Hercules, otherwise known as the ``Four Fans of Freedom'' and honorably served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a combat pilot over 3 deployments.
Lt Col Pitliangas has held numerous leadership positions in a variety of units, highlighted by serving as the Director of Operations for the 386th Expeditionary Operations Support Squadron in Kuwait.
During that time, he enabled 29,000 airlift and air refueling missions directly supporting Operations INHERENT RESOLVE and FREEDOM'S SENTINEL flown from our busiest airfield in United States Central Command.
In the winter of 2020, Mark was selected to serve as Deputy Director of Congressional Affairs under the United States Transportation Command.
As the primary liaison between Members of Congress, congressional staff, committees, and USTRANSCOM, he provided valuable insight and understanding of transportation policies, actions, operations, and requirements.
His first-hand knowledge of the military, its culture, and traditions has been a tremendous benefit to our Congressional offices.
His dogged determination and exceptional coordination enabled the USTRANSCOM Commander to accomplish over 40 office calls with Members and Staff in preparation for her annual posture testimony.
Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure to work with Lieutenant Colonel Pitliangas during his time representing the United States Transportation Command on Capitol Hill.
