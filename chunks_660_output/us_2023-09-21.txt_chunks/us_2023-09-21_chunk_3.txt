I am proud to represent Southern Nevada, a place that has long been a welcoming home to nearly 375,000 seniors.
They enrich our community tremendously, and their value should not be diminished by undue prejudice and discrimination.
Organizations such as Nevada Senior Services provide essential services to individuals across Southern Nevada as they age and ensure that aging is not viewed with fear or hostility.
Nevada Senior Services not only operates the Adult Day Care Centers of Las Vegas and Henderson, but also Caregiver Support Programs, Respite and Personal Care, RAMP Home Modifications, Hospital 2 Home Assistance, and the Care Partner Institute.
I applaud and support the goals and ideals of Ageism Awareness Day which sheds light on the plight of many individuals and brings the Nation together to promote acceptance and appreciation of the gifts of aging persons.
I thank all the family members, professionals, and volunteers who assist aging individuals every day and help fight the stigma of ageism. ____________________
RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS' LONGEST MARRIED COUPLE; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
153



Date: 2023-09-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 153 Pages: E875 - E875 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS' LONGEST MARRIED COUPLE ______ of arkansas in the house of representatives Mr. WESTERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, many people are familiar with the passage of scripture found in First Corinthians Chapter 13, verse 4, ``Love is patient, love is kind.
It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.''
However, fewer may remember verse 5 which states that love ``always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.''
When the apostle Paul was inspired to write these words so many years ago, I believe he had persevering and loving couples like Cleovis and Arwilda Whiteside in mind.
Since 2019, the Whitesides have been recognized as Arkansas' ``Longest Married Couple.''
This Sunday, September 24, 2023, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, they are being recognized for their 84th year of marriage.
On what I am sure was a hot and humid Monday, July 24, 1939, 17-year- old Cleovis and 13-year-old Arwilda made a lifetime commitment to God and each other that has endured the test of time.
The next year, Mrs. Whiteside delivered the first of their 12 children.
In an interview last year, Mr. Whiteside, who was 100 at the time, stated, ``We've been together all this long time and I still love my wife.
She still loves me, and we still get along just as good.''
Mrs. Whiteside added, ``I ran to him since I was nine years old and I've run first to God, then him ever since.''
We find within these 2 statements the foundation of a strong, Christ-centered marriage that inspires me and countless people, in Pine Bluff, Jefferson County, and the entire state of Arkansas.
At the end of the 13th chapter of Corinthians, Paul tells us that when all is complete, 3 things remain: ``faith, hope, and love.
But the greatest of these is love.''
I offer my most sincere congratulations to Mr. Cleovis and Mrs. Arwilda Whiteside on their 84 years of marriage.
I thank them for exemplifying the greatest gift of persevering love. ____________________
