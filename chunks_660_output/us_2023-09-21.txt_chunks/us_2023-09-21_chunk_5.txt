Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dorsey O'Neal Walker, a Texan who valiantly served our Nation during some of the darkest hours of WWII.
Dorsey grew up in Ora, a small Angelina County community, graduating in 1942 from Huntington High School.
Drafted during WWII, he joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1944.
Assigned to the Fourth Marine Division in Maui, Hawaii, as Company Clerk because he could type, Dorsey would soon deploy with the Fourth Marines in 3 major Pacific war battles: Saipan, Tinian, and Iwo Jima.
When returned to Maui from Saipan for replacements, he was 1 of only 12 among 200 in his company not killed or wounded.
Then Corporal Walker's first Reserve separation from the Corps occurred in December 1945; his final Reserve separation occurred in 1948.
Dorsey and his wife Habie have been married for 77 years.
Commendation Citations received from his Commanding General illuminate Dorsey's valor: ``For excellent performance of duties in connection with operations against the enemy on Saipan and Tinian, Marianas Islands from 15 June to 1 August 1944.
Private First Class Walker diligently performed every assigned duty.
His willingness to give battle, and his indifference to the hardships which he encountered throughout operation, evoked the admiration of his officers and the men serving with him.
His unselfish devotion to the task at hand was a material contribution to the early and complete victory over the enemy.
His conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.''
``For excellent service in the line of duties as a Radio Operator with a rifle company in combat with the enemy on Iwo Jima, Volcano Islands, from 19 February to 16 March 1945.
Corporal Walker skillfully carried out his assigned duties under the most hazardous combat conditions.
Frequently, on reconnaissances with his company commander or at a forward observation post, he unhesitantly exposed himself to enemy mortar and small arms fire to carry out his duties successfully, and by his extraordinary resourcefulness and efficiency, he rendered invaluable aid to his company.
His conduct throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.''
It is my distinct honor to recognize Dorsey O'Neal Walker, a Texan, an American, and a ``True Patriot,'' as one of the oldest living survivors of the Battle of Iwo Jima.
