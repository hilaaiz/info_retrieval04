He quickly took on more roles within the union, holding positions of Financial Secretary, District Committee-person, Bargaining Committee-person, and Vice President of the Parts Depot Unit.
From 1997 he served as the Second and First Vice President of Local 600 before being elected President in 2009.
His leadership over the last 15 years has earned him the respect of not only local leaders but national leaders as well.
UAW VP Chuck Browning said about Bernie ``He's unselfish, He's humble.
And he's a really powerful presence in our union.''
Rory Gamble, the former president of the UAW, said ``Bernie's leadership legacy will fare well over the years as historians look back at his impact on the UAW and Ford.
He was steady, fair, and successful for members in the worst of times.
If the measure of a man is the dignity he brings to others, he will always be a giant in our union.''
Bernie and I got to know each other through the many community projects that he has dedicated himself to.
Outside of his work with the UAW, Bernie and his wife, Sue, are pillars of the Detroit community.
Together they run the Bernie Ricke Charity Fund out of Trenton, MI.
Bernie is a lifetime member of the NAACP, member of the Labor Advisory Board for Health Alliance Plan, and serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors for Bridging Communities Incorporated.
Bridging Communities is a non-profit organization that serves the community of Southwest Detroit by providing a variety of services to the homebound elderly including meals on wheels, minor home repairs, transportation for doctors' appointments and medical care.
In 1999 and again in 2004, Bernie was given the ``Spirit of Detroit'' award by the Detroit City Council.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bernie Ricke for all that he has

done for the people of Southeastern Michigan.
Together we have been through the thick and thin of life, surviving the tough times by breaking bread at his famous garage parties.
We wish him all best in retirement, though we know he will still be working hard to support the UAW and his Detroit community in whatever ways he can.
I thank Bernie. ____________________
RECOGNIZING BORICUA COLLEGE; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
86



Date: 2024-05-17 Volume: 170, Issue: 86 Pages: E523 - E523 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BORICUA COLLEGE ______ of new york in the house of representatives Ms. VELAZQUEZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Boricua College on the special occasion of its 50th aniversary and in appreciation for decades of higher education.
Boricua College was the first private, not-for-profit post-secondary educational institution established in the United States specifically designed to meet the academic needs of Puerto Ricans and other Spanish-speaking people.
Today, it is a diverse institution for learning and professional development.
Boricua College inspired educated and passionate advocates for the Puerto Rican Disapora during the 1960's and 70's in New York City.
Visionaries like Dr. Antonia Pantoja, founder of Universidad Boricua and the precursor of Boricua College, founded by Dr. Victor Alicea, believed that higher education and cultural pride were crucial to addressing poverty and creating economic empowerment.
The significant migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City warranted a grassroots response to navigate the socio-economic opportunities and challenges of plantando bandera in a new environment.
Thus, Boricua College was created and became a beacon of hope for the Latino community in Brooklyn.
Since its founding in 1974, Boricua College has grown from its humble beginnings on a single-floor storefront in Williamsburg to a multi- campus institution spanning Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx.
The first Boricua College class had just 26 students.
When it opened its doors, it broke all barriers to higher learning with a cadre of Puerto Rican bilingual professionals in New York City.
