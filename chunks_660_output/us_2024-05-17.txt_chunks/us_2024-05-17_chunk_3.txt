Since its founding in 1974, Boricua College has grown from its humble beginnings on a single-floor storefront in Williamsburg to a multi- campus institution spanning Brooklyn, Manhattan, and the Bronx.
The first Boricua College class had just 26 students.
When it opened its doors, it broke all barriers to higher learning with a cadre of Puerto Rican bilingual professionals in New York City.
Today, Boricua College has an enrollment of thousands of students pursuing an Associate, Bachelor or Master's degree in the field of Human Services, Business, Liberal Arts, Childhood Education and inter-American Studies to list a few.
It is also a designated Hispanic Serving Institution by the U.S. Department of Education.
The growth of Boricua College exemplifies the growth of Latinos' economic and political empowerment across the country.
The college may not have millions in endowments, if at all.
However, it does have an unwavering commitment to educational advancement.
By 2060, nearly 1 in 4 Americans are likely to be Latinos'.
Thanks to vital institutions like Boricua College, we are making even greater contributions in every sector of society--education, politics, business, the arts, and sciences.
This fine institution is as successful as the administration and leadership.
Therefore, I would also like to salute Founder and President Dr. Victor G. Alicea for a lifetime of public service, Board of Trustees Chair Benito R. Fernandez, the deans, faculty, staff, and graduates.
Mr. Speaker, please join us in recognizing Boricua College on the occasion of its 50th anniversary and offering our best wishes for another 50 years of serving the community. ____________________
