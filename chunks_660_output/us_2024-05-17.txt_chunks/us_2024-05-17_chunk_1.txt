Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Shiloh Baptist Church Old Site on 170 years of service to the community.
This remarkable milestone is a testament to the thousands of congregants who, through their unwavering faith and love for their neighbors, have helped build a legacy of service at the church.
For 170 years, Shiloh Old Site has been an advocate for justice, equality, and perseverance.
Throughout the years, this community has been a catalyst in halting the spread of racial injustice in the city of Fredericksburg and has worked tirelessly to provide supplemental education to Black residents to offset the shortfalls of a racially segregated educational system.
Through its ministries and its purpose- driven youth mission, the church works to provide families and children with programming that nurtures a community service mindset.
Shiloh Old Site is a pillar of the Fredericksburg community--always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need.
The community's commitment to Fredericksburg and its residents is both inspiring and humbling.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating and thanking Shiloh Baptist Church Old Site on 170 years of dedicated service to the Fredericksburg community.
I look forward to celebrating their continued success and contributions to Virginia in years to come. ____________________

Date: 2024-05-17 Volume: 170, Issue: 86 Pages: E524 - E524 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BERNIE RICKE'S LEADERSHIP OF UAW LOCAL 600 IN DEARBORN, MICHIGAN ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bernie Ricke, President of UAW Local 600 in Dearborn, Michigan, on the occasion of his retirement.
His dedication to the UAW over the last 51 years, and his leadership of Local 600 for the past 15 years, is worthy of commendation.
UAW Local 600 currently has over 30,000 active and retired members, representing a diverse membership from the Ford Rouge Complex, AK Steel, truck drivers, independent part suppliers, as well as healthcare and technical office professionals.
They currently have over 47 autonomous bargaining units throughout Southeastern Michigan.
Bernie was born into the auto industry as the son of an engineer who worked at Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.
At the age of 18, Bernie took a job in a Ford warehouse and shortly thereafter joined the UAW as a member of Local 600 in November of 1973.
He quickly took on more roles within the union, holding positions of Financial Secretary, District Committee-person, Bargaining Committee-person, and Vice President of the Parts Depot Unit.
From 1997 he served as the Second and First Vice President of Local 600 before being elected President in 2009.
His leadership over the last 15 years has earned him the respect of not only local leaders but national leaders as well.
