Ms. Ahmann was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and later moved with her

family to Long Beach, California.
She attended Long Beach State

College, graduating in 1966, a year after marrying her husband, John.
Judy began her professional career at IBM, but her passion for the land

soon led her and John to purchase their first 12 acres in California.
After a brief relocation to New Jersey for work, they returned to

California in 1970 and settled in our Napa County, where they purchased

300 acres and began raising cattle.
In 1986, they acquired more than

3,000 acres along Lake Berryessa, establishing Running Deer Ranch.
With

no prior ranching experience, the Ahmanns turned to the Napa County

Farm Bureau and local Cattlewomen's and Cattlemen's Associations for

guidance so they could raise their three daughters, Christina, Anna,

and Erica, in the ranching tradition.
Ms. Ahmann's commitment to our agricultural community is clear from

her extensive advocacy work.
She became a long-standing member and

leader in California CattleWomen, serving as president at both the

local and state levels, including as state president in 2007 and 2008.
She later joined the Executive Board of American National CattleWomen,

where her leadership earned her recognition as National CattleWoman of

the Year in 2014.
In 2010, Judy was selected as a member of Common

Threads California, which honors women for their volunteer leadership

and contributions to agriculture.
Judy has rightfully been recognized for her advocacy at the national

level.
In 2013, she testified before the House Natural Resources

Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation in support of

the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act.
Her

testimony focused on the need to balance conservation efforts with the

preservation of working ranchlands and grazing operations for future

generations.
Ms. Ahmann's dedication to agriculture extends to supporting the next

generation of farmers and ranchers.
She and her family have been

generous supporters of youth in agriculture, donating time and raising

funds for scholarships benefiting local 4-H and Future Farmers of

America students.
She has been a steadfast supporter of the Napa County

Farm Bureau, actively promoting agricultural policy, education, and

community engagement.
In 2010, Judy and John placed a conservation

easement on 1,275 acres of Running Deer Ranch through the California

Rangeland Trust, permanently protecting the ranch as a working

landscape while preserving its vital wildlife habitat.
They also

granted a trail easement to open public access to 9,100 acres of Bureau

of Land Management land that had been landlocked for more than 150

years.
Judy remains deeply involved in ranching alongside her daughters and

their families, who now operate Running Deer Ranch.
Despite the

devastation caused by wildfires in 2018 and 2020, the Ahmann family has

continued to rebuild, demonstrating resilience and an unwavering

commitment to sustainable ranching and responsible land management.
Mr. Speaker, we thank Judy Ahmann for her decades of leadership in

the cattle industry, dedication to agricultural education and advocacy,

and commitment to supporting the next generation of farmers.
Therefore,

it is fitting and proper that we honor her here today as the Napa

County Farm Bureau's 2025 Member of the Year.
