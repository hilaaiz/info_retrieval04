HONORING MIRIAM WONG AS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S 8TH CONGRESSIONAL

DISTRICT'S WOMEN OF THE YEAR

_____

HON.
JOHN GARAMENDI

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor

Miriam Wong as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women

of the Year.
Ms. Wong is the founder and Executive Director of The

Latina Center, a Richmond-based nonprofit organization she established

in 1999 to empower and support Latina women across the San Francisco

Bay Area.
For more than two decades, she has dedicated her life to

advancing leadership, healing, and opportunity within the Latino

community.
Under her leadership The Latina Center has become a trusted

community institution devoted to improving the physical, mental, and

spiritual health of Latina women and their families.
In 2000, she

founded Women, Health, and Leadership, a one-year leadership and

community service program that began humbly in her own living room.
What started as small gatherings to build peer support among Latina

women has since grown into a transformative program that has graduated

more than 420 women as Peer Leaders.
The Latina Center's impact extends

far beyond leadership training.
Its programs provide parenting classes,

mental health support, and resources for survivors of domestic

violence, while also offering small business training and access to

microloans to promote self-sufficiency.
Graduates of The Latina

Center's programs now serve as staff, volunteers, and board members,

continuing the cycle of mentorship and empowerment that fulfills Ms.

Wong's vision of community-led change.
Ms. Wong's leadership is defined

by empathy, inclusion, and cultural pride.
On behalf of the people of

California's 8th Congressional District, I am honored to recognize

Miriam Wong for her extraordinary leadership and her decades of service

to Latina women and families throughout the Bay Area.

DISTRICT'S WOMEN OF THE YEAR

HON.
JOHN GARAMENDI

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the

contributions of Rebecca Grasty as she is honored as one of

California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
With over

15 years as a Family Child Care Professional, Rebecca Grasty has

devoted her life to strengthening the early childhood education

landscape in California.
A credentialed educator in both Social Science

and Family & Consumer Sciences, she is a leader whose influence extends

far beyond the classroom.
She currently serves as Vice President of the

Bay Area Professional Family Child Care Network and was recently

elected Chapter President for the California Association for the

Education of Young Children.
Rebecca's commitment to professional

development and peer support is clear in her work revitalizing the

Solano Association of Providers.
Recognizing the isolating nature of

the Family Child Care profession, she brought together providers from

across Solano County for a leadership meeting to reignite collaboration

and build a stronger sense of community.
She has presented on financial

literacy for providers at Solano Family & Children's Services, is a

featured speaker at the 2025 Solano ECE Conference, and founded Save

California Family Child Care, a grassroots initiative advocating for

developmentally appropriate changes to state policy.
She was also

instrumental in organizing the ``A Day Without Child Care'' Advocacy

Loop in Solano County, collaborating with the Children's Network, Napa

providers, and the NorCal Family Child Care Alliance to highlight the

urgent need for childcare reform.
She also served on the organizing

committee of the May 2025 Family Child Care Symposium and led planning

for the upcoming ``State of the Bay'' Summit to bring together

stakeholders from all nine Bay Area counties to advocate for children,

families, and the providers who serve them.
Her tireless efforts have

uplifted families, empowered fellow professionals, and shaped policy

conversations that will benefit generations to come.
