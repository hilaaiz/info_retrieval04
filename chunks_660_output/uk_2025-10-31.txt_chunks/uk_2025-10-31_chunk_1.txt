CELEBRATING DIPESH AND DIPTI PANDYA'S 30TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

_____

HON.
BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor two

of my remarkable constituents of Pennsylvania's 1st Congressional

District, Dipesh and Dipti Pandya, as they celebrate their 30th wedding

anniversary.
On this joyous occasion, we celebrate not only thirty years of

marriage, but thirty years of partnership, commitment, and steadfast

love.
Dipesh and Dipti's marriage is a profound example of what it

means to build a life rooted

in respect, compassion, and shared purpose.
Over three decades, they

faced challenges with grace, celebrated triumphs with gratitude, and

walked side-by-side through every season of life.
Dipesh and Dipti are the embodiment of the American story.
They are

dedicated parents, faithful friends, and generous members of our

community.
Their unwavering work ethic and perseverance reflect values

that have strengthened both their family and those around them.
Through

their kindness, hospitality, and warmth of spirit, they have touched

countless lives.
Together they have built a home filled with love, laughter, and

understanding.
Their marriage stands as a testament to the enduring

power of devotion, communication, and, above all, unconditional love.
They are living proof that the most meaningful legacy we leave is not

measured in material achievements, but in the love we share and the

lives we uplift.
As they celebrate this incredible milestone surrounded by family,

friends, and loved ones, we honor their commitment to one another and

to the values that make our community strong.
May the next chapter of

their journey be blessed with continued health, happiness, and

cherished memories.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States House of Representatives

and the people of Pennsylvania's 1st District, I extend my warmest

congratulations to Dipesh and Dipti Pandya on their 30th wedding

anniversary.
May their love continue to inspire all of us.

CELEBRATING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COURTNEY FRY

_____

HON.
SHARICE DAVIDS

Mr. DAVIDS of Kansas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the

public service of Courtney Fry, who is departing Capitol Hill after

almost 19 years with the House of Representatives.
Ms. Fry's tenure began in 2007 when she started working as a staff

assistant in the office of then-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.
Her

competence, hard work, and dedication led to a 16-year career in that

office, where she worked her way up to Director of Legislative

Operations.
She then continued her service with the office of House Democratic

Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar, where she has worked for almost three

years as Director of Member Services.
In this capacity, she has been a

tireless servant to all members of the House Democratic Caucus,

providing advice, guidance, and resources.
Ms. Fry has not only been an

invaluable partner to my office and my staff--she also became a friend.
I thank Ms. Fry for her countless contributions to the Caucus.
She

will certainly be missed here on Capitol Hill, and I wish her great

success as she moves on to the next chapter of her career.

HONORING GRACE EPISCOPAL CHURCH

_____

HON.
MIKE THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Grace

Episcopal Church for the organization's 150 years of dedicated service

and commitment to the people of our community.
Grace Episcopal Church was founded in 1875 in St. Helena and remains

the oldest stone church in Napa County.
Episcopal worship in St. Helena

began in 1871, when a small group of parishioners gathered as a

fledgling congregation.
Their efforts culminated on December 12, 1875,

when Bishop A.W.D. Wingfield consecrated the newly built church and

confirmed fourteen founding members.
