HONORING SARATOGA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY KAREN HEGGEN

_____

HON.
ELISE M. STEFANIK

Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Saratoga County

District Attorney Karen Heggen for her decades of service, leadership,

and commitment to justice in her home community.
A Malta native, DA Karen Heggen has served in the Saratoga County

District Attorney's Office since 1993, beginning her career as an

Assistant District Attorney and advancing through the ranks to the

office's second-highest position before being elected District Attorney

in 2014.
Over more than thirty years, she has dedicated herself to

protecting the people of Saratoga County with professionalism,

compassion, and integrity.
As the first woman ever elected District Attorney in Saratoga County,

Karen made history while setting a standard of excellence that inspired

those who followed.
Her tenure as DA was marked by both achievement and

resilience during a time of significant change in New York's criminal

justice system.
Under her leadership, the office maintained one of the

state's strongest records for case integrity and public trust despite

the challenges of bail reform, discovery reform, and parole reform.
Her

steady hand ensured that Saratoga County avoided the disruptions that

plagued many other jurisdictions.
Throughout her career, Karen focused not on politics or recognition,

but on people.
She emphasized teamwork, collaboration, and justice

rooted in fairness.
Her approach reflected her belief that a district

attorney's role is not merely to prosecute, but to pursue what is

right--to balance the interests of victims, public safety, and the

accused.
Her leadership earned deep respect from law enforcement,

attorneys, and community members alike.
Karen leaves behind a legacy of fairness, compassion, and leadership

that will continue to shape the Saratoga County District Attorney's

Office for years to come.
Karen now looks forward to spending more time

with her family, who have supported her through long nights and

demanding years.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to

recognize District Attorney Karen Heggen for her trailblazing career,

her lifelong service to the people of Saratoga County, and the example

she has set for future generations of public servants.
