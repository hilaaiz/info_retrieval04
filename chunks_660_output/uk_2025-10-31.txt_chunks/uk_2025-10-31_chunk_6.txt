She was also

instrumental in organizing the ``A Day Without Child Care'' Advocacy

Loop in Solano County, collaborating with the Children's Network, Napa

providers, and the NorCal Family Child Care Alliance to highlight the

urgent need for childcare reform.
She also served on the organizing

committee of the May 2025 Family Child Care Symposium and led planning

for the upcoming ``State of the Bay'' Summit to bring together

stakeholders from all nine Bay Area counties to advocate for children,

families, and the providers who serve them.
Her tireless efforts have

uplifted families, empowered fellow professionals, and shaped policy

conversations that will benefit generations to come.
On behalf of the

people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to

honor and recognize Rebecca Grasty for her invaluable contributions to

our community.

DISTRICT'S WOMEN OF THE YEAR

HON.
JOHN GARAMENDI

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Regina Whitney

as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's

Women of the Year for her extraordinary public service and mentorship,

for more than four decades she has advanced justice, equity, and

opportunity for countless Californians.
Regina began her professional

journey as a legal secretary in family law, where for over a decade she

supported attorneys and families facing some of life's most challenging

circumstances.
Her compassion and meticulous attention to detail

reflected her belief that every person deserves dignity and fairness

under the law.
Building upon that foundation, Regina devoted more than

20 years to the California State Attorney General's Office, where she

served with distinction in the Department of Justice.
Her work

supported major legal operations that safeguarded the rights of

Californians and strengthened public trust in government.
During this

time, she helped organize Blacks in Government, a national network

advocating for equity in public service.
Regina's leadership within the

organization opened pathways for advancement, mentoring, and

professional development for countless Black employees across state

agencies.
Today, Regina continues her advocacy with SEIU Local 1000,

one of California's largest and most influential public-sector unions.
In her role as a leader in labor relations and organizing, she has

fought tirelessly for fair contracts, safe workplaces, and respect for

public employees.
Her work has secured tangible gains in wages,

benefits, and working conditions, improving the lives of thousands of

workers and their families across the state.
Beyond her professional

achievements, Regina has spent decades serving her community through

volunteerism and mentorship.
She has long been involved with Battered

Women's Alternatives, providing shelter and support for survivors of

domestic violence; serves as Secretary of the Richmond Commission on

Aging, advocating for seniors' health and dignity; and contributes her

energy to the NAACP Richmond Branch, promoting civil rights and

community empowerment.
She has also led women's mentoring programs for

many years, teaching self-confidence, etiquette, and leadership to

young women entering adulthood.
Through her compassion,

professionalism, and leadership, she has demonstrated that true service

is measured not by recognition, but by the lives uplifted and the

opportunities created for others.
Her impact on California's public

institutions and her enduring mentorship of others represent the

highest ideals of civic leadership and public service.
On behalf of the

people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to

honor and recognize Regina Whitney for her invaluable contributions to

our community.
