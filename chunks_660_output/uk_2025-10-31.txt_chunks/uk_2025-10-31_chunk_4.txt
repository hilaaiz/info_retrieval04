Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the

contributions of Marie Carayanis as she is honored as one of

California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year for her

decades of outstanding service and commitment to her community.
In

1970, together with her husband, Marie opened Nick & Marie's

Delicatessen and Catering, a cornerstone of downtown El Sobrante for 30

years.
Through her work as a small business owner, she became a

dedicated advocate for the needs of local businesses and an active

leader in the community.
Marie has served on the El Sobrante Chamber of

Commerce Board since 1968, holding the office of President in 1984 to

1985, 2003 to 2004, and again from 2014 to 2016.
She currently serves

as Membership Chairperson.
She was also one of the founders of the El

Sobrante Stroll, the community's signature festival, and continues to

serve as Director of Vendor Booths for this beloved annual event.
Her

commitment to civic life extends far beyond business.
Marie has served

for many years on the board of the Boys & Girls Club of El Sobrante,

including as President and Director of the Volunteer Program.
She has

also been active in the American Business Women's Association and the

Soroptimists, working to advance opportunities for women and strengthen

community service.
While Marie's priorities have always centered on her

family, including her three daughters and grandchildren, she has never

wavered in her dedication to her friends, neighbors, and the well-being

of the El Sobrante Valley community.
On behalf of the people of

California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to honor and

recognize Marie Carayanis for her invaluable contributions to our

community.

Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the

contributions of Melissa Nickson as she is honored as one of

California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year for her

exceptional leadership, compassion, and unwavering commitment to

survivors of violence across Solano County.
Her dedication to trauma-

informed advocacy and her tireless pursuit of justice have profoundly

strengthened our community.
Under her direction, Napa Solano SANE-

SART's advocacy and case management programs have expanded to provide

comprehensive, survivor-centered care for thousands affected by sexual

assault, domestic violence, and human trafficking.
She has built an

organization grounded in compassion and respect, ensuring that every

survivor is met with dignity and the support needed to rebuild their

life.
One of Melissa's most significant contributions has been her

leadership in the regional response to human trafficking.
She has

spearheaded collaborations with local law enforcement, county task

forces, and community partners to create a coordinated and effective

safety net for trafficking survivors.
Her efforts have led to the

development of a 24/7 human trafficking crisis line, the expansion of

emergency housing options, and the implementation of long-term recovery

pathways that address both immediate and systemic barriers to healing.
Melissa has also been a tireless advocate and educator.
She engages in

civic organizations, professional groups, and schools to raise

awareness about exploitation, victim rights, and prevention.
Her

outreach to youth is particularly impactful and through school

presentations and youth programs, she has equipped young people with

the knowledge and confidence to recognize and resist the signs of

trafficking and abuse.
Survivors and colleagues alike describe Melissa

as a beacon of hope and a steady, empathetic presence in moments of

crisis.
Her courage, compassion, and tireless advocacy for survivors

have restored lives and fostered community resilience.
On behalf of the

people of California's 8th Congressional District, it is my pleasure to

honor and recognize Melissa Nickson for her invaluable contributions to

our community.
