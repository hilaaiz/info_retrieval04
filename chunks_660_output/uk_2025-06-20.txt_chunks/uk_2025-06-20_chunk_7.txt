INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA LOCAL JUROR NON-DISCRIMINATION

ACT OF 2025

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the District of Columbia

Local Juror Non-Discrimination Act of 2025.
This bill would clarify

that D.C. residents may not be excluded or disqualified from jury

service in the local D.C. trial court, the D.C. Superior Court, based

on sexual orientation or gender identity.
Specifically, this bill would

clarify that the term ``sex,'' which is a protected class under the

non-discrimination law that applies to jurors in the D.C. Superior

Court, includes sexual orientation and gender identity.
The term

``sex'' would also include a sex stereotype; pregnancy, childbirth or

related medical condition; and sex characteristics, including intersex

traits.
In the 117th Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and

Reform passed a version of this bill.
D.C. has one of the strongest non-discrimination laws in the country,

including protecting individuals based on sexual orientation and gender

identity.
However, under the D.C. Home Rule Act, the D.C. Council does

not have the authority to amend title 11 of the D.C. Code, which

contains the non-discrimination provisions that apply to jurors in the

D.C. Superior Court.
Therefore, until D.C. is given authority to amend

title 11 of the D.C. Code, which one of my bills would do, an act of

Congress is required to clarify that LGBTQ+ jurors in the D.C. Superior

Court are protected from discrimination.
As the Supreme Court said in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company,

``discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to

the fairness of the proceedings conducted there. . . . [
B]ias mars the

integrity of the judicial system and prevents the idea of democratic

government from becoming a reality.''
