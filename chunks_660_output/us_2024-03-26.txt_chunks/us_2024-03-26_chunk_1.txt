Throughout his career, John has been instrumental in shaping vital water policy in our state, forging increased collaboration between a variety of California water agencies, working to protect the East Bay's water supply, and guiding the agency through multiple state-wide droughts.
John was first elected to EBMUD's board in 1990 representing the communities of Alamo, Lafayette, Walnut Creek, Danville, Pleasant Hill, and San Ramon.
John played a key role in the founding of the Freeport Regional Water Authority (FRWA), an agency tasked with guiding the financing, ownership, construction, and operations of the Freeport Regional Water Project.
John is also the longest-serving board member in EBMUD's history.
Prior to his work with EBMUD, John served as President of the Association of California Water Agencies (ACWA) and the California Association of Sanitation Agencies (CASA).
He also was President of the Lafayette Chamber Board and spearheaded the creation of the annual Lafayette Reservoir Run for Education.
John has been a strong supporter of youth in our community, having served as Scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 243 in Lafayette for more than 20 years and later going on to serve as an Eagle Advisor.
We are grateful for John's continued dedication to our community and wish him luck at his new post in the Calaveras County Water District.

Date: 2024-03-26 Volume: 170, Issue: 52 Pages: E287 - E287 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PASSPORT SYSTEM REFORM AND BACKLOG PREVENTION ACT ______ speech of of california in the house of representatives Mr. ISSA.
Mr. Speaker, I would like to include in the Record a letter which my lead Democratic cosponsor, Mr. Costa, and I received from the U.S. Travel Association expressing the support of the travel industry for the passage of the Passport System Reform and Backlog Prevention Act: March 18, 2024.
Hon.
Darrell Issa, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Hon.
Jim Costa, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
Dear Representatives Issa and Costa: On behalf of the U.S. Travel Association (U.S. Travel), which represents all segments of America's travel industry, I am writing to express our strong support for H.R. 6610, the Passport System Reform and Backlog Prevention Act, which is a bipartisan measure that calls for the modernization of the State Department's passport processing capabilities.
H.R. 6610 provides a much-needed framework for meeting the Department's commitment to improve efficiency, security, and customer experience within the passport application process.
As you know, America's travel industry plays a vital role in our Nation's economy, contributing significantly to revenue generation and job creation across all 50 states and territories.
U.S. Travel's mission is to increase travel to and within the United States, and H.R. 6610 aligns with that mission.
As the travel sector continues to recover from the pandemic, there is an urgent need to modernize that travel experience, improve travel IT infrastructure, and position the Department to meet increased demand for passports.
In 2022 and 2023, the Department received a record-breaking number of passport applications driven by the surge in U.S. traveler demand for international trips, thereby causing a massive and persistent backlog in average processing times.
