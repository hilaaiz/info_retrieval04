U.S. Travel's mission is to increase travel to and within the United States, and H.R. 6610 aligns with that mission.
As the travel sector continues to recover from the pandemic, there is an urgent need to modernize that travel experience, improve travel IT infrastructure, and position the Department to meet increased demand for passports.
In 2022 and 2023, the Department received a record-breaking number of passport applications driven by the surge in U.S. traveler demand for international trips, thereby causing a massive and persistent backlog in average processing times.
While there has been modest improvement in passport processing times since last summer, more needs to be done to bring about sustained progress.
Significant improvements in both passport and visa processing times can be readily achieved through the long-overdue modernization of the Bureau of Consular Affairs' outdated IT systems.
The legacy systems relied upon by Consular Affairs have significantly hindered the agency's ability to keep pace with demand and disrupted the travel experiences of millions of Americans each year.
Accordingly, the modernization of IT infrastructure should be treated as a critical priority for delivering streamlined customer experience for passport and visa applicants, while ensuring the accuracy and security of those functions.
This modernization initiative also aligns with broader efforts to promote international travel and strengthen diplomatic relations.
As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential for the United States to maintain a robust and efficient passport system that facilitates the movement of people and fosters a travel sector that drives economic growth and job creation.
The U.S. Travel Association commends your bipartisan leadership in introducing H.R. 6610 and looks forward to working alongside you to advocate for its passage.
Sincerely,

Tori Emerson Barnes, Executive Vice President, Public Affairs and Policy. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, having been born and raised in Vallejo, California and graduating from California State University, East Bay, Cheryl is a true Bay Area native.
With a focus on the local news impacting my constituents most, Cheryl covered a wide range of stories, from community events to breaking news.
Her reporting showcased her dedication to providing accurate and impactful journalism to her viewers.
Her love for covering breaking news was known to anyone who crossed her path.
Cheryl was the first to report about the BALCO steroid scandal that rocked the sports world.
By shedding a light on the banned performance-enhancing substances, Cheryl was able to hold corporations accountable and protect the integrity of our athletics.
I truly admire the tenacity she showed to always follow through on her stories.
Like many journalists in California, Cheryl was tasked with covering natural disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes that devastated entire communities.
I'm thankful for the compassion she showed to the victims of those events as well as her work to raise awareness of the increasing risks posed by disasters including the flooding, wildfires, heatwaves, and drought Californians now face every year.
Over her 20-year legacy, Cheryl was honored with an award from the Bay Area Black Journalist Association and four Emmy awards presented by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences San Francisco.
I'm so proud that her years of experience and commitment were met with accolades and applause.
Aside from her time in broadcast, Cheryl is also one of the founding members of Friends of Faith, a non-profit organization founded 1987, that raises money for women diagnosed with breast cancer in the East Bay.
After realizing the financial hardships that East Bay cancer patients are burdened with, Cheryl, along with her peers, began fundraising to provide stipends for women in need of financial assistance during their treatment journey.
