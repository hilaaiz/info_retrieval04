MICKEY WILSON

HON.
BRITTANY PETTERSEN

Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mickey Wilson

of Golden, Colorado, for receiving a Carnegie Medal after saving his

friend's life in a daring act of heroism.
In January 2017, Mr. Wilson, a professional slackliner, was skiing in

Dillon, Colorado, when a friend and fellow skier got caught leaving a

ski lift.
The skier was left dangling unconscious from the lift, out of

reach from help.
Mr. Wilson realized the gravity of the situation and

selflessly sprung into action.
Despite danger warnings, he climbed the

chairlift pole and traversed 30 feet along the lift's two-inch cable to

reach the chair.
He then swung down onto the chair and, after catching

a knife thrown by a rescue crew member, cut his friend free.
The skier

fully recovered with only a broken rib, while Mr. Wilson was uninjured.
Mr. Wilson's slacklining experience proved life-saving that day.
The Carnegie Medal is given to people who risk their own safety in an

attempt to save the lives of others.
There is no doubt that Mr. Wilson

is incredibly deserving of this award and it is an honor to

congratulate him on this life-saving act of bravery.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ELBERON FIRST AID & EMERGENCY SQUAD

HON.
FRANK PALLONE, JR.
Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Elberon First

Aid & Emergency Squad on its 75th anniversary.
The all-volunteer agency

continues to provide exemplary service to residents and its work is

truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Incorporated in 1948, Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad is a 501c4

that does not bill for its services.
Though the squad is responsible

for financing most of its operations, including its medical supplies,

equipment, and vehicles, it receives a small stipend through the city

and is also supported by the community through donations and

fundraisers.
Responding to over 600 calls a year, Elberon First Aid & Emergency

Squad serves the residents of the Elberon section of Long Branch, but

also provides backup for the entire city of Long Branch, West Long

Branch, Deal, Allenhurst, Eatontown, Oceanport, Monmouth Beach, and Sea

Bright.
In addition to providing on-site support for local community

events, including the large-scale NJ Marathon, Elberon First Aid &

Emergency Squad is on a Monmouth County EMS Strike Team and stands

ready to assist in mass casualty incidents.
First Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians play a vital role

in our communities, providing quality care in a timely manner.
The

members of Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad volunteer their time and

undergo rigorous training to support its neighbors.
