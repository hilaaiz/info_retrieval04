In addition to providing on-site support for local community

events, including the large-scale NJ Marathon, Elberon First Aid &

Emergency Squad is on a Monmouth County EMS Strike Team and stands

ready to assist in mass casualty incidents.
First Responders and Emergency Medical Technicians play a vital role

in our communities, providing quality care in a timely manner.
The

members of Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad volunteer their time and

undergo rigorous training to support its neighbors.
They are well-

trained, efficient, and compassionate, and they demonstrate true

community service.
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in marking

this milestone.
For 75 years, Elberon First Aid & Emergency Squad has

upheld its duty to serve the community and its dedication is to be

celebrated.
