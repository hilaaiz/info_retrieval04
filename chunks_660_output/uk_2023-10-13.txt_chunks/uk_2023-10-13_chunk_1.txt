CHRIS CONNORS

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today, I honor the unwavering

dedication and remarkable milestones of State Senator Chris Connors

throughout his career.
His commitment to public service began with his

election to the Lacey Township Committee in 1984, followed by his role

as Mayor from 1986 to 1990.
Senator Connors has also served as Director

of the New Jersey Commission on Capital Budgeting and Planning,

overseeing the state's capital budget and expenditure plans.
Elected to

the General Assembly in 1989, Senator Connors has been a champion for

his constituents.
He was subsequently elected to the Senate in 2007,

and his contributions have been recognized through various honors and

awards.
During my time as a state legislator, I had collaborated with Senator

Chris Connors on several practical initiatives, such as establishing

the Coastal New Jersey Evacuation Task Force to enhance the

preparedness of coastal communities for natural disasters.
Additionally, we fought diligently to secure South Jersey

representation on the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the governing body

responsible for overseeing the Garden State Parkway.
In addition to his political career, Senator Connors is an

accomplished attorney, and he

remains a dedicated family man, married to his wife Deborah since 1979,

and together they have two children.
Senator Christopher J. Connors'

unwavering dedication, notable achievements, and commitment to serving

his community make him a true role model.
Let us express our utmost

respect and appreciation for his remarkable public service.
God Bless

Senator Chris Connors, and God Bless our United States of America.

DYLAN BRANCA

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, this April, I had the

opportunity to attend Dylan Branca's Eagle Scout Court of Honor.
Dylan

joined the Boy Scouts in the fifth grade and shortly after achieved the

Arrow of Light, the highest honor in Cub Scouts.
Once he crossed over

into the Boy Scouts, he hit the ground running with his troop,

embarking on many adventures such as hiking Mount Washington and

Tuckerman's Ravine.
One of his most memorable adventures was the

twelve-day trip to Philmont Scout Reserve in New Mexico, where Dylan

had the opportunity to serve as their ``Leave No Trace'' Guide.
For

Dylan's Eagle Scout project, he planted lavender in the fields at

Reed's farm in Egg Harbor Township.
This lavender is now being used to

produce different products such as soaps and oils while the fields are

simultaneously serving as the location for community yoga classes.
Dylan currently studies environmental science at Cedar Creek High

School in the Magnet Program while simultaneously earning college

credit.
It was a pleasure to attend Dylan's Eagle Scout Court of honor and he

should be proud of his scouting achievements.
God Bless Dylan, and God

Bless our United States of America.
