Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the Hemp Access and Consumer Safety Act.
This legislation would allow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate hemp and hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD) like any other legal dietary ingredients, foods, and beverages.
U.S. cannabis laws are broken, and legalizing hemp was a significant step forward.
However, in order for the market to fully operate with hemp and hemp-derived CBD products with a federal consumer safety standard, FDA has to regulate these products.
FDA has announced that it does not plan to use existing authorities to regulate these products.
I am introducing this legislation in partnership with my fellow Oregonian, Senator Wyden, because our constituents are directly impacted by this gap in federal safety standards.
As the public has grown increasingly interested in CBD, the federal government's consumer protection mechanisms have failed to keep up.
The Hemp Access and Consumer Safety Act will finally bring CBD regulations up to par with the safety standards Americans should be able to expect for these legal products.
It will also ensure packaging and labeling can be regulated to prevent minors accessing these products or any other undue confusion for consumers.
I look forward to working with my co-leads, Senators Ron Wyden and Rand Paul, and my colleagues in the House and Senate to enact this legislation and finally guarantee common-sense safety regulations for hemp and hemp-derived products. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a segment of the White House's Statement of Administration Policy in regard to Section 813 of the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act: Maintaining Safe and Secure Airspace During Major Sports Events.
While the Administration supports the goal of providing accessibility to and public use of the national airspace, it is concerned that provisions proposed in the bill could introduce unnecessary risks to those attending major sporting events if the effectiveness of safety and security buffers currently provided by temporary flight restrictions were to be decreased.
To the extent that the proposed provisions are intended to accommodate airshows, the Administration urges the Congress to consider alternative methods to deconflict airshows and major sports events rather than potentially put aviation operations in close proximity to events attended by millions of Americans each year. ____________________
