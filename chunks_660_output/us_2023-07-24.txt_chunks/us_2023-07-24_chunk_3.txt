He left behind his wife, a 17-year-old daughter, and 2 sons, 14 and 15 years old.
He laid in honor with Officer Chestnut in the Capitol rotunda.
Both men were buried with full honors in Arlington National Cemetery.
These men gave their lives in defense of the democracy that serves all of us while defending the lives of congressmen and -women, congressional staffers, and other United States Capitol Police officers.
In the days that followed, Representative DeLay stated that the death of these officers symbolized, ``the sacrifices of thousands of police officers across the Nation who do their duty to serve and protect the public, sometimes under great abuse, sometimes under great disregard, and many times people take them for granted.
It all comes together when an incident like this happens and we realize how much we owe to police officers all over this country.''
I'll say that the women and men who comprise the United States Capitol Police Department continue to be a very important component in safeguarding the form of government that allows us daily and routine freedoms.
Today we remember Officer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson while thanking all who are a part of the United States Capitol Police Department. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ZONING COMMISSION HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
127



Date: 2023-07-24 Volume: 169, Issue: 127 Pages: E706 - E706 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ZONING COMMISSION HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the District of Columbia Zoning Commission Home Rule Act.
This bill would give the District of Columbia the authority to appoint all members of the D.C. Zoning Commission (Commission).
Currently, the membership of the Commission consists of two federal officials (the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) and the Director of the National Park Service (NPS)) and three members appointed by the D.C. mayor, subject to D.C. Council approval.
The federal officials are members even though the Commission has no authority over federal property.
Land use is a quintessential local matter in our country.
Despite the D.C. Home Rule Act, which gave D.C. authority over local matters, 40 percent of the members of the Commission are federal officials, who are unaccountable to the nearly 700,000 residents who live in D.C.. The federal government would lose nothing under this bill because the federal government's land-use interests in the nation's capital are protected by federal law and federal agencies.
The Commission creates the zoning maps and regulations, which must ``not be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan for the national capital.''
The mayor is responsible for the local elements of the comprehensive plan, subject to Council approval.
The National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), which is the central federal planning agency for the federal government in D.C. and approves federal projects here, is responsible for the federal elements of the comprehensive plan.
This bill would not alter the comprehensive plan process or the authority of NCPC and the Commission.
This bill would immediately remove the AOC and the NPS Director from the Commission, and the Commission would, at least initially, consist solely of three mayoral appointees.
D.C. would have the authority to reconstitute the membership of the Commission through local legislation.
This is an important step to increase D.C. home rule, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
