Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and legacy of Ruth Alvia Munchus Baker, a pillar of our Fort Worth community.
Ruth Alvia Munchus Baker was born June 16, 1931, in Fort Worth and completed her education at historic I.M. Terrell High School.
In 1948, she began a devoted marriage and partnership with Herbert Baker and later became the proud mother of five daughters.
Mrs. Baker began working outside her home as her children entered school.
She was employed in her family business at Baker Funeral Home for more than sixty years, serving in many roles, including receptionist, musician, lady attendant, beautician and cosmetologist, board member, and co-owner.
Mrs. Baker was revered as a friendly and knowledgeable employee who knew how to do nearly every task associated with funeral services.
Blessed with a long life, Mrs. Baker continued working for her family business well into her ninety-second year.
Mrs. Baker was also a woman of faith.
Ruth began her journey starting at a young age at Saint John Missionary Baptist Church on Baptist Hill.
She later would become a founding member of the Beth-Eden Baptist Church in Fort Worth.
Later, she united with Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, where she served as a Trustee, Sunday School teacher, member of the Choir, Brownettes and General Mission.
In 2019, she united with Baker Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church under the pastoral leadership of Reverend Walter McDonald.
There, Mrs. Baker was a Class Leader, member of the Church School, Prayer, and Daily Devotion ministries, while also participating in the monthly food give-away and in the Lay Organization.
My thoughts and prayers are with all those who knew and loved Mrs. Baker, particularly her extensive, loving family.
May her memory last forever. ____________________

GIBSON ______ of wisconsin in the house of representatives Mr. STEIL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor 2 Capitol Police officers, Officer Jacob J. Chestnut, Jr., and Detective John M. Gibson, who were shot and killed by a gunman in the Capitol on July 24, 1998.
In the afternoon of July 24, 1998, a lone gunman forced his way past a security checkpoint, fatally shooting Officer Chestnut.
The assailant ran toward an entrance that led to the offices of Tom DeLay of Texas, the Majority Whip.
Detective Gibson, a member of DeLay's protective team, told others to hide and find cover.
The gunman shot Gibson, and although mortally wounded, Gibson returned fire, striking the gunman.
Detective Gibson's selfless acts resulted in lives saved and provided an opportunity for responding officers to restrain the gunman and end the horrific events that day.
Officer Jacob Joseph Chestnut, Jr., was a 20-year Air Force veteran, having served 2 tours in Vietnam, and retired as a Master Sergeant.
He has the distinction of being the first African American to lie in honor at the Capitol.
He was 58 years old.
Detective John Michael Gibson had been selected as part of the dignitary protection team for Congressman Tom DeLay and had served with the United States Capitol Police for 18 years.
He left behind his wife, a 17-year-old daughter, and 2 sons, 14 and 15 years old.
He laid in honor with Officer Chestnut in the Capitol rotunda.
Both men were buried with full honors in Arlington National Cemetery.
