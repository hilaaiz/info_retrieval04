Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Heroes, Elizabeth Pickett and Noelle Dorgan.
Over the summer, when a woman dialed 9-1-1 as her husband experienced a cardiac event, Elizabeth and Noelle stepped up to help save a life.
As Emergency Communications Specialists for the Grapevine Police Department, they successfully guided the caller through the steps of CPR.
Thanks to the clear instructions of these first responders and the caller's immediate action, the patient was able to be saved once paramedics arrived.
Recently, Elizabeth and Noelle earned well-deserved recognition from the Grapevine Fire Department for their heroic efforts.
Their composure amidst this intense situation was the difference between life and death.
I want to thank both Elizabeth and Noelle for their dedication to serving the community and their efforts to tend to the safety and health of Texas-24. ____________________
