LISA C. McCLAIN of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
One of the women honored by She Leads America, Lori Windham, is vice president and senior counsel at Becket.
In this capacity, Lori proudly defends religious freedom before the United States Supreme Court.
Her work in Fulton v. Philadelphia, as well as in Becket's Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor victories, has protected many from religious discrimination.
Lori is a renowned expert on religious freedom and in First Amendment Law and has testified before U.S. Congress.
Mr. Speaker, these women, including Lori, have left an indelible mark on countless lives.
They are pioneers whose examples have--and will continue to--inspire many.
I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each of them for their unwavering dedication.
This honor is truly well- deserved. ____________________
