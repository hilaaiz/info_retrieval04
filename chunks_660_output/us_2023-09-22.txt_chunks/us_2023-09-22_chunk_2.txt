When he wasn't working tirelessly to ensure the Sun ran smoothly, Jack was involved in the revitalization of his hometown.
His expertise and vision for the future of the City made him a trusted confidant to many business and political leaders over the years.
He served as Chairman of the Lowell Memorial Auditorium, which welcomed many talented artists to perform at the venue under his stewardship.
Jack also served as Chairman of the Tsongas Arena Commission and was instrumental in the arena's creation.
In addition to these accomplishments, he is also responsible for helping to bring professional hockey and baseball teams to Lowell for the community to enjoy.
Jack's contributions to Lowell have made a lasting impact on the city and will continue to be felt for generations to come.
Jack will be remembered for his love for his family and friends, his kindness to those around him, his distinguished professional career, and his immense pride in the City of Lowell.
My heart goes out to Brenda, his loving wife of 54 years, his children, John III, Peter, Nicole, and Suzanne, and the entire Costello family during this difficult time.
Jack's legacy will live on through his loving family and all of us who had the

honor of knowing him. ____________________

LISA C. McCLAIN of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. McLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor exceptional female leaders throughout our Nation who have recently been recognized as ``Christian Women of Distinction'' by She Leads America.
While I strive to lead by example for my constituents back home in Michigan, I understand that not everyone looks to Washington politics for role models.
Thankfully, we do not need to look far to be inspired by individuals led by their strong faith, moral values, and unwavering dedication to their communities.
Today, I am proud to honor some of the women who through their hard work and tireless dedication have brought great inspiration to many throughout the world.
As a United States Representative, it is both my sacred and constitutional obligation to remain steadfast in my commitment to the defense of religious freedom.
Now more than ever, we must safeguard religious liberty to ensure that each of these women and those I serve never have to compromise their religious beliefs.
