RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-23 Volume: 170, Issue: 71 Pages: E384 - E384 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL ______ of kansas in the house of representatives Mr. MANN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Battery Council International.
In March 1924, 25 firms launched the National Battery Manufacturer's Association--the group that would eventually become BCI.
Since then, BCI has been the leading trade association for unlocking the potential of energy storage and supporting the commercial integration of essential products.
BCI members are committed to safe, responsible battery manufacturing.
The United States' lead battery industry has more than 165 GWh of manufacturing capacity across 39 facilities, 250,000 lead battery collection and distribution sites, and 9 lead battery recycling facilities.
Each of these components supports the nearly 100 percent recycle rate for lead batteries, creating an impressive circular economy.
In the last century, BCI members have created batteries to power nearly a billion vehicles in the U.S. alone--powering individuals, families, and businesses along the way.
In 2022, I visited a BCI member, Stryten Energy, which has a manufacturing facility in the Big First District of Kansas.
Stryten's stored energy solutions are built in the U.S. and power everything from forklifts, cars, trains, trucks, microgrids, submarines, and more.
Stryten has over a century of expertise and is the only energy storage solutions provider in North America that can offer advanced lead, lithium, and vanadium battery solutions to solve complex storage challenges.
Companies like Stryten Energy make BCI a strong and essential voice in the energy and defense industries.
I congratulate the Battery Council International on its 100th anniversary and for all the work they do to accelerate the future of energy storage in the U.S. and beyond. ____________________
