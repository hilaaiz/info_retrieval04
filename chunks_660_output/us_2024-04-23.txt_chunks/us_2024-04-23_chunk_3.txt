Today, Rock Creek Park offers residents of D.C., Maryland, and Northern Virginia, as well as visitors, an escape from our increasingly urban environment.
Residents and tourists alike enjoy many activities in the park's 2,000 acres, including hiking and biking on the trails, horseback riding, picnicking, tennis, and other recreational activities in some of the open fields.
Our residents have expressed their appreciation by volunteering to clean up and maintain the forests, trails, and waterways.
In 1918, landscape architects John Charles Olmstead

and Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr. wrote of Rock Creek Park, ``No matter how perfect the scenery of the park may be or may become, no matter how high its potential value, that value remains potential except insofar as it is enjoyed by large and ever larger numbers of people, poor and rich alike,'' Redesignating Rock Creek Park as Rock Creek National Park will help recognize the national status of the park and protect and revitalize this remarkable resource in our Nation's capital.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
