Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish David City, Nebraska a very happy 150th birthday.
August 6, 1873 marks the day David City was made the county seat of Butler County.
Since 1873, David City has grown and distinguished itself in many ways.
Providing an excellent quality of life for their small town with exceptional education and job opportunities.
While David City is home to just about 3,000, it's the birthplace of notable people--like former U.S. Senator Roman Hruska; the founder of Hallmark cards, Joyce Hall; and Catholic Bishop Kenneth Steiner.
Major employers in the City include Timpte, ADM, and David City Public Schools among others.
David City is proud of its Catholic roots.
Aquinas Catholic Schools educates many of the town's people and St. Mary's Church is almost as old as the town itself.
As David City reaches this sesquicentennial birthday, there is much to celebrate.
On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I congratulate David City on 150 years and wish them fun as they celebrate this incredible milestone.
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION + PUBLIC SAFETY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-08-04 Volume: 169, Issue: 133 Pages: E756 - E757 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E756-E757] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION + PUBLIC SAFETY ______ of texas in the house of representatives Ms. JACKSON LEE.
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Congressional Black Caucus, I must shed light on the growing public safety concern regarding gun violence.
In 2022, firearm injury was the 12th leading cause of death in the United States of America.
Every day, 120 Americans are killed with guns.
And each year, hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to gun violence, having been shot to death while protecting their communities.
Our government's continued lack of proactivity towards preventing gun violence has led to countless, unnecessary deaths.
Countless lives have been cut far too short, and countless families have had to experience the excruciating pain of knowing their loved one will never make it back home.
And although gun violence affects us all, I would like to highlight the disproportionate effect of gun violence on Black communities.
Black Americans are 10 times more likely than white Americans to die by gun homicide.
Black Americans are three times more likely than white Americans to be fatally shot by police.
And while Black Americans made up 12.5 percent of the United States population in 2020, they were the victims in 61 percent of all gun homicides.
According to the American Progress, ``this is due to a combination of weak gun laws; systemic racial inequities, including unequal access to safe housing and adequate educational and employment opportunities; and a history of disinvestment in public infrastructure and services in the communities of color most affected by gun violence.''
Discriminatory and unjust policies and practices such as slavery and Jim Crow are the reason that Black communities are still struggling to overcome the inequities in our society today.
Time and time again our country has forced Black Americans to pay the price for its sins, causing countless lives to be lost in the process.
Instead of acknowledging this public safety concern, our government continues to choose to remain ignorant, crafting a narrative of a war on the Second Amendment.
So, allow me to be clear: I support the Second Amendment.
But I will not sit idly by and hear the abuse of the far right's interpretation of the Second Amendment.
In June 2022, the Supreme Court took a radical step when it ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. V. Bruen that the right to carry a weapon or self-defense extends to outside the home.
In this case, plaintiffs challenged the 100-year old New York state handgun licensing law requiring individuals to show proper cause before they can be licensed to carry a concealed weapon in public.
