But I will not sit idly by and hear the abuse of the far right's interpretation of the Second Amendment.
In June 2022, the Supreme Court took a radical step when it ruled in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. V. Bruen that the right to carry a weapon or self-defense extends to outside the home.
In this case, plaintiffs challenged the 100-year old New York state handgun licensing law requiring individuals to show proper cause before they can be licensed to carry a concealed weapon in public.
The Court ultimately ruled New York's concealed carry law unconstitutional, extending the right to own a gun for self-defense in the home to exist outside the home as

well.
This decision altered the well-established test for evaluating gun safety laws and threatens the lives of millions around the country.
The Court's decision sheds light to a growing misinterpretation of the Second Amendment.
As both a legislature and a legal scholar, I must point out that the Second Amendment is not absolute.
No where in the Second Amendment does it prohibit regulating guns.
How dare we sit by when lives are being lost and act as though there is nothing we can do?
Is there no sense of responsibility to provide restrictions to save lives?
Our role in Congress is to ensure that we utilize every tool available to us to keep our cities safe.
We need to reimagine public safety by holding law enforcement officers who violate the public trust accountable, using public health resources to address mental health crises, and ensuring all communities are not overpoliced, well-resourced with access to job opportunities, affordable childcare, and capable social services to improve the quality of life.
We need to increase the use of civilian responders deployed to incidents involving mental health concerns and disturbances or disputes.
We need to strengthen governmental agencies dedicated to violence intervention and neighborhood safety.
We need to pass legislation such as H.R. 52, the Kimberly Vaughn Firearm Safe Storage Act, a bill I introduced which establishes best practices for safe firearm storage to protect Americans, especially children, from improperly stored or misused firearms.
We need to pass legislation, such as H.R. 48 the Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act of 2023, which will work to hire additional Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosive agents and investigators to enforce gun laws.
We need to focus on mental health and pass legislation such as H.R. 46 the Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which will authorize funding to increase access to mental health care treatment to reduce gun violence.
These bills are particularly important as it pertains to mental health given the following facts: Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America.
More than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of individuals using these weapons as a means to commit suicide.
Approximately 1 in 4 American adults have a mental illness and nearly half of all adults in America will develop at least one mental illness during their lifetime.
Less than half of children and adults with diagnosable mental health problems receive the treatment they need.
Gun violence is a nonpartisan issue with bipartisan solutions.
We act as though our hands are tied behind our back, despite the countless options at our disposal.
I join my CBC colleagues in advancing common-sense bills that work to prevent gun violence.
Protecting our communities and protecting our families need to be priority. ____________________
