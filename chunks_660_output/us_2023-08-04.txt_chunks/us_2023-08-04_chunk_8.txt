Tommy Chatmon paid his rent, and he paid it well.
He gave his time, talent, and treasure to numerous social and civil organizations, serving as Chair of Homeless Service Network of Central Florida Board, and the Starter Studio Board, The International Downtown Association (IDA), Nap Ford Community School, MyRegion.
ORG, WMFW Community Advisory Board, and the Central Florida Urban League Board.
Tommy has been honored for his dedicated Community service to include Orlando's ``10 Businessmen to Watch'' and Orlando Magazine's ``50 Most Powerful People'', Georgia Trend Magazine's 100 Most Influential Georgians, Martin Luther King Celebration Leadership Award, and the Leadership Albany Outstanding Alumni Award.
Tommy accomplished much in his life, but none of it would have been possible without the grace of God, the love and support of his elementary school sweetheart, his beloved wife Brenetta, and his three children, Yvonne, Brittany, and Cory.
On a personal note, Tommy was my friend, my Morehouse brother, and longtime supporter.
Over the years, he gave me wise counsel, for which I will be forever grateful.
Likewise, during his life, Tommy did so much for so many for so long.
He touched countless lives, and because he did, the world is a better place.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife Vivian and me, along with the 765,000 people of the 2nd Congressional District, in extending our deepest condolences to the family of Mr. Thomas Christopher Chatmon, Jr., his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
May we all be consoled and comforted

by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead. ____________________
