Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of Miss Jessica Thompson, a resident of Middletown, Maryland and member of the Frederick County Knucklers marble shooting team.
On June 22, 2023, Miss Thompson won the 100th Annual National Marbles Tournament.
In addition to winning the top title in the girls' division, she won the honor of Good Sportsmanship.
These titles earned her a college scholarship.
As this year marks the 100th annual tournament, it is regarded as the oldest children's competitive sport in the United States, having started in 1922.
During the week of June 22nd, young girls and boys from all across the nation gathered to participate in tournaments, engaging in over 1,200 games of Ringer.
Throughout the intense three- day event, Jessica displayed her exceptional skills by competing in more than 100 games.
With determination and skill, she clinched the championship.
It is with great pride that Maryland's sixth district welcomes the Queen of Marbles home to Middletown, and we wish her continued success in all of her endeavors. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Honorable Cynthia Doty, long time resident of the Upper West Side, political activist, and Democratic District Leader, who passed away in Manhattan at the age of 72 on July 17, 2023.
I first met Cynthia 30 years ago working in local Democratic politics.
I worked alongside her former boss Assemblymember Ed Sullivan in the New York State Assembly.
Cynthia served 9 years as his Legislative Associate and Special Assistant.
In Albany, she drafted legislation and negotiated budgets.
In the district, she advocated on behalf of thousands of constituents to protect their housing and deliver needed services.
Cynthia was a major force in the Three Parks Independent Democrats political club and served as its President and as District Leader.
Cynthia was kind, honest, and skilled at her position, and was both respected and beloved within the community.
She was extremely reliable--if she said she was going to get something done, it would always get done--and she was a gracious host to me and others who visited her political club frequently.
Under her leadership, the club members were very active in gathering petition signatures and mobilizing the vote in our area for countless elected officials at all levels of politics from District Leader to Congressman, Senator, and President.
Cynthia and her club did the work to help get Democrats elected across the country--not just in New York--and organized bus trips to Connecticut and Pennsylvania to get out the votes.
She ran phone banks that reached voters across the country and was always finding ways for volunteers to get involved and fight for causes they believed in.
She was my guest at both inaugurations of President Obama and frequently attended marches and protests on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. She opposed the war in Iraq, supported a woman's right to choose, and defended LGBTQ+ rights.
She supported community farms and was a member of a CSA (community supported agriculture) where she enjoyed volunteering.
Cynthia was born into a Democratic family in Philadelphia in 1951, where she developed her progressive principles and a deep commitment to public service.
Cynthia went to public school, co-chaired the racial justice committee at her college, and led several college groups to Washington to protest the Vietnam War.
