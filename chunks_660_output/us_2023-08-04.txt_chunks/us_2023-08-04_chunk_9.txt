Mr. Speaker, on June 22, 2023, I was unavoidably detained.
Had I been present, I would have voted ``NAY'' on rollcall No.
285.
I strongly oppose H. Res.
529, a resolution to refer H. Res.
503 from the House floor to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on the Judiciary.
That resolution impeaches President Joe Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to actions taken that involve immigration and the southern border.
President Biden continues to lead with integrity and has done more than any other President to combat substance use disorder and address the mental health crisis.
In the absence of Congressional action, I have been heartened to work with the Biden Administration to make significant and meaningful reforms to address the immigration challenges facing our Nation.
Rather than consider legislation that is purely politically driven, it is my hope that we get back to the serious work of legislating on the real issues our country faces.
for the People.
I also would have voted ``NAY'' on rollcall No.
286.
I strongly oppose H. Res.
461.
condemning the use of elementary and secondary school facilities to provide shelter for aliens who are not admitted to the United States.
Migrants deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and I commend anyone who follows the Golden Rule and finds shelter for those most in need. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a dedicated staffer who is moving on to a new venture.
After graduating from Georgia Southern University with a degree in accounting, Logan came to my Congressional office as an intern.
Although he is originally from South Lake Tahoe, Nevada, he quickly became an honorary Georgian.
Logan was college football starter for 3 years at Georgia Southern.
He was named on Sun Belt Conference Academic Commissioner's List and the Sun Belt Conference Academic Honor Role.
Logan has a strong desire to serve, and an even stronger dedication to this country.
Despite having a job offer in hand after graduation, Logan chose to come to D.C. to work as an intern, and immediately made an impact on our office.
When the opportunity arose for Logan to join the staff of my House Administration subcommittee, he didn't hesitate.
He saw it as another opportunity to serve--and he has been invaluable from day 1.
Logan is moving on to the next phase of his life, where he will begin his career in accounting.
Logan has left a lasting impression on our entire team and will be impossible to replace; but I am grateful for his service, and I look forward to seeing him continue to succeed as he enters his new role. ____________________
