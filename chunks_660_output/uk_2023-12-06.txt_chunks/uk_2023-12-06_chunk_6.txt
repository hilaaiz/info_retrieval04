SCOTT FRANKLIN

Mr. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the

loss and honor the legacy of a World War II heroine from Lakeland, FL,

Lt.
Hope Kirkendall.
She passed away at the age of 103, carrying her

spiritedness, heart of service and witty sense of humor until her final

days.
During World War II, Lt.
Kirkendall was a nurse in the U.S. Army and

was one of the first women to land in Normandy shortly after the Allied

Forces' D-Day invasion.
She arrived one month after the initial

invasion and achieved the rank of first lieutenant, working around the

clock with her surgical team to care for soldiers who made the ultimate

sacrifices in the Battle for Brest and the Battle of the Bulge.
Decades after her service, Lt.
Kirkendall recounted getting involved

in military life because she was young and wanted to see everything.
She certainly achieved that goal Among her adventures, Kirkendall

traveled in an ambulance convoy, using a gas can for a seat.
She moved

with field hospitals, taking in the wounded near the front lines.
And

amongst the chaos and the tragedy, she said she found a home.
In 2017, Lt.
Kirkendall received the French Knight in the Legion of

Honor award for her expertise and bravery during bombings and in the

line of fire.
Lt.
Kirkendall went on to raise five children after the

war and continued her duties off the battlefield caring for patients

who needed psychiatric assessments.
She is survived by two siblings,

five children, nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
Sadly, we are losing more of the greatest generation each day.
May

Hope rest in peace.
She is truly an American hero.
