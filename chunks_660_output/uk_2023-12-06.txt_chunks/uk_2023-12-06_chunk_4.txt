From the start, she

was known for her prowess in communications and policy issues, and she

went on to serve in the administration of former Michigan Governor John

Engler, heading up three different departments during her tenure--the

only woman in Michigan history to do so.
In the early 2000s, she began

the next chapter of her career with our state's public universities,

first at Central Michigan University where she served as interim

president, vice president of advancement and external relations, and

vice president for government relations.
But of the many titles Kathy held over her decades-long career, one

the closest to her heart was Spartan.
Kathy was a super-alumna, holding

not one, not two, but three degrees from MSU: a bachelor's degree in

Journalism, a master's degree in higher education administration, and a

Ph.
D in the same, and even served one term on the university's Board of

Trustees.
In 2018, she joined Michigan State University's staff, where

she served as senior vice president for government relations.
Under her

tenure, the university secured funding and support for landmark

projects, including the Engineering and Digital Innovation Center, the

MSU greenhouses, and the MSU Apple Academy.
Her steady hand helped

guide the university through good times and bad, driven by an

unshakable faith in the power of higher education, clothed in green and

white.
Over the years, Kathy was a mentor to so many, and I personally

benefited from her knowledge and her wisdom.
Her door was always open,

her invitation to coffee sincere, her cup of kindness bottomless.
She

graciously shared her experience with all, and was truly invested in

seeing others succeed.
From Kathy, I learned what it means to advocate,

and the power of active listening.
Her life was a testament to the

power of getting things done, and the role one person can play to make

positive change.
I send my deepest condolences to all who knew and

loved Kathy, particularly her husband, Tom, their four sons, Tom, Will,

Sam, and Ray; her granddaughter, Mary; and the entire Michigan State

University family.
Kathy Wilbur's accomplishments, her passion, and her

compassion will live on in our hearts and on the banks of the Red Cedar

in East Lansing.

HONORING THE LATE CLAUDE MORSE OF COFFEE COUNTY, TENNESSEE

HON.
SCOTT DesJARLAIS

Mr. DesJARLAIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember

Claude Morse, who sadly passed away November 12, 2023.
Tennessee has

long been known as The Volunteer State for a reason, and no one I have

met personified the spirit of that motto more than Claude Morse.

The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. DesJARLAIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Claude Morse, who

sadly passed away November 12,

========================= END NOTE =========================

Claude was a selfless example of volunteerism, and not the kind of

symbolic of volunteerism that simply amounts to adding his name to a

group.
When a need and a project arose, Claude was never just a worker;

he was a planner, an organizer, a manager, and a participant.
Morse was actively involved with several nonprofit organizations

throughout Coffee County.
Honor Flight, Project Appleseed and the

Arnold Community Council are just a few of the organizations to which

Morse devoted his time and efforts.
As President of Honor Flight Middle Tennessee, Claude worked

tirelessly to take eligible World War II, Korean War and Vietnam

veterans on a free trip to see war memorials in Washington, DC.
It

remains my great honor to personally welcome as many of these heroes as

I can when they come, and it was always a special treat to get to spend

time with Claude as well.
