college and served in the military.
She is also a grandmother, great-

grandmother, great-great-grandmother, and a surrogate mother to many.
Her four beloved cats, Lilibeth, Corabell, Marthann, and Cleolynn, are

her constant companions.
As a founding member of the Good Shepherd Holiness Church, Mrs.

Randolph holds the esteemed title of Mother of the Church.
For years,

she was an active participant in various church activities, including

the Musical Choir, Youth Department, Missionary Society, Vacation Bible

Her dedication to her faith community is

a testament to her unwavering spirit and love for service.
Beyond her contributions to the church, Mrs. Randolph is the former

owner of Brooks Grocery Store, a cornerstone of her community.
A Gold

Star Wife and a member of the Tuesday Rockers and United Order of

Tents, Mrs. Randolph has always been active in community service and is

a former member of the Hopkins Adult Senior Citizens Program, where she

volunteered with Meals on Wheels.
She also loves socializing,

entertaining, gardening, and reading scripture.
Mrs. Randolph's motto, ``Helping Others to Help Others,'' reflects

her life's work.
Her favorite hymns, ``Rock of Ages'' and ``Nearer My

God To Thee,'' and her cherished scripture, ``The Lord is my Shepherd;

I shall not want'' (Psalms 23), are a testament to her deep faith and

guiding principles.
Her favorite saying, ``If you know better, you will

do better,'' encapsulates her belief in the power of knowledge and

self-improvement.
