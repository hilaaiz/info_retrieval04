OPPOSITION TO LEADED AVIATION FUEL PROVISIONS IN H.R. 3935, THE

SECURING GROWTH AND ROBUST LEADERSHIP IN AMERICAN AVIATION ACT

HON.
ZOE LOFGREN

Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I voted in favor of H.R. 3935, the Securing

Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act to reauthorize

and improve important aviation programs in order to move the measure

forward to the Senate.
While there was much good in the bill, I opposed

provisions in the underlying bill calling for continued use of leaded

aviation fuel.
I was pleased to work with the House Transportation and

Infrastructure Committee on securing improvements to this language in

the manager's amendment, which we believe will protect my constituents

from exposure to leaded fuel used by small aircraft.
The Senate should

further improve these provisions on continued use of leaded avgas

before the bill comes back to the House for negotiations.

RECOGNIZING MR.
LANNIE CORBIN

HON.
MATT GAETZ

Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Lannie Corbin,

the City Manager for the City of Niceville, Okaloosa County, Florida.
On July 31, 2023, Mr. Corbin will be retiring after more than 52 years

of service to the City of Niceville.
A native of Northwest Florida, Mr.

Corbin began his civic service as City Clerk in August 1971.
He was

then appointed City Manager/City Clerk in 1972, a position he has held

since.
Mr. Corbin is the longest-serving city manager in the history of

the State of Florida.
During his tenure, Mr. Corbin has been instrumental in improving the

quality of life in Niceville and the surrounding area.
One of his many

great accomplishments includes negotiating with local landowners to

cede a portion of their land to the city, enabling the city to more

than double its size.
This led to Nicevilles population growing from

4,300 residents in 1972 to over 16,000 today.
Lannie Corbin helped bring increased-quality-of-life projects to

Niceville, such as the Turkey Creek Nature Trail, Lions Park, the

Niceville Senior Center, the Twin Oaks Multi-use Sports Complex, the

Children's and Spray Parks, and multiple city parks, such as Meigs and

Rocky Runway Commons.
He also brought a new complex to the city to

house its administrative offices, the police headquarters, community

center, and the Children's Park.
One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of Niceville's

first public library.
This led him to champion the first-ever

cooperative effort in Okaloosa County by forming the Okaloosa County

Library Cooperative, uniting 6 cities with the county, enabling them to

increase the resources available to all the residents of our county.
I, along with all of Northwest Florida, thank Niceville City Manager

Corbin for his dedication to public service and commitment to improving

the quality of life in the city for all its residents and visitors.
His

lifelong service exemplifies the very best of Northwest Florida.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am

privileged to recognize City Manager Lannie Corbin on the occasion of

his retirement.
