The story of EESI begins in the 1970s when a bipartisan group of

members of Congress--led by then-Rep. Richard L. ``Dick'' Ottinger--

established the Environmental and Energy Study Conference to help

policymakers understand sustainability issues that were gaining in

importance on Capitol Hill.
By 1984, the Conference had evolved into an

independent nonprofit organization: EESI.
As climate, clean energy, and environmental challenges have become

more complicated and more urgent over the years, EESI has produced

briefings, articles, fact sheets, issue briefs, and podcasts that

clearly explain and synthesize issues for policymakers, with an

emphasis on Congressional staff, while remaining objective and

nonpartisan.
Moreso, I have the privilege of serving as a co-chair of the

Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus, which highlights, on a

bipartisan basis, the many benefits of clean energy.
Each year, EESI

works with House and Senate Caucus leadership to organize the

Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency EXPO and Policy

Forum.
Dozens of leaders, experts, and practitioners descend on Capitol

Hill to exhibit their solutions and raise awareness of how clean energy

is creating good-paying jobs, promoting environmental justice,

expanding economic development in rural communities, and contributing

to national security and resilience.
Now in its 27th year, the EXPO and

Policy Forum is firmly established as an essential showcase and venue

for policymaker education.
Many congratulations to EESI on 40 impactful years on Capitol Hill.
As my colleagues in Congress and I consider new policies and

investments to meet the climate challenges of today and tomorrow, I

have no doubt that EESI will continue to be an essential resource and

eager partner.
On behalf of the United States Congress and Missouri's

Fifth District, I applaud EESI for 40 years of achievements and I look

forward to the years of success to come.
