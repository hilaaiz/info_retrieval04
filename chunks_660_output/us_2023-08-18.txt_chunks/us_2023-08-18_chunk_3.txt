Mr. Speaker, I'm honored to recognize Greg and Carol Kupp upon the auspicious occasion of the 90th Anniversary of ``Kuppy's Diner'' on August 6, 2023.
Kuppy's is located in the heart of Middletown, Pennsylvania, and has remained a beloved landmark since Percy Kupp founded the establishment in 1933, during the Great Depression.
Kuppy's has been owned and operated by Fourth Generation Kupps (Greg and Carol) since 1991, with the Fifth Generation (Rachel) working alongside them daily, and even mentoring the Sixth Generation (Jackson) to take over someday.
The Kupp Family is dedicated to continuing the tradition of their small, hometown, hardworking, friendly, and community-based establishment where all are welcome and treated like family.
Kuppy's Diner has enjoyed and earned extraordinary success, due in no small part to Percy Kuppy's philosophy, ``if you serve good food at reasonable prices, people will be satisfied.''
But perhaps the most significant factor in Kuppy's longevity, popularity, and legacy is the Kupp Family's tireless dedication to and appreciation of their customers and community for nearly a century.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 10th Congressional District, and surrounding communities, I'm honored and humbled to commemorate Greg, Carol, and the entire Kupp Family upon the 90th Anniversary of Kuppy's Diner in Middletown, Pennsylvania.
I wish them continued God's blessings for all they have built, achieved, and contributed, not only to the communities of Central Pennsylvania, but to the United States of America. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Joan Kaplan Davidson, a philanthropist and champion of conservation in New York State who recently passed away at the age of 96.
Joan spent her life advocating for the restoration and conservation of New York's treasures and her legacy is one of vision and action.
She served as the leader of the J.M. Kaplan Fund, as the New York State Commissioner of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, and gave her time to countless non-profit boards and committees.
I had the pleasure of working alongside her to designate the Hudson River as New York's first Heritage River and to work to advance numerous local waterfront development plans and historic preservation projects.
Joan chose to make a profound impact through the power of small, decisive actions, and her work has inspired me and countless others.
