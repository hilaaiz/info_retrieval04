SCOTT, JR. ______
of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated servant leader, good friend, and native son of South Carolina.
South Carolina State Senator John L. Scott, Jr. transitioned from this life on August 13, 2023, in Charleston, South Carolina.
His passionate work to improve access to education and health care will have profound implications for generations to come.
Senator John L. Scott, Jr. was born on October 21, 1953, in Richland County, South Carolina, to the late John L. Scott, Sr.
and Gracie W. Scott.
Senator Scott graduated from C.A. Johnson High School in Columbia, South Carolina, and attended my alma mater, South Carolina State University, where he graduated in 1975 with a bachelor's degree in accounting.
He would go on to found J.L. Scott Realty Company, Inc., in 1981 and serve as owner and President of C&S Consulting Group.
I knew Senator Scott well through his transformational work in the state.
From 1988 to 1990, he served as Vice Chair for Richland County Council.
He was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives in 1990, where he served until his election to the South Carolina State Senate in 2009.
Throughout his nearly 33 years in elected office, Senator Scott sponsored legislation to promote access to education and affordable housing, improve career outcomes for HBCU students, and further rural equity.
He was recognized with many awards and accolades throughout his service, from the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian honor; to receiving the South Carolina National Guard Association Senator of the Year award; to receiving honorary Doctorates from various universities.
His dedication to the betterment of the Palmetto State extended to our South Carolina Military Department, as Senator Scott commanded the Joint Services Detachment from February 18, 2017, to January 19, 2019.
During that time, he actively recruited to increase enrollment, improved unit efficiency and readiness, and provided critical support for the Youth ChalleNGe Academy Program.
Senator Scott was a man of faith and a longtime member of New Ebenezer Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina.
He was an active participant in the church, serving as Church Clerk from 1980 to 1995, on the Trustee Board from 1980 to 2005, and as a Deacon from 2005 until his passing.
He is lovingly remembered by his wife, Joan Crouch, son, John L. Scott, III, extended family, political colleagues, and the members of our shared brotherhood, Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in recognizing the life and legacy of Senator John L. Scott, Jr. Senator Scott embodied the Biblical teaching to ``Be devoted to one another in love.
Honor one another above yourselves,'' and as such devoted his life to improving the welfare

of every South Carolinian.
He will be sorely missed and well remembered. ____________________
