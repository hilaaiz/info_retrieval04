Date: 2023-08-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 137 Pages: E782 - E782 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING AARON ANDERSON ______ of minnesota in the house of representatives Mr. EMMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Aaron Anderson for his efforts to better his community.
In high school, Aaron was a dedicated member of the youth service club at Blaine High School.
As a member of ``Bengals in Action,'' he spent countless hours volunteering at the North Anoka County Emergency food shelf.
While volunteering, he noticed a problem with the procedure for taking orders.
Luckily for Aaron, the solution lay in another area of his interest, technology.
Aaron, with the help of his friend and fellow Eagle Scout, Andrew, created a software application to help track the food shelf's orders.
The application immediately helped reduce confusion when taking orders and increased efficiency in sorting and packaging donations for distribution.
Their application keeps records of past food shelf orders, family members, and dietary restrictions, which customers can reuse each time they come in.
In fact, their program has allowed food and necessities to be delivered to clients in half the time.
In recognition of their efforts, Aaron and Andrew were recently presented with the Congressional Award.
The award represents the highest Congressional honor available for young Americans.
Aaron and Andrew are true inspirations and examples of what it means to be a community servant.
They are bright young men committed to making a difference in the world and I look forward to seeing all they accomplish in the years to come. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the heroic action of Senior Trooper Christopher Carlton with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.
On February 17, 2023, at approximately 4:38 P.M., Senior Trooper Carlton responded to a vehicle crash on Highway 84 in Houston County, Alabama.
Senior Trooper Carlton rescued Jessica Joy Thrasher of Lynn Haven, FL and 4-year-old Simon Thrasher, from the scene.
Upon Trooper Carlton's arrival, a member of Wicksburg Rescue advised Carlton that another ambulance would be required for both patients since they needed immediate medical attention.
Without hesitation, Carlton transported Simon to Flowers Hospital in his patrol vehicle to ensure rapid treatment and care.
Physicians, nurses, and hospital staff were able to stabilize Simon after the incident, and both Jessica and Simon are expected to make a full recovery.
I am confident Trooper Carlton's quick and selfless actions saved the lives of Jessica and Simon.
I would like to thank Senior Trooper Christopher Carlton for his service.
He serves the State of Alabama with integrity and always answers the call of duty.
I extend my gratitude for his hard work and diligence in public service.
The Second Congressional District of Alabama is blessed to have such an outstanding citizen. ____________________
