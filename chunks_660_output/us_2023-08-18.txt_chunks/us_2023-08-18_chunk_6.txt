Date: 2023-08-18 Volume: 169, Issue: 137 Pages: E783 - E783 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING AND HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL BOB DILL ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the life and military service of Colonel Bobby Dill, who passed away on August 14, 2023, at the age of 91.
Colonel Dill was a native of Greenville County in South Carolina.
He was a 1955 graduate of Clemson University and earned a master's degree from Oklahoma University.
In the U.S. Army, he served in Korea, Vietnam, Germany and on Army Staff at the Pentagon.
After retiring from military service, he spent several years investing in the next generation by working as a substitute teacher.
Later, he would leave retirement to take on a new career as a newspaperman--working diligently to keep his community informed.
With his wife LaVerle at his side, he wrote articles, attended countless meetings, and remained devoted to printing the truth.
Mr. Speaker, Colonel Bob Dill's life was devoted to serving his country and his local community.
Soloman tells us in the book of Proverbs that ``a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches.''
Colonel Bob Dill was a kind man who loved his country, and his memory will live on in the Third District of South Carolina. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commend to the House the 50th anniversary of the first concert of Ohio Wesleyan University's Gospel Lyres Choir.
From its founding in October of 1972 by students Cheryl Smith and Marteal Pitts, the Gospel Lyres Choir provided a place for African American students at Ohio Wesleyan to gather in fellowship and friendship and to use their musical gifts to praise God.
At its debut concert on campus on November 4, 1973, the Choir numbered an impressive 22 members.
Through the years, Choir members served as unofficial ambassadors of Ohio Wesleyan, performing at churches not just in the city of Delaware, Ohio, but across our great state and beyond.
Its members formed strong, lifelong bonds as they touched countless lives with the Gospel message they shared through their music.
Mr. Speaker, Choir alumni will gather on campus during Ohio Wesleyan's homecoming weekend this October for a reunion concert and celebration.
On behalf of the people of Ohio's Fourth Congressional District, I thank the members of the Gospel Lyres Choir for contributing so richly to the musical landscape of our great state.
I wish them all the best as they mark their golden anniversary. ____________________
