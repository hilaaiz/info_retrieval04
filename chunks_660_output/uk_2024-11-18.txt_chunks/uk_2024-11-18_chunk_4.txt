High School.
It is my distinct privilege to recognize the dedication,

perseverance, and excellence demonstrated by these young athletes.
Under the exemplary leadership of Head Coach Lawton Williams, III and

his outstanding coaching staff, the team has achieved the highest honor

in Florida high school basketball.
The Vikings completed the season

Their dedication and hard work

culminated in a thrilling championship game at the RP Funding Center in

Lakeland, Florida, where they faced Blake High School.
The Vikings

showcased their skill and determination, defeating Blake with a

decisive score of 61-48.
This championship victory is a testament to the hard work,

discipline, and teamwork exhibited by each member of the team.
The

Miami Norland Vikings have not only brought pride to their school but

have also inspired the local community through their commitment to

achievement on and off the court.

The unwavering support from Principal Mrs. Rhonda Gaines-Miller and

Athletic Director Mr. Tyronn Johnson has also been instrumental in the

team's success.
Their leadership and commitment to fostering a thriving
