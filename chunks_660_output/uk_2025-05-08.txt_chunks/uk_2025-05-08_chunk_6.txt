The name ``Ocoee'' comes from the Cherokee

word for ``apricot vine,'' which is what inspired the city's logo now

referred to as the passion flower.
Over the past century, the City of Ocoee has become steeped in rich

history made up of significant moments and milestones.
Generations have

come and gone, each adding their own story to the fabric of Ocoee.
Today, with a growing population, over 50,000 people currently call

Ocoee home.
The City of Ocoee prides itself on the quality of life it

provides its citizens.
Ocoee's unique location in the heart of Central

Florida makes it a wonderful place to live, work and play.
The City of Ocoee will host their Centennial Celebration on Friday,

May 9, 2025.
I join our community in celebrating this momentous

occasion.
Happy Centennial, Ocoee.

RECOGNIZING THE CRYSTAL LAKE STRIKERS FOR RECEIVING THE CARL E. WEHDE

AWARD

HON.
BILL FOSTER

Mr. FOSTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Crystal Lake

Strikers for receiving the Carl E. Wehde Award.
This award honors the

late Carl E. Wehde and celebrates outstanding contributions that

enhance the quality of life for the people of Crystal Lake.
The Crystal Lake Strikers are a drumline that seamlessly integrates

the arts and education.
They perform year-round and offer a wide range

of programs in percussion, color guard, and other performing arts

disciplines.
Their mission is twofold: to provide high-quality

entertainment to the community and to build confidence in students.
By

expanding upon lessons taught in local schools, the Strikers meet the

educational needs of Crystal Lake, offering percussion experiences for

children at all grade levels through six distinct groups.
In recognition of their impact, the Strikers were previously honored

with the Illinois Park and Recreation Association's Outstanding Program

and Special Event Award for the creation of the Kingpins drumline, an

educational program designed specifically for children with special

needs.
The Strikers' commitment to serving the Crystal Lake community

extends beyond the classroom.
They actively support aspiring performers

through college scholarships, fundraisers, and by providing a platform

for young talent in the perfomning arts.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the Crystal Lake Strikers, whose

contributions to the arts and education have had a profound and lasting

impact on the city.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating

the Strikers on receiving this well-deserved award and for continuing

to inspire the next generation of performers.
