To earn

the Girl Scout Gold Award, high school-age Girl Scouts must identify

and investigate an issue they care about, devise a plan, and then lead

a team of experts and community members to implement a project that

produces lasting change.
Over the course of 1-2 years, Gold Award Girl

Scouts demonstrate significant initiative, commitment, and leadership,

distinguishing them from their peers.
Through their resourcefulness and

perseverance, they embody the Girl Scout Law to truly make the world a

better place.
Hannah's project, Kindness Counts, in partnership with Port Charlotte

High School and the National Honor Society and Key Club, was an

excellent endeavor to address mental health and bullying in our

community.
Hannah took action by coordinating with school

administrators, educating community members about the harmful effects

of bullying, and creating a motivational mural to be displayed at her

school, which will have a positive impact on our community for years to

come.
On behalf of the 17th Congressional District of Florida,

congratulations to Hannah for achieving the highest distinction in Girl

Scouts, the Gold Award.
We thank Hannah for her leadership and making

such a positive, lasting change in our community.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF OCOEE

HON.
DANIEL WEBSTER

Mr. WEBSTER of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to recognize

and celebrate the 100 Year Anniversary of the City of Ocoee, Florida.
Ocoee officially became a municipality in 1923 and was incorporated as

a city in May 1925.
The City of Ocoee will host their Centennial

Celebration on Friday, May 9, 2025.
Ocoee was first settled in the mid-1800s, near Starke Lake, southeast

of Lake Apopka.
In 1886, Dr. H.K. Clarke, Charles J. Chunn, and R.B.F.

Roper developed the Town of Ocoee subdivision, naming it after the

Ocoee River in Tennessee.
The name ``Ocoee'' comes from the Cherokee

word for ``apricot vine,'' which is what inspired the city's logo now

referred to as the passion flower.
Over the past century, the City of Ocoee has become steeped in rich

history made up of significant moments and milestones.
Generations have

come and gone, each adding their own story to the fabric of Ocoee.
