Limited access to funding restricts the ability to scale and compete on an equal footing with their counterparts, hindering their potential for long-term success and growth.
Due to limited credit access, higher shares of Black employer businesses are forced to turn to alternative forms of financing.
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, 49 percent of firms who pursue financing at an online lender do so because they were denied by other financial institutions.
One of my constituents who has faced these types of challenges is Tiffany Kelly, the owner and founder of House of Ketubah Bridal in Mount Rainier, Maryland.
Tiffany told me that her business has been overlooked and excluded from financing opportunities.
But she hasn't abandoned hope.
Tiffany and her team continue to explore alternative avenues and innovative solutions to ensure that they can continue to serve their customers and the community.
I urge my colleagues to work together to solve the access to capital challenges faced by small businesses and to consider the unique needs of minority-owned businesses during Black History Month. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dudley Davenport and on the dedication of the gymnasium at Sharon High School in his honor.
Born on December 14, 1937, Dudley Davenport was raised in Westport, Massachusetts, where he found a passion for sports, specifically basketball, at a young age.
During Dudley's time at Westport High School, he was a four-year starter on the basketball team and set an all-time scoring record with 1,529 points throughout his high school career.
This record held for 50 years and earned Dudley a place in the Westport High School Athletic Hall of Fame.
It was also in Westport where Dudley first met the love of his life, Shirley.
They began dating Dudley's sophomore year and were married in 1957.
Together, Dudley and Shirley raised four children--David, Diane, Tracy, and Jay.
Dudley went on to receive an athletic scholarship to play basketball at the University of Rhode Island and served as team captain.
After graduating in 1960, Dudley taught at Roosevelt Junior High School in New Bedford for one year, before accepting a position to teach at Sharon High School.
For 35 years, Dudley taught science at Sharon High School and quickly established himself as a pillar of the local community.
In 1961, during his first year of teaching in Sharon, Dudley also began coaching the boys' varsity basketball team and continued to do so until 1983.
Throughout his two decades as a coach, the team won five Hockomock League Championships and a total of 328 games.
The team also qualified for the state tournament 18 times and played in 10 semi- finals and four state finals.
With a coaching record of 328-114, Dudley was inducted into the Sharon High School Athletic Hall of Fame as well as the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches' Hall of Fame and was a recipient of the MIAA Sherman A. Kinney Award for outstanding contributions to Massachusetts high school basketball.
In addition to his work as a teacher and a coach, Dudley also took on the role of athletic director at Sharon High School in 1969 and held this position for nearly three decades.
In 2010, to celebrate Dudley's impact on the Hockomock League and athletics across the region, the league named a division after him--the Davenport Division.
Dudley's contributions to the Sharon community were not limited only to the classroom or basketball court.
For over 40 years, Dudley served as a board member on the Sharon Credit Union as well as the Chairman for nearly two decades.
