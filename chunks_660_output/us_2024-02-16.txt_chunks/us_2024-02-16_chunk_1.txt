Date: 2024-02-16 Volume: 170, Issue: 31 Pages: E160 - E161 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E160-E161] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WASHINGTON ASSOCIATION OF NEW JERSEY ______ of new jersey in the house of representatives Ms. SHERRILL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 150th anniversary of the Washington Association of New Jersey based in New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District, and their longstanding commitment to preserving our nation's early history.
During the harshest winter of the Revolutionary War from 1779 to 1780, Jacob Ford Jr.'s mansion in Morristown, New Jersey served as the military headquarters for George Washington as the Continental Army encamped nearby.
Recognizing the importance of this site, the Washington Association of New Jersey was founded on March 30, 1874 with the goal of preserving and maintaining the Ford Mansion.
In 1933, the Washington Association was instrumental in advocating for the establishment of our country's first National Historical Park, as they shared the important history of the Ford Mansion, Jockey Hollow, and Fort Nonsense with the 65th Congress.
I am grateful to the Washington Association for its dedication to preserving this important history for both the State of New Jersey and the United States.
Today, visitors can appreciate the beauty and historical importance of Washington's Headquarters and the Morristown Historical Park thanks to the efforts and foresight of the Washington Association of New Jersey.
New Jersey is the Crossroads of the American Revolution and I especially look forward to welcoming people from all over America and the world to these sites in 2026 as we celebrate the 250th anniversary of our nation.
For the past 150 years, the Washington Association has shared New Jersey's Revolutionary War history with all of us and that is why I am honored to recognize them on this important anniversary. ____________________
