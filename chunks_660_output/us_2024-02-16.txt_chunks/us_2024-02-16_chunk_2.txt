Beyond his professional achievements, Cliffs legacy is defined by his selfless service to others.
As a dedicated member of the real estate community, he generously shared his time and expertise, serving in various capacities including President of the Arkansas REALTORS Association and as an ARPAC Trustee.
His advocacy and leadership were instrumental in advancing the interests of his colleagues and advocating for policies that promoted economic growth and prosperity.
Cliffs impact extended far beyond the boardroom, as he actively engaged in civic leadership and community service.
Whether through his involvement with organizations such as the Russellville Jaycees, Lions Club, or Chamber of Commerce, Cliff demonstrated an unwavering commitment to improving the lives of those around him.
His passion for civic engagement and grassroots activism inspired others to follow in his footsteps, leaving an enduring legacy of service and leadership.
As we reflect on Cliff's remarkable life, let us draw inspiration from his boundless generosity, unwavering integrity, and steadfast devotion to his family and community.
Though he may no longer walk among us, his spirit will continue to guide and inspire us in the days ahead.
May Sara Lou, Gaye, Julie, and the entire Goodin family, find comfort in the cherished memories they shared with Cliff and solace in the knowledge that his legacy will endure as a beacon of hope and inspiration for generations to come.
Let us honor Cliff's memory by rededicating ourselves to the principles of service, compassion, and unity that he held dear.
