Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Magnolia Park's own Gilda Ramirez.
Gilda was born on February 12, 1963, in the shadow of Port Houston, a place that would come to define her life, and where some of her fondest memories were born, like hunting for Easter eggs in Mason Park.
She knew at a young age that the door of opportunity to the halls of power had been cracked open for her generation, but it was up to her to open that door all the way and hold it open for the community.
Gilda, ever-curious, took what she learned at Stephen F. Austin High School and Houston International University and embarked on a history- making career as an executive at Houston's Metropolitan Transit Authority and the Port of Houston, a place she loved dearly.
She was amazed at all the different things that came through the Port and all the jobs and families it helped.
She said she could never live far away from Magnolia Park.
She kept coming back.
She found joy in connecting people, fostering friendships, and serving the community that had given her so much.
Through it all, Gilda never forgot those who would follow.
She stayed committed to mentoring future professionals and supporting and empowering small, minority and women-owned businesses, and keeping that door open.
Mr. Speaker, Gilda swung the door wide open, and she held it there through her final days.
Because of her work, Latina women have a seat at the table, our future leaders have a seat at the table, our community has a seat at the table.
Gilda won countless honors, from ``Hispanic Executive of the Year'' by the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce to ``The One Woman Soaring Heights Award'' by the Texas Business Alliance, but it is especially sweet to honor the life of my friend in the Congress of the United States.
Our prayers are with her husband, Richard Arevalo, her sister, Rebecca Pena, and her lovely and sharp girls, Coco and Lola.
May God bless Gilda.
I thank her for everything she did for us while she was with us here.
May she please keep watch over us as we continue the fight for greater inclusion and shared properity for all.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life and legacy of Gilda Ramirez.

Mr. Speaker, as we recognize National Entrepreneurship Week and Black History Month, I rise today to highlight the accomplishments and challenges of America's Black-owned small businesses.
Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in 30 years with the share of Black households owning a business doubling between 2019 and 2022.
However, Black-owned small businesses still face distinct challenges, particularly as it relates to accessing capital, securing contracts, and navigating systemic biases within financial institutions and markets.
Limited access to funding restricts the ability to scale and compete on an equal footing with their counterparts, hindering their potential for long-term success and growth.
Due to limited credit access, higher shares of Black employer businesses are forced to turn to alternative forms of financing.
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, 49 percent of firms who pursue financing at an online lender do so because they were denied by other financial institutions.
