In 2010, to celebrate Dudley's impact on the Hockomock League and athletics across the region, the league named a division after him--the Davenport Division.
Dudley's contributions to the Sharon community were not limited only to the classroom or basketball court.
For over 40 years, Dudley served as a board member on the Sharon Credit Union as well as the Chairman for nearly two decades.
Under his leadership, the credit union grew and transformed into the important resource that it is today.
As an educator for over 35 years, Dudley understood the importance of access to education and played a critical role in establishing the Sharon

Credit Union Scholarship Program, which awards scholarships to graduating seniors who excelled in academics, extracurriculars, and community service.
Sadly, we lost Dudley too soon on May 15, 2019, at the age of 81.
Dudley leaves behind a remarkable legacy as a loving father and devoted educator, coach, and mentor to students and colleagues alike.
Although Dudley had a significant record as both a coach and player, what people remember most is the positive impact that Dudley had on those around him.
On February 16, 2024, the Sharon community will gather together to dedicate the gymnasium at Sharon High School in memory of Dudley Davenport.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Dudley Davenport, my friend who positively impacted the lives of so many who were privileged to know him, and I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating his lifelong commitment to mentoring and supporting those in his community. ____________________

FRANK PALLONE, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PALLONE.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to congratulate The Stone Pony on its 50th anniversary as its staff, patrons, and the community gather to celebrate ``Stone Pony Day'' as proclaimed by the City of Asbury Park.
The Stone Pony is a landmark music venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey and this milestone and its historical significance are truly deserving of this body's recognition.
Opened on February 8, 1974 by John P. ``Jack'' Roig and Robert ``Butch'' Pielka, The Stone Pony has become synonymous with Asbury Park.
Its storied past has seen triumphs and tribulations, but throughout its 50 years, The Stone Pony's connection to rock and roll history has cemented its status and success as preeminent music venue.
Its stage has been graced by a venerable list of talent, including New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen, Ronnie Spector, the Ramones, Joan Jett, Peter Frampton, Green Day, Kenny Chesney, and The Black Crowes.
Many artists launched their careers at the Pony, including New Jersey rock band The Smithereens, who credit The Stone Pony for their start.
One of the venue's first house bands, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, helped buoy the venue's following and still play there today.
The venue is a mainstay of Asbury Park, and its history is woven into that of the city.
The Stone Pony's commitment to promoting local and national musical acts has contributed to the thriving cultural landscape of the city.
In addition, it has supported local charities and philanthropic efforts throughout its history, hosting benefit concerts for hunger initiatives, local youth programs, Parkinson's disease research, and music education, among others.
Mr. Speaker, once again, it is with pride that I recognize the remarkable history and contributions of The Stone Pony and congratulate it on its 50th anniversary.
The Stone Pony continues to bring local talent and renowned musical acts to residents and visitors, drawing crowds from across New Jersey and beyond.
