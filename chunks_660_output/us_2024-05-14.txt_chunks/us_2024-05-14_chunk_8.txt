However, Lt.
Colonel Claiborne's service did not stop there.
In 2016, she co-founded the Sister of the Skies with pilots Christine Angel Hughes and Nia Wordlaw, with the mission of supporting and building a diverse aviation workforce by offering workshops, mentorships, and scholarships.
We owe a debt of gratitude to Lt.
Colonel Claiborne for her more than 20 years of service to our armed forces and for paving the way for a new generation of Black female pilots. ____________________
