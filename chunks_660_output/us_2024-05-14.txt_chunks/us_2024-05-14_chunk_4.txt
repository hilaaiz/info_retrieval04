Over its sixty-year history, there have been changes in performers, musical directors, and even their home base, but two features at the heart of the organization remain its foundation--a commitment to sacred music and an openness to all members of the community.
As they celebrate this remarkable milestone, I am honored to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the New Haven Oratorio Choir and wish them all the best for many more successful years to come.

HONORING THE VALIANT EFFORTS OF THE MADISON COUNTY COMMUNITY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-05-14 Volume: 170, Issue: 83 Pages: E495 - E496 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E495-E496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE VALIANT EFFORTS OF THE MADISON COUNTY COMMUNITY ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. SPANBERGER.
Mr Speaker, I rise to recognize the Madison County community for its valiant and courageous spirit.
On October 24, 2023, Madison County first responders began the difficult task of containing the Quaker Run fire.
The following day, Madison County declared a local emergency after the fire continued to burn and eventually spread into Shenandoah National Park.
As the fire continued to grow and weather conditions continued to work against first responders, it was inspiring to watch local residents and volunteers come together--soon, local news stations and articles began to highlight these efforts and the contributions made by these brave individuals who assisted first responders in navigating the steep and difficult terrain to contain the fire.
Unreliable cellphone service added to the uncertainty.
In response to this, Verizon provided a mobile site for emergency personnel to use to facilitate and coordinate communication.
It also allowed the Virginia Department of Forestry to generate maps on site that proved useful in helping organize the efforts on the ground to contain the fire.
In the face of adversity, the community came together to protect neighboring areas and help Madison County in its efforts to contain the Quaker Run fire.
Notably, volunteers--many of them local farmers and bear hunters-- helped install large containment lines to keep the fire away from the community and also helped distribute food and water.
The collaborative effort between the Virginia Department of Forestry, Virginia Department of Emergency Management, Virginia National Guard, National Park Service, USDA Forest Service, local fire and emergency services, law enforcement, and more than 140 volunteers and nearly 20 fire and EMS companies is a true reflection of the caring individuals who lent their time and a helping hand to assist in containing the fire and keeping Madison County residents safe.
On November 3, 2023, the fire had spread to roughly 1,500 acres.
On November 9, 2023, the State of Virginia declared a state of emergency.
Finally, on November 17, 2023, the Quaker Run fire was declared 100 percent contained with about 3,397 acres of private, state, and federal lands affected by the fire.
The efforts made by volunteers and first responders from Madison County and across the Commonwealth were crucial to preventing further damage and ensuring the safety of residents.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking and celebrating the courageous men and women who came together--from volunteers to first responders--to help their neighbors and provide support to one another as they fought to contain the Quaker Run fire.
Their unwavering commitment to helping their community during this time of need is a source of inspiration and I am honored to represent them in Congress. ____________________
