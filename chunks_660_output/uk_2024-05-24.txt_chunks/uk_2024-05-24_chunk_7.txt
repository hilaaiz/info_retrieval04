Joann became a proud grandmother in 2019 when Laura gave birth to

twins Lilyana and CeCe, and later, granddaughter Raina was born in

2023.
She and Norm recently purchased a home in Cape Coral, FL, where

Joann will enjoy her retirement spending time with her family, pursuing

various creative and home improvement projects, and enjoying winters in

sunny Florida as a `snowbird.'
I congratulate Joann on her retirement and I ask my colleagues to

join me in thanking her for her distinguished service to the House and

our Nation.
I wish her all the best as she begins a new chapter in her

life.
