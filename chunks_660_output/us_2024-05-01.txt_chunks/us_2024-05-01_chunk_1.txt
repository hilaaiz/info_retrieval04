Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Maria Contreras Tebbutt, whom I have named the 2024 Climate Crisis Champion for Yolo County because of the important work she has done to promote cycling as an alternative form of transponation to address the impacts of climate change on California's 4th Congressional District.
Maria Contreras Tebbutt was born in King City, California.
She and her husband Mark have a daughter, Nicole.
She is a graduate of Davis High School and has lived in Davis ever since graduation.
Through her role as the Outreach Director of the Bike Campaign, Ms. Contreras Tebbutt has educated our community about the value of cycling.
This campaign, along with its counterpart, the Bike Garage, was founded in 2011 to help teach people about the benefits of cycling and encourage people to ride their bikes more.
These two locations offer training, internships, and jobs for youths, as well as enrichment opportunities for seniors who volunteer.
The Bike Campaign works closely with city governments, county health departments, school districts, and community service groups.
Her advocacy for cycling has also given Ms. Contreras Tebbutt the opportunity to advocate on behalf of seniors and people with disabilities.
She recently partnered with Cycling Without Age--Trishaw Electric's assist rides program, which provides opportunities for seniors and those with disabilities to enjoy cycling in Davis.
This program allows those with mobility limitations to enjoy parks and green spaces more easily.
Her work on this program has given her the opportunity to partner with the Davis Senior Center, the Yolo Healthy Aging Alliance, Yolo Hospice, various faith-based organizations, Rancho Yolo, and various senior residential facilities in the county.
Ms. Contreras Tebbutt's advocacy on behalf of cycling has meaningfully benefited some of the most vulnerable in our community, which is laudable.
Ms. Contreras Tebbutt's cycling work has also given her the opportunity to connect with our local leaders.
She has built partnerships with the City of Davis's Public Works Program, the City of Woodland's Department of Transportation, the Woodland Chamber, the Woodland City Council, and the Davis City Council.
She has also been an influential voice in the planning of various community cycling events, such as the Zombie Ride, Ice Cream Ride, and the Polar Bear Ride.
Ms. Contreras Tebbutt's life-long advocacy for cycling and its mental and physical, as well as environmental, benefits, make her an important community leader in combatting the climate crisis.
Mr. Speaker, it is evident that Maria Contreras Tebbutt is a leader dedicated to promoting cycling as an alternative method of transportation.
Therefore, it is fitting that we honor her here today as Yolo County's 2024 Climate Crisis Champion. ____________________
