Date: 2024-05-01 Volume: 170, Issue: 75 Pages: E428 - E428 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE MISSISSIPPI CENTER FOR CULTURAL PRODUCTION ______ of mississippi in the house of representatives Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Mississippi Center for Cultural Production.
This organization has gone beyond the call of duty to ensure that rural communities in Mississippi are taken care of, and their stories are told.
The Mississippi Center for Cultural Production, also known as ``Sipp Culture,'' is an approach and resource for cultivating thriving communities.
Based in the rural South, Sipp Culture is honoring the history and building the future of Rural Hinds County, especially in the Town of Utica, MS.
Sipp Culture supports community development from the ground up through cultural production focused on self-determination and agency designed by them and for them.
The organization believes that history, culture, and food affirm our individual and collective humanity.
Their goal is to strengthen the local food system, advance health equity, and support rural artistic voices--while activating the power of story--all to promote the legacy and vision of Utica, MS.
At the core of it all is the unwavering belief that gathering and sharing local stories is the best way to support safe and thriving communities for the future.
Honoring growth, story, and imagination is an approach that can cultivate healthy and equitable places everywhere.
For Sipp Culture, it all starts in Utica.
I firmly believe the work Sipp Culture has done for the communities in Hinds County can be a model for what should be done for rural communities all across the United States of America.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing The Mississippi Center for Cultural Production for their service to the citizens of Mississippi. ____________________
