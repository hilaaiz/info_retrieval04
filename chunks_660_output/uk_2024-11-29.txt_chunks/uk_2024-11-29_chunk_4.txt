The family center itself

provides a variety of programs from assisting residents with accessing

health insurance and housing resources to playgroups and family

support.
UpValley also collaborates with over 40 partner organizations

to help engage residents and increase access to services locally.
Over their 25 years of service, UpValley Family Centers' programs

have made significant long-term impacts.
As a Department of Justice

recognized organization, UpValley has helped over 2,000 people become

U.S. citizens in tandem with the Napa Citizenship Legal Services.
They

have increased early literacy, socialization and school readiness

skills in over 1,000 young children through weekly bilingual

playgroups.
Children participating in their youth mentoring services

are more likely to meet requirements needed to attend a 4-year college.
Thousands of low-income households have benefitted from their free VITA

tax filing program, accessing over $11 million in tax credits and

refunds.
They distributed over $2.1 million in emergency funds stemming

from the pandemic and LNU Complex wildfire-related hardships, which

reached over 800 households.
UpValley Family Centers also participates in broader civic

initiatives throughout Napa County.
As part of the Drug-Free

Communities Initiative, they partnered with local officials and helped

pass social host ordinances in Calistoga and St. Helena.
And in 2020,

they served as trusted messengers alongside other Napa County-based

community organizations to increase participation in the 2020 Census.
Napa County saw a 2 percent increase in census participation as a

result of their efforts.
Mr. Speaker, we thank UpValley Family Centers for their dedicated

service to our Napa County community.
Therefore, it is fitting and

proper that we honor them here today.
