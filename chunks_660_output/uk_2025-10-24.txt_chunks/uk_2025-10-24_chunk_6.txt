HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SUPERVISOR JAMES M. ``JIM'' HOLLAND

HON.
JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN

Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy

of the Honorable James M. ``Jim'' Holland, who faithfully served the

people of Chesterfield County's Dale District for nearly two decades

before his passing on October 14, 2025.
I had the honor of working

closely with Jim and witnessing firsthand his deep love for and

unwavering dedication to his constituents.
His kindness, humility, and

steadfast commitment left a lasting impression on everyone who knew

him, and his influence will be felt for generations to come.
Born in Gates County, North Carolina, in 1951, Jim Holland served

honorably in the U.S. Army's 18th Airborne Corps before earning degrees

in accounting and business administration from Fayetteville State

University and North Carolina Central University.
A certified public

accountant, he built a successful practice and later taught accounting

for 24 years at Virginia Commonwealth University, inspiring generations

empowerment.
Elected in 2008, Supervisor Holland was the longest-serving member of

the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, chairing the Board in

2014, 2021, and 2024.
Known for his calm and collaborative leadership,

he guided the county through the Great Recession and the COVID-19

pandemic, championing strong schools, fiscal responsibility, and

community investment.
His dedication led to major improvements in local

infrastructure and the renaming of the Beulah Recreation Center in his

honor in 2025.
Beyond his contributions in local government, he represented

Chesterfield on numerous regional and state boards and was appointed by

multiple Virginia governors for his expertise and judgment.
Deeply

rooted in his faith and community, he served as a deacon and Sunday

school teacher at First Baptist Church Centralia and received the Dr.

Martin Luther King, Jr. Service Leadership Award earlier this year.
Jim Holland is survived by his wife of 52 years, Judith, and their

children, Jessica and James, Chesterfield County and the Commonwealth

legacy will endure in the community he helped build.
