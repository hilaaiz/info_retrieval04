RECOGNIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF BETHEL TEMPLE CHURCH IN HAMPTON,

VIRGINIA

HON.
ROBERT C. ``BOBBY'' SCOTT

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and

celebrate Bethel Temple Church in Hampton, Virginia, on the occasion of

its 70th anniversary.
For seven decades, Bethel Temple has been a

steadfast pillar of faith, service, and fellowship in the Hampton

community.
In the early 1950s, Reverend Beverly W. Fox, then pastor of Phoebus

Assembly of God, led efforts to build a new house of worship.
With the

support of the community, a modest sanctuary was completed and

dedicated as Bethel Assembly of God.
In the summer of 1955, Reverend

Fox and thirty congregants held the church's first service, laying the

foundation for a ministry that would thrive for generations.
Under the leadership of pastors, including Reverends Howard S. Ryan,

G.P. Hertweck, Gerald Ogg, Sammy Hayes, and Arnold Brown, the church

grew in both membership and outreach.
Expanding facilities,

establishing new ministries, and adopting the name Bethel Temple

Assembly of God reflected its evolving mission and growing

congregation.
In the decades that followed, Reverends Ron Johnson and Glenn

Reynolds deepened the church's community engagement through programs

such as the Great Turkey Giveaway, Christmas Toy Giveaway, and weekly

Community Dinner.
These initiatives have benefitted countless families

across Hampton Roads.
Today, under the leadership of Senior Pastor Reverend Charles Ricks,

Jr., and Pastor Lori Ricks, Bethel Temple continues to embody faith in

action.
Through partnerships with local organizations and tireless

service for the Hampton community during the COVID-19 pandemic, they

have strengthened the church's legacy of compassion and service.
Mr. Speaker, as they mark this milestone, I extend my sincere

gratitude to Bethel Temple Church for seventy years of faithful service

and enduring impact on the people of Hampton.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT AND CAREER OF STACEY MORTENSEN

HON.
JOSH HARDER

Mr. HARDER of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today along with my

colleague, Congressman Mark DeSaulnier, to recognize and celebrate the

retirement and career of Stacey Mortensen, whose visionary leadership

has transformed public transportation across the Central Valley and

Northern California.
For more than three decades, Stacey has championed investments in

passenger rail that have connected communities, expanded opportunity,

and laid the groundwork for a more sustainable future.
As Executive

Director of the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, she led the

launch of the Altamont Corridor Express--ACE--in 1998, uniting San

Joaquin, Alameda, and Santa Clara Counties through a first-of-its-kind

commuter rail partnership.
This complex initiative required building

infrastructure and relationships across three different regions, a

challenge Stacey met with innovation and unwavering determination.
Through her work, Stacey helped establish the San Joaquin Joint Powers

Authority and spearheaded the Valley Rail Program, securing nearly $2

billion in funding and enabling major infrastructure projects such as

the Stockton Diamond Grade Separation.
Under her leadership, ACE has continued to evolve to meet modern

needs, including the recent launch of a specialty train service to

Levi's Stadium for San Francisco 49ers games--an example of the

flexible, community-responsive transit vision she has cultivated.
Her

efforts brought together more than 20 local and regional agencies to

develop a shared vision for passenger rail in the Central Valley.
In 2024, Stacey helped launch the Rail Academy of Central California

(TRACC), a critical workforce development program that prepares young

people for careers in the rail industry.
Her deep commitment to the

next generation is reflected in this initiative, which ensures the

continued success and sustainability of our region's transit systems by

investing in talent right here in the Valley.
What truly sets Stacey

apart is her deep belief in partnership and public service.
Her

collaborative approach has not only built rail lines--

it has built trust across counties, cities, and communities.
