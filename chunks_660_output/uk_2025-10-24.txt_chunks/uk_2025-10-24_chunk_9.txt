Her deep commitment to the

next generation is reflected in this initiative, which ensures the

continued success and sustainability of our region's transit systems by

investing in talent right here in the Valley.
What truly sets Stacey

apart is her deep belief in partnership and public service.
Her

collaborative approach has not only built rail lines--

it has built trust across counties, cities, and communities.
Thanks to

her leadership, thousands of Central Valley residents now have better

access to jobs, education, and opportunity.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Stacey Mortensen for her

extraordinary contributions and for her steadfast commitment to the

people of California's Central Valley.

TRIBUTE TO DOUGLAS M. MANCINO

HON.
BRAD SHERMAN

Mr. SHERMAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy

of Douglas M. Mancino, an esteemed attorney, civic leader, and

philanthropist whose distinguished career and lifelong dedication to

public service enriched countless institutions and communities across

the nation.
Mr. Mancino passed away unexpectedly on September 10, 2025,

leaving behind a profound legacy of excellence, compassion, and

integrity.
For more than four decades, Doug Mancino stood as one of the nation's

foremost authorities on health care and tax-exempt organization law.
A

partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP, he counseled hospitals, universities,

foundations, and nonprofit organizations on complex tax, financial, and

regulatory matters.
Mr. Mancino reorganized the Children's Burn

Foundation in 1995 and served for 20 years as its Chairman of the

Board.
He also served as Commissioner, El Pueblo de Los Angeles

Monument Authority and as a member at the Board of Directors for the

Irvine Health Foundation.
His work strengthened the charitable and

health care institutions that form the backbone of our society,

ensuring they could better serve the public good.
Mr. Mancino's leadership in the legal community was both vast and

consequential.
He served as President of the American Health Lawyers

Association, Chair of the American Bar Association's Exempt

Organizations Committee, and Vice-Chair of Publications for the ABA Tax

Section.
He was a Fellow of the American College of Tax Counsel and

served on the Editorial Advisory Board of Taxation of Exempts.
A

prolific author, he wrote or co-authored five books and more than

ninety articles that advanced understanding of nonprofit and health

care law nationwide.
Beyond his professional accomplishments, Doug was a devoted husband

to his wife, Carol, of 52 years, and was known as ``Uncle Spice'' to

his many nieces and nephews.
He was admired not only for his brilliance

but for his kindness.
He was a mentor to many, a trusted colleague, and

a friend whose moral compass never wavered.
His passing is a loss not

only to the legal and nonprofit communities but to all who were

privileged to know him.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Douglas M.

Mancino, whose extraordinary life exemplified the highest ideals of

service, scholarship, and compassion.
We extend our deepest condolences

to his family, friends, and colleagues.
May his memory be a blessing

and his example a continuing inspiration to us all.
