CELEBRATING 200 YEARS OF THE PORT OF GALVESTON

HON.
RANDY K. WEBER, SR.
Mr. WEBER of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a true Texas

treasure, 200 years of the Port of Galveston.
It is an honor to mark

this historic milestone and to recognize the men and women, past and

present, whose hard work, grit, and vision have made this port what it

is today.
I especially want to thank Rodger Rees and the Port's

leadership for their stewardship of this vital gateway to the Gulf.
Mr. Speaker, I've lived on the Texas Gulf Coast my whole life.
Down

here, ports aren't just infrastructure, they're the backbone of our

economy.
Representing seven ports, more than any other Member of

Congress, I know firsthand how critical they are to jobs, commerce,

energy, and America's security.
The Port of Galveston is a shining example.
Established on October

17, 1825, by the Congress of Mexico, it quickly became a hub of

strategic importance.
During the fight for Texas Independence, it

served as the home of the Texas Navy, brave men who risked everything

to secure freedom.
That fight laid the foundation for Galveston to grow

into one of the most important cities on the Gulf Coast.
In 1940, the

people of Galveston, proud, determined, and invested in their future,

came together to purchase their port.
That move secured local control

and ensured the Port's place as an engine of growth for generations.
From a vital shipping center to one of the busiest cruise ports in

the nation, the Port of Galveston continues to adapt and expand.
This

fall, a fourth cruise terminal will open,

bringing more visitors, more commerce, and more opportunity for

Southeast Texas.
Two hundred years is no small achievement.
The Port of Galveston has

stood the test of time, through storms, wars, and economic change, and

it has remained a symbol of Texas perseverance and prosperity.
Mr. Speaker, here's to the next 200 years of success for the Port of

Galveston, for Galveston Island, and for the great state of Texas.

CELEBRATING ROGER CARPENTER'S 75 YEARS OF SERVICE AS SCOUTMASTER OF

TROOP 316, OAK HARBOR, OHIO

HON.
MARCY KAPTUR

Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly remarkable

American, Mr. Roger Carpenter of Oak Harbor, Ohio, who just celebrated

an extraordinary milestone: seventy-five years of service as

Scoutmaster of Troop 316.
Seventy-five years, that's three-quarters of a century of guiding,

teaching, and uplifting generations of young people.
Shaping their

character, their sense of service, and their love for community.
Few

can say they have given so much of themselves, for so long, to a single

purpose.
But Roger Carpenter can.
And he has done so with a humble

heart, steadfast faith, and a pair of calloused hands that never stop

building, fixing, or helping.
At 97 years young, Roger remains active with his troop, recently

repairing the very log splitter used to make the Scouts' famous apple

butter.
This tradition has warmed both hearts and bellies at the Oak

Harbor Apple Festival for decades.
This festival, itself a celebration

of community spirit, fittingly chose this year to honor Roger for his

life of selfless service.
He is believed to be the longest-serving Scoutmaster in our nation's

history.
But beyond the record books, his impact is written in the

lives of the hundreds, more likely perhaps thousands, of young men he

has mentored.
Many of them have gone on to serve their country, their

neighbors, and their families with the same quiet strength they learned

under his guidance.
