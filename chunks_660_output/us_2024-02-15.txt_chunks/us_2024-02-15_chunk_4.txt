WILLIAM LYNCH _____ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. William Lynch for his dedicated service to the Kings County community and to congratulate him on his well-earned retirement from the Kings County Fire Department.
Mr. Lynch's passion for the fire service began 40 years ago as a volunteer firefighter for Kings County Fire Department.
After a few years with the department, Mr. Lynch joined the Hanford Fire Department as a professional firefighter.
He quickly moved up the leadership ranks, and was promoted to Captain in 1995, Assistant Chief Fire Marshal in 2004, and Deputy Chief in 2008.
In 2011, Mr. Lynch was named Kings County Fire Chief following 24 years of dedicated service with the Hanford Fire Department.
After his retirement from the department in 2016, he returned as the Fire Chief in 2020.
Over the course of his career, Mr. Lynch has received many professional certifications by the California State Fire Marshal's Office, including Fire Instructor, Fire Investigator, and Fire Prevention Officer.
Mr. Lynch has served as an instructor of fire technology at College of the Sequoias, as well as an instructor of hazardous materials for the California Standardized Training Institute, where he teaches students the skills required to protect their communities from fire hazards and other dangers.
Throughout his entire career, and in his many different roles, Mr. Lynch continually demonstrated his commitment to ensuring the safety of our community.
Mr. Lynch's decades of service to his community serve as a true testament to his character and leadership abilities.
I am confident the impact he has left on the Kings County Fire Department and the broader Central Valley community will be felt by generations to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Lynch for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy and well-earned retirement. ____________________
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 30 Pages: E153 - E154 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E153-E154] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WEEK ______ HON.
LUCY McBATH of georgia in the house of representatives Mrs. McBATH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of National Entrepreneurship Week.
During Black History Month, I am proud to recognize and celebrate the achievements of Black small business owners and champion solutions that will build on the progress that has been made.
Thanks to historic federal investments through the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act, Black business ownership is growing at its fastest pace in 30 years and Black wealth is up 60% from prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
While we celebrate these historic gains, it is important to recognize the challenges that Black small business owners still face when seeking access to credit.
According to the Alliance for Entrepreneurial Equity, Black-owned businesses are three times more likely to be labeled a higher credit risk than non-Black counterparts, and 72 percent of businesses use personal savings to overcome difficulties accessing credit from other sources.
Business owners in my district have experienced these barriers.
Che Houston, the ``Macaron Maven of Atlanta'' and owner of Che Rene Macarons & More, has herself experienced difficulty securing financing for her growing business.
Despite these challenges, Che's business has continued to grow at a rapid pace.
Last year, she earned recognition as OUT Georgia Business Alliance's New Business of the Year, and she continues to serve as an Ambassador for OUT Georgia Business Alliance where she assists new members in Food and Beverage startups.
She is also a stakeholder with the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs.
