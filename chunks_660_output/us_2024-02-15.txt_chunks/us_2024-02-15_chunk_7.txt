Throughout his life Chaplain Grant worked tirelessly in his service to others.
He filled his time working to help those in need and to make his community a better place.
This is seen in the countless hours he spent serving the members of his community although he did more than just serve.
Rather, chaplain Grant established many of the systems and programs still used to help people in our community to this day.
Chaplain Grant was instrumental in creating multiple institutions in our community such as the LINK Against Hunger and the Good Shepherd Alliance which provides housing services for those in need.
Further, it's this desire for service and compassion for his community which led him to establish the Loudoun County Fire and Rescue Chaplain's Program, the program for which he is perhaps most well-known, in which he was instrumental in providing support and services for the brave men and women of Loudoun County Fire and Rescue.
This legacy of service will be fondly remembered in the community as Chaplain Grant exemplified the ideals of service, dedication, and compassion.
The services and programs he established are being carried on by his successors.
Even after his passing, Chaplain Grant is still watching over his community.
I want to formally recognize the service of Chaplain Grant to our community and the Nation.
He exemplified the ideals of service, charity, and compassion and has irrefutably benefited the lives of countless people of the 10th District of Virginia and our Nation. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ICON, THOMAS N. TODD; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-02-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 30 Pages: E156 - E157 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E156-E157] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE LATE CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ICON, THOMAS N. TODD ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to pay tribute to a remarkable civil rights leader and social justice icon, Thomas N. Todd.
Although his name may not be familiar to everyone, his contributions to social justice and equality in this country are remarkable and have benefited millions of people in ways few others have accomplished.
Tom Todd was one of the most electrifying speakers of our time.
His impressive oratorical skills were so impactful that his initials ``T-N- T'' became synonymous with the powerful effect he had on his audiences.
Tom Todd was born in Demopolis, Alabama, in 1938.
He later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he married Janice Roberts.
They had two children together, Tamara Nicole and Tracey Newborn.
Tom lived in Chicago until he passed away on February 8, 2024.
As a child in Demopolis, Tom's family was poor.
His father passed away shortly after his birth.
Tom was raised by his mother and stepfather.
Unfortunately, his mother also passed away when he was only 20 years old.
Due to his stepfather's illiteracy, Tom stayed in Mobile to help with the funeral and burial arrangements.
He even considered dropping out of school to assist further.
However, he eventually enrolled at Southern University in 1959, where he studied political science and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree.
After graduation, Todd returned to Mobile and worked odd jobs for nearly a year until a friend suggested he apply to law school.
Todd returned to Southern University for law school in 1960 and was admitted solely on the recommendation of a dean who met Todd as an undergraduate and recognized his potential.
There, law professors and students represented other students who had been arrested for sitting at whites- only lunch counters at five-and-dime and drug stores--an act of civil disobedience aimed at protesting segregation in Baton Rouge.
Todd actively participated in the first lawsuit regarding these protests to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, Garner v. Louisiana (1961).
