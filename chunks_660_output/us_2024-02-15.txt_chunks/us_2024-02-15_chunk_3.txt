The Garrett Chapter of the FFA is an excellent example of this service on display.
The students spend many of their days in Northeast Indiana giving back, showing up to community events, and advocating for farmers at every level of government.
The Garrett FFA Chapter has experienced nine decades of often tumultuous history.
Since its founding in the 1930s, its members have persevered and fed America through droughts, wars, and other perilous conditions.
As such, the students who currently constitute this chapter are the recipients of an impressive heritage of Northeast Indiana farmers.
They and their children can be proud to carry on this legacy for the next 90 years or more. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 30 Pages: E157 - E157 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MR.
JACK AMOROSO ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. VALADAO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jack Amoroso for his dedicated service to the Kings County community and to congratulate him on his well-earned retirement from the Hanford Police Department.
Mr. Amoroso was born and raised in San Francisco and moved to the Central Valley in 1974 to attend College of the Sequoias, where he played baseball.
His passion for law enforcement was inspired by his father, who retired as the Deputy Chief of Police of the San Francisco Police Department.
Mr. Amoroso's career in law enforcement began in 1979 at the Hanford Police Department, where he earned two stripes and was promoted to Sergeant.
In 1988, Mr. Amoroso became the Swat Team Leader and Range Master at the Kings County Sherrif's Office.
During his time at the Sherrif's office, Mr. Amoroso was awarded the Medal of Valor to honor his bravery while protecting the Corcoran community and was later promoted to Commander.
In 2009, he retired as Commander and was sworn in as the Police Chief of the Avenal Police Department.
During his tenure as Police Chief, Mr. Amoroso was steadfast in his commitment to reducing violent crime, leading the department to reduce the city's gang crime rate by nearly 80 percent.
In 2023--more than 40 years after he was first hired by the department--Mr. Amoroso returned to the Hanford Police Department, this time as its Interim Police Chief.
In addition to his more than 35 years as a law enforcement officer, Mr. Amoroso has served for decades as an instructor at the Tulare-Kings Counties Police Academy, where he teaches young recruits the skills, responsibilities, and dedication required of future Central Valley law enforcement officers.
From 2017 to 2019, Mr. Amoroso served as the Academy's Director.
It is because of the dedication of public servants like Mr. Amoroso that our future law enforcement officers are prepared to protect our Central Valley communities.
Mr. Amoroso's dedication to his colleagues, his work, and his community is a true testament to his character and leadership.
I know that his service to the Department and his commitment to the safety of Kings County will have a lasting impact for years to come.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Mr. Amoroso for his decades of service to the Central Valley and wishing him a happy and well-deserved retirement.
