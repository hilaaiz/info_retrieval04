Despite these challenges, Che's business has continued to grow at a rapid pace.
Last year, she earned recognition as OUT Georgia Business Alliance's New Business of the Year, and she continues to serve as an Ambassador for OUT Georgia Business Alliance where she assists new members in Food and Beverage startups.
She is also a stakeholder with the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs.
Here in Congress, I am fighting for solutions that will eliminate barriers that business owners like Che face when developing and growing their small businesses.
And back home, I am committed to sharing federal resources that have been made possible through the historic investments from the Biden-Harris Administration.
I urge my colleagues to consider additional solutions to help our entrepreneurs thrive.
Together, we can champion solutions that invigorate our communities and strengthen our economy. ____________________
