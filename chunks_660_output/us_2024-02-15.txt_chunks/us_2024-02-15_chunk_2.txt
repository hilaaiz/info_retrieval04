Mr. Momaday passed away on Wednesday, January 24 in Santa Fe, New Mexico at the age of 89.
I offer my sincerest condolences to his family.
They are in my prayers to find peace and healing.
Mr. Momaday was born in Lawton, Oklahoma on February 27, 1934.
After moving to Arizona, his family moved to Jemez Pueblo, New Mexico, also known as Walatowa--meaning the ``people of the valley.''
There is no surprise in my mind as to why N. Scott Momaday was inspired by this beautiful place, which was often featured in his brilliant works.
Indeed, Mr. Momaday received the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his House Made of Dawn, which is largely credited with igniting a wave of modern Native American literature.
He showed us the power of storytelling and the oral tradition--of bringing imagination to life-- and shed light on the Native experience and culture.
As he once said, ``Our very existence consists in our imagination of ourselves.''
Mr. Momaday also reminded us of the importance of the land.
He wrote, ``We Americans must come again to a moral comprehension of the earth and air.
We must live according to the principle of a land ethic.
The alternative is that we shall not live at all.''
Today I say thank you to N. Scott Momaday for these stories that preserve the beauty of our lands so that in a changing world, they remain indispensable to our collective well-being for years to come.
Mr. Momaday will be forever remembered across Native America and New Mexico.
His writing sparked our imagination and took our hearts to places our bodies have never touched.
He had the ability to paint the picture of a story through the finesse of power in his words.
He created space necessary for creative culture to follow.
For all this and more, we recognize N. Scott Momaday for his indelible influence on the state of New Mexico and to the United States of America. ____________________

Date: 2024-02-15 Volume: 170, Issue: 30 Pages: E154 - E154 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING GARRETT, INDIANA'S FFA CHAPTER ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. BANKS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Garrett, Indiana's FFA Chapter as they celebrate 90 years of community service, leadership, and agricultural education.
Agriculture is at the very heart of Indiana.
Indiana has some of the best farmers in the nation, and America has the best farmers in the world.
Perhaps no organization has had more to do with this than the FFA, which teaches the longstanding values of American farming to each subsequent generation.
Farmers don't just cultivate the land and grow America's food; they serve in other ways too.
The Garrett Chapter of the FFA is an excellent example of this service on display.
The students spend many of their days in Northeast Indiana giving back, showing up to community events, and advocating for farmers at every level of government.
The Garrett FFA Chapter has experienced nine decades of often tumultuous history.
