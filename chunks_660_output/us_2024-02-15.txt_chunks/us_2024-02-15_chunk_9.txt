He advocated for social change and economic empowerment.
When Harold Washington ran for mayor in 1983, Todd headed the campaign's speakers bureau and served as Washington's surrogate.
Because of his magnetism with audiences, he was often called on to warm up the crowd before Washington took the stage.
Todd had a deep voice with a mesmerizing cadence that resembled the voice of James Earl Jones.
His tone was powerful, fluctuating in waves and creating a fascinating rhythm.
A Chicago journalist once described Todd's speaking style as ``a deep, rhythmic growl that carried a sense of the South's segregation history and the

civil rights movement and conveyed a sense of urgency and anger about the present and the future.''
Todd's booming voice got the attention of the iconic hip-hop group Public Enemy, who incorporated Todd's voice as a powerful tool in their 1989 song ``Fight the Power'' for the first 16 seconds and also used his voice to sample ``Revolutionary Generation'' in 1990.
Todd is reputed to have delivered speeches at every historically black college in the country where he would encourage students to let verbs like give, serve, and help guide their actions but to lead their lives defined by nouns like courage, commitment, and compassion.
Tom Todd's journey was one of resilience, courage, and unwavering commitment to the principles of justice--challenging systemic injustices and uplifting marginalized communities.
Through powerful oration and bold, courageous advocacy, he fought to dismantle barriers to equality, promote minority-owned businesses, and advocate for fair employment practices.
Tom Todd transformed lives, empowered communities, and inspired a generation to stand up and fight for what is right.
He leaves a profound and impactful legacy of lasting change that continues to shape our Nation's path forward. ____________________

JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following essay by 1st Place Middle Schooler, Frances Widmer: Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm did many amazing things to pave the way for Black women in politics during her life and legacy.
Her childhood, experience in national politics, and tenure as a congresswomen all speak to the remarkable legacy she left behind.
She paved the way for Black women to lead in politics by pushing against the odds, by running against white men, and by challenging the political system.
Shirley Chisholm was born in Brooklyn, New York, but when she was three she moved to her system parents' homeland of Barbados to live with her grandmother.
She was an intelligent girl and excelled in school and was ``bossy'' to all her older cousins.
When she was eight years old, she moved back to Brooklyn with her parents.
There she would listen into the political conversations her dad would hold and she became more and more interested in politics.
She continued in her education and went to Brooklyn College to study Spanish and sociology, but she was not allowed to study political science because she was a Black woman.
As Shirley became more interested in politics, she attended political meetings and joined the 17th Assembly District Democratic Club.
In her club, she realized that they did more chores, like writing thank you cards and holding fundraisers, than helping their community.
Shirley Chisholm also began to realize that the congressmen were making promises they could not keep.
Wanting to change all of these things, she got Into action.
In 1968 Shirley Chisholm was the first Black woman to be elected to congress.
