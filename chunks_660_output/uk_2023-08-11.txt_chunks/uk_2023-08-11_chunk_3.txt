She peacefully passed away at her

Fresno home on July 23, 2023, leaving behind a legacy of compassion,

determination, and lasting influence.
Born on November 11, 1942, in Hanford, California, Diana's journey

began on a dairy farm in Easton, California, surrounded by the love of

her parents and five brothers.
Her heart radiated with a genuine

concern for others from an early age, a trait that would define her

entire life.
Diana attended Washington Union High School, excelling

academically, and serving as the editor of the school's newspaper, a

role that foreshadowed her lifelong dedication to sharing stories and

voices.
Diana's path intertwined with that of her soulmate, Mike Decker, in

1963.
Their story unfolded with a sense of fate, and on July 4, 1964,

they embarked on a journey of love that spanned 53 remarkable years.
Together, they raised a family and built a legacy of love, resilience,

and unwavering commitment to one another.
Diana's passion for early childhood education was both a vocation and

a calling.
For over 30 years, she poured her heart and soul into

advocating for the youngest members of our society.
Her contributions

to the Central California Association of Young Children were

immeasurable, embodying her dedication through roles such as Chapter

President, Community Outreach advocate, Governing Board member, and was

the very first recipient of the Fansler Institute ECE Leader of the

Year award for her contributions to the educational community.
She

continued to shine her light at the state level, serving as a Central

California representative on the State board of the California

Association for the Education of Young Children, leaving an indelible

mark on the landscape of childhood education across the State.
Diana's impact extended to her teaching career, empowering children,

and adults with her wisdom.
Her role as a special education teacher for

Central Unified and later as a Special Education Specialist Lead for

the Merced County Office of Education, CPIN, exemplified her dedication

to fostering growth and potential in every individual.
Her compassion

radiated not only in her professional endeavors but also within her

family.
As a loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, she

left an indelible mark of love, unity, and boundless support.
As we mourn Diana's physical absence, we find solace in the beautiful

memories and legacy of love she has gifted us.
Her life's tapestry is

woven with threads of compassion, kindness, and resilience, reminding

us that the impact of a single life, lived with purpose, can reach far

beyond the confines of time.
Diana is survived by her three children:

Timothy John Decker of Pagosa Springs, Colorado; Katie Marie Decker and

Scott Arthur Decker, both Fresno, California and daughter-in-law Marie

Estrada Decker.
Her legacy also includes three grandchildren: Michael

Anthony Hill, Jadyn Decker Garrett, and Nicho Decker, as well as a

great-granddaughter, Neelia Grace Hill.
She is also survived by her

brothers Gene Roza and his wife, Marylou Roza; Robert Roza and his

wife, Gail Roza; and Franklin Roza.
Numerous cousins, including myself,

nieces, and nephews also cherish her memory.
May we honor Diana's memory by carrying forward her torch of

compassion, nurturing the dreams of our youth, and supporting one

another with the unwavering devotion she showed throughout her

remarkable journey.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my esteemed colleagues to join me in honoring the

legacy of Dorothy Diana (Roza) Decker, a dedicated educator whose

commitment to early childhood education has profoundly shaped the lives

of many.
Her contributions will continue to inspire generations,

fostering a love for learning and education.
