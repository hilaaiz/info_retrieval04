Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I celebrate the accomplishments of Noah Wertzberger and his recent achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout.
Noah embarked on his scouting journey as a K-cub during his kindergarten years.
Throughout his scouting experience, he remained actively involved and just recently completed his Eagle Project in October.
His project involved the removal of two Osprey nests situated on the Great Egg Harbor Watershed.
Once those were removed, he constructed and installed replacement Osprey Nests with the help of the Great Egg Harbor Watershed Association.
Noah is extremely grateful for Troop Seventy-Nine and the Boy Scouts for imparting invaluable lessons and fostering friendships.
After achieving the prestigious rank of Eagle Scout, he now serves as an assistant scoutmaster, providing ongoing assistance to the Troop.
In the upcoming fall, he will be attending Seton Hall University.
Noah should be incredibly proud of his accomplishments, and I know he has a bright future ahead of him.
God Bless Noah Wertzberger and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________
