Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I celebrate the accomplishments of Noah Quinton Brown and his recent achievement of the rank of Eagle Scout.
Noah began scouting at the age of five, following in the footsteps of four generations of family before him.
Now, having reached the highest rank in scouting, we celebrate his achievements.
During his time in the Scouts, Noah has participated in countless fundraising and community service activities along with many different camping and hiking adventures.
In July of 2022, Noah completed a 60- mile Trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico where he achieved the Boy Scout 50 miler award.
For his Eagle Scout Project, he built benches, a water station, and rehabilitated a pavilion for use by spectators at cycling events put on by Camp Edge in Alloway, South Jersey.
His remains active in the scouts with his current position of Junior Assistant Scoutmaster at Troop 60 in Daretown, South Jersey.
Noah is now a junior at Woodstown High School, consistently earning his way on to the Honor Roll.
Outside of scouting, he is an athlete on his school's Varsity Track and Field team and a volunteer at his church, all while maintaining a job at a local farm.
Along with his Eagle Scout award, Noah will be presented with the Bronze and Gold palms for his remarkable leadership and his willingness to accept responsibility.
I am incredibly proud of Noah for all his accomplishments in the Scouts and I know he has a bright future ahead of him.
God Bless Noah and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________
