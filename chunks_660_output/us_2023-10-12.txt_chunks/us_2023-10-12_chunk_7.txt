Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to recognize and congratulate Mayor Joseph Thallemer, who is completing his tenure of dedicated service to Warsaw.
Indiana at the end of this year.
Currently serving in his third term as Mayor.
Joe Thallemer has long advocated solutions that make Warsaw a better place to live, work, and raise a family, and that maintain and build on Warsaw's status as the Medical Device and Orthopedic Capital of the World.
Prior to becoming Mayor.
Joe Thallemer also served on the City Council and the Warsaw Plan Commission, meaning his record of faithfully serving Warsaw runs nearly three decades deep.
Beyond City Hall, many Hoosiers know Joe through his Optometry practice that he established in Warsaw in 1980.
Outside of his medical practice and elected office, Joe has also given back to the community he and his wife Jill call home by serving on the local YMCA board as well as in church and school activities with Jill and their four children.
As he prepares to step down as Mayor, spend more time with his family, and write the next chapter of his life, I am proud to congratulate Joe Thallemer on a distinguished career and a job well done.
The Warsaw community is unquestionably better off thanks to this good man with a servant's heart.
I join Hoosiers throughout Indiana's Second Congressional District in expressing our gratitude to Mayor Thallemer for his service and in wishing him and his wonderful family nothing but the very best going forward. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 167 Pages: E962 - E962 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DANIELLE ``DANI'' DUGGAN ______ of massachusetts in the house of representatives Mr. KEATING.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in honor of the life of Danielle ``Dani'' Duggan.
Born on May 7, 1966, Dani was raised in Middleborough, Massachusetts, where she found a passion for the arts at a young age.
After graduating as an honors student from Middleborough High School in 1984, Dani went on to study at St. Michael's College, where she received an honors Bachelor of Arts degree in fine arts and theatre and was the recipient of the Delta Epsilon Sigma Society Departmental Award for outstanding achievement in fine arts.
Dani then moved to Dublin, Ireland to work for the famous Abbey Theatre.
This is where she also met her husband, Gerry Clements.
She lived in Ireland for eight years receiving an honors master's degree in modern drama from University College Dublin and would later form the Salem Willows Theatre Company.
Dani returned to the U.S. with her husband, Gerry, moving to Pembroke, Massachusetts, and over the next 24 years, she taught drama at Middleborough High School.
During her time at MHS, she became chair of the fine arts department and played a pivotal role in the design and construction of the new Middleborough High School Performing Arts Center and Blackbox Theatre.
At MHS, Dani directed numerous school productions and the speech & theater workshop, as well as several productions with the Plymouth Community Theatre.
Sadly, Dani left us too soon on October 15, 2022, after a two year battle with cancer.
Whether during her time at Middleborough High School or her work with the Abbey Theatre, Dani's passion for sharing her love for the arts serves as an example to all.
Throughout her years at Middleborough High School, Dani laid the groundwork for the school district to hold an annual event celebrating students' work in the fine arts.
On May 20, 2023, Middleborough held its inaugural Dani Duggan Fine Arts Festival to honor Dani's legacy.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am proud to honor the life of Dani Duggan.
