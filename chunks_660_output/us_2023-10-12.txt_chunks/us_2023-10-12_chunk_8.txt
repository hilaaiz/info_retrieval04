Date: 2023-10-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 167 Pages: E962 - E962 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE WILSON FAMILY'S FARM, COTTON HILLS FARM IN LOWRYS, SOUTH CAROLINA ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. NORMAN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognzie the outstanding work of the Wilson Family in Lowrys, South Carolina and their dedication to providing locally grown produce for over 140 years.
Cotton Hills Farm was given to Joseph Wilson and Theodosia Abel as a wedding gift by the bride's father in 1880.
It has been passed down multiple generations and is now run by JEB Wilson along with his brother, Pete, and his father, Jeff.
For 100 years, cotton had been the primary crop planted on Cotton Hills Farm.
Starting in the 1940s, JEB's grandfather started planting peaches as well.
Today, the family farm has expanded to pumpkins, peaches, watermelon, and cantaloupe.
JEB Wilson has proudly said, ``basically anything that can be grown in South Carolina, we grow it.''
The family also operates three retail locations in Chester County, South Carolina and sells wholesale produce.
Conservation and sustainability have been a key element to the long- term success of Cotton Hills Farm.
The Wilson family is constantly looking for ways to improve the farm and keep it sustainable for years to come.
I would like to recognize that the entire family is also very accomplished in their community.
Jeff is a long-serving member of the Soil and Water Conservation District in Chester County and currently serving as the vice chairman.
Additionally, JEB and Pete have been named Conservationist of the Year in Chester County.
JEB credits the family's success to their adaptability to challenges and willingness to try new farming methods that will continue to decrease their environmental impact.
The Wilson family continues to be devoted to their farm and are looking forward to passing it down the family line.
On behalf of the 5th District of South Carolina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recognize Cotton Hills Farm and the Wilson family for their great service to our state.
Please join me in recognizing the farm on its advancements in agricultural innovation and conservation. ____________________
