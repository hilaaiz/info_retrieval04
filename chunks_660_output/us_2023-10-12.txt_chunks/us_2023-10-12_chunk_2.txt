Ms. Smith led the organizational process that created the Measure M Traffic Relief Act (Measure M).
She worked to include it on the 2004 ballot and to ensure it passed.
This quarter cent sales tax has been successfully used to improve transportation, transit, safety, and the widening of Highway 101 for carpool lanes.
In addition, she oversaw long range planning, and collaborated with partner agencies and the public on policy priorities.
Additionally, she was instrumental in the founding legislation for Sonoma Marin Area Rail Transit District (SMART) and the Sonoma County Regional Climate Protection Authority.
In 1997, Ms. Smith had three goals: to get a sales tax measure passed to support transportation, widen Highway 101, and establish train service.
She not only accomplished her goals, but she has also acted as an incredible leader for the community of Sonoma County.
She has made and maintained effective partnerships with agencies and elected officials nationwide and has directed the Sonoma County Transit Authority and Regional Climate Protection Authority through economic downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic.
She has served with integrity, foresight, thoughtfulness, and unquestionable dedication and commitment.
Ms. Smith demonstrated exceptional interpersonal skills and an innate understanding of how politics work and how to move projects forward.
Throughout her professional career, Ms. Smith also served as the district director for State Assembly Member Valerie Brown.
She worked on policy issues such as transportation, education, and local government.
Ms. Smith is revered by her colleagues not just for her work but also for her friendliness and collegiality.
When she is not working, she also loves to spend time with her family including her husband, Tim, her mom, Barbara, her stepchildren, Katie

Mason, Nick Smith, and Emily Angelopoulos, and her grandchildren, Cam, Nick, Sidney, Ben, Anthony, and Dominic.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is therefore fitting and proper that we recognize Suzanne Smith for her longtime service at the Sonoma County Transit Authority and Regional Climate Protection Authority. ____________________
