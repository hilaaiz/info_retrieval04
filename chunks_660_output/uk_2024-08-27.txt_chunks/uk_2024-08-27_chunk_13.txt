Must we continue a 50-year-old triad strategy without

considering the alternatives?
Why, why are we stuck in a logic silo

with the blast door closed?
I want to end this with a discussion I had with the captain of a

United Kingdom nuclear-armed submarine.
After touring his ship, I

stopped at the foot of the ladder to thank him for the discussion.
I

said ``I appreciate the enormous responsibility and difficult task that

you have.
If you receive a message to launch your missiles, and you do,

what do you do next?
Go home?''
I'll never forget the look on his face.
I don't know if he had ever contemplated that question, but that's a

question that we must all ask today.
