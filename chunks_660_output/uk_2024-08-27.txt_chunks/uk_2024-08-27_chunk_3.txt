Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor a

remarkable leader, Fire Chief Mike Starr, who has dedicated 27 years of

his life to serving and protecting the citizens of Southlake, Texas.
In

1997, Starr joined the Southlake Fire Department, working as a

firefighter and paramedic.
As a result of his unwavering dedication and

commitment, he rose through the ranks, taking on the positions of

driver, engineer, and captain of operations.
Then, in 2008, Starr

earned the title of Fire Chief, a role he has used to make a lasting

impact in North Texas.
During his tenure as Fire Chief, Mike Starr led the department

through a period of significant growth and transformation.
Under his

leadership, the department expanded its personnel from 45 to 74 members

and oversaw the openings of Station 1 DPS Headquarters and the Station

3 North training facility.
Chief Starr's vision and commitment to

excellence have been the driving force behind these achievements,

ensuring that the fire department not only meets but exceeds the needs

of our growing community.
Throughout his distinguished career, Chief

Starr has embodied what it means to be a true leader.
His dedication

and hard work have been recognized through numerous honors, including

the Teamwork Award in 1998 and the Director's Award in 2006.
In 2007,

he was named Firefighter of the Year, a testament to his outstanding

service.
Chief Starr has always focused on leading and developing a department

that models best-in-class service delivery.
In the Fire Department's

2023 annual report, Chief Starr highlighted the importance of

continuous improvement through daily ``quick drills'' for line

personnel, ensuring operational effectiveness and preparedness.
His

leadership has been invaluable, and as Southlake City Manager Alison

Ortowski noted, his guidance has been instrumental in navigating the

challenges of growing a fire department while maintaining the highest

standards of service.
As Chief Starr prepares to retire at the end of August, it is both an

honor and a privilege to recognize his 27 years of exemplary service.
I

would like to extend my deepest gratitude for his contributions and

wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

HONORING TEXAS-24 HOMETOWN HERO SANDY LAUDER

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor our Texas-24 Hometown

Hero, Sandy Lauder.
Over the last two decades, Sandy has spent

thousands of hours volunteering in the Richardson community.
He has

been a dedicated volunteer with Richardson Police Department's

Volunteers in Police Service program for nearly 17 years, along with

completing Richardson Citizen Police Academy's Class 25.
To this day,

Sandy still serves on the board of the Citizen Police Academy Alumni

Association.
In 2015, Sandy joined the Richardson Community Band where he plays a

dual role as trombonist and band president.
As the president, Sandy

collaborates with other bands in the area to perform jazz and big band

classics for Richardson Senior Center, retirement homes, community

fairs, and the Dallas VA Hospital.
Sandy also teaches English and

citizenship classes at Woodcreek Church in Richardson as part of the

Building English Skills Together program.
Previously, he served as

president of his homeowner's association, and he currently coordinates

his neighborhood's crime watch patrol.
Sandy's community involvement spans beyond Richardson city limits.
For 20 years, he has volunteered as a DFW Airport Ambassador, greeting

international guests and answering their questions.
According to the

DFW Airport Customer Programs Coordinator, Sandy ``has been a superhero

coming to the aid of millions of travelers through his service.
He is

kind and helpful to all who work around him and he rarely misses a

shift.''
At 91 years young, he credits his longevity to ``staying

positive and volunteering.''
In his own words, ``It's never too late to

enjoy life and serve your fellow man.''
I'd like to thank Sandy Lauder for going above and beyond to serve

our North Texas community.
