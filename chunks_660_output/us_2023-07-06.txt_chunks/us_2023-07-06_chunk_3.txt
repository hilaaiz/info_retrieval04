Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce a bill that would expand the mission of the National Park Service (NPS) to include active use of National Park System units located in urban areas.
The idea for this bill came from a new report authored by George Washington University's Sumner M. Redstone Global Center for Prevention and Wellness that examined strategies to create a more equitable and activated park system in the District of Columbia.
As the report notes, NPS parks in D.C. are ``inconsistently managed and inequitably maintained'' and ``do not meet the needs of people who both live near and experience the park system as a part of their daily lives.''
Efforts to activate and improve local parks have been hindered by limitations on NPS's statutory authority.
NPS's primary mission is to preserve spaces for the enjoyment of future generations.
This noble mission was crafted for the purpose of wilderness preservation, allowing nature to remain untouched by time.
However, in addition to grand national parks, NPS also owns neighborhood parks in urban areas.
For example, more than 20 percent of D.C. land consists of parkland, and NPS owns nearly 90 percent of it, over two-thirds of which is local, neighborhood parks, smaller than one acre.
These parks could benefit from improvements that prioritize community engagement, including trails, playgrounds and benches.
However, NPS's mission is limited to preserving land as it currently exists.
This mission is ill- suited to address the unique and immediate needs of urban neighborhood parks.
This bill would expand the mission of NPS to include the promotion of active use of its parks located in urban areas.
Active use prioritizes current enjoyment by people and improves quality of life, including playgrounds, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly infrastructure, sports and recreation facilities, community events, programming and concessions.
This expanded mission would only apply to parks located in areas that have been defined and designated as ``urban'' in the most recent decennial census by the Secretary of Commerce, and would not impact wilderness areas.
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

Date: 2023-07-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 116 Pages: E638 - E639 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E638-E639] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING STOP PENTAGON PRICE GOUGING ACT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, today I reintroduce the ``Stop Pentagon Price Gouging Act'' with Representative DeLuzio (D-PA-17) as the original cosponsor.
I thank U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mike Braun (R-IN) for sponsoring the companion bill.
These important reforms will protect taxpayers from being overcharged for goods procured by the Department of Defense.
Our bicameral, bipartisan bill would close loopholes in current acquisition laws, tie financial incentives for contractors to performance, and provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with the information necessary to prevent future rip-offs.
Our bill would make several key reforms to achieve those goals.
First, our bill would ensure competitive and transparent pricing by closing a loophole and ensuring that defense contractors provide the federal government cost or pricing information in all cases where there isn't adequate price competition that results in at least 2 competitive bids.
Second, the bill would restore market dynamics and ensure that commercial goods are those actually sold to customers other than just the federal government, revising the definition of commercial item for federal procurement by the Department of Defense.
