Our bill would make several key reforms to achieve those goals.
First, our bill would ensure competitive and transparent pricing by closing a loophole and ensuring that defense contractors provide the federal government cost or pricing information in all cases where there isn't adequate price competition that results in at least 2 competitive bids.
Second, the bill would restore market dynamics and ensure that commercial goods are those actually sold to customers other than just the federal government, revising the definition of commercial item for federal procurement by the Department of Defense.
Third, the bill would ensure payment is tied to performance by creating a new pilot program for progress payments, which will help to tie payments to performance by providing contractors the opportunity to receive advance payments only when they meet certain conditions such as providing timely responses, disclosing important data, and meeting small business subcontractor goals.
Lastly, the bill would ensure that our defense dollars are being spent to provide our armed forces with the resources they need and not to line the pockets of defense contractor executives, requiring disclosures from defense contractors mirroring those already required by publicly traded companies.
Taken together, this bill will be an important step in tackling price gouging, overbilling, or outright fraud by defense contractors.
As a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, I know how much we pay for parts to keep military equipment ready.
We know that taxpayers are routinely overcharged due to loopholes in current law and federal procurement regulations.
We cannot allow taxpayer money to be wasted to inflate the bottom lines of multinational defense contractors.
Our service members need the tools to properly negotiate prices.
This is just common sense, and that's why we are reintroducing this bill today.
Mr. Speaker, Representative DeLuzio and I look forward to working across the aisle to advance these key reforms in the ``Stop Pentagon Price Gouging Act.''
I encourage all members to join us in cosponsoring this commonsense bill. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MUENSTER STATE BANK; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
116



Date: 2023-07-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 116 Pages: E639 - E639 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MUENSTER STATE BANK ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Muenster State Bank on their 100th Anniversary, celebrating their opening to serve North Texans on July 2, 1923.
Early in 1923, a group of local leaders from the small German Catholic community of Muenster, Texas decided that if the town of less than 450 residents was going to continue to grow and prosper, a bank was necessary.
This group, made up of businessmen and farmers, met in J.W. Meurer's hardware store to request that J.W. take on a leadership role in the formation of this new bank.
The group was apprehensive that the required funds could be raised to supply the necessary capital and deposits, considering that the previous private bank had already failed twice.
Assured that adequate stock could be sold, the group prevailed upon Mr. Meurer to continue in his leadership role and to take charge of the organization and operation of the bank.
They looked for additional assistance and discovered through interviews that experienced bankers could be found but were unaffordable for this new bank venture.
Mr. Meurer knew his brother-in-law, J.M. Weinzapfel, had the business acumen required and was available, but at the time lived over 60 miles away in Windthorst, Texas.
Upon being offered the job, Mr. Weinzapfel moved to Muenster to assist with the necessary paperwork to secure a charter and future operations.
The original 21 stockholders in the bank successfully raised $19,250.00 in total capital to obtain the State Charter and on Friday, June 29, 1923, the State of Texas granted them Bank Charter No.
1400.
