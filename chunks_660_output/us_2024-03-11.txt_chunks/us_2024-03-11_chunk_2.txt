Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a beloved member of our community, Tom Kamerling.
On Tuesday, we lost a true legend, a man whose voice resonated through the halls of Arkansas Tech Univerity for many years.
Tom's contributions to our community, both on and off the airwaves, will be forever cherished and remembered.
As the public address voice of the Arkansas Tech Wonder Boys and Golden Suns, Tom was more than just a broadcaster; he was the embodiment of professionalism and dedication.
His voice became synonymous with Tech athletics, guiding fans through countless memorable moments with his unmistakable tone and unrivaled passion for the game.
His impact extended far beyond the broadcasting booth.
Tom's kindness and generosity touched the lives of everyone he encountered.
Whether as a mentor to aspiring broadcasters or as a friend to those in need, he always went above and beyond to make a positive difference.
His unwavering faith and commitment to serving others serve as an inspiration to us all.
Even in his absence, his spirit will continue to guide and uplift our community for generations to come.
My thoughts and prayers are with Tom's family and loved ones during this difficult time.
May they find solace in the knowledge that his legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.
In honor of his memory, let us strive to embody the same kindness, professionalism, and unwavering faith that defined Tom Kamerling's life. ____________________
