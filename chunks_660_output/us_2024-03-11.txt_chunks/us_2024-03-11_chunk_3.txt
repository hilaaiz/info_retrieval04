She inspired these students with her own work and her own academic journey.
Dr. Cocco De Filippis herself graduated summa cum laude from Queens College, with a Bachelor's in English and Spanish Literature, and then went on to pursue a Master of Arts in Spanish Literature, again from Queens College.
Dr. Cocco De Filippis didn't stop there: she pursued a Master of Philosophy in Spanish Literature and a Ph.D. in Latin American Literature from the City University of New York Graduate Center.
She was also the first person of Dominican ancestry to do so, cementing her legacy as a legendary pioneer in Dominican women's studies, Caribbean, and Dominican Diaspora literatures.
For her work in these fields, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Santo Domingo, the oldest university in the Americas.
Dr. Cocco De Filippis' resume is no doubt an inspiration to her students, just as it is an inspiration to me.
Dr. Cocco De Filippis returned to Hostos Community College in 2020 as President and led the school through the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, navigating the difficult world of online learning and community preparedness with grace and hope.

RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BOROUGH OF WHITE HAVEN; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-03-11 Volume: 170, Issue: 43 Pages: E239 - E239 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BOROUGH OF WHITE HAVEN ______ of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Mr. CARTWRIGHT.
Mr. Speaker, today I recognize the Borough of White Haven, Pennsylvania, in honor of its bicentennial celebration.
The Borough of White Haven is situated on the eastern edge of Luzerne County and borders the beautiful Lehigh River at the entrance of the Pocono Mountains.
White Haven was founded as a settlement in 1824, making it the oldest established community in this area of Luzerne County.
Incorporated as a Borough in 1842, White Haven was named after Josiah White, an enterprising citizen and builder of the old-fashioned ``bear trap'' locks that made the Lehigh River navigable.
The early settlers could not have predicted the immense importance of White Haven in Pennsylvania's--and the nation's--economic growth and industrialization efforts.
By the 1840s, anthracite coal mining was booming in the nearby Wyoming Valley and White Haven would become a central trade hub.
A railroad was built from the Wyoming Valley to White Haven, where the canal system allowed the coal to be carried to market on barges.
The Borough also boasted Pennsylvania's busiest lumber depots at the time, producing 20 million feet of lumber annually at its peak.
Today, White Haven is a quaint town featuring a main street with shops and restaurants and lovely tree-lined streets.
It also serves as a recreational hub with the Lehigh Gorge State Park on its border and the Delaware and Lehigh Anthracite Trail in its downtown.
With its picturesque views, charming architecture, and friendly residents, it is easy to see why so many choose to call White Haven home.
White Haven played a critical role in Pennsylvania's history and the industrialization of our nation.
