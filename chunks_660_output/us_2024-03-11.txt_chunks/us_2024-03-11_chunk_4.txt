It also serves as a recreational hub with the Lehigh Gorge State Park on its border and the Delaware and Lehigh Anthracite Trail in its downtown.
With its picturesque views, charming architecture, and friendly residents, it is easy to see why so many choose to call White Haven home.
White Haven played a critical role in Pennsylvania's history and the industrialization of our nation.
Over the past two centuries, the Borough has demonstrated a commitment to persistence and progress, a trend which will no doubt continue and contribute to the prosperity of this treasured community for centuries to come. ____________________

Date: 2024-03-11 Volume: 170, Issue: 43 Pages: E237 - E237 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF MR.
GARY NELSON ______ of washington in the house of representatives Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Gary Nelson for his many years of public service to our community as he enters his retirement.
As the Executive Director of the Port of Grays Harbor for nearly 24 years, Mr. Nelson has demonstrated unparalleled leadership and advocacy for the Grays Harbor community.
Mr. Nelson joined the Port of Grays Harbor in 2000, when there were only 21 vessel calls handling 85,000 tons of cargo.
When Mr. Nelson stepped into leadership, the Port of Grays Harbor, like many other communities in my district, had fallen on hard times when the timber industry took it on the chin.
Some folks feared that good things couldn't happen in Grays Harbor County anymore.
But not Gary.
Under his visionary leadership over the last 24 years, the number of vessel calls increased nearly 500 percent, and the number of metric tons of cargo was up over 3 million in 2023.
During his tenure at the Port of Grays Harbor, Mr. Nelson oversaw the diversification of the Port's revenue streams and business ventures.
This includes the operations at Satsop Business Park and recreational facilities at Friends Landing.
He oversaw more than $275 million in private investment throughout Port facilities, as weII as millions of dollars in federal and state grants to modernize and improve the Westport Marina, Marine Terminals in Aberdeen, and the Bowerman Airport, positioning the Port to accommodate current and future economic growth.
Gary's leadership will continue to impact the entire region for years to come.
Put simply, because of Gary Nelson, there are people in Grays Harbor who now have jobs.
Because of Gary Nelson, there are families that can now put food on the table.
Because of Gary Nelson, the future for our region is brighter.
Beyond his local impact, Mr. Nelson is a nationally recognized leader in the industry.
He served as the Chair of the American Association of Port Authorities from 2019 to 2020, chaired the Washington Public Ports Association Legislative Committee, and served on the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association Executive Board.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud and thank Gary Nelson for his amazing tenure.
Gary's passionate and caring stewardship of the Port of Grays Harbor has impacted the future of the community and shown that not only can good things happen in Grays Harbor County--great things can.
I wish him the best in his retirement.
He will be sorely missed.
I am pleased to recognize Mr. Gary Nelson in the United States Congress. ____________________
