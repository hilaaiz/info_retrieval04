Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 12 New Hampshire individuals for their recent act of bravery in the Town of Alton.
When a man's jet ski began to sink into the frigid November waters of Lake Winnipesaukee, seven New Hampshire Department of Transportation (NHDOT) employees and five Top Notch Tree Service employees stepped in to save the man from drowning.
I commend the NHDOT workers and the Top Notch Tree Team, as well as the EMS response crew, for their efforts to rescue the man and provide him with needed care.
While removing an old dock from the Alton shoreline, the team of good samaritans heard screams and cries for help from the water.
As soon as the workers discovered that a man on a jet ski was sinking deeper into the lake, they jumped into action.
Some rescuers ran to Sandy Point Beach Resort to secure a kayak and canoe to row to the man, others called 911 and urged him to continue swimming.
When the kayaker reached the sinking jet ski, the drowning man latched onto the rescuer's kayak and was paddled to shore.
Although the man was initially unresponsive when brought to shore, hard-working EMS personnel quickly revived him.
The NHDOT and Top Notch Tree teams' quick and effective response to the situation is a result of their empathy, brilliance, and sound judgment.
By acting quickly and delegating responsibilities, the rescuers were able to reach the man and save him before it was too late.
I commend these individuals for demonstrating a calculated and successful save in a difficult situation.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I want to thank these selfless and courageous individuals.
Let their courage and heroism serve as an example for us all. ____________________

CURTIS, U.S. ARMY, RETIRED ______ of texas in the house of representatives Mr. CARTER of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Staff Sergeant Willie A. Curtis, U.S. Army, with a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
His excellent service to both the Army and his local community is a shining example of citizenship and commitment to duty.
During SSG Curtis's 20+ years of service to the United States Army, he went above and beyond to serve his country.
Due to his extensive period serving our country, he earned many awards such as the Army Commendation Medal, an Army Achievement Medal, and a National Defense Service Medal, among other medals, decorations, and badges.
Upon retirement, SSG Curtis settled in Taylor, Texas.
An eternal optimist, he has an enormous heart and an endless capacity to contribute his time, energy, and resources to assist local students, the homeless, and first responders.
Whether it's organizing public music events or celebrating the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr., SSG Curtis is renowned as a man unafraid to do the hard work to do good for his neighbors.
When I reflect on SSG Curtis' life of service over the years, I am reminded of the teachings of Christ when he taught, ``Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.''
To SSG Curtis, these are not mere words but a summons by which to live a fulfilling life.
He is a fitting recipient of a Congressional Veteran Commendation.
