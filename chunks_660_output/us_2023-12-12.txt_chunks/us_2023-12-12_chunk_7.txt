In the weeks before his death, Gabe shared with me a message to all our progeny.
``Don't make excuses, if you work hard, look forward and not backwards you can accomplish anything with just an average aptitude.''
Gabe shared his life with his beloved wife, business partner and best friend, Shirley A. Ellis, who for over 41 years supported each other in health and sickness, exemplifying a dynamic and supportive partnership.
Gabe's role as a great provider extended beyond his immediate family, as he generously shared his wisdom with mentees, especially young men, offering valuable insights into the trade.
Personally, Gabriel supported me during some of the most challenging times of my life.
My brother-in-love was a comforting resource for me as an 18-year-old new parent, as a candidate without a dime to donate to my own campaign, as a ``handy'' friend who rescued me time and time again as a new homeowner of an old house.
Mr. Speaker, Gabriel Lee Shaw, Jr., was a cherished member of Milwaukee, the 4th Congressional District, and the entire State of Wisconsin.
He is an example of how patriotism, hard work, lifelong learning, and kindness can create a fulfilling life, I will always treasure his personal impact on me, and I rise to honor the late Gabriel L. Shaw, Jr. ____________________
