TRIBUTE TO GABRIEL LEE SHAW, JR.;
Congressional Record Vol.

204



Date: 2023-12-12 Volume: 169, Issue: 204 Pages: E1215 - E1215 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO GABRIEL LEE SHAW, JR. ______
of wisconsin in the house of representatives Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and service of Gabriel (Gabe) Lee Shaw, Jr., a dedicated individual, a family-oriented man, a lifelong learner, and one of my dearest friends.
I fondly referred to him as my ``brother-in-love,'' it saddens me to say that Gabe passed peacefully on Thursday, December 7, 2023, with his beloved wife of 41 years, Shirley Ellis, District Director of Wisconsin's 4th Congressional District by his side.
The breadth of Gabe's accomplishments far exceeds his 78 years.
Gabe was born in Osceola, Arkansas, into the loving union of Gabriel Lee Shaw and Mary Hall Shaw.
Gabe's life began as the first son among eight children, including five daughters and three sons.
Graduating from North Division High School in 1963, he embarked on a path of hard work and continuous learning, which led him to proudly join the United States Air Force at the age of 17 the same year.
His dedication was evident as he graduated from the U.S. Air Force Explosive Ordinance Disposal School at Eglin AFB in Florida.
Gabe's military service was exceptional, marked by holding one of the highest security clearances during the Vietnam era, concluding with an honorable discharge in 1968.
Gabe's work ethic and commitment to detail became a hallmark of his character.
He often declared, ``you cannot talk work done,'' demonstrating his resolve to address and solve any challenge thrown his way.
Following his military service, his pursuit of knowledge persisted, leading him to enroll in both UW-Platteville and UW-Milwaukee with a focus on mathematics.
His passion for cars propelled him to become an Automotive Service Excellence Certified technician.
Known for his love of challenges, Gabe accomplished the remarkable feat of passing all eight comprehensive exams required for the Automotive Excellence certificate on his first attempt, maintaining this certification for an impressive 15 years.
He later attended Milwaukee Area Technical College and became a certified Air Conditioning and Heating Specialist.
Gabe retired from Miller Brewing Company in 2005 after 30 years of service.
His illustrious 30-year tenure at Miller Brewing Company showcased his dedication and loyalty.
Gabe, son of a carpenter, had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge that extended to various subjects, including taxes, carpentry, electrical work, masonry, and heating/cooling.
This extensive expertise paved the way for his successful career, culminating in becoming a licensed Real Estate Broker in 1977.
With a wealth of knowledge, Gabe thrived as a property owner.
His ability to repair and maintain properties enabled him to support his family and community.
He bailed out countless people with home and auto repairs operating as a contractor under the telling banner of GOOD AND FAIR.
Gabe's four daughters, son and grandchildren all benefited from his talent, intelligence, love, and generosity.
In the weeks before his death, Gabe shared with me a message to all our progeny.
``Don't make excuses, if you work hard, look forward and not backwards you can accomplish anything with just an average aptitude.''
Gabe shared his life with his beloved wife, business partner and best friend, Shirley A. Ellis, who for over 41 years supported each other in health and sickness, exemplifying a dynamic and supportive partnership.
