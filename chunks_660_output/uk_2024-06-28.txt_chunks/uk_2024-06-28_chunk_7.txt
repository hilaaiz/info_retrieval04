RECOGNIZING ELIZABETH BARRIE FOR HER SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA'S 46TH

CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

HON.
J. LUIS CORREA

Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the contributions of

Elizabeth Barrie to California's 46th Congressional District.
Elizabeth

started her career on the Hill as an intern in my office during my

first year in Congress and, like many congressional staffers before

her, takes great pride in being a part of this Chamber and this

institution.
Members are able to better serve out constituents because

provide us.
For Team Correa, it has been an honor to know and work

alongside Elizabeth.
Elizabeth has dedicated herself to her role through countless late

nights, through sprints in the Rayburn basement, and through many

difficult conversations while advising me.
I've seen staffers come and go on to greener pastures, and I am

always so fortunate to cross paths with an individual who still has so

much potential.
She's an incredibly bright staffer with an even

brighter future ahead.
Though we are all sad to lose her, we know that she will bring the

same work ethic to her new role as Federal Affairs and National

Engagement Manager for the City of Los Angeles, where she'll be able to

wear her Dodgers shirt without fear of shame.
I've had the honor of watching Elizabeth grow into her role, and I

will still never let her forget that Orange County is the best county

in California.
I am so proud that Elizabeth will return to her roots

and serve the constituents of LA.
Elizabeth truly believes in the

ideals of public service, and Los Angeles is lucky to have her service.
