RECOGNIZING SUE ABDERHOLDEN FOR HER WORK ON BEHALF OF THOSE WITH

DISABILITIES AND MENTAL ILLNESSES

HON.
KELLY MORRISON

Ms. MORRISON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Sue

Abderholden for her decades of tireless service and steadfast

commitment to Minnesotans living with disabilities and mental

illnesses.
For the past 24 years, Ms. Abderholden has served as Executive

Director of the Minnesota chapter of the National Alliance on Mental

Illness.
Under her leadership, our state has become more compassionate, more

informed, and more responsive to the needs of those facing mental

health challenges.
She played a central role in passing over two dozen laws that

expanded access to care and improved how we support people with mental

illnesses.
Ms. Abderholden's advocacy brought mental health training into our

schools, ensured screenings for individuals entering the justice

system, and reformed civil commitment laws to emphasize voluntary

treatment.
She expanded crisis and early intervention services, championed a

more diverse mental health workforce, and worked to strengthen housing

and community-based support services.
Her compassion extended to her home where Ms. Abderholden and her

family fostered children with disabilities and youth aging out of

foster care, offering stability and care when it was most needed.
On behalf of myself and countless Minnesotans, I offer my gratitude

to Ms. Abderholden for her decades of hard work and service.

TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS

speech of

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the

challenges and burdens placed on Black Americans during the first 100

days of the Trump Administration.
Donald Trump is undoing the progress

African Americans have fought for, threatening justice, equality, and

our democracy.
His administration has cut jobs, programs, and services

that help Black professionals, students, and business owners thrive.
Mississippi's public universities invested over $23 million in DEI

programs that supported Black students, and now those programs are at

risk.
Donald Trump has also removed protections for minority-owned

businesses, weakened civil rights enforcement, and cut funding for

public health research, all while costs rise.
More than 664,000

Mississippians are at risk of losing Medicaid.
Black families, already

facing chronic illness and poor healthcare access, will bear the full

burden.
Head Start, which serves nearly 20,000 children in Mississippi,

is also in danger.
Black children, who already face significant

barriers to education, will be hit the hardest.
These cuts cause actual

harm and send the message that Black lives and futures don't matter.
We

deserve leadership that sees, hears, and fights for us.
And we won't

stop demanding it.
