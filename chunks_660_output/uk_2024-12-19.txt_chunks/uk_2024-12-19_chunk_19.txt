We do not fight for a sect or denomination.
We do

not even fight for a motherland or a fatherland, and

Americans most certainly never fight for conquest or plunder

or enslavement of another people.
Instead, when America sends

its young, its brave and its finest to fight and yes,

sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice, America does it for

simple, humble values, the values of liberty and democracy

and when the job is done, when the mission is accomplished,

when America has taken down the dictator and stood up

democracy, Americans do something utterly unique in the

history of mankind.
We go home all that America asks for in

return.
In exchange for the sacrifice of our young, are a few

small plots of land to bury our dead.
All of you are seated

here today in one of those small plots of land, and that is

why this place, this ceremony, is still so important.
It

reminds us of American sacrifice, and it reminds all of the

autocrats and the dictators in this world, whether they be in

Moscow or Beijing, whether they be in Tehran or Pyongyang,

the autocracy may seem powerful.
The dictatorship may seem

strong.
But here this place at the Luxembourg American

Cemetery.
We remind the world that there is nothing more

powerful in it than a free people willing to fight for

freedom.
Ladies and gentlemen, May the good Lord bless each

and every one of you.
Bless Luxembourg and the United States

of America.
Thank you.
