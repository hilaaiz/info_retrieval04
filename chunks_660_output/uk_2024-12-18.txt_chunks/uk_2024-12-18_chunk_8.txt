In 2020, Bill was elected to serve as Menifee's directly elected

mayor.
As mayor, Bill has worked tirelessly to support the

infrastructure and recreational opportunities required from a growing

residential community.
My office and I have been proud to work hand-in-

hand with Bill and city staff to support these efforts with federal

resources.
In addition to his role at city hall, Bill serves on the

Board for Boys & Girls Club, Menifee Valley Historical Association, and

is President of the Antelope-Menifee Rural Center Board.
Bill clearly possesses a passionate belief in public service and a

dedication to the community he has served so faithfully.
I know I speak

on behalf of all residents in expressing my heartfelt thanks and praise

for Bill's significant contributions to Menifee.
I wish Bill and his

family the very best in the years to come.
