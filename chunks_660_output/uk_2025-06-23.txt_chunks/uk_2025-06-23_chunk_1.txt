CONGRATULATING ALEXANDER ANDREWS

HON.
RICK W. ALLEN

Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,

Alexander Andrews, upon his acceptance to the United States Naval

Academy.
As a future midshipman, he will be joining the ranks of the world's

most elite naval force, guided by the motto: ``Semper Fortis''

The service and sacrifice of America's military personnel have

safeguarded our Nation since its inception, defending our way of life

from Lexington to Normandy.
And throughout our history, American servicemembers have demonstrated

tremendous courage and strength, beating back tyranny to the ends of

the earth.
I was glad to sponsor Alexander's nomination, and I am confident that

his talents will distinguish him among his peers during his time at the

Academy and thereafter.
I congratulate Alexander.
I know that he will make this Nation proud.

CONGRATULATING JACK GRAY

HON.
RICK W. ALLEN

Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my constituent,

Jack Gray, upon his acceptance to the United States Merchant Marine

Academy.
As a future midshipman, he will be joining the ranks of the world's

HONORING CULVER POLICE DEPARTMENT CHIEF WAYNE BEAN

HON.
RUDY YAKYM III

Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to recognize and honor Culver

Police Chief Wayne Bean for more than four decades of dedicated service

to the Town of Culver and the broader law enforcement community as he

enters retirement.
Chief Bean, a lifelong resident of Culver and Union Township,

graduated from Culver Community Schools and began his law enforcement

career as a reserve deputy marshal in 1980 for the Culver Police

Department, becoming a full-time deputy in 1982.
His leadership quickly

stood out as he was promoted to deputy chief in 1991 and chief of the

Culver Police Department just a few years later, a role he has held

with distinction for more than two decades.
Throughout his career, Chief Bean has served with professionalism,

bravery, and compassion.
