His love and compassion for the people of Tennessee led him from

Capitol Hill to the Governor's Mansion in 1994.
Unwavering in his

convictions, Gov. Sundquist took on monumental issues, including

welfare reform that lifted 40,000 families out of poverty, a

comprehensive crime bill focused on victim's rights, expanding

broadband to every public school and library in Tennessee, and earning

National accolades for the state's economic success on his watch.
In addition to his courageous public service, he was also a proud

veteran of the United States Navy.
Of all the honorable titles that

have been etched into history beside his name, Don's most cherished

were husband, father, grandfather and friend.
Thanks to our longtime

friendship in the U.S. House, Don later introduced me to my beautiful

Tennessee bride, Cynthia.
He and his First Lady Martha graciously

hosted our wedding at the Governor's mansion in 1999, remaining

constant friends all the while.
It is for his dedicated friendship and

partnership in public service that I shall be eternally grateful.
My

wife Cynthia and I offer our heartfelt sympathy and prayers to the

entire Sundquist family and the people of Tennessee.
