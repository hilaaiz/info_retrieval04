Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act District of Columbia Equality Act, which would make the District of Columbia eligible for the same federal funding as states under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act and the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act.
D.C. residents pay full federal taxes and therefore D.C. is treated as a state under federal programs, with limited exceptions, most of them simply oversights or failures to update post-home rule.
The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act provides funding, derived from excise taxes on sporting equipment, for five distinct purposes: program administration, wildlife restoration, basic hunter education and safety, enhanced hunter education and safety grants, and multistate conservation grants.
D.C. does not receive any funding under this Act.
The Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act provides funding for sport fish restoration, aquatic education, wetlands restoration, and boat-related activities.
Under this Act, states receive a minimum of one percent of the total amount apportioned, while D.C. is capped at one-third of one percent.
This omission and lack of parity under these Acts have serious consequences for D.C. D.C. has roughly 7,800 acres of parkland covering nearly a quarter of the city, which means it has more parkland per capita than any other city in the United States.
This bill would define ``State'' in these Acts to include D.C., providing D.C. with equal funding for wildlife conservation in our Nation's capital.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
RECOGNIZING MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, TREY WEBSTER, FOR HIS EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-02-26 Volume: 170, Issue: 34 Pages: E179 - E179 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING MY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, TREY WEBSTER, FOR HIS EXCELLENT WORK ON BEHALF OF MINNESOTA'S THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ______ of minnesota in the house of representatives Mr. PHILLIPS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my Legislative Director, Raymond ``Trey'' Webster III, for his work done on behalf of every constituent in Minnesota's Third Congressional District.
This week, Trey will depart my office for new opportunities with Rep. Susie Lee as her Legislative Director, and I could not be prouder or more grateful for his service.
As Legislative Director, Trey brought an incredible work ethic and commitment to his job, earning his spot as an honorary Minnesotan in the process.
He led our legislative team with intelligence, humor, and compassion, and we will miss him greatly as he embarks on his new adventure.
A University of South Carolina and Georgetown Law graduate, Trey first came to our office in 2021 as my Legislative Counsel leading efforts in public safety, civil rights, civil liberties, and democracy preservation.
A shining example of Trey's brilliant work and true adherence to our ethos that ``Representation Begins with Listening,'' came a few short months after he started.
Through a series of meetings, Trey listened to local public safety stakeholders and national experts and then turned that listening into action as he wrote the Pathways to Policing Act, a bill based on a Minnesota program to ensure the recruitment of high-quality police officers across the country.
When our Legislative Director role came open in 2022, it was obvious who the correct choice should be to fill it.
Right away, Trey exhibited true servant leadership and put the needs of his team above his own.
