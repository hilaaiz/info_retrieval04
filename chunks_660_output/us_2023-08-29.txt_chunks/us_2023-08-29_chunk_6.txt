The U.P. Veteran of the Year is chosen annually by a selection committee consisting of past commanders of various service organizations throughout the peninsula.
It is given to recognize Yooper veterans who go above and beyond in their service to their local communities and fellow veterans.
None are more deserving of this honor than James.
Prior to his work with veterans, James served in the United States Marine Corps, where he was decorated with the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnamese Service Medal, Vietnamese Campaign Medal, and two Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citations.
His devotion to the people of his country and community has not wavered since returning from military service.
It is impossible to fully list all the ways in which James works to better the lives of U.P. veterans.
Since the organization's founding in 2014, he has been the Chairman of the Marquette County Veterans Alliance.
Similarly, he has served on the Marquette County's Veterans Affairs Committee for the past 9 years.
As a member of the committee, he works on the veterans crisis team, finding resources and housing for individuals in need.
Furthermore, James has played a pivotal role in ensuring that veterans in the U.P. have consistent access to medical services.
Through his fundraising efforts, he has helped the Disabled American Veterans Chapter 22 Veteran Transportation Program to purchase new vehicles and has personally logged thousands of hours transporting veterans to doctor appointments and hospital visits.
Notably, in 2016 James was responsible for the AVTT Traveling Vietnam Wall's arrival in Marquette.
He organized many commemorative veterans events to coincide with the tribute.
Since returning from the Vietnam War, James has spent years as an advocate for veterans, and the initiatives that he has begun have created the infrastructure of support that our military heroes need and deserve.
Outside of his work for veterans, James is an active community member.
After providing the loan to start the Marquette County Youth Football League in 1990, he became the league commissioner for the following 20 years.
In addition, he coached Marquette Junior Hockey for 12 years, serving twice as Vice President.
Later, he founded the Central Upper Peninsula Hockey League and served as both Marquette Senior High School and Northern Michigan University's Goal Judge for over two decades.
His contributions to his community have been previously recognized by Senator Peters, Senator Stabenow, Governor Whitmer, and myself.
Just last year, he was also honored as

the 2022 Marquette County Veteran of the Year.
As a servicemember, a veteran, a volunteer, and a Yooper, James has consistently put the needs of others before his own.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate James A. Provost for his decades of service to fellow Michigan veterans and for being named the 2023 Upper Peninsula Veteran of the Year.
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing the First District is home to such a selfless and devoted individual.
On behalf of my constituents, I wish James all the best in his future endeavors. ____________________

Date: 2023-08-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 140 Pages: E802 - E802 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 125 YEARS OF MONESSEN ______ of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Mr. RESCHENTHALER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the city of Monessen, Pennsylvania, in celebration of its 125th anniversary.
Prior to its founding, the area consisted of 8 farms.
However, Civil War veteran James M. Schoonmaker and other great Americans, saw the promise of an industrial city on the Monongahela River.
Thus, Schoonmaker convinced famed industrialist William Donner to set up a tin plate mill within the new community.
Thanks to the American Tin Plate Company's success, the community grew rapidly, and the borough of Monessen became incorporated on September 3, 1898.
