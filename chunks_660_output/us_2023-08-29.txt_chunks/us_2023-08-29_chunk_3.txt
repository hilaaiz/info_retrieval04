INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTAL OF LEGISLATION ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-08-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 140 Pages: E801 - E802 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E801-E802] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMITTAL OF LEGISLATION ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to introduce the District of Columbia Electronic Transmittal of Legislation Act, which would permit the Chair of the Council of the District of Columbia to transmit legislation to Congress in the form of the Chair's choosing, including electronic form.
This bill would bring the congressional review process for legislation enacted by D.C. into the electronic age.
Last Congress, the Committee on Oversight and Reform passed this bill.
While I do not believe there should be a congressional review process for D.C. legislation--and I have introduced a bill to eliminate the review process--this bill would not change the review process, except that it would give D.C. flexibility in the form it transmits legislation to Congress.
This bill's only purpose is to reduce administrative burdens on D.C. and Congress.
The D.C. Home Rule Act requires the Chair of the D.C. Council to transmit legislation to Congress for a review period.
The legislation takes effect upon the expiration of the review period, unless a resolution of disapproval is enacted into law during the review period.
The Home Rule Act is silent on the form of transmittal, but Congress has always required the legislation to be physically transmitted.
Electronic records are recognized as valid under Federal and State law, and Federal, State and local governments conduct official business electronically.
For example, under the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, which was enacted into law more than 20 years ago, with respect to any interstate transaction in which the parties consent, ``a signature, contract, or other record relating to such transaction may not be denied legal effect, validity, or enforceability solely because it is in electronic form.''
In 2002, the E-Government Act, which facilitated the Federal Government providing information and services to the public electronically, was enacted into law.
Federal agencies transmit regulations and other documents to the Federal Register electronically.
Congress is also capable of conducting official business electronically.
