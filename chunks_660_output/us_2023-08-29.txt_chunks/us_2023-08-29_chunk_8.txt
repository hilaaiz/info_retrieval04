TRIBUTE TO SETH SCOTT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-08-29 Volume: 169, Issue: 140 Pages: E801 - E801 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO SETH SCOTT ______ of arizona in the house of representatives Mr. STANTON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my departing Chief of Staff, Seth Scott, for his years of service to the people of Arizona's Fourth Congressional District.
It's a bittersweet day.
Seth has worked with me for more than a decade--half of that here in the House.
I often say hiring him was the best career decision I've ever made.
Few have as broad experience in government, law, media and politics.
He cut his teeth in the Arizona Governor's office, Congress, and local government and ran several important political campaigns before returning to Arizona State University for law school.
At the City of Phoenix and here in Congress, Seth has led my office with a steady hand.
His acumen while serving as my Chief of Staff was always in clear view, and all the accomplishments we achieved would not have been possible without him at the helm.
His fierce intellect, sharp political instincts and deep policy expertise have made him an invaluable and sought-after adviser.
But it's his loyalty, integrity and a work ethic second to none that have endeared Seth to all who have worked with and under him.
As deftly as he's handled complex legislative matters, he has also cultivated and mentored a generation of young staffers.
Seth has the talent and determination to succeed anywhere he chooses--but the people of Arizona are fortunate that he has chosen to devote his career to serving his community.
He has been a great friend and trusted confidant of mine, and he will continue to be well after he departs--though perhaps with a few less late-night and early morning phone calls.
I wish him all the best as he takes on this new challenge. ____________________
