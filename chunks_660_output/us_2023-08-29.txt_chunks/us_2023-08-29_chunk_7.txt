However, Civil War veteran James M. Schoonmaker and other great Americans, saw the promise of an industrial city on the Monongahela River.
Thus, Schoonmaker convinced famed industrialist William Donner to set up a tin plate mill within the new community.
Thanks to the American Tin Plate Company's success, the community grew rapidly, and the borough of Monessen became incorporated on September 3, 1898.
Throughout the early 20th century, Monessen's community played active roles in the suffrage and labor movements, events surrounding Prohibition, and in the industrial efforts powering American operations in World War I and World War II.
In 1921, the city also had a multitude of nationalities and mirrored the ethnicities of the Pittsburgh region, serving as a microcosm of America as a whole.
At its peak, the city's population reached over 20,000 residents.
Today, the town is still an important part of the southwestern Pennsylvania community.
Its residents exemplify the values of hard work, dedication to one's community, and good citizenship.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania's 14th Congressional District, I congratulate the City of Monessen on its 125th anniversary and applaud their determination to build a better community for themselves and their children.
I am confident that Monessen's people will strive for and achieve an even more successful next 125 years. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 2023 graduating class of Fairfax County High School Firefighter program.
In 2016, the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department in partnership with Fairfax County Public Schools created its High School Firefighter Program to provide training to students who are considering a career as a firefighter.
Students who participate in this program attend courses taught by qualified instructors at the Fairfax County Fire Academy.
In fact, they receive the same training as new professional and volunteer firefighters.
The course is grueling but upon successful completion, the students will earn a Virginia Certification as Firefighter I & II and Hazardous Materials Awareness and Operations.
Should these students decide to apply to the Fairfax County Fire Academy, this program will make them competitive candidates and will have prepared them for recruit school.
Fourteen seniors and one junior are graduating as the Class of 2023 of the High School Firefighter Program.
It is my great honor to include in the Record the names of the following graduates: Sydney G. Bates; Braden A. Dasher; Callie J. Desrosier; Alec T. DiLeonardo; Ian S. Dingman; Regan N. Kelley; Peter D. Mangone; Connor J. Marshall; Casey W. Martin; Hunter J. Piotrowski; Eric S. Verrier.
Mr. Speaker, the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue Department is 1 of the best fire departments in the country and in the world.
I commend the department as well as the public school system for partnering in the creation of this program.
I also applaud these young people for their desire to learn more about the department and for their interest in protecting our community.
Northern Virginia is fortunate to have such dedicated young citizens.
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating these students on their successful completion of their program and in wishing them great success in their future endeavors. ____________________
