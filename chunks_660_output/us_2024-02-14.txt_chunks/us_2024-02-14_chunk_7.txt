This ability served him particularly well in times of infrastructure emergencies when responsiveness and communication are most critical.
Providing quality customer service is an inherent part of the responsibilities of any congressional and intergovernmental affairs specialist.
Mr. Arnade's superior work ethic and professional drive to deliver high-quality, on-time service to Congress and others was exemplary among his peers.
Mr. Arnade is well known among his colleagues for his availability, responsiveness and dedication, routinely working beyond traditional work hours to respond to Congressional inquiries.
These efforts contributed to the development of high-quality legislative solutions and reinforced FHWA's reputation for providing exceptional technical assistance to Capitol Hill.
Mr. Arnade exemplifies the highest standards of public service and embodies FHWA's spirit of professionalism and customer service.
Over the years, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, other congressional committees, Members of Congress, and their staff have relied on Mr. Arnade's legislative and highway policy expertise, quick and helpful responses, and cheerful demeanor.
Mr. Arnade's colleagues at USDOT and FHWA depended on his tireless efforts and his never-wilted spirit.
Mr. Arnade will be missed at

FHWA.
However, his legacy will live on in the customers he served, the staff he mentored and trained, and the colleagues he influenced.
On behalf of the Committee, my colleagues, and our staff, I thank Mr. Arnade for his steadfast public service and his support for Congress and extend our well wishes to Mr. Arnade on his retirement. ____________________
