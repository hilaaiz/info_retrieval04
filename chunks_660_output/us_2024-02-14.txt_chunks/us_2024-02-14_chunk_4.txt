Raymond was drafted into the Infantry and sent to train in North Carolina.
There he spent time honing his skills, preparing to be deployed at a moment's notice.
The Army Air Force, during a visit to the base for recruitment of new airmen and engineers, recognized Raymond's talent and commitment to the war effort and immediately approved his transfer to that branch of the service.
Now newly baptized as an airman, Raymond traveled to Texas to train as a flight engineer on a B-17 aircraft.
His attention to detail and devotion to his obligations led to a promotion to the rank of Sergeant.
Although never sent to fight in the European or Pacific theaters, Raymond was always ready to go wherever he was needed, a symbol of his devotion to his country.
After his service in the Air Force, Raymond used his newly acquired aviation knowledge to contribute to a leading company in the aerospace industry.
After the war concluded and he was discharged, Raymond returned home to Connecticut and found employment within the experimental and testing division at Pratt and Whitney where he could continue to support its mission with his skills and passion for working with aircraft.
Pratt and Whitney Aircraft was instrumental in developing jet engines in the Cold War era that made a decisive difference in protecting our allies and the U.S. homeland.
Until his retirement in 1982, Raymond was a part of that effort which our Nation should never forget.
During this time at Pratt and Whitney, Raymond also married his hometown sweetheart and the love of his life, Lillian.
Together they moved to Vernon, Connecticut in 1957.
In Vernon, Raymond fulfilled his life-long dream of settling down and owning his own home, a place he and his wife raised their family in and lived for over 60 years.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues please join me in wishing Raymond a happy 100th birthday and recognizing him as the outstanding citizen he has distinguished himself as.
I consider myself fortunate to represent constituents of such quality as Raymond.
It is my

honor to cement the incredible and continuing story of Raymond Tremblay.
We wish Raymond a joyous birthday and many more years of happiness.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of John Morrow Derby, a legend of Central Valley journalism who spent 60 years in the newspaper business.
Mr. Derby was the publisher of five local weekly newspapers, including the Merced County Times, the Atwater-Winton Times, the Hilmar Times, the Hughson Chronicle, and the Waterford News.
He also served as president of the parent company Mid-Valley Publications.
Mr. Derby was known for coining the local slogan and business mantra, ``The Power of Positive Press.''
He was an avid sailor, a member of the Lake Yosemite Sailing Association, and a longtime member of the Merced Sunrise Rotary Club.
John Derby first came to the Central Valley in the 1950s, studying at Fresno State and serving in the military toward the end of the Korean conflict.
In Korea, he picked up the journalism bug when he pursued an assignment to write about the operations of nine battalions from Seoul to Panmunjom where the peace talks were held.
Mr. Derby would eventually end up in Merced in 1961 after landing a reporting job at the Sun-Star.
Over the course of six decades, he started multiple newspapers across the Central Valley.
Mr. Derby once wrote, ``Life without being a newspaper man is about the most boring thing in the world.
