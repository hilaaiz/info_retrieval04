I

will be forever grateful for his friendship and support.
Willie accomplished much in his life but none of it would have been

possible without the grace of God and the love and support of his late

wife, Patricia D. Watkins; his four children, Marcus Watkins, Willena

Watkins Singleton, Mactrice Watkins Thomas and Willie Watkins, Jr.; his

late siblings, Lily Watkins Hopson, Catherine Watkins Jackson, Frank

Watkins and Geneva Watkins Burns; his surviving siblings, Ann Watkins

Cobb and Jessie Watkins, Jr.; his 8 grandchildren, 2 great-

grandchildren; nieces, nephews, and extended family.
Willie loved his

family, and his family loved him back.
As we reflect on the remarkable life of Willie James Watkins, we

honor and remember his unwavering faith, his love of family, his help

to insurance professionals, his Spencer Greenwave spirit, his passion

for golf and his impact on our community.
We are all better because

Willie touched our lives.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me,

along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's 2nd Congressional

District in honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Willie James Watkins,

in extending our deepest condolences to his family, friends and all who

mourn his loss.
Moreover, I pray that we will all be consoled and

comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks

and months ahead.
