RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY'S SEATTLE

CAMPUS

HON.
PRAMILA JAYAPAL

Ms. JAYAPAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Northeastern

University on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of establishing a

campus in the City of Seattle.
In 2013, Northeastern opened its doors in Seattle with two programs,

32 students and 500 square feet of space in South Lake Union, A decade

later, the campus has nearly 1,800 graduates, a dozen graduate-degree

programs, hundreds of industry and community partnerships, and is among

the largest of Northeastern's 13 global locations.
Northeastern has worked to bring programs in high-growth fields to

the Pacific Northwest, such as computer science, data analytics, global

studies and project management.
Each program is designed to help

students thrive in careers through classroom learning and real-world

experiences.
On the occasion of this milestone, I am proud to recognize

Northeastern University as a partner and valued member of the Seattle

community.
