Carolyn's love for developing young minds led her to be a part of the Broward County Public School District for more than 38 years.
Her esteemed career included Parkway Middle School, Apollo Middle School, and Attucks Middle School.
The pinnacle of Carolyn's educational career was when she was honored as Attucks Middle School Teacher of the Year.
She was also a member of The Charmettes, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, and the Red Hat Society.
As a supportive wife, Carolyn stood by her husband Albert as he served on both the Dania Beach and Broward County Commissions.
Truly an inspiration, Carolyn is remembered for her kind and generous spirit and legacy of service to family, church, and community.
My heart is with her family in mourning the loss of this kind, generous, and compassionate soul.
We were forever privileged to have shared this time with her.
May her memory be for a blessing.

Date: 2023-11-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 192 Pages: E1120 - E1121 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1120-E1121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF GARY PETERSEN ______ of washington in the house of representatives Mr. NEWHOUSE.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gary Petersen, a dedicated leader hailing from the Tri-Cities, who tragically lost his fight to cancer this past month.
It saddens me that rather than announcing his next great achievement, I am instead here to mourn his passing.
Gary was known throughout both Central Washington, the U.S. Capitol, and the Department of Energy as a fierce advocate for the interests of the Tri-Cities.
His leadership in our communities proved fruitful for decades, sparking both economic development and innovation for the citizens of Central Washington.
His advocacy for the Hanford cleanup mission has been the cornerstone of the success of our region, and I am in awe of the impact he has made over the years.
His immense knowledge, wisdom, and understanding of our community's priorities was matched by so few, and I have no doubt his name will go down in history with the likes of Sam Volpentest and Bob Ferguson.
Gary's legacy includes leading advocacy for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's campus, supporting the advancement of the Hanford cleanup mission, and advocating for growing the local economy at TRIDEC; he will also be known as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and personal friend of mine.
While he will be missed, his legacy will continue to live on in every corner of the Tri-Cities and Central Washington. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, Today I want to recognize my friend, William ``Bill'' Goodman.
Bill was an iconic member of our Detroit legal community who never wavered in fighting for the working class, the most vulnerable among us.
I met Bill over fifteen years ago when he was President of the Maurice and Jane Sugar Law Center for Economic and Social Justice.
He was a mentor to many of us young attorneys and a hero to many who were seeking justice.
Born in 1940, Bill grew up in northwest Detroit, where he witnessed the injustices of racism and segregation.
This, combined with the values instilled in him by his parents, informed the path Bill would take with his career and life's work.
He earned his juris doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1964, returned to Detroit during the height of the civil rights movement, and went to work in partnership with his father, Ernie Goodman.
Over the course of his career, Bill took on numerous high-profile cases.
