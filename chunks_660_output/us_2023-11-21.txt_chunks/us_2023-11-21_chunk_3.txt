This, combined with the values instilled in him by his parents, informed the path Bill would take with his career and life's work.
He earned his juris doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1964, returned to Detroit during the height of the civil rights movement, and went to work in partnership with his father, Ernie Goodman.
Over the course of his career, Bill took on numerous high-profile cases.
He worked as legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights, where he represented Guantanamo Bay detainees, Vietnamese survivors of Agent Orange, and the wrongfully detained.
He sought to focus his work on the protection of civil liberties.
Bill eventually returned to Detroit as partner at the law firm Goodman Hurwitz, where he continued to represent families and individuals who were victims of police and government misconduct.
Bill worked with a number of legal advocacy organizations, including the National Lawyers Guild, ACLU, and Sugar Law Center, where I got to know him when we both served as board members.
I knew Bill to be a fierce advocate, a brilliant legal mind, and a tenacious but kind warrior for justice.
Please join me in tribute to Bill Goodman, remembering his life and distinguished career.
May he rest in power. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQUITY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
192



Date: 2023-11-21 Volume: 169, Issue: 192 Pages: E1120 - E1120 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADVERTISING EQUITY ACCOUNTABILITY ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Federal Government Advertising Equity Accountability Act, which would require all federal agencies to include in their annual budget requests to Congress the amount they spend on advertising contracts with small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) and businesses owned by minorities and women.
Federal agencies would be required to provide prior and projected total expenditures for such contracts.
At my request, the Committee on Appropriations has been requiring such information from many agencies for the last several years, but this bill would codify this requirement and apply it to all federal agencies.
In 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined spending on advertising contracts with minority-owned businesses by five agencies--the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of the Interior and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration--and found that only five percent of the $4.3 billion available for advertising contracts went to minority businesses.
In light of these concerning findings, several Members of Congress and I sent letters to GAO in April 2016 and June 2022 requesting updated information on the amount of federal advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
A GAO report released in July 2018 showed that in fiscal year 2017, only 16 percent of the federal government's advertising contract obligations went to SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
GAO agreed last year to issue an updated report.
The federal government is the largest advertiser in the United States, and it has an obligation to ensure equitable access to its contracts for SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women.
The GAO's findings demonstrate that there is still much progress to be made.
The regular collection of information on federal advertising contracts with SDBs and businesses owned by women and minorities is essential to bridging the gap between what current statistics show and a more inclusive advertising landscape.
This bill would help achieve this goal while also promoting transparency and encouraging federal agencies to strive to reach minorities, who often receive the news from smaller media outlets that serve communities of color.
The requirement that agencies submit prior and projected information on the amount of advertising dollars spent with SDBs and businesses owned by minorities and women would allow federal agencies to evaluate their progress.
