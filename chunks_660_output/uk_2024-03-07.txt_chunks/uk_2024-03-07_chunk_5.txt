RECOGNIZING MRS.
CHRISTAL BENNETT, THE SANTA ROSA COUNTY TEACHER OF THE

YEAR

HON.
MATT GAETZ

Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the Santa Rosa

County Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Christal Bennett, for her exceptional

efforts in fostering the musical talents of her many students.
A

longtime Florida native, Mrs. Bennett's extensive history in music

education began in the very District in which she now teaches.
From

Avalon Middle School to the University of West Florida, Mrs. Bennett's

exceptional gift of music has exemplified a lifelong dedication to

spreading joy throughout her community.
As the Director of Bands at Central School and the recent founder of

its very first marching band, Mrs. Bennett's leadership continues to

find new and influential ways to impact the lives of countless young

musicians.
In its first year, the Central School Jaguar Marching Band

has already managed to obtain a competition rating of ``excellent''

under her direction.
Mrs. Bennett's stated mission of filling her students with pride

exemplifies the kind of leader she is.
I express great pride in knowing

that such a remarkable and kindhearted person has been named the Santa

Rosa County Teacher of the Year.
I congratulate her on this well-

deserved recognition and look forward to seeing the many musical

successes that she and her students will undoubtedly achieve in the

future.
