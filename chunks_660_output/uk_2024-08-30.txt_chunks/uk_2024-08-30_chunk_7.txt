Mr. Speaker, having worked in a family-run small business

Accordingly, I would like to take a

moment to recognize the 2024 award recipients for the Youngstown Warren

Regional Chamber's annual Salute to Business.
I am proud to be able to

honor these recipients for their work as upstanding business leaders in

the community.

with the Business Professional of the Year.

will be presented with the Business Advocate of the Year.

presented with the Salute to Labor Achievement Award.
Finally, Ms. Sarah O'Brien, owner of a chain of Little Tart Bakeshop

locations in Atlanta, will be presented with the Valley Champion Award.
I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to

join me in recognizing these honorable leaders, pillars of the

Youngstown Warren community, as we congratulate them on their

accomplishments and their contributions to the community.
These

admirable citizens illustrate the thriving Ohio business community I am

proud to represent, and may their work continue to be a blessing to our

industrious Nation.
