INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SALARY HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
203



Date: 2023-12-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 203 Pages: E1203 - E1203 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SALARY HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I introduce the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer Act, which would give the District of Columbia the authority to increase the pay of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
The D.C. CFO is a local D.C. official and is paid with local D.C funds.
D.C. should have the authority to set the pay of all its employees.
Last Congress, the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability passed this bill.
Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, Congress established a maximum rate of pay of the CFO, and the D.C. Council has no authority to increase that rate.
Congress does not cap, or otherwise establish, the pay of any other D.C. employee.
Under this bill, the CFO would be paid at the greater of a rate equal to the current maximum rate of pay or a rate established in law by D.C. D.C. requested that I introduce this bill to enable it to retain and recruit the best CFOs.
The D.C. CFO was established by Congress in 1995.
Congress vested the CFO with extraordinary powers and designed the CFO to be independent of the D.C. Mayor and Council.
D.C. cannot obligate or expend funds without the CFO's approval.
The CFO manages an approximately $20 billion budget that consists of state, county and city functions, and the CFO has more than 1,700 employees.
The CFO may be removed only for cause by the Mayor, subject to the approval of two- thirds of the Council and a 30-day congressional review and comment period.
This bill would help maintain the independence of the CFO by establishing a permanent floor on the CFO's pay and by prohibiting the Council from reducing the CFO's pay during the CFO's term.
Although the D.C. CFO is the most powerful non-elected official in D.C., more than 20 D.C. employees are paid more than the CFO.
D.C. must compete with both the private and public sectors for high-quality CFOs, and there are many private- and public-sector CFOs who are paid more than the D.C. CFO.
This bill is critical to the financial operations of D.C. and is an important step to increase home-rule authority for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________
