RENEWABLE FUEL FOR OCEAN-GOING VESSELS ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
203



Date: 2023-12-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 203 Pages: E1202 - E1202 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RENEWABLE FUEL FOR OCEAN-GOING VESSELS ACT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. GARAMENDI.
Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to co-sponsor the ``Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act'' (H.R. 6681), with Representatives Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA01), Nikki Budzinski (D- IL13), and Carlos A. Gimenez (R-FL28).
This bipartisan bill would make maritime biofuel fully eligible under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Renewable Fuel Standard, which currently only applies to biofuels for motor vehicles, airplanes, locomotives and, in limited circumstances, recreational boating or vessels on inland waterways.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58), Congress authorized the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which works to simultaneously reduce transportation-related emissions from fossil fuels and support domestic agriculture, forestry, and biofuels manufacturing.
However, current law excludes otherwise eligible biofuels for ocean-going vessels.
No rationale was ever provided for this exclusion in the Congressional hearing record or Committee reports for the 2005 and 2007 Energy Bills.
This arbitrary, counterproductive exclusion denies the burgeoning advanced biofuels and renewable natural gas industries in the United States important maritime customers.
