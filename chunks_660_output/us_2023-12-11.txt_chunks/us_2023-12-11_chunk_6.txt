And Black owners face unique challenges.
While owners from all other demographics told the Fed that their main problem at the moment was low customer demand, Black respondents cited a different top challenge: access to credit.
When Jenell Ross, who runs an auto dealership in Ohio, sought a Paycheck Protection Program loan, her longtime bank told her to look elsewhere--a message that large banks like Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo delivered to many of their customers in the program's frenzied early days.
Days later, she obtained a loan from Huntington Bank, a regional lender, but the experience stung.
``Historically, access to capital has been the leading concern of women- and minority-owned businesses to survive, and during this pandemic it has been no different,'' Ms. Ross, who is Black, told a House committee last year.
Community groups step in Community lenders and aid organizations took a shoe-leather approach to filling the gaps.
Last year, the American Business Immigration Coalition, an advocacy group, worked with local nonprofits to create a ``community navigator'' program that sent outreach workers to Black, minority and rural businesses in Florida, Illinois, South Carolina and Texas.
They plowed through roadblocks, Whac-a-Mole-style.
Language barriers were common.
Many business owners had never sought a bank loan before.
Several didn't have an email address and needed help creating one.
Some hadn't filed taxes; the coalition hired two accountants to help people sort out

their financials.
``Our folks literally went door to door and walked people through the process,'' said Rebecca Shi, the group's executive director.
``It's time-consuming.''
The group's work netted $8 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans for 219 businesses.
For those companies, the help made a profound difference.
TruFund Financial, a New York lender that focuses on historically disadvantaged communities, spent two hours of staff time, on average, on each of the 490 loans it made last year--far more than larger lenders put in.
Dozens of its applications took 10 hours or more to complete, said James H. Bason, TruFund's chief executive.
Many of TruFund's customers walked in the door after being turned away by large banks, where ``not being able to speak to anybody at the bank, sitting around waiting to hear, and then not hearing anything for weeks--all of that created a lot of anxiety for our small-business borrowers,'' Mr. Bason said.
Shaundell Newsome, a Las Vegas business owner and a co- chair of Small Business for America's Future, an advocacy group, said improving outcomes for Black business owners would require deliberate, sustained changes throughout the banking industry.
``The solution is intentionality,'' he said.
``What I mean by that is making sure bankers, regulators and policymakers stay intentional on building Black businesses and helping us get access to capital.''
That's a message Mr. Newsome passed on to Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen in a recent meeting.
Ms. Yellen has pledged to increase support for minority-focused lenders and make other changes to alter a financial system that, in her words, still produces outcomes unacceptably similar to those of the days when Jim Crow laws were in effect.
Economic crises like the one now gripping the country ``hit people of color harder and longer'' and intensify economic inequality, Ms. Yellen said at that meeting.
``I am worried the current crisis will do this again.
In fact, I know it will, unless we act.'' ____________________
