GIBSON UNITED STATES MINT DIRECTOR, GREATEST GENERATION COMMEMORATIVE COIN DESIGN DISPLAY ______ of ohio in the house of representatives Ms. KAPTUR.
Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following remarks by the Honorable Ventris C. Gibson.
Good Afternoon.
It is a pleasure to be here to introduce the designs for the 2024 Greatest Generation Commemorative Coin Program.
Every day, across the Nation, the Mint connects Americans through coins.
Next year, it will be our great privilege to connect America to the service and sacrifice of American soldiers and civilians during the Second World War.
The National World War II Memorial stands as an important symbol of America's national unity, a timeless reminder of the moral strength and power that flows when free people are at once united and bonded together in a common and just cause for liberty.
This is the first national memorial dedicated to all who served during World War II and acknowledges the commitment and achievement of the entire Nation.
It honors the more than 16 million who served in the Armed Forces of the United States, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war effort from home.
Their legacy is part of our American story.
Since the Mint's establishment in 1792, the women and men of our workforce have taken great pride in rendering the story of our nation through enduring examples of numismatic art.
As the largest mint in the world, the United States Mint produces the coinage required by our Nation to conduct its trade and commerce.
In addition, Congress authorizes a maximum of two commemorative coin programs annually to celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and institutions.
I would like to thank Senator Browne, Representative McHenry and Representative Waters for their work to get the Greatest Generation out of their respective committees and working with the sponsors, leadership and Mint to ensure the language was correct and passed in time for 2024.
Since the beginning of the modern commemorative coin program in 1982, the United States Mint has raised more than $522 million in surcharges authorized to help build or enhance new museums, preserve historical sites, and support important national programs.
In accordance with legislation, the Mint includes a surcharge as part of the price of each commemorative coin.
These surcharges are authorized to be turned over to the sponsoring organizations for projects that benefit the community.
In this case, surcharges are authorized to be awarded to the Friends of the National World War II Memorial to support the National Park Service in maintaining and repairing the memorial, and for educational and commemorative programs.
I'd like to tell you a little about the designs.
