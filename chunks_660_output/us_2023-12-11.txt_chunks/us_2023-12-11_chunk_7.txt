of california in the house of representatives Mr. ISSA.
Mr. Speaker, today I take a moment to recognize Army Captain Kirk R. Proctor, Jr., an exceptional Officer, leader and public servant.
Cpt.
Proctor has concluded a year as a member of my legislative team, and within this duration, he has made a real impact on a multitude of defense, national security, and foreign affairs policy initiatives.
His on-the-ground perspective bolstered by my team's analysis--from how the industrial base ties into the operational force, to explaining the evolution of military medicine, and how readiness initiatives intersect with military family quality of life.
Furthermore, Cpt.
Proctor has inspired colleagues to learn more about the defense industry through his application of institutional knowledge and hard- earned experiences.
Cpt.
Proctor's unwavering dedication to my office and contributions to Congress have not gone unnoticed.
His commitment to the American people and passion for public service is admirable, and I hope he is offered the most unique opportunities and enriching assignments as he continues his career as an Army Officer.
I wish Cpt.
Proctor and his wife Sabia the best of luck as he begins his next assignment as a legislative liaison, and I look forward to seeing him lead in the years to come.
On behalf of the U.S. Congress and a grateful Nation, I extend my deepest appreciation to Captain Kirk R. Proctor, Jr., and I congratulate him as he continues a career of public service within the U.S. Army and to our Nation. ____________________

Date: 2023-12-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 203 Pages: E1200 - E1200 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF MR.
WILLIAM ``BILL'' SHEPLER ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mr. BERGMAN.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Mr. William ``Bill'' Shepler for his years of service to the Mackinaw City community and retirement as President of the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum Board of Directors.
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, our country assumed heavy demands on the war materials industry.
In order to sustain these increased production needs, the United States Coast Guard icebreaker, Cutter Mackinaw WAGB-83, was authorized for construction on December 17, 1941.
Until decommissioning, The Mackinaw proved to be an essential facet of the Great Lakes' economy, colloquially becoming known as ``The Queen of the Great Lakes.''
The Mackinaw was essential to the maintenance of the shipping lanes of the Lakes, becoming responsible for over 100 trapped ships being freed from ice blockages or buildups.
Following a long and successful career, the ship began its decommissioning process and the City of Cheboygan attempted to find a suitable home for The Mackinaw.
In August of 2004, Mr. Shepler, along with Dick Moehl and Sandy Planisek, founded the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum in order to keep the ship in the Great Lakes.
Following its successful development, the renowned icebreaker was decommissioned on July 10, 2006, and was moored at its permanent berth on July 21, 2006.
With gratitude to the IMMM board of directors under the direction of Bill Shepler, the Icebreaker Mackinaw Maritime Museum welcomed its first visitors in the spring of 2007.
Visitors can now explore the ship's 62-year history, making their way around the Mess Deck, Engine Room, Captain's Quarters, Sick Bay, Galley, Navigation Room and more.
Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize the dedicated efforts of Mr. Bill Shepler in preserving our history, and I congratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.
I'd like to wish Bill and the IMMM all the best in their future endeavors. ____________________
