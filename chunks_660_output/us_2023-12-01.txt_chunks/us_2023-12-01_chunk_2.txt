Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for the exemplary service and dedication of Mr. Larry D. Smith.
It is with great honor that we acknowledge his remarkable contributions and years of service to our country and our Military Academies.
I thank him for his invaluable partnership over the past decade as this weekend marks his last round of academy nomination interviews that he will conduct in support of my office.
Born in Los Angeles in 1940, Mr. Smith's journey is one marked by commitment and achievement.
A graduate of Manual Arts High School in 1958, he furthered his education at the United States Military Academy, earning a BS in General Engineering in 1962.
Commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the US Army, Armor Branch, Mr. Smith's military service took him to Germany, the United States, and Vietnam, where he served with distinction in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment.
Transitioning to civilian life in 1970, Mr. Smith embarked on a successful career in Commercial Real Estate, notably with Grubb & Ellis Company, where he served on the Board of Directors and managed offices in the Los Angeles area.
His relocation from Southern California to Sacramento in 1979 marked the beginning of a new chapter as a Commercial Real Estate Developer, leaving an indelible mark by constructing the IRS office facility in Sacramento and managing others in Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico.
His foray into residential home building in 1990 saw the creation and sale of hundreds of homes in the Sacramento area, a testament to his enduring entrepreneurial spirit.
Beyond his professional accomplishments, Mr. Smith has been an active and engaged member of the West Point community.
Currently serving as the President of the West Point Alumni in Northern California, he also holds the position of National Trustee for the Association of Graduates.
His involvement in the West Point Admissions Department and his role as the e-mail network moderator for the West Point Parents Net (wpp-net) showcase his commitment to the development and support of future generations.
Mr. Smith's family life is equally commendable, having been married to his wife, Maren, for 35 years.
His sons, Tom and Mark, have followed in his footsteps, with Tom serving as an officer in the Army and Mark as a legislative aide to a California State Senator.
I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Mr. Larry D. Smith in recognition of his outstanding achievements and unwavering dedication to public service.
His legacy serves as an inspiration to us all, and we are grateful for his continued contributions to the betterment of our community and Nation. ____________________
