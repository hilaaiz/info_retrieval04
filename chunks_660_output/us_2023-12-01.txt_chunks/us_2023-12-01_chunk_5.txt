This recurring process that the fellowship program fosters, strengthens civilian- military understanding for future leaders of the greatest military in the world, which I believe is a necessary component of a strong democracy.
Our Nation is best served at sea and here onshore by officers and leaders of the highest caliber, like Christian.
He embodies such qualities and has a promising career ahead in continued service to our nation, and we owe him such gratitude.
I ask that the House join me in wishing CDR Christian Woodside, his spouse Leigh Anne, and their two daughters, Hannah and Charlotte, the best of luck in their next life chapter. ____________________

RANDY K. WEBER, SR.
of texas in the house of representatives Mr. WEBER of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, due to a family health issue that required prompt attention, I missed two suspension votes last night regarding our greatest ally, Israel.
Had I been present, I would have voted yes--without reservation--for both measures: I unequivocally reaffirm Israel's right to exist, and I support the immediate release of all hostages taken by the jihadist terrorist organization Hamas.
I am thankful that my colleagues in Congress voted overwhelmingly in favor of these measures.
Anyone familiar with my voting record knows that I have always stood foursquare in support of Israel and will continue to do so.
Hamas must be eradicated, all prisoners must be released, and we must continue to remove any shred of doubt about Israel's right to exist. ____________________
