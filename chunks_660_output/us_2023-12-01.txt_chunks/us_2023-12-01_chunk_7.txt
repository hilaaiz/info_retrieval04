This wonderful event, which will take place at Fred Poppe Regional Park in Palm Bay, FL, will provide an uplifting message of hope and future during this Christmas season.
The House Church, River of Life Christian Center, Elevation Church, Eastwind Pentecostal Church, Grace Bible Church, Jornada al Cielo, Church on the Rock, Truth Reveal Ministries, Wings of Grace Ministries, CITA Rescue Mission, have all united to bring the 15th Annual Family Christmas Extravaganza to our City and County.
Working with several community and business partners such as the City of Palm Bay Parks & Recreation, Thrifty Specialty Produce, Chick-Fil-A, Fruits of my Labor, Engel & Volkers, Gator Automotive, the Mortgage Firm, Frog Bones-Family Shooting Center, Z88.3FM, All Digital All Day, Grifols Plasma Distribution Center, Double Scope, Al Dia Today Newspaper, Martin's Famous Potato Rolls, SMTC Manufacturing, and Premiere Oaks 10 Cinema, the mission is to provide a positive venue for residents and children to celebrate Christmas, serve others and give back to their community.
Over sixty local businesses and organizations have made donations of toys, food, gift certificates, equipment, finances, and goodie bags, and will feature musicians and artist such as Unified Sound with Joel Lopez, Peabod, Carl Lewis and the Intensity Band, Eddie Anthony as Eddie Frost, Jalixa Morales as FA-LA-LA-LA-LIXA and Corey Sprenkle with S & S Sound.
Senior Pastor Ken Delgado of The House at Palm Bay said: ``With today's news being filled with division, contention, and expressions of hatred, it is exciting to see the City of Palm Bay, along with the city's businesses and the citizens, create an event where love, joy and peace are expressed.
The Family Christmas Extravaganza is the greatest expression that so many people yearn for and is what the angels proclaimed at the birth of Jesus, saying `Peace and good will towards all men'.''
The Mayor of the City of Palm Bay, Rob Medina, issued a proclamation in support for this year's celebration, recognizing the Extravaganza has become the largest Christmas party on the Space Coast and December 16, 2023, as Family Christmas Extravaganza Day.
The spirit of the holidays is all about giving and spending time with loved ones.
This year's Extravaganza brings our community together to remind us of that.
I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting all those who are doing their part to spread the Christmas spirit this holiday season and those who have worked so hard to make the 15th Annual Family Christmas Extravaganza possible. ____________________

Date: 2023-12-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 198 Pages: E1157 - E1158 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1157-E1158] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF WDSU CHANNEL 6 ______ of louisiana in the house of representatives Mr. SCALISE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and recognize a local television station, WDSU Channel 6, on their 75th Anniversary.
On December 18, 1948, WDSU became the first television station to ``sign on'' in the State of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region and for the next nine years would remain our only local station.
Starting with the invocation of archdiocesan chancellor Monsignor Charles J. Plauche in 1948, WDSU has been an eyewitness for historical moments that have shaped our region.
WDSU was on the scene during the building of the Crescent City Connection which connects New Orleans' East Bank to the West Bank.
The station was there to provide the first live election results in the Greater New Orleans area, and WDSU reporters were the only ones to live broadcast the World's Fair in New Orleans in 1984.
The station chronicled the moments leading up to landfall of Hurricane Katrina, with coverage during the storm, and the days, months, and years following as the people of Southeast Louisiana recovered and rebuilt.
