JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of the 300th Anniversary of the First Congregational Church and Meeting House in Shrewsbury.
The Congregation will celebrate this tremendous milestone on Monday, December 4.
Mr. Speaker, the history of the Church spans almost as far back as the town itself.
In October 1717, the General Court of Massachusetts permitted Shrewsbury as a township, as long as 40 families would settle there, build a meeting house, and settle an ordained minister within three years.
With little delay, Reverend Job Cushing was ordained, and the original church covenant was adopted on December 4, 1723.
For 109 years, the meeting house was the site for both church and town affairs, until the two separated in 1832.
Since its inception, the Church has undergone moves, repairs, remodels, and expansions.
Nevertheless, the Church remained a steadfast community center.
During its long history, the Church has remained a site of social responsibility.
The Church championed a Vigilance Committee to support the Underground Railroad.
Its ministries outreach to those in need.
And today, the Church is an open and affirming Congregation.
In 1961, the First Congregational Church of Shrewsbury became part of the United Church of Christ.
Since then, the Church has opened its doors to all, supporting the diverse needs of the Shrewsbury community.
Mr. Speaker, the First Congregational Church of Shrewsbury strives to keep adapting to be in service to all people.
I look forward to celebrating this crucial community organization on their 300th Anniversary.
Please join me in paying honor and tribute to the First Congregational Church of Shrewsbury. ____________________
