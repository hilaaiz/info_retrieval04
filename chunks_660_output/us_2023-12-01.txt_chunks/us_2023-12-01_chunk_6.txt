Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Officer Jeffrey Peirce of the Newfields Police Department for his recent act of bravery that earned him the Department's Life Saving Award.
When an armed man experiencing a mental health crisis needed assistance, Officer Peirce relied on his training, experience, and sense of duty to effectively de-escalate the situation and help the individual access proper care.
I commend Officer Peirce on his courage during a difficult situation and thank him for his decades of service to the Newfields and Rye Police Departments.
In response to calls about a distressed individual in the police department's parking lot, Officer Peirce arrived on the scene ready to assist in the de-escalation of a mental health crisis.
Without any backup Peirce engaged with the man, asking him questions and listening to his concerns, empowered by his years of de-escalation training and mental health classes.
After removing a gun from the individual's car, Officer Peirce encouraged the man to travel with him to Portsmouth Hospital in order to receive treatment and speak with the staff at the Behavioral Health Unit.
Officer Peirce's ability to de-escalate the situation is a result of his quick thinking and courage, as well as the professional training in mental health affairs he received as a member of the force.
By listening to the concerns of the individual, acting quickly to withdraw and empty his gun, and helping him access the care he needed, Officer Peirce demonstrated bravery and empathy, making him truly deserving of the Life Saving Award.
On behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I thank Officer Peirce for his bravery and recognize him for his service to the people of New Hampshire.
His heroism and sense of duty will serve as a shining example for all Granite State public safety professionals.
I wish Officer Peirce all the best in his future endeavors. ____________________
