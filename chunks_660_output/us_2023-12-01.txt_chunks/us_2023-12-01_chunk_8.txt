WDSU was on the scene during the building of the Crescent City Connection which connects New Orleans' East Bank to the West Bank.
The station was there to provide the first live election results in the Greater New Orleans area, and WDSU reporters were the only ones to live broadcast the World's Fair in New Orleans in 1984.
The station chronicled the moments leading up to landfall of Hurricane Katrina, with coverage during the storm, and the days, months, and years following as the people of Southeast Louisiana recovered and rebuilt.
The station has since covered other major storms to hit the area including Hurricanes Gustav, Ike, Laura, and Ida.
The name WDSU is widely recognized across the Greater New Orleans area but not many know the significance behind the name.
The ``W'' in WDSU is used by stations east of the Mississippi River.
The ``D'' honors the Desoto Hotel where the original radio station, formerly known as WCBE, broadcasted above.
The ``S'' is a nod to the old New Orleans States newspaper, and the ``U'' recognizes Joe Uhalt who bought the original radio station.
It is truly my pleasure to recognize WDSU's 75th Anniversary.
On behalf of the great people of Louisiana's First Congressional District, I thank the anchors, photographers, journalists, and the whole staff at WDSU for their continued coverage of breaking news, historical events, and representation of the Greater New Orleans area, ensuring our community is informed and entertained.
WDSU's commitment to public service and broadcasting does not go unnoticed and is appreciated by the entire New Orleans region. ____________________
