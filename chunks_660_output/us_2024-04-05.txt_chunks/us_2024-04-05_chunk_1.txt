ANN WYLIE'S EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a great Marylander and important member of our University of Maryland community celebrated her eightieth birthday: Dr. Ann Wylie.
She has educated countless students from across Maryland and America ever since she first became an Assistant Professor for the University of Maryland's Department of Agronomy in 1972.
The following year, she became a founding faculty member of the University of Maryland's renowned Department of Geology.
From the President's Medal and the Scholar-Teacher Award at the University of Maryland, College Park, to the Butler Prize awarded by the Geological Society of Washington, Dr. Wylie has received widespread acclaim for her research and leadership in academia.
Crucially, Dr. Wylie has displayed a commitment to service that deserves the admiration of every Member of this Congress.
Her work on how exposure to minerals--including many mined in Maryland--affect human health has helped us better safeguard the well-being of the American people.
Whether for the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. geological survey, the U.S. Bureau of Mines, or the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, she has made important contributions to our government's understanding of these issues.
As a Terp, I'm also grateful for her leadership in the University of Maryland, College Park's administration.
Throughout her distinguished career, she has served as Interim Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Provost, Vice President for Administrative Affairs, Interim Dean of the Graduate School, and many other vital positions.
My staff and I have had the pleasure of working closely with Dr. Wylie on many occasions over the years--especially when she served as Chief of Staff to my friend Dan Mote during his tenure as the university's president.
Mr. Speaker, we at the University of Maryland, College Park, could never have known just how lucky we were to have Dr. Wylie join our community more than a half century ago.
She has propelled the university and its students to greater heights and leave an indelible mark on campus.
I ask that all my colleagues join me in wishing my fellow Terp well as she marks this terrific milestone.
May they also join me in thanking her for her many years of service and leadership. ____________________
