As a result of her ingenuity and visionary leadership, the University has achieved a sixteen percent increase in retention and a six percent increase in enrollment.
Dr. Fedrick is

widely respected by her colleagues because of her enduring commitment to student success, racial and social equity and the power of community.
She has used her powerful voice to be a spokesperson for access, equity, and fairness.
Dr. Fedrick has helped to strengthen the bond between Albany State and the greater Albany community.
Dr. Fedrick has been associated with and contributed to a wide variety of initiatives in the University System of Georgia to include the mental health task force and The Georgia COVID-19 Health Equity Council.
This initiative helped the Georgia Department of Community Health to improve its outreach to communities most affected by the virus.
This ensured the fair distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Dr. Fedrick has accomplished much in her life but none of it would have been possible without the grace of God and the love and support of her husband, Horace and her daughter, Grace.
On a personal note, I have worked with many University Presidents over the years.
Dr. Fedrick has been one of the most effective presidents that I will have worked with during my time in Congress.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my wife Vivian, and the 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in expressing our deepest gratitude and best wishes to President Dr. Marion Ross Fedrick for her dedicated service to Albany State University.
May God continue to bless her and her family as she enters a new chapter in her remarkable life. ____________________
