HONORING ALVIN JOSEPH PICARD, VETERAN OF THE GHOST ARMY, FOR RECOGNITION WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-04-05 Volume: 170, Issue: 58 Pages: E306 - E306 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING ALVIN JOSEPH PICARD, VETERAN OF THE GHOST ARMY, FOR RECOGNITION WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ______ of louisiana in the house of representatives Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Alvin Joseph Picard, a son of South Louisiana who by nature of his service in World War II has been recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal--the highest expression of national appreciation through Congress.
Mr. Picard was a native of Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, born on December 9, 1919.
He grew up amid the Depression and reached adulthood at a time of national crisis.
When America entered the Second World War, Mr. Picard enlisted in the United States Army.
He held the rank of Technician Fifth Grade with Signal Company of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops.
This top-secret unit is now known fondly as the ``Ghost Army.''
The 1,100-man unit was assigned a critical task: to mask and misrepresent the whereabouts, trajectory, and strength of Allied forces in Nazi-occupied France.
Operating in the European theater, the Ghost Army was engaged in battlefield operations beginning in June of 1944.
The unit's deception strategies were critical to many Allied victories across Europe, including the D-Day landings.
As a Cryptographic Technician in Signal Company, Mr. Picard employed ``spoof radio'' to confuse Axis forces and conceal the movements of other Allied troops.
His efforts and those of others in the Ghost Army saved countless American lives.
Thirty years after the war, a U.S. Army report noted: ``rarely, if ever, has there existed a group of such few men, which had so great an influence on the outcome of a major military campaign.''
While aiding the victory in Europe, the Ghost Army also laid the foundation for modern defense strategies, on which our national security depends.
As we confront present threats in psychological, cyber, and information warfare, the legacy of the Ghost Army and soldiers like Mr. Picard endures.
Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr. Picard posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family, community, and country.
On behalf of Louisiana's 3rd District, I thank Mr. Picard for his service.
May God bless his family and his Veteran Brothers of the Ghost Army. ____________________
