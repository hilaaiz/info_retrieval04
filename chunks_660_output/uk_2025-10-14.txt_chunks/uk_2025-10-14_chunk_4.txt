HONORING SAMRUDDHA PREUITT'S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT

_____

HON.
MAXINE DEXTER

Ms. DEXTER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an extraordinary

young leader from Oregon's 3rd Congressional District, Samruddha

Preuitt, a graduate of David Douglas High School in Portland.
Samruddha

was recently named a 2025 U.S. Presidential Scholar--one of just 161

students nationwide to earn this prestigious honor.
Since 1964, the U.S. Presidential Scholars Program has celebrated the

academic excellence, leadership, and dedication of our Nation's most

distinguished high school seniors.
This honor is reserved for students

who not only achieve top scores on college entrance exams but also

demonstrate outstanding scholarship, character, and service.
Samruddha embodies all of these qualities.
He now studies data

science and engineering at the University of Connecticut, drawn by its

strong commitment to undergraduate research.
As someone who engaged in

undergraduate research myself, I know how transformative those

experiences can be--and how they help prepare the next generation of

leaders in science, technology, and public service.
This achievement reflects not only Samruddha's individual brilliance

and perseverance, but also the strength of our public schools, our

educators, and a community that values opportunity and hard work.
I congratulate him on this remarkable achievement, and I wish him

continued success as he pursues his academic and professional journey.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF PEACOCK'S SIGNS & DESIGN

_____

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

and honor the remarkable achievements of Peacock's Signs & Designs, a

venerable black-owned business located in Grenada, Mississippi, that

has been a pillar of the community for nearly five decades.
Founded in 1976 by Walter Peacock, this family-owned enterprise began

humbly as a side endeavor creating personalized license plates.
Mr.

Peacock, a talented artist and dedicated entrepreneur, transformed his

passion and skill into one of Grenada County's oldest and most

successful businesses.
Through decades of unwavering hard work and commitment, Peacock's

Signs & Designs has grown from a small local operation into a respected

company serving hometown restaurants, boutiques, shopping plazas, and

even national restaurant and retail chains.
Mr. Peacock's dedication to

quality and service has earned the business a reputation for

excellence, not only in Grenada but also in surrounding communities and

smaller towns that lack local sign companies.
Today, the legacy of Peacock's Signs continues with the involvement

of Walter Peacock's two sons, Walter ``Winston'' Peacock, Jr. and Fred

``Wesley'' Peacock.
