INTRODUCTION OF THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT

_____

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Government

Accountability Office District of Columbia Home Rule Act.
This bill

would repeal the authority of the U.S. Government Accountability Office

(GAO) over the District of Columbia.
GAO, a federal agency that conducts investigations and audits for

Congress, has the same authority over D.C. that it has over federal

agencies.
GAO's authorizing statute defines D.C. as a federal agency.
In addition, GAO's authorizing statute and the D.C. Home Rule Act

require GAO to engage in specific types of oversight of D.C.

D.C. is not a federal agency, and it should never be treated as such.
D.C. already has a locally appointed auditor and inspector general, so

GAO's authority over D.C. is both redundant and offensive.
GAO does not

have general authority over states and cities, and therefore it should

not have such authority over D.C.

This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge

my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING DR.
LYNN KOWALSKI AND DR.
STEPHANIE WISHNEV FOR COMPLETING

THE TRANSAMERICA ROUTE

_____

HON.
SUSIE LEE

Ms. LEE of Nevada.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two

extraordinary women, Dr. Lynn Kowalski and Dr. Stephanie Wishnev, for

completing one of the TransAmerica routes.
It is one of the most

challenging cycling endeavors in the world, spanning from Astoria,

Oregon to Yorktown, Virginia.
As an avid cyclist myself, I know the grit and determination it takes

to complete even a single long-distance ride.
