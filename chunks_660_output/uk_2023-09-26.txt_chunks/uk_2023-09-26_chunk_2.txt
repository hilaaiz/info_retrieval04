Through their production of the Thomas Maupin

Festival, affectionately known as MaupinFest, in Unionville, Tennessee,

the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association has played a pivotal

role in preserving this significant piece of American cultural

heritage.
I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to the Uncle Dave

Macon Days Association, who diligently oversaw the National Buckdancing

Championship annually since 1986 when Congress entrusted them with this

duty, up until 2019.
Since its inception in 2019, the Tennessee Old-

Time Dance Association has organized MaupinFest and has continued to

bestow the title of National Buckdancing Champion on behalf of Uncle

Dave Macon Days.
In light of this transition in production, the Uncle

Dave Macon Days Association has expressed their desire to transfer the

responsibility for the National Buckdancing Championship permanently to

the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association.
MaupinFest aims to pay tribute to Mr. Maupin's dance style, which

stands as the quintessential representation of traditional Tennessee

rhythmic flatfoot buckdancing, distinct from the more common clogging.
Mr, Maupin's old-time buckdancing style merits preservation as a

cherished Tennessee treasure.
Therefore, I proudly announce that

henceforth, the title of National Old-Time Buckdancing Champion will be

conferred by the Tennessee Old-Time Music and Dance Association.
This

ensures that this historical American art form receives the recognition

it so rightfully deserves.

SALUTING THE CLEMENCEAU HERITAGE MUSEUM

HON.
ELIJAH CRANE

Mr. CRANE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the Clemenceau

Heritage Museum for their unwavering dedication to preserving the rich

history of Arizona's Verde Valley.
Originally opened in November 1991

through the efforts of the Verde Historical Society, the museum

showcases artifacts and pieces of historical significance that are

indicative of the rich heritage of both our district and state.
Since 1991, the members of the Verde Historical Society have been

committed to ensuring that our community's history is honored and

maintained through the museum's educational services to the public.
The

Verde Historical Society's vision made the museum a reality and their

continued faithfulness enables the history of Verde Valley to be

appreciated by all residents of the valley today.
The countless hours

they devote to the upkeep of the museum is commendable, and through

their work, the history of the region is kept alive.
The Museum's exhibits and displays have blessed our community with a

steady reminder of where we came from and the factors, including

mining, ranching, and farming, that empowered our society and economy

to prosper.
I applaud the Verde Historical Society for their commitment to

presenting the history of the region and for carrying the torch

necessary for current and future generations to enjoy and benefit from

our heritage.
