In 2011, he was seriously injured in a bicycling accident while

training for an Iron Man competition.
He later served as chairman of

the Tennessee Democratic Party from 2013 to 2015.
Roy graduated at the top of his class at the University of Tennessee

at Martin in 1975 and was chosen as a Rotary Scholar and spent a year

studying religion at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.
Returning to Tennessee, he received both a master's degree in Divinity

and a J.D. from Vanderbilt University in 1980.
Besides his accomplishments and dedication to public service, Roy

will be remembered as a truly nice guy.
I extend my deepest condolences

to his wife Nancy and his sons John, Rick and Ben, and his many friends

and supporters.
His was a life well lived, and he will be missed.
