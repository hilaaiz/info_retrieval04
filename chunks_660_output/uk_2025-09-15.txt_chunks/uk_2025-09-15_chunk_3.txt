A proud veteran and dedicated

educator, Ziggy lived a long and impactful life of 94 years, which

stretched far beyond the baseball diamond and hockey rink.
Born in 1930, Ziggy proudly served in the United States Air Force

before returning home to raise a family and dedicate his life to

teaching and coaching.
As a beloved educator at Western High School,

``Mr. G'' inspired countless students with his humor, wisdom, and

unshakable belief in their potential.
Ziggy was also the heart and soul of Clark Park, where he got the

name ``Mr. Clark Park'' and built hockey and baseball programs that

gave generations of young people a place to play, learn, and belong.
To

many, he will forever be ``Mr. Clark Park.''
His love of family,

sports, community, and music, especially jazz, reflected the very best

of Detroit.
We extend our love to his wife, siblings, children, grandchildren,

and friends as we celebrate his life, and we are committed to carrying

forward his spirit of service, joy, and justice.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PETER MAYS

HON.
RASHIDA TLAIB

Ms. TLAIB.
Mr. Speaker, today, the 12th Congressional District of

Michigan honors the life of Peter Mays, a dedicated and beloved member

of the Trinity Health family for over 20 years.
Peter served in the

Information Technology department, where he took pride in his work and

was known for his reliability, generosity, and willingness to help

others.
He continued working as long as his health allowed, retiring

just one week before his passing.
When not working, you could find

Peter riding his bike around the city of Detroit.
During a Trinity Health Town Hall attended by more than 600

employees, colleagues paid tribute to Peter in a special Colleague

Remembrance presentation.
His coworkers, many of whom became close

friends, stood by him and his family through challenging years,

offering hospital visits, home support, and heartfelt gestures of

kindness.
Peter's service, friendship, and example will be deeply missed, but

his impact will continue to inspire those who knew and loved him.
The

12th Congressional District of Michigan honors the life of Peter Mays

and extends heartfelt condolences to all his loved ones and friends.
