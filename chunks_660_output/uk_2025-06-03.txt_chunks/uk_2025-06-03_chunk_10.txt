Mr. Speaker, it is with profound respect and

admiration that I rise today to recognize the extraordinary efforts of

the students from Tohickon Middle School, part of the Central Bucks

School District, in Bucks County Pennsylvania, who have demonstrated

exceptional civic commitment through their participation in the Central

Bucks Veterans Recognition Project, the Library of Congress Veterans

History Project, and the United States Navy Memorial Student Interview

Program.
These students embody the very best of American youth--curious,

compassionate, and committed to preserving the legacy of those who have

selflessly served our Nation.
Through countless hours spent

interviewing and documenting the personal histories of our Veterans,

they have become stewards of memory, ensuring that the voices of our

heroes are not lost to time but instead honored and heard by future

generations.
For over a decade, students from Tohickon Middle School, Lenape

Middle School, Central Bucks High School East, and Central Bucks High

School West have gone above and beyond the classroom.
After school

hours, they have dedicated themselves to capturing the lived

experiences of local Veterans--contributions that now form part of a

national archive of living history.
These stories, rich with courage,

sacrifice, and resilience, serve not only as a tribute to those who

served but also as a powerful educational resource for all Americans.
Today, I especially commend the Tohickon Middle School History Corps,

led with vision and dedication by Dr. Fash, Mrs. Fox, Mrs. Girardi, Mr.

Neely, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Pakstis.
Under their guidance, students have

conducted interviews with Veterans from every branch of the Armed

Forces, spanning from World War II to the present day.
Many of these

Veterans had never before shared their stories on record.
By capturing

these memories, the students have created an irreplaceable bridge

between generations--one that deepens our collective understanding of

service, sacrifice, and patriotism.
One particularly moving example of their work took place during the

reunion of over 100 Veterans from the USS New Jersey, the most

decorated battleship in U.S. Navy history Invited to document this

historic gathering, the students traveled to the ship to interview its

clew members--many of whom were returning to their vessel for the first

time in decades.
From September through May, the students meticulously

crafted short documentaries that not only chronicled the Veterans'

experiences but also honored their enduring legacy.
These documentaries were presented on May 22, 2025, at the United

States Navy Memorial in Washington, D.C., before an audience that

included USS New Jersey Veterans, retired military personnel, and

leadership from both the Navy Memorial and the Library my of Congress

Veterans History Project.
This moment was not only a celebration of the

Veterans' service but also a testament to the students' remarkable

ability to preserve and elevate the stones that define our national

character.
Mr. Speaker, the work of these students is more than an academic

exercise--it is a profound act of remembrance and gratitude.
Their

efforts remind us that history is not merely written in textbooks but

lives in the hearts and voices of those who lived it.
I ask my

colleagues to join me in commending these young historians for their

dedication, their empathy, and their unwavering respect for those who

have worn their uniform of the United States of America.
I include in the Record the following who have documented the Service

Memories of Veterans and their families from Bucks County,

Pennsylvania:

Dr. Matthew Fash

Mr. James Neely

Mrs. Bridget Fox

Mrs. Amanda Girardi

Mr. Marcus Smith
