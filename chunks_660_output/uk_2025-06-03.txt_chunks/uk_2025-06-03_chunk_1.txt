CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY'S

PARTNERSHIP WITH THE KRAKOW UNIVERSITY OF ECONOMICS

HON.
HILLARY J. SCHOLTEN

Ms. SCHOLTEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary

milestone--the 50th anniversary of Grand Valley State University's

long-standing partnership with the Krakow University of Economics in

Poland.
For five decades, these two institutions have stood as a

shining example of the power and promise of international collaboration

in higher education, and I could not be prouder of the great work they

have achieved together.
GVSU is a pillar of our community.
Year after year, their commitment

to academic excellence and innovation has led generations of students

to reach their full potential.
With a dedication to fostering global

understanding, GVSU has always known the importance of offering

students opportunities that extend beyond our borders, and they have

worked tirelessly to connect their students with experiences that

broaden their global understanding.
This is why their partnership with

the Krakow University of Economics is so meaningful--a true testament

to their mission.
This partnership began in 1975, at a time when the United States and

Poland shared more differences than they did similarities.
Still, they

came together with a mission to educate, building a strong connection

based on mutual respect and a shared goal of helping students grow

through global learning.
Over the course of 50 years, their partnership

has helped foster not only academic excellence, but cultural exchange

and understanding between our two nations.
As our world becomes more

interconnected than ever, this partnership continues to serve as a

shining example of what can be achieved when we come together to learn

and grow from each other.
On behalf of Michigan's Third Congressional District, congratulations

to those at both Grand Valley State University and the Krakow

University of Economics who have maintained this collaboration over the

years.
This partnership has touched the lives of countless students,

faculty, and communities across the globe.
Today and every day, we

thank both institutions for their lasting impact on the communities

they serve.

HONORING INTERNATIONAL HOUSE DAVIS (I-HOUSE)

HON.
MIKE THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

International House Davis (I-House) as the organization celebrates 40

years of service.
Since its founding, I-House has helped make our Davis

community a more welcoming and inclusive place by building cultural

understanding and supporting international residents.
I-House was originally established in 1981 to connect International

students attending UC Davis to our greater Davis community.
In 1984,

the organization opened its permanent location at 10 College Park,

which has since become a central space for cultural exchange, language

learning, and public programming in our area.
What began as a small,

volunteer-led effort has grown into a well-established nonprofit

reaching thousands of people each year.
Each year, over 250 international residents participate in I-House's

English language programs.
In addition, more than 2,500 individuals

take part in the organization's cultural events and community programs.
These include music and dance classes, parenting groups, public

speaking workshops, and the I-House World Tour, a program that features

cultural traditions from around the world and partners with local

organizations to deepen community ties.
After the COVID-19 pandemic, I-House reevaluated its operation norms,

and decided to begin work on expanding its programming and reaching a

broader cross-section of our Davis community.
The organization has

since strengthened its support for immigrants, refugees, and newcomers

by launching new English language offerings and volunteer-driven

initiatives.
It has also added more community-led cultural programming,

including classes in Persian drumming, French and Peruvian dance, and

other areas that reflect the diversity of its participants.
