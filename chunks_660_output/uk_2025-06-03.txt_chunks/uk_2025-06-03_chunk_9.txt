ERIC SWALWELL

Mr. SWALWELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate

the outstanding contributions of Parvin Ahmadi, a lifelong educator

whose 36 years of service in public education have profoundly shaped

the lives of students, families, and educators across California.
Parvin Ahmadi began her career as a classroom teacher in San Jose

before taking on administrative roles in Fremont and ultimately serving

as Superintendent of the Castro Valley Unified School District for the

past decade.
Her unwavering belief that ``nothing you do for children

is ever wasted'' has guided her leadership and inspired a generation of

educators to pursue equity, access, and excellence in every classroom.
Over the course of her distinguished career, Superintendent Ahmadi

has served as a teacher, principal, director, assistant superintendent,

and superintendent--holding the latter position for 15 years.
Throughout her journey, she has built inclusive learning environments

by collaborating with school boards and communities to ensure that

every student has the opportunity to thrive.
Superintendent Ahmadi holds a bachelor's degree from San Jose State

University, a master's in teaching from Chicago, and a master's in

educational leadership from Saint Mary's College of California.
She

also earned a School Management Certificate from UCLA.
In addition to her district leadership, Parvin Ahmadi has made a

lasting impact at the state level.
As President of the Association of

California School Administrators (ACSA), she represented more than

18,000 administrators serving six million students.
She continues her

advocacy as Past President, mentoring new superintendents through

ACSA's professional development academies.
In 2019, she was named

Senate District 10 Woman of the Year by Senator Bob Wieckowski and also

contributed her expertise as a member of Assemblymember Anthony

Rendon's State Blue Ribbon Commission on Early Childhood.
It is my honor to recognize Parvin Ahmadi for her decades of service,

leadership, and enduring impact on public education.
Her legacy is one

of integrity, dedication, and a deep commitment to the belief that

every child deserves a champion.
We thank her for her remarkable career

and wish her continued success in all her future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING PRICILLA CRUZ-SEADO

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding

contributions that Pricilla Cruz-Seado has made to our community

through her work with New Beginnings Youth Shelter, which serves

homeless kids aged 10 to 17 who are between foster homes, abandoned, or

homeless.
The whole team jumps in to take care of the kids that have no

one else looking out for them.
They teach kids structure, respect,

understanding and so much more in a loving environment.
The team really

cares, and each member is deeply invested in the kids' long-term

success.
It is clear Pricilla Cruz-Seado has made a profoundly positive impact

on our community, and I am grateful for her service.
May we all strive

to serve our communities with the same dedication and humility.

FROM BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA AND THE USS NEW JERSEY (BB-62)

HON.
BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK

Mr. FITZPATRICK.
Mr. Speaker, it is with profound respect and

admiration that I rise today to recognize the extraordinary efforts of

the students from Tohickon Middle School, part of the Central Bucks

School District, in Bucks County Pennsylvania, who have demonstrated

exceptional civic commitment through their participation in the Central

Bucks Veterans Recognition Project, the Library of Congress Veterans

History Project, and the United States Navy Memorial Student Interview

Program.
These students embody the very best of American youth--curious,

compassionate, and committed to preserving the legacy of those who have

selflessly served our Nation.
Through countless hours spent

interviewing and documenting the personal histories of our Veterans,

they have become stewards of memory, ensuring that the voices of our

heroes are not lost to time but instead honored and heard by future

generations.
