HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR.
VICTOR TREVINO

HON.
HENRY CUELLAR

Mr. CUELLAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional

service of Dr. Victor Trevino--physician, public health advocate, and

the 85th Mayor of the City of Laredo.
A native son of Laredo and descendant of its founder, Captain Tomas

Sanchez, Dr. Trevino is a proud graduate of Nixon High School and the

Laredo public school system.
He pursued higher education at Laredo

Junior College and Texas A&M-Kingsville before earning his medical

degree in Coahuila, Mexico.
After completing his residency in New

Orleans, he returned home to serve the people of Laredo.
For nearly four decades, Dr. Trevino has cared for the most

vulnerable in our community.
As Medical Director of the Laredo Health

Department, he expanded access to maternity care, public health

clinics, and preventive services.
He also held leadership roles at

multiple hospitals, nursing facilities, and continues to serve as a

trusted physician in the community.
His leadership during the COVID-l9 pandemic was especially critical.
As Health Authority, Dr. Trevino launched a binational vaccination

program with Nuevo Laredo and Colombia, Nuevo Leon--administering

nearly 300,000 vaccines and significantly reducing hospitalizations and

deaths on both sides of the border.
Elected Mayor in 2022, Dr. Trevino continues to serve with compassion

and a deep belief in the betterment of our city.
Mr. Speaker, Dr. Trevino's life is a testament to service rooted in

heritage and guided by purpose.
On behalf of the 28th District of

Texas, I thank him for his enduring commitment to Laredo.

HONORING THOSE WHO MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE ON MEMORIAL DAY

HON.
AARON BEAN

Mr. BEAN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, standing at Arlington National

Cemetery, the weight of history surrounds you--rows of white headstones

stretching endlessly, each marking a life dedicated to service.
But

among them, one site stands apart: the eternal flame at President John

F. Kennedy's final resting place.
As the flame flickers, unwavering,

the words from his inaugural address echo in your mind.
``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we

shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any

friend, oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of

liberty.''
President Kennedy spoke those words in 1961, but he could have said

them today, or yesterday.
More than a declaration, those words are a

promise woven into the fabric of American history, upheld by the

generations of men and women laid to rest around him.
To put it simply,

President Kennedy's immortal words encapsulate Memorial Day perfectly.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Memorial Day, a time to

commemorate the valor and sacrifices of the brave men and women who

laid down their lives in service to our nation.
To recall those who

enlisted in our armed forces and fought to preserve our American

liberties, values, and way of life.
We remember the men who ran ashore the beaches of Normandy to end

WWII; those who fought in the snows of Korea; the bravery of those who

fought in the impenetrable jungles and unbearable heat of Vietnam; as

well as the men and women who were called to serve in the aftermath of

9/11.
