St. Philip Phan Van Minh Church, a national parish for Vietnamese

American Catholics in Orlando.

and actively involved with many faith celebrations and cultural

activities for the Vietnamese American and Asian communities in Central

Florida.
Most notable are the parish's annual Lunar New Year festivals,

which have been held for the last 32 years.

church, they were later relocated to the Central Florida Fairgrounds

due to their widespread and enthusiastic attendance.

attracts over 10,000 people annually to celebrate the Lunar New Year

and showcase Vietnamese culture and customs.
The other notable

achievement is the growth of the parish's Vietnamese Eucharistic Youth

Movement chapter, whose national organization has been recognized by

the USCCB in recent years.

Festival from a small gathering at a restaurant into a major annual

celebration in Kissimmee, now drawing over 10,000 attendees.
