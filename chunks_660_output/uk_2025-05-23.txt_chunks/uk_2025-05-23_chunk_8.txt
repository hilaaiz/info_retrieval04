Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green were sons of Mississippi

whose lives mattered.
Their futures were stolen, but their memory fuels

our pursuit of justice and accountability.
Let us ensure that future generations know their names--not just as

victims, but as young men who deserved to grow old, to dream fully, and

to live freely.
In honoring them today, we commit ourselves to building a nation

where no young person's life is met with such disregard--and where

history is neither buried nor forgotten.
May we speak their names, tell their story, and carry their legacy

forward.

WELCOMING GEORGE GLEZMANN HOME TO GEORGIA'S 5TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

HON.
NIKEMA WILLIAMS

Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome my

constituent George Glezmann home from more than 2 years of wrongful

detention by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
George is home with his family in Atlanta in large part because of

the tireless efforts of his wife Aleksandra.
A devoted Delta airplane

mechanic, George has an infectious zeal for life, travel, and

experience, and I know he is eager to return to a life of normalcy and

autonomy.
I also want to highlight the challenges that come from extended

wrongful detention: George has numerous medical conditions that arose

from lack of ongoing care, and his assets have been put in

conservatorship.
The financial instability that came from George's

detention has resulted in him and Aleksandra losing access to stable

housing, a challenge exacerbated by George's ongoing conservatorship.
I am so pleased that George is back with his family, and words cannot

fully celebrate the work Aleksandra put in to bring her husband home.
I

look forward to George's swift return to normalcy and autonomy with his

loved ones, back in Atlanta where he belongs.
