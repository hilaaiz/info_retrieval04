RECOGNIZING THE NATIONAL PUBLIC WORKS WEEK MAY 18-24, 2025 AND THE CITY

OF ANNISTON'S PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT

HON.
MIKE ROGERS

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

National Public Works Week, which takes place from May 18-24, 2025, and

to offer a special greeting to the City of Anniston Public Works

Department.
Our public works professionals dedicate their time and talent to

maintaining the infrastructure and facilities essential to public

health and our quality of life.
In Anniston, that work is carried out

under the capable leadership of David Arnett and Supervisory staff who

oversees a dedicated team of 58 employees.
Without the efforts of the Public Works Department, essential

services we all rely on, like safe roads, clean public spaces and

functional public buildings--simply could not be provided.
The Anniston

Public Works team works every day to rebuild, improve and safeguard our

transportation systems, structures and facilities.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing National Public Works Week

and thanking the City of Anniston's hardworking Public Works

professionals, engineers, managers and employees for their unwavering

commitment to help maintain our city's health, safety and advancing the

quality of life.

REMEMBERING PHILLIP LAFAYETTE GIBBS AND JAMES EARL GREEN--55 YEARS

LATER

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

memory of two young Black men--Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl

Green--whose lives were violently taken 55 years ago on May 15, 1970,

on the campus of Jackson State College in Jackson, Mississippi.
Phillip Gibbs was a 21-year-old junior at Jackson State College.
He

was majoring in political science and planned to attend law school.
He

was a husband and a father to a young son, Phillip Jr. At the time of

his death, his wife Dale was home with their child and pregnant with

their second son, Demetrius who would never get the chance to meet his

father.
In the late-night hours, nearly 500 rounds of ammunition were fired

at students gathered near Alexander Hall.
Phillip Gibbs was killed

outside the dormitory, while James Green was struck and killed across

the street near B.F. Roberts Hall.
Twelve others were wounded.
The

walls and windows of Alexander Hall still bear the scars of that night.
Despite multiple investigations, no one was ever held accountable for

the shootings.
Local and federal probes concluded that the use of force

was excessive and unjustified.
Yet, legal doctrines shielded those

responsible, and justice we never served.
To this day, the names Gibbs and Green are spoken with reverence in

Jackson and beyond.
Their memory lives on in the Gibbs-Green Plaza,

which stands where blood was once spilled--now transformed into a space

of reflection, remembrance, and resolve.
In 2021, Jackson State

University conferred honorary degrees posthumously on both young men--

an acknowledgment of the futures they were denied.
Mr. Speaker, on this 55th anniversary, we do more than remember--we

reaffirm our responsibility to tell their story with truth and dignity.
Phillip Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green were sons of Mississippi

whose lives mattered.
Their futures were stolen, but their memory fuels

our pursuit of justice and accountability.
Let us ensure that future generations know their names--not just as

victims, but as young men who deserved to grow old, to dream fully, and

to live freely.
