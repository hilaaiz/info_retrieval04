CONGRATULATING CHIEF KERRY NYE ON HIS RETIREMENT

HON.
LLOYD SMUCKER

Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Lititz Borough

Police Chief Kerry Nye on his retirement after 45 years in law

enforcement.
Kerry Nye began his career with the Lititz Borough Police Department

in 1980 and has remained there since, becoming a sergeant in 1994 and

the Chief of Police in 2016.
A staple of Chief Nye's leadership was his

geniality and his visibility in the community.
He planned emergency

services events, such as cancer treatment fundraisers, and was a

central figure in special occasions throughout Lititz Borough.
His dedication to serving the community extends beyond the Lititz

Borough Police Department, as he served with the Boy Scouts for more

than 30 years.
Once again, I want to thank Chief Nye for his selfless efforts

serving and protecting Lititz Borough.
I wish him the best in his well-

deserved retirement.

HONORING JAMESTOWN HIGH SCHOOL BAND AND CHORUS ON THEIR 100TH

ANNIVERSARY

HON.
NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 100th

anniversary of the Jamestown High School Band and Chorus, we honor a

century of musical excellence and dedication that has profoundly

enriched both the school and broader community.
Established in 1924 by siblings Arthur and Ebba Goranson, these

ensembles have become pillars of artistic achievement.
Under Arthur's

leadership, the band gained national recognition, performing in

prestigious events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and the

Tournament of Roses Parade.
Ebba's pioneering efforts led the formation

of the A Cappella Choir, renowned for its annual Vespers services and

international performances, earning the moniker ``Choir of the

Cathedrals.''
Over the decades, these programs have fostered generations of

talented musicians, instilling values of discipline, collaboration and

cultural appreciation.
As we celebrate this milestone, we commend and

express deep gratitude to the past, present and future directors,

instructors and students whose passion and dedication continue to

inspire the Jamestown community and uphold this remarkable legacy for

generations to come.

Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my fellow Hoosier,

John Michael Green, for his contributions to literature, entertainment,

and education, and in recognition of his latest book, Everything is

Tuberculosis, which debuted on March 18, 2025.
As a globally-recognized New York Times bestselling author, John's

podcasts, articles, live-action shows, motion pictures, and more.

his brother Hank have reached millions of people worldwide with over 65

accessible and engaging educational video series.

his platform to foster philanthropy and advocacy, including as an

advocate for Indianapolis, earning him the title ``Indy's best hype

man.''
Since 2019, John's focus has turned to global health and the fight to

eradicate tuberculosis.
Recognizing the artificial barriers to

tuberculosis treatment in developing nations, John's advocacy has

lowered the cost of lifesaving drugs and testing equipment and directed

millions of dollars to underfunded tuberculosis health programs.

Control and Prevention, John continues to highlight the tuberculosis

crisis through his newest release, Everything is Tuberculosis.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring John Green for his
