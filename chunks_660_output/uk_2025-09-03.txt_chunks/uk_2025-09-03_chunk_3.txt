HONORING DAVE PARATORE

HON.
ELISE M. STEFANIK

Ms. STEFANIK.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Dave Paratore,

owner of Dave's Diner in Schuyler, New York, a true institution in

Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley for more than three decades.
Since opening its doors on January 13, 1989, Dave's Diner has been

more than a restaurant--it has been a gathering place for families,

friends, and neighbors.
What began as a modest 40-seat room grew into

three dining rooms with more than 100 seats and even an ice cream

window.
For 25 years, the diner hosted Tuesday night cruise-ins, a

beloved tradition that became a fixture of Central New York summers.
Generations of employees passed through its doors, many starting as

young people looking for summer jobs who went on to become teachers,

medical professionals, engineers, and servicemembers.
Dave himself grew up helping run his family's Glen Motel and, with

little restaurant experience, poured his energy and vision into

creating a business that became part of the region's identity.
Through

hard work, he was able to build a future for his family, send two

children to school, and provide a home.
When his wife Joanne, a retired

Westmoreland schoolteacher, was diagnosed with cancer, Dave turned his

diner into a force for good, raising over $10,000 for the Joseph

Michael Chubbuck Foundation through the diner's cruise-ins to help

local families facing cancer.
Beyond his business success, Dave has given back to the community in

countless ways.
His diner was a hub for America First rallies since

2016, a place where neighbors came together not only for food but also

for civic life and shared values.
He quietly helped families in need,

especially those struggling with illness or financial hardship,

providing support in difficult times.
On August 7, 2025, Dave announced that Dave's Diner will close its

doors on September 1st as he begins his well-earned retirement.
The

outpouring of support was extraordinary, with hundreds of comments and

shares from people across the region who felt touched by the memories,

meals, and kindness that Dave and his team provided over 36 years.
On behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District, I am honored to

recognize Dave Paratore for his service to his community, his

generosity, and the enduring legacy of Dave's Diner.
His contributions

to Herkimer County and the Mohawk Valley will not be forgotten.
