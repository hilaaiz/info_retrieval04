Held along the beautiful shores of Lake Charlevoix, the Portside Art

Fair honors the deep connection between our region's natural beauty and

the inspiration it provides to artists.
It showcases the work of

established and emerging artists from East Jordan and throughout

Northern Michigan.
Each year, a qualified judge in the visual arts

carefully selects standout pieces to be honored with inclusion in the

prestigious Cygred Riley Gallery at Elm Point.
The standards for recognition at the Portside Art Fair are high, and

the quality of submissions reflects the extraordinary talent of our

local artists.
The fair serves as a powerful reminder of the important

role that the arts play in strengthening our communities, inspiring

future generations, and celebrating the unique character of Northern

Michigan.
Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend the East Jordan Area

Chamber of Commerce for organizing the 2025 Portside Art Fair and for

its unwavering support of the arts.
I offer my best wishes to all

participating artists and look forward to the continued success of this

treasured cultural event.
