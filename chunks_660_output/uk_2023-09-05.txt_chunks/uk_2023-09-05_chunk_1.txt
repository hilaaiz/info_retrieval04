HOMETOWN HEROES BRENDA AND DAVID HUGHES

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brenda and

David Hughes, creators of the ``Stay in the Light'' Christmas light

exhibit.
Their award-winning ``Stay in the Light'' spectacle was

started in memory of their son, Nathaniel, who struggled with

depression.
Nathaniel passed away in April of 2019, and the festivities

that the Hughes' host are in honor of his memory.
The Hughes family

accepts donations of blankets and socks that are donated to Meals on

Wheels Senior Services of Rockwall County for the elderly.
Food items and toys are also accepted for donation.
Brenda and David

commit over 100 hours and hang 60,000 lights to honor Nathaniel and

give back to those in need within their community.
I thank Brenda and

David Hughes for bringing extra light to our North Texas community.

HOMETOWN HERO GRAPEVINE POLICE OFFICER PATRICK O'NEAL

HON.
BETH VAN DUYNE

Ms. VAN DUYNE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24

Hometown Hero, Grapevine Police Officer Patrick O'Neal.
In 2017,

Officer O'Neal stalled working on a project to help law enforcement

find any area or room on a school campus in an emergency, within

seconds.
After realizing this could be lifesaving for officers who are

responding to an emergency at a school campus they may not be familiar

with, Officer O'Neal embarked on his mission of numbering every door

and hallway in Grapevine ISD, then creating digital maps of the floor

plans to share across departments.
It took years to gather the information for all the schools in the

district.
The maps include detailed information about all doors, their

accessibility to police, the most efficient points of entry and

directions to specific classrooms, and even indicate which doors

require keys to open.
