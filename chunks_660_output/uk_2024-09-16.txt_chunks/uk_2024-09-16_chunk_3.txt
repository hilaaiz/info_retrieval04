He then attended the State University of New York at

Buffalo, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical

Engineering, graduating magna cum laude in 1986.
His love of learning

led him to further his education, obtaining a Master of Science in

1998, followed by a second Master's in Creative Studies from SUNY

College at Buffalo in 2002.
Ed's professional career was marked by innovation and excellence.
Over his 35-year tenure at Mahle (formerly Delphi Harrison Thermal

Systems), he earned more than 20 patents and was inducted into the

Delphi Automotive Systems Innovation Hall of Fame in 1997.
His

dedication to his work culminated in receiving the prestigious 2013

``Boss'' Kettering Award, and he retired as a Product Engineering

Manager in 2020.
However, Ed's legacy extends far beyond his professional

achievements.
He was a man deeply committed to First Principles

Thinking--a philosophy that guided his approach to life, problem-

solving, and civic engagement.
Ed believed in the importance of

returning to fundamental truths and using them as a foundation to build

solutions, a method that influenced both his engineering work and his

advocacy.
Central to Ed's belief system was the conviction that natural

rights--those to life, liberty, and property--originated not from any

earthly government, but from our Creator.
He held that these rights

were inalienable and that governments were instituted among men to

protect them, not to grant them.
This belief fueled his passionate

advocacy for the Second Amendment, as he viewed the right to keep and

bear arms as a fundamental protection of these God-given rights.
To

safeguard these principles, Ed founded the Second Amendment For Ever

(SAfE) organization in Niagara County.
He was a staunch defender of the

rights of responsible gun owners, believing that public safety and

personal security were interdependent, both sustained by the

individual's right to self-defense.
Ed's commitment to

this cause was rooted in his deepseated belief that the Second

Amendment was essential to preserving all other freedoms.
Ed also championed the rights of farmers and the agricultural

community in Niagara County.
Recognizing the challenges faced by rural

areas under the current political system, he was a vocal advocate for

Rural Electoral Equity.
He argued that rural communities were

politically disenfranchised, with power disproportionately concentrated

in urban centers like New York City.
Ed believed this imbalance

undermined the principles of a republic, where all regions should have

an equal voice in governance.
His advocacy extended to challenging the 1964 Supreme Court ruling in

``Reynolds v. Sims,'' which mandated that Senate districts be

apportioned based on population rather than by county.
Ed contended

that this ruling led to political gerrymandering that favored urban

areas at the expense of rural communities, affecting key issues such as

gun control, energy, land use, and criminal justice.
Ed's vision was to make Niagara County a leading example of how rural

areas could assert their rights and push back against state overreach.
He worked tirelessly to build coalitions with other counties,

strengthen local government, and create barriers to state infringement.
As part of his efforts to support the agricultural community, Ed helped

form the Niagara County Agricultural Rights Advisory Panel, ensuring

that the voices of local farmers were heard and their rights protected.
His contributions to the community were recognized through several

awards, including the 2018 Ken Burner Memorial Award and the 2022

Oliver Jones Memorial Award Sportsperson of the Year from the Niagara

County Federation of Conservation Clubs, Inc.

Above all, Ed was a devoted family man.
He married his high school

sweetheart, Lisa (Bowers) Pettitt, in 1981, and together they raised

four sons: Edward II, Jonathon, Michael, and Thomas.
He was a loving

grandfather to five grandchildren, with whom he shared his love of the

outdoors, including fishing, camping, kayaking, and farming.
Edward D. Pettitt, Sr.
will be remembered as a man of integrity, a

fierce defender of constitutional rights, and a tireless advdcate for

rural communities.
