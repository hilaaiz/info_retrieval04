Under Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White's leadership, the

members of the Women's Missionary Society have grown in their mission

focus.
Episcopal Supervisor Penny is intentional about ensuring the

missionaries bless organizations that serve ``the least of these.''
Donations of diapers, clothing, socks, coats, toiletries, toys, and

funds are just a sampling of the ways the missionaries have an impact.
Penny's service to her community is rich and extensive, including

serving: with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Miami; as Chair and

Co-Chair of United Way Campaigns: as a Co-Chair for multiple March of

Dimes sub-committees; on Committees within the American Cancer Society;

as Treasurer for the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce Trustee Council;

with the Chamber as they travelled to Brazil and South Africa to foster

working relationships between countries; and as an officer of the Fort

Lauderdale Chapter of The Links, Incorporated.
Penny currently serves

as a Board Member of the Black Women's Agenda, Inc.

During her tenure, Episcopal Supervisor Penny Hartsfield White

spearheaded the project to build a home for a pastor in Africa when she

learned he needed a place to live.
She led the construction of a

commercial kitchen in the public library in Pembroke, Illinois, to

ensure the community had a suitable gathering place.
She also

coordinated the purchase of sewing machines for widowed women in India

so they could make items to sell to support their families.
I join with members of the 4th Episcopal District of the African

Methodist Episcopal Church and the global community to thank Mrs. Penny

Hartsfield White for her exceptional service to the church and our

nation.
I wish her health and happiness in her weIl-deserved

retirement.
