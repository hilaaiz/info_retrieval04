Additionally, during

this time, she met and married Frank C. Smith of Charleston.
Her

dedication to education and community service served as an inspiration

to her five children, all of whom served as educators in various

capacities.
Mrs. Smith accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior at a young age and

was baptized at Calvary Baptist Church.
Her love for the Lord would

follow her throughout the entirety of her life.
A longtime devoted

parishioner of Morris Street Baptist Church in Charleston, Mrs. Smith

was involved in the Senior Choir, Hour of Power Choir, Educational

Ministry, Newsletter Ministry, Social Butterflies, Senior Ministry,

Pastoral Aid, Senior Citizens, and Sunday School.
After relocating to the Washington, D.C. area to live with her

daughter Jennifer, Mrs. Smith became a member of the Reid Temple AME

Church.
There, she participated in the Reid Temple Senior Services

Bible study.
However, Morris Street Baptist always remained dear to her

heart.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in honoring

the remarkable life of Mrs. Mary Ellen Rivers Smith.
She is remembered

fondly by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchild, beloved

relatives, church family, and dear friends.
Mrs. Smith lived a life

full of love, devotion, public service, and grace.
She will be sorely

missed and well-remembered by all blessed to know her.
