CELEBRATING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MILITARY WORKING DOG TEAMS

NATIONAL MONUMENT

HON.
CHIP ROY

Mr. ROY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 10th

anniversary of the Military Working Dog Teams National Monument located

at Joint Base San Antonio--Lackland.
For the past ten years, the Military Working Dog Teams National

Monument has served as a physical symbol of the loyal service and

unconditional sacrifice that military working dogs have made alongside

our men and women in uniform since WWII.
It is a privilege and an honor to celebrate the anniversary of the

Military Working Dog Teams National Monument.
I hope this record serves

as an acknowledgment of the immeasurable debt of gratitude owed to both

soldiers and K-9s by the American people.
On behalf of Texas' 21st

Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing

the extraordinary sacrifice of these individuals and animals.

CELEBRATING THE LAS VEGAS ACES FOR WINNING THE 2023 WOMEN'S NATIONAL

BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION CHAMPIONSHIP

HON.
DINA TITUS

Ms. TITUS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge and congratulate

the Las Vegas Aces on winning the 2023 Women's National Basketball

Association Finals.
On October 18, 2023, the Las Vegas Aces defeated the New York

Liberty, 70-69, in Game 4 of the WNBA Finals.
The Aces won the

championship three games to one and became the first professional team

in Nevada to win two championships.
They won despite two of their

starters being out with injuries, star guard Chelsea Gray and center

Kiah Stokes.
They also became the first WNBA team in 21 years to win consecutive

championships.
Hall of Fame head coach Becky Hammon led the team to victory and

became the third coach in either the NBA or WNBA to win two

championships in her first two seasons.
Even before the playoffs, the Aces had an incredible season,

clinching first seed in the playoffs after dominating the regular

season with a record of 34-6.
They set a new league record for wins and

led the league in points per game and field goal percentage.
At home, the Aces went 19-1 in the regular season and undefeated in

the postseason, setting attendance records and even hosting the All-

Star Game.
Owner Mark Davis and Team President Nikki Fargas proved once again

that investing in women's sports is investing in success, thereby

setting an example for others to follow.
In the championship-clinching game, Finals Most Valuable Player A'ja

Wilson led the way with 24 points and 16 rebounds, while Jackie Young

added 16 points and seven assists.
And Kelsey Plum delivered a well-

rounded performance of eight rebounds, five assists, and seven points.
The Aces never trailed in the fourth quarter.
The Aces certainly raised the stakes when securing another

championship for Vegas, firmly establishing District One as the Sports

Capital of the World.
All of Southern Nevada is very proud and I can't wait to cheer the

team on next year as they go for three in a row.
