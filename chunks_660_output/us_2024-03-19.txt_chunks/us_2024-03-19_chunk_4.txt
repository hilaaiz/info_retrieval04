HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF AUDREY BURGETTE; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.
48



Date: 2024-03-19 Volume: 170, Issue: 48 Pages: E262 - E262 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND MEMORY OF AUDREY BURGETTE ______ of missouri in the house of representatives Mr. CLEAVER.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to commemorate the life of Mrs. Audrey Burgette.
Mrs. Audrey lived a life of selflessness, service, and desire to better her community.
There are individuals whose impact transcends time, leaving an indelible mark on those fortunate enough to have known them.
Audrey June (Stewart) Burgette, the first Black female graduate of William Jewell College, was one of these special people.
Audrey Burgette was born in Liberty, Missouri on July 18, 1930.
The circumstances of her childhood were a reflection of the times--Liberty was a racially segregated community still in the grips of Jim Crow laws.
Her early educational years were also plagued by second-class treatment due to her race.
This was before the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, so her schooling occurred under less than ideal conditions.
She grew up in a supportive African American community and a loving family, which bolstered her to remain steadfast in her put suit of academic excellence and personal growth.
As a testament to this, she graduated as Valedictorian of her class at Garrison School in Liberty.
Throughout her life, Audrey stood as a beacon of resilience and determination for overcoming numerous challenges.
In her early 20s, she married John West Stapleton and welcomed two children, Carrie Eileen Stapleton and John West Stapleton, Jr., Esq.
At the young age of 25, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and was partially paralyzed by the disease.
She battled back and regained her ability to walk, only to face the pain of divorce.
Fortunately, she found love once again with Herbert Lee Burgette, a Korean War veteran from Kansas City.
Together with Herbert, Audrey welcomed two more children into her loving embrace, the late Dr. Phillip Leroy Burgette, M.D., and Brigitte Burgette Bradley, Esq.
Love was always present in her blended family's lives.
Even though she and John were divorced, her second husband, Herbert, would sometimes connect with John Sr.,
a disabled war veteran, and offer to drive him to milestone events in Carrie and John Jr.'s lives, such as graduations and sporting events.
While raising four children under the age of 10, Audrey was unrelenting in her quest for education.
She achieved her dream of attending and graduating from William Jewell College with a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education in 1966.
She later earned a Master of Arts in Education from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 1972.
