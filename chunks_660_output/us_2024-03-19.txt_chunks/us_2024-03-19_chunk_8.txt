In 1998, it was Brian who made the unforgettable phone call to me to share the shocking and tragic news of Sonny's death.
After Sonny's passing, Brian went on to serve as Chief of Staff to Congresswoman Mary Bono from 1998 until 2000.
He launched a government affairs consulting business named Nestande and Associates, and worked collaboratively with clients on alternative energy and healthcare issues.
In 2008, Brian's own name was on the ballot for the first time and he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he would serve until 2014.
In Sacramento, Brian was a tireless advocate for the Coachella Valley and Riverside County, working on important local issues like the Salton Sea and improving our infrastructure.
After his time in the Assembly, Brian joined the County of Riverside where he served as Deputy CEO, coordinating legislative priorities with state and federal representatives in the region.
Brian is survived by his wife Gina; his son Hayden; his daughter Sophia; and his stepchildren Sadie, Tad, Mason, Molly and Savana.
I extend my personal and heartfelt condolences to the Nestande family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Brian.
Although he may be gone, the many contributions he made to his community and family have left an enduring legacy. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO PETER ANDREW STURROCK, PH.D. ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-19 Volume: 170, Issue: 48 Pages: E264 - E265 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E264-E265] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PETER ANDREW STURROCK, PH.D. ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ of california in the house of representatives Ms. ESHOO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Peter Andrew Sturrock, Ph.D., who celebrates the centennial of his birth on March 20, 2024.
Dr. Sturrock grew up in Essex, England and studied at Palmers School, Grays, Essex, where his favorite subject was mathematics.
He studied mathematics at Cambridge University, then helped develop radar systems at what is now the Royal Radar Establishment.
He earned a scholarship to St. John's College where he was elected to a fellowship.
Dr. Sturrock then pursued work in electron physics at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, the National Bureau of Standards, and the Ecole Normale Superieure at the University of Paris.
In 1951, Dr. Sturrock earned his Ph.
D in astrophysics.
He researched nuclear physics at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment; plasma physics at St. John's College, Cambridge; microwave tubes at Stanford University; and accelerator physics at the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
He invented a number of implements, including a novel microwave tube later dubbed the ``Free electron laser.''
In 1961, Dr. Sturrock was appointed Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford University, where he lived for nearly 40 years with his wife Marilyn.
He is Emeritus Professor of Applied Physics at Stanford and Emeritus Director of the Center for Space Science and Astrophysics.
In 1990, he was awarded the Arctowski Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Sturrock founded and then served as president for many years at the Society for Scientific Exploration.
He also served as Chairman of the Plasma Physics Division and the Solar Physics Division of the American Astronomical Society.
In 2009, Dr. Sturrock published his autobiography, A Tale of Two Sciences: Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist, which covered both his research in conventional physics and his less mainstream investigations.
In 2013, he published AKA Shakespeare: A Scientific Approach to the Authorship Question.
In this book, he lays out a method for weighing evidence which he developed for studying pulsars.
Dr. Sturrock then invites the reader to apply the method to tabulate their own ``degree of belief'' in three different candidates for authorship of the works usually attributed to Shakespeare.
He was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020 and has a deep interest in unidentified flying objects.
