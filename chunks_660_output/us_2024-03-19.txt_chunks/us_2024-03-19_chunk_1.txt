JENNIFER L. McCLELLAN of virginia in the house of representatives Ms. McCLELLAN.
Mr. Speaker, the Virginia General Assembly proclaimed March 28th as James Solomon Russell Day.
Today, I use to honor his legacy and incredible contributions to our Commonwealth.
Born enslaved in 1857, James Solomon Russell's life journey exemplifies resilience and determination.
After receiving his teaching license in Warren County, North Carolina, and beginning to teach in the area, he attended Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in 1874.
However, due to financial difficulties, he was unable to complete his studies and returned to teach in Warren County.
Thereafter, he became interested in the Episcopal Church and was the fist student at Saint Stephen's Normal and Industrial School (later Bishop Payne Divinity School) in Petersburg, VA.
He dedicated himself to uplifting his community and worked among Zion Union members in Brunswick County.
His tireless efforts included the establishment of schools, senior housing, and the founding of Saint Paul's College in 1888.
Through his leadership, thousands of African American youth were empowered to pursue education, becoming beacons of progress across the Commonwealth.
Despite closing its doors in 2013, James Solomon Russell's indelible mark at Saint Paul's College is kept alive at the James Solomon Russell--Saint Paul's College Museum and Archives in Lawrenceville, Virginia.
I commend the James Solomon Russell Commemoration Committee and the Saint Paul's College Museum Committee for spearheading the community effort to open the museum to the public in 2019.
Moreover, I extend my deepest appreciation to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture Robert F. Smith Center for the Digitization and Curation of African American History.
Their collaboration with the James Solomon Russell-- Saint Paul's College Museum and Archives is invaluable.
The Center's expertise in archiving and digitizing historical records ensures that Russell's story, along with the rich history of Saint Paul's College, remains accessible to future generations. ____________________

RONALD VAUGHN AND HIS EXCEPTIONAL CAREER ______ of florida in the house of representatives Ms. CASTOR of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the career and service of Dr. Ronald Vaughn, president of the University of Tampa.
Throughout his 28 years of leadership with the University of Tampa, Dr. Vaughn has lifted students, faculty, the university, and the Tampa Bay community.
He spearheaded a remarkable turnaround for the university and leaves UT ranked among the best medium-sized private universities in America.
Dr. Vaughn's remarkable career, his lifelong commitment to education, and exceptional stewardship of the University of Tampa have propelled the school into being an academic powerhouse.
During his tenure as president, the school's academic offerings and footprint grew into the dynamic, community-connected institution that we are proud of today.
Dr. Vaughn embraced the history of the historic Tampa Bay Hotel, Plant Hall and the iconic minarets and infused the university with life and amenities for students including an expanded campus with 71 construction projects completed or underway and investments worth a total of $950 million.
The University of Tampa now hosts students from all 50 states and from almost all 195 countries.
Dr. Vaughn's leadership has been fundamental to achieving academic excellence with a unique entrepreneurial spirit.
Dr. Vaughn's academic journey is a model for my others--a B.A and an MBA from Indiana State University, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Georgia.
