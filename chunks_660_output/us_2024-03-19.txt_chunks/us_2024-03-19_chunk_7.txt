RECOGNIZING JULIE SHAMBARGER'S CONTRIBUTIONS RESTORING THE TIMES THEATER IN ROCHESTER, INDIANA; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-19 Volume: 170, Issue: 48 Pages: E264 - E264 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING JULIE SHAMBARGER'S CONTRIBUTIONS RESTORING THE TIMES THEATER IN ROCHESTER, INDIANA ______ of indiana in the house of representatives Mr. YAKYM.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Julie Shambarger for the incredible work she has done to revitalize downtown Rochester, Indiana, by spearheading the effort to refurbish and reopen The Times Theater in Rochester.
As is the case with so many venues on Main Streets across America, The Times Theater was an iconic symbol of Main Street Rochester before closing its doors in 2014.
Rather than accept The Times Theater's apparent fate as a project of the past, Julie Shambarger poured her heart and soul into the mission of ensuring this cherished community fixture would be open for business and welcome visitors once again.
Guided by her belief that The Times Theater could be restored as the vibrant heart of the Rochester community, Julie marshalled the effort to acquire the grants and donations needed to renovate The Times Theater so its reopening could be not only a possibility, but a reality.
Today, The Times Theater is host to not only movies but also live music and community events, and it has welcomed over 9,000 guests since reopening last February.
It has elevated the cultural landscape of Rochester and been a beacon of artistic innovation and creative expression.
At a time when many of America's social and civic ties are fraying, places like The Times Theater--places the community can take pride in and congregate at--are all the more important.
I and so many other Hoosiers are immensely grateful to Julie Shambarger for the dedicated and diligent work she has done to bring more energy and life back to downtown Rochester and all of Fulton County.
I look forward to visiting The Times Theater again soon and seeing how Julie Shambarger's efforts will continue to pay dividends in the years ahead. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO BRIAN NESTANDE; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-03-19 Volume: 170, Issue: 48 Pages: E264 - E264 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO BRIAN NESTANDE ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CALVERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my good friend and former California State Assemblyman Brian Nestande, who passed away at his home in Palm Desert earlier this month.
Brian was a dedicated leader in the Coachella Valley who has left us far too soon, and he will be deeply missed.
Born in Orange County, California, on January 10, 1964, Brian was exposed to the world of public service and politics at an early age.
Brian's father, Bruce, was a staff member for then-California Governor Ronald Reagan and later an elected member of the State Assembly and Orange County Board of Supervisors.
After graduating from California State University, Fullerton in 1991, Brian started his own political career by taking a position as the Deputy Campaign Manager for the successful congressional campaign of Michael Buffington in Santa Barbara County.
A few years later, Brian managed then-Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono's congressional campaign, which was also successful.
He went on to serve as Sonny's Chief of Staff.
In 1998, it was Brian who made the unforgettable phone call to me to share the shocking and tragic news of Sonny's death.
After Sonny's passing, Brian went on to serve as Chief of Staff to Congresswoman Mary Bono from 1998 until 2000.
He launched a government affairs consulting business named Nestande and Associates, and worked collaboratively with clients on alternative energy and healthcare issues.
