WELLSTON 150TH ANNIVERSARY

HON.
BRAD R. WENSTRUP

Mr. WENSTRUP.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 150th Anniversary

of the Village of Wellston, Ohio.
Since its founding in 1873, the

Village of Wellston has been an important industrial and historical

center of Southeast Ohio for nearly 2 centuries.
Harvey Wells, a Civil War veteran and Ohio native, used part of his

Jackson County property to establish Wellston.
Wellston was officially

incorporated as a Village in 1876 with the hopes of being the ``New

Pittsburgh of the West.''
With the construction of numerous blast furnaces, the Village of

Wellston solidified itself as an important industrial and mining town

in Southern Ohio.
Wellston also played an important role in the

Underground Railroad system acting as one of the first stops in the

North and became the settling point for several freed slaves.
Throughout its history, the Village of Wellston has been a beacon of

prosperity and freedom for Southern Ohio, and I am honored to represent

a town with such a rich history and strong sense of community.
Again, I want to congratulate the Village of Wellston on celebrating

its 150th Anniversary and recognize their importance to Jackson County

and all of Southern Ohio.
May they continue to prosper over the

centuries to come.
