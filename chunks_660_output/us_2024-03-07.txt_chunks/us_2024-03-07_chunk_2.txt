Throughout her career she's made a positive impact everywhere she's been.
Dr. Applegate oversaw more than 11,000 employees and was responsible for the commercial performance of the Crop Science business in the United States and Canada, which is a segment worth more than $8B in net sales.
Dr. Applegate made significant impacts throughout her career, whether through her commitment to assist in the career elevation for each team member or in opening opportunity for the youth who will lead agriculture in the future.
The greatest leaders we have not only take on the issues of today, but they also lay the groundwork for a better tomorrow.
Dr. Applegate certainly fits that description.
Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Dr. Applegate for her service to America's farmers and agriculture around the world, and in wishing her a happy retirement on an unforgettable career. ____________________
HONORING TAMMY HOLLAND; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 41 Pages: E223 - E223 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING TAMMY HOLLAND ______ of utah in the house of representatives Mr. MOORE of Utah.
Mr. Speaker, I was saddened by the recent and sudden passing of Tammy Holland, who was an anchor in the Ogden, Utah and Hill Air Force Base communities.
Tammy was a native to Colorado, where she grew up hiking, skiing, and riding horses.
She brought her love of the outdoors to Utah and instilled the same admiration for God's creations in her children, Andrew and Avery.
Tammy was easy to be around and quick to welcome anyone as a new friend.
With her husband of 23 years, Tammy built her home centered on faith in Jesus Christ and encouraged family and friends alike to join her in serving others.
It's no easy task raising two kids in an Air Force family, and Tammy was a rock for her husband and children as they made homes in Florida, South Carolina, Ohio, Germany, Texas, Massachusetts, Virginia, Illinois, Missouri, and ultimately, Utah.
Friends and loved ones in each of these communities came to love Tammy for her organizing and compassionate service to the Airmen and their respective families.
Our community is better because of her efforts and her influence will be greatly missed.
It is upon us to carry forward her legacy of service.
I extend my deepest sympathy to Tammy's husband, Col.
Jeff Holland, and their son, Andrew, and daughter, Avery, for their loss, and I offer my prayers on their behalf. ____________________

In 1978, Mr. Moore embarked upon one of his greatest gifts when he founded the African American Panoramic Experience (APEX) Museum, where he proudly served as its President until his passing.
The APEX Museum is the oldest Black history museum in Atlanta and a cultural institution.
