A tireless entrepreneur, filmmaker, producer, writer, cinematographer, editor, exhibition designer, photographer, author, and humanitarian, Mr. Moore was a man of immense talent and his renowned works in film, music, and literature helped shape our culture in Atlanta and beyond.
In 1978, Mr. Moore embarked upon one of his greatest gifts when he founded the African American Panoramic Experience (APEX) Museum, where he proudly served as its President until his passing.
The APEX Museum is the oldest Black history museum in Atlanta and a cultural institution.
His work will live on as the museum plans APEX Phase II, a massive 90,000 square foot expansion that will provide a state-of-the- art walk-through history, from African civilizations to contemporary Black America.
Among his many awards and accolades, Mr. Moore received the Joseph R. Biden Presidential Lifetime Achievement Award on October 21, 2023.
Most recently, during Black History Month this year, I had the pleasure of recognizing Mr. Moore for his pioneering contributions to the preservation and showcasing of Black history and culture in Atlanta at a ceremony in Stonecrest.
I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the outstanding life and legacy that Mr. Moore leaves behind for generations to come. ____________________
PASSAGE OF THE WINNEBAGO LAND TRANSFER ACT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-03-07 Volume: 170, Issue: 41 Pages: E223 - E224 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E223-E224] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PASSAGE OF THE WINNEBAGO LAND TRANSFER ACT ______ of kansas in the house of representatives Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1240, the Winnebago Land Transfer Act, introduced by my colleague, Mr. Feenstra from Iowa.
This critical bill would transfer rightfully-owed land back to the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska.
The land in question was taken from the Tribe in an illegal acquisition, and due to complex legal stipulations within the most recent court proceedings pertaining to this matter, the land has still not been returned to the Tribe.
Legal complications of these sorts when it comes to federal tribal trust responsibility are an all-too-common phenomenon for Indian Country and demonstrates the importance of a strong relationship between the federal government and tribes.
This bill would reinstate the autonomy of the land back to the Winnebago Tribe and protect their sovereignty.
The state of Iowa, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and two affected counties are supportive of this bill, and have demonstrated their support for this cause.
I applaud my colleagues who have moved swiftly to pass this bill. ____________________
