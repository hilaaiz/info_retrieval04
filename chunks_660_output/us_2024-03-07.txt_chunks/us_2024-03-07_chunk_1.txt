J. BRENT OLMSTEAD ______ of idaho in the house of representatives Mr. SIMPSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the distinguished career and contributions of J. Brent Olmstead, a fourth generation Idahoan raised on a cattle ranch with a rich background in public policy and advocacy.
Brent grew up on a cattle ranch south of Twin Falls, Idaho, and dedicated over 35 years of his life to public service.
He began his career as a lobbyist for Idaho Commerce and Industry in 1994.
There he focused his attention and expertise on issues such as agriculture, natural resources, immigration, and the environment.
After 7 years at IACI, where he served as vice-president.
Brent then created his own consulting firm named MPIdaho.
As a consultant, Brent specialized in public policy development and strategic planning for private businesses in agriculture, taxation, and immigration.
He also created the non-profit organization, Milk Producers of Idaho.
More recently, Brent joined the University of Idaho's College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, as assistant dean for government and external relations.
In this capacity, Brent worked extensively on a project called the Idaho Center for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment (CAFE).
The new center will focus their research on critical problems that agribusiness faces.
Brent also received IACI's 2023 Pat K. Harwood award, in recognition of his decades of service to the state of Idaho.
A great achievement for a man who exemplifies what it means to be a leader.
His commitment to Idaho is also evident through his service on various boards, including the advisory board for the James A. and Louise McLure Center for Public Policy Research, the Idaho Hispanic Foundation, the Idaho Small Business Advisory Council, the Children's Discovery Center of Idaho, and Idaho Red Cross.
My friend, Brent Olmstead, has had many titles in his distinguished career, but the two most important to Brent are father and husband.
Brent is a devoted family man and raised five children with his late wife, Jane Wittmeyer.
If anyone has earned the right to have a peaceful and enjoyable retirement, it is Brent.
Well done my friend and congratulations. ____________________
