As pastor of Living Word Fellowship Church since October 10, 1999, he has always taken the stance that the Word must be taught with passion and boldness--without compromise--in order that the lost will be saved, and the saved will be strengthened.
Growing together in the Word of God, Pastor Larry and First Lady Wanda Benford are consummate students of the Word and outspoken believers in its ability to change lives for the better.
Pastor Larry and First Lady Wanda Benford's greatest desire is that others would develop an intimate, personal relationship with the Lord.
