Date: 2023-09-13 Volume: 169, Issue: 148 Pages: E841 - E841 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONOR FLIGHT OF SOUTHERN OREGON ______ of oregon in the house of representatives Mr. BENTZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Vietnam and Korean War Veterans from Oregon's Second Congressional District who, through the efforts of Honor Flight of Oregon, are visiting their memorials on the National Mall.
When I meet these heroes, I am reminded of the enduring words of George S. Patton, Jr., who said, ``The highest obligation and privilege of citizenship is that of bearing arms for one's country.''
These words, Mr. Speaker, still ring true today.
Those who value liberty are indebted to these heroes, for each one of them defended our freedom through acts of service, sacrifice, and bravery on behalf of our country.
It is my privilege to include in the Record their names.
The Veterans on this Honor Flight from Oregon are: Joshua Alvarez, Army; Dennis Anderson, Navy; Thomas Beckley, Army; Jerry Chartier, Sr, Marine Corps; Fredd Conn, Marine Corps; David Cunningham, Navy; William Duncan, Army; Richard Gehrke, Navy/Marine Corps; Edward Goodman, Navy; Roger Haynes, Air Force/Army; Robert Howerton, Navy; Michael Hoffman, Navy; David Johnson, Army; Earl Kilpatrick, Air Force; Jesse Redding, Navy; Paul Lofland, Army; Robert Long, Marine Corps; Jesus Lopez, Air Force; Preton Manville II, Marine Corps; William Mathews, Army/Air Force; Lawrence Mixon, Jr, Army; Charles Owen, Army; Robert Rammin, Army; Steven Rolston, Army; Loyd Thurman, Army; Jerry White, Army; and Otto William, Air Force.
These heroes join over 260,000 Veterans, who since 2005, have been honored through the nationwide Honor Flight Network of volunteers.
I would also like to recognize the volunteers and guardians traveling on this trip: Janet Wilkerson, and the guardians who have also served our country: Kathrine Berg, Army; Jody William, III, Marine Corps.
Mr. Speaker, in his 1983 Memorial Day address, Ronald Reagan said, ``We are forever indebted to those who have given their lives that we might be free.''
As a Nation, we must never take for granted the liberties we enjoy today, recognizing that these freedoms have been hard-won by the honor, commitment, and sacrifice of our Veterans.
Each Member in this chamber and citizen in these United States should be humbled by the courage of the brave Veterans who voluntarily underwent the dangers necessary to preserve our country.
Colleagues, please join me in thanking these Veterans and the volunteers of Honor Flight of Oregon for their remarkable service and devotion to our great country. ____________________
