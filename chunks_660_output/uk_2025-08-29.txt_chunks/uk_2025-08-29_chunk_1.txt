CELEBRATING COLONEL WILLARD ALVIN ``BILL'' BARNES

HON.
JOAQUIN CASTRO

Mr. CASTRO of Texas.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of

Colonel Willard Alvin ``Bill'' Barnes who is turning one hundred five

years old on August 30, 2025.
Colonel Barnes was born in Atkinson, Nebraska, on August 30, 1920.
Raised by his maternal grandfather, Ole Torske, he was imbued with an

understanding of the power of service, loyalty, and hard work at an

early age.
In 1942, Colonel Barnes bravely answered the call to defend our

Nation by enlisting in the United States Army shortly after the attack

on Pearl Harbor.
He completed his training at Camp Shelby Joint Forces

Training Center in Mississippi, where he then became a member of the

85th Infantry, Custer Division.
He was deployed to the North African

Theater of Operations during World War II.
Upon the campaign's

completion, he and his division traveled to Italy where they fought in

three campaigns in the Rome-Arno region, the North Apennines and the Po

River Valley.
Following Colonel Barnes' service in World War II, he returned to

Nebraska where he enrolled at Creighton University and earned his

bachelor's degree and Juris Doctor degree.
Upon graduation in 1952, he

began a twenty-eight-year career in the United States Air Force as part

of the Judge Advocate General's Corps.
Colonel Barnes' time in Judge Advocate General's Corps sent him

across the world in service to our country.
Throughout his career, he

served domestically in Idaho, Alaska, California, Washington, D.C.,

Illinois and New Mexico, and internationally in London, Madrid and

Seoul.
After nearly four decades of military service, Colonel Barnes

retired, but his commitment to service did not end.
He dedicated

himself to serving senior citizens, unhoused persons and his church

community.
As rich as Colonel Barnes' military career is, so is his familial

life.
He was born to his mother Anna Torske Barnes and had two

brothers, Olin Barnes and Raymond Barnes.
He married Elaine Spielman

Barnes on July 16, 1948, with whom he would spend 72 years of his life.
They had three children, M.J. Barnes, Barbara Barnes and Kari Rugh.
He

has three grandchildren, Alex Barnes, Nicholas Barnes and Kalie Kyo,

and one great grandchild, Katherine Millie Barnes.
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to recognize the life and career of Colonel

``Bill'' Barnes on his 105th birthday.
I thank Colonel Barnes for his

service to our country and the San Antonio community.

CONGRATULATING SABA ON THE GRAND OPENING OF ITS NORTH AMERICAN

HEADQUARTERS

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate SABA on the

grand opening of its new North American headquarters in St. Clair,

Michigan.
This nearly 60,000 square foot facility marks a significant

milestone for a company that has grown into a global leader in

adhesives and sealants over the past 90 years.
Founded in the Netherlands, SABA has earned a strong reputation for

innovation, sustainability, and industry leadership--particularly in

the mattress and furniture sectors, where its adhesives are widely used

across the United States.
With a market share exceeding 50 percent,

SABA plays an essential role in the products Americans use every day.
The new headquarters includes a one-of-a-kind technical center that

will serve as a hub for testing, training, and product development,

reinforcing the company's commitment to excellence and customer

collaboration.
This $4 million investment not only expands production

and warehouse capacity, but also strengthens the local economy and

supports job growth in Michigan.
Mr. Speaker, I applaud SABA's continued success and leadership, and I

am proud to welcome their expanded presence in St. Clair.
I wish them

the very best as they open this new chapter.
