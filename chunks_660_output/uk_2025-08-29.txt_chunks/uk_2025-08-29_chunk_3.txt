HONORING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RIVERSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD PARADE

HON.
ANDRE CARSON

Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary

of the Riverside Neighborhood Parade on September 6, 2025.
This is one

of Indianapolis's most treasured and enduring community traditions.
The Riverside Parade began in 1925, when the city first paved Harding

Street and more than 10,000 neighbors gathered to celebrate.
Since that

day, the parade has represented civic unity, community pride, and the

rich cultural legacy of one of our city's oldest neighborhoods.
For

generations, the Riverside community has come together every September

to honor its history, celebrate its people, and look ahead with hope.
Riverside is more than just a neighborhood--it is a community built

on resilience, service, and shared history.
With its early 20th-century

homes and the newly completed promenade trail at Riverside Park, the

area reflects the very heart and soul of Indianapolis.
This year's centennial celebration not only marks a historic

milestone but also begins a new chapter.
Under the leadership of

Careena Jackson and the Riverside Civic League, the parade's planning

and stewardship have returned to the neighborhood's hands.
Their

dedication to preserving this beloved tradition while building its

future is a powerful example of community leadership in action.
Featuring everything from marching bands and bike riders to school

groups and local leaders, the Riverside Parade continues to inspire

joy, connection, and civic engagement.
It serves as a reminder of what

is possible when neighbors unite with purpose and pride.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the

Riverside Neighborhood Parade on its 100th anniversary.
May this

celebration honor the past, strengthen the present, and inspire the

future of this remarkable Indianapolis community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF MOSIE ``MAMA'' BURKS

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

life, legacy, and voice of a Mississippi treasure--Mosie ``Mama''

Burks, gospel music legend and beloved member of the world-renowned

Mississippi Mass Choir.
Born on June 17, 1933, in Forest, Mississippi,

Mama Burks was one of ten children in a large migrant farming family.
Her roots were humble, her work ethic unshakeable, and her faith

unmovable.
As a child laboring in the cotton fields under the scorching

Mississippi sun, she experienced the hardship and perseverance that

would later define her voice and testimony.
Delivered from field work

after suffering from heat exhaustion, Mama Burks went on to serve her

community in numerous ways, including a 24-year career in social work

at Jackson State University.
But it was her powerful, soul-stirring

voice and unwavering testimony of God's grace that would make her a

household name in gospel music.
In 1993, Mama Burks joined the Mississippi Mass Choir and soon became

the face and heart of the ensemble.
Her passionate renditions of ``When

I Rose This Morning'' and other gospel staples brought joy and healing

to audiences across the nation and around the world.
Her performances

were more than music, they were ministry.
With every note, she reminded

listeners of the enduring power of faith, love, and perseverance.
Mama Burks was not merely a singer--she was a vessel.
