Her performances

were more than music, they were ministry.
With every note, she reminded

listeners of the enduring power of faith, love, and perseverance.
Mama Burks was not merely a singer--she was a vessel.
Through

countless concerts, worship services, and personal testimonies, she

embodied the best of Mississippi's rich gospel tradition.
She shared

her gifts humbly and generously, always giving glory to God.
Now, therefore, as we reflect on her passing, we remember not just

the voice, but the spirit of Mama Burks.
A mother to many, a sister in

faith, and a tireless servant of the Lord, she leaves behind a legacy

that transcends music--a legacy of praise, perseverance, and purpose.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the life of

Mosie ``Mama'' Burks,

whose voice uplifted generations and whose life was a living testimony

of God's faithfulness.

HONORING THOMAS DURAND ON HIS INDUCTION INTO THE MICHIGAN FARMERS HALL

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Thomas

Durand, a dedicated and selfless leader in Michigan's agricultural

community, on his induction into the Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame.
Thomas Durand has spent his life committed to Michigan agriculture.
A

lifelong farmer, Thomas, began his journey in the fields of Sanilac

County, working alongside his father.
In 1981, he established his own

farm, where he continues to grow a diverse range of crops including

sugar beets, black beans, wheat, soybeans, and corn.
A member of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, Thomas served four

years on its board, including one year as president.
He also served

nine years on the Corn Marketing Program of Michigan board, including

two years as its president.
Thomas's advocacy has extended far beyond Michigan's borders.
He

represented the U.S. Grains Council on a mission to Japan and has been

a steadfast voice for Michigan corn growers in Washington, D.C.

His agricultural service doesn't stop at corn.
Thomas has served 18

years on the Michigan Sugar Company board, and seven years on the

Greenstone Farm Credit board.
He is also a lifetime member of the

Soybean Growers Association and an active member of the Michigan Farm

Bureau.
Equally commendable is Thomas's commitment to community.
He has

served as a township supervisor, school board member, high school

basketball coach, and referee.
He has also spent years broadcasting

local high school sports on WTGV in Sandusky, further strengthening

community ties through his voice and presence.
In 2021, Thomas was honored with the Distinguished Service Award by

the Michigan Corn Growers Association, a fitting recognition for his

lifelong service and leadership.
Mr. Speaker, Thomas Durand exemplifies the very best of Michigan

agriculture and rural leadership.
His unwavering dedication to farming,

advocacy, and community service make him a worthy inductee into the

Michigan Farmers Hall of Fame.
I ask my colleagues to join me in

congratulating Thomas on this well-deserved honor and thanking him for

his lifelong contributions to Michigan's agricultural heritage.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL POLICE CAMERA AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF

2025

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, I, along with Representative Donald S. Beyer

Jr., introduce the Federal Police Camera and Accountability Act of

2025.
This bill would require federal law enforcement officers to wear

body cameras and marked federal law enforcement vehicles to have

dashboard cameras.
It would also require the Government Accountability

Office to conduct a study on federal law enforcement officers'

training, vehicle pursuits, use of force and interaction with the

public.
In the 116th and 117th Congresses, the House passed this bill

as part of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
Cameras can increase transparency, strengthen public trust and even

deter criminal behavior.
With the surge of federal law enforcement

officers in the District of Columbia this month, this bill has become

even more important.
