Mr. Speaker, this February, I had the pleasure of attending the Eagle Scout Court of Honor for Ian Crowley, a young man who is a model of dedication, perseverance, and commitment to community service.
During his time in the Scouts, Ian has learned the importance of preserving and celebrating our history, a lesson which inspired his Eagle Scout project.
He undertook a major task and installed QR codes at the Lifesaving Station, a local historical site in South Jersey.
These codes provide access to videos that detail each of the artifacts' histories, preserving the knowledge for generations to come.
Beyond his time spent with the Scouts, Ian excels academically and demonstrates a remarkable work ethic.
He always keeps busy, whether that's his pursuit of his pilot's license or his participation in the Ocean City High School golf team.
In recognition of his outstanding achievements, Ian has been honored with the Order of the Arrow, an award which celebrates his dedication to community service, leadership, and the preservation of history.
I congratulate Ian on all accomplishments.
He makes us all proud.
God Bless Ian and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, last month, I had the honor of celebrating Jayson Cagle, a remarkable young man from Pittsgrove, South Jersey, who has achieved the rank of Eagle Scout with Boy Scouts of America Troop 1058.
Jayson's journey to Eagle Scout is not just a personal triumph but a testament to his unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in his surroundings.
His Eagle Scout project, improving his high school's music room, reflects his dedication to both his community and his passion for music.
As a graduating high school senior this year, Jayson has been accepted into Seton Hall University's School of Diplomacy and International Relations, where he hopes to learn how to serve his country on the global stage.
Jayson's commitment to service and leadership is an inspiration to us all.
I'm proud to congratulate him for his achievements and I wish him all the best.
God Bless Jayson and God Bless the United States of America. ____________________

HARMONY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS BECOMING NEWLY PUBLISHED AUTHORS ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, the students at Mt. Harmony Elementary School, located in my district, accomplished a terrific feat: they became published authors.
Each grade wrote and illustrated a book documenting their recent visit to the National Mall right here in the heart of our Nation's capital.
I thank their librarian Melaney Sanchez, Mt. Harmony PTA Treasurer Jennifer Franco, National Mall Education Specialist Ranger Jen Epstein, and everyone else who helped make this extraordinary, hands-on learning experience possible.
Together, they took more than 600 kids to Washington, D.C. During these visits, the students learned about American history and the principles upon which our democracy rests.
