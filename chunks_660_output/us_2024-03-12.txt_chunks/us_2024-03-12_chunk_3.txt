VILLEGAS 100TH BIRTHDAY ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of Staff Sergeant Ysmael R. Villegas, a distinguished American hero from California's 39th Congressional District.
Born in Casa Blanca in 1924, Villegas, the eldest of 13 children, exemplified the values of our diverse community.
Formerly an ``orange picker,'' Villegas answered the call to serve during WWII, displaying extraordinary bravery at the Battle of Luzon.
Tragically, on March 20, 1945, one day before his 21st birthday, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
President Truman posthumously awarded him the Medal of Honor on October 19, 1945.
Colonel G. B. Appleman presented the medal to his widow at Camp Haan on November 1, 1945, in our very own Riverside district.
The ceremony drew thousands, a testament to the profound impact of Villegas's heroism on our community.
As we commemorate what would have been his 100th birthday, let us remember Staff Sergeant Villegas's selflessness, dedication, and love for family.
May his legacy inspire future generations, and the heroism of Staff Sergeant Villegas remains etched in the history and hearts of California's 39th Congressional District. ____________________
