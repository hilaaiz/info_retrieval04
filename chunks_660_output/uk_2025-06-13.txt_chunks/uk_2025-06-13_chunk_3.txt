JOSEPH D. MORELLE

Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American

Heritage Month to recognize an exceptional public servant from

Rochester, New York: Marlene Henry.
As the owner of PeppaPot Catering, Marlene Henry is far more than a

business owner--she is a quiet but powerful force for good in our

community.
Time and again, she has offered her culinary talents in

service of others, often at her own expense.
Whether providing food at

no cost to those in need or offering discounted services for community

events, Marlene exemplifies the spirit of generosity that defines

Caribbean American heritage.
Her commitment to service extends well beyond the kitchen.
Marlene is

among the first to volunteer for community events, including Caribbean

American Heritage Month celebrations, Mother's Day initiatives, and

cultural festivals.
She approaches every act of service with humility,

never seeking recognition, but always delivering excellence.
Marlene's impact is also felt through her efforts to pass on cultural

traditions to the next generation.
She devotes time to teaching young

people how to prepare and appreciate authentic Caribbean dishes,

ensuring that the flavors, stories, and values of our shared heritage

endure.
It is my distinct honor to recognize Marlene Henry this Caribbean

American Heritage Month.
Her deep compassion, cultural pride, and

unwavering service enrich our community and inspire us all.

RECOGNIZING NORMA THOM

HON.
JOSEPH D. MORELLE

Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American

Heritage Month to recognize a trailblazing leader and advocate from

Rochester, New York: Norma Thom.
Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Norma brought to the United States a

deep commitment to culture, education, and service.
After arriving in

Rochester, she transitioned from her role as a schoolteacher to become

a prominent voice for the Caribbean American community.
Norma is a founding member of The Rochester West Indian Festival

Organization, a nonprofit that has celebrated and promoted Caribbean

heritage in Rochester for over 42 years.
Through her leadership, she

has fostered unity, cultural pride, and greater visibility for

Caribbean Americans across our region.
Beyond her community advocacy, Norma also built a distinguished

professional career.
She spent 29 years at Eastman Kodak Company, where

she worked in the supply chain and logistics department.
She retired in

2003, leaving behind a legacy of excellence in both her workplace and

her community.
It is an honor to recognize Norma Thom during Caribbean American

Heritage Month.
Her enduring legacy continues to uplift Rochester and

inspire future generations.

RECOGNIZING ROOSEVELT MAREUS

HON.
JOSEPH D. MORELLE

Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Caribbean American

Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary leader from the Rochester

community: Roosevelt Mareus.
As Executive Director and Dean of the Rochester Educational

Opportunity Center, or REOC, Roosevelt Mareus has led with vision,

integrity, and a deep commitment to uplifting others.
Under his

leadership, REOC has continued its vital mission of empowering

individuals, helping countless students break the cycle of poverty and

reach their utmost potential.
Born in Haiti, Roosevelt's journey is one of remarkable resilience

and transformation.
As a young man overcoming adversity, he found

direction and opportunity through the very institution he would one day

lead.
Beginning his career at REOC as a security guard, he steadily

rose through the ranks to become Executive Director.
His life story is

a testament to his perseverance and dedication.
Roosevelt's passion for service extends far beyond Rochester.
Deeply

connected to his Haitian roots, he founded Elevate Haiti Ministries, an

organization dedicated to building an orphanage and school in Haiti.
Over the past decade, Elevate Haiti has offered critical education and

housing for young boys.
During Caribbean American Heritage Month, it is my great privilege to

recognize Roosevelt Mareus.
His leadership and service continues to

inspire and uplift communities both here at home and abroad.
