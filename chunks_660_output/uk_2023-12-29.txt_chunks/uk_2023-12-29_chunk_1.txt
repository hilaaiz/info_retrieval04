INTRODUCTION OF THE JURY DUTY EXEMPTION FOR BREASTFEEDING ACT OF 2023

HON.
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Jury Duty Exemption

for Breastfeeding Act of 2023, which would allow breastfeeding

individuals summoned for jury service in the federal courts and in the

Superior Court of the District of Columbia to be excused from service

upon the individual's request.
The benefits of breastfeeding are well-

documented, and individuals should not be deterred from breastfeeding

by jury service.
This bill would apply to the D.C. Superior Court, in addition to the

federal courts, because the D.C. Home Rule Act prohibits the D.C.

Council from enacting any law relating to title 11 of the D.C. Code.
Title 11 governs jury service in the D.C. Superior Court.
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
