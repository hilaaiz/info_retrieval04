``And working with a local farm has been super

fun.''
Guerrero is one of two local Girl Scouts working on a

Gold Award Project.
She's partnered with Around the Bend

Farms to get youth involved and make farming a little more

eco-friendly.
``We're creating this food scrap to compost system where

the food scrap waste from the Bethlehem Inn kitchen gets

delivered here and turned into compost which is used for the

farm's agriculture,'' Guerrero said.
Those food scraps

contain vital nutrients for vegetables that would otherwise

rot away in a landfill.
``By throwing those nutrients into a

compost pile and into that kind of system, we can re-collect

the nutrients and re-integrate it into our soil to rebuild

that cycle,'' Urban Farm Manager Josh Lesko said.
``Then, our

plants are just re-feeding themselves and feeding us more in

the future.''
The compost system also helps keep the farm eco-friendly.
``We're lowering the amount of costs we're putting in,''

Lesko said.
``We're lowering the amount of transportation for

things we need to pick up.
We're letting the natural cycle do

its thing and kind of working alongside it.''
But for

Guerrero, it's starting to plant the seeds for the next

generation.
``It's a great opportunity to have high school

students come out and share this with their friends and be

like `oh there's a farm here and we can all help together.'
I

really like that aspect of it,'' Guerrero said.

========================= END NOTE =========================

Nevada--the groundbreaking of the permanent home of Chabad Southwest

Las Vegas, which will take place on September 13, 2025.Founded under

the leadership of Rabbi Levi Wilhelm and Mrs. Chayala Wilhelm, Chabad

Southwest has become a vibrant center for Jewish life, learning, and

community in the Southwest Las Vegas Valley.
The new permanent home of Chabad Southwest Las Vegas will serve as a

hub for worship, education, and fellowship.
It will house weekly prayer

services, holiday programs, adult and child education classes, Mommy &

Me programs, women's groups, after-school enrichment, and a wide

variety of cultural and social gatherings.
This expansion will allow

Chabad Southwest Las Vegas to better serve families, individuals, and

future generations, strengthening the fabric of the southern Nevada

community.
The groundbreaking marks not only a construction project but also the

realization of a vision--``Building Our Future Together''--that will

ensure the Jewish community in the region has a spiritual, educational,

and cultural home for decades to come.
On this historic occasion, I ask my colleagues to join me in

congratulating Rabbi Levi and Mrs. Chayala Wilhelm, the dedicated

members of the Chabad Southwest Las Vegas community, and all those

whose generosity and commitment have made this day possible.
Their

efforts stand as a testament to the enduring values of faith, family,

and community that enrich our great state of Nevada and our Nation.
