HONORING HIS ALL-HOLINESS ECUMENICAL PATRIARCH BARTHOLOMEW

HON.
ANDRE CARSON

Mr. CARSON.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life

and global leadership of His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch

Bartholomew.
He is the spiritual leader of more than 300 million

Orthodox Christians worldwide and a tireless advocate for peace, human

rights, and interfaith dialogue.
As the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, recognized as the

senior primate of the Orthodox Christian world, His All-Holiness has

dedicated more than three decades to advancing religious freedom,

protecting our planet, and fostering understanding across faiths and

nations.
This month, he visits Washington, D.C., following his

acceptance of the prestigious Templeton Prize in New York City, joining

the ranks of past recipients such as Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama, and

Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Throughout his tenure, Patriarch Bartholomew has met with presidents,

popes, and parliaments across the globe, including multiple visits to

the White House and the United States Congress.
He has worked

courageously to defend religious liberty despite ongoing challenges in

his native Turkey.
His commitment to peace and reconciliation, despite

significant challenges, embodies the highest ideals of global religious

leadership.
Known also as ``the Green Patriarch,'' His All-Holiness has been a

pioneering voice on environmental issues, organizing international

interfaith summits to confront climate change and ecological

degradation as spiritual and moral imperatives.
His leadership has

inspired generations to see care for the Earth as a sacred

responsibility.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing His All-

Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew for his profound

contributions to global peace, interreligious cooperation, and the

advancement of human dignity.
His presence in our Nation's capital is a

powerful reminder of the vital role that faith leaders play in building

a more just, compassionate, and united world.

HONORING MRS.
KATIE BLOUNT

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the

remarkable leadership and lifelong contributions of Mrs. Katie Blount,

whose tenure as Director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and

History (MDAH) has left an enduring mark on our state.
Mrs. Blount began her career at Mississippi Department of Archives

and history in 1994 as a public relations coordinator and steadily rose

through the ranks.
She served as assistant to the director for

communication, working under former directors Elbert R. Hilliard and H.

T. Holmes.
In 2015, she was appointed as the agency's seventh director,

becoming only the second woman to lead MDAH since its founding on 1902.
Over the course of more than three decades of service, Mrs. Blount has

provided steadfast leadership and vision, culmination in her announced

retirement effective June 30, 2026.
Under her stewardship, MDAH has grown into a nationally recognized

institution.
Mrs. Blount guided the creation of the Two Mississippi

Museums, preserving and sharing the diverse storIes of our state, and

she championed the public engagement that supported adoption of

Mississippi's new state flag.
She also worked tirelessly to strengthen

relationships with Tribal partners through repatriation and advanced

preservation projects across the state, including the new Vicksburg

Civil War Visitor Center, the stabilization of Windsor Ruins,

enhancements at the Grand Village of the Natchez Indians, and the

development of Margaret Ann Crigler Park in Jackson.
Her vision for inclusive storytelling reshaped programming and

interpretation at MDAH, ensuring that the voices and histories of all

Mississippians are represented.
Earlier this year, the American

Association for State and Local History honored Mrs. Blount with a

Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing her extraordinary dedication to

public history.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mrs. Katie

Blount for her steadfast commitment to preserving the heritage of

Mississippi and for her outstanding service to our communities.
