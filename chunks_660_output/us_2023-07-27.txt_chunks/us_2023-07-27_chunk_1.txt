Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to commemorate the 33rd anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.
This core civil rights law prohibits discrimination against Americans with disabilities by requiring public and private institutions to provide equal access to goods, services, and opportunities, such as employment, public transportation, and telecommunication.
Today, 1-in-4 U.S. adults has a disability that substantially impacts life.
The law provides a framework to make the United States fully- accessible to tens of millions of Americans, whether in workplaces, housing, schools, transit, or businesses.
I applaud the successes that the disability advocates have secured over the past decades.
We know the passage of the ADA law was the beginning and not the end.
According the Federal Transit Administration, 99 percent of all busses are ADA- accessible, in contrast to just 65 percent prior to the ADA.
However, we still have metros, trains, and planes that are not accessible.
A 2020 GAO report found that two-thirds of school districts had facilities with barriers that could limit access for people with disabilities.
We also know that advocates have waged and continue to wage the legal battles to improve access to buildings and transportation that should have occurred 33 years ago.
Although disability advocates have secured important accomplishments over the past decades, much more is needed to achieve an equitable society for Americans with disabilities.
Americans with disabilities face an unemployment rate of 6.8 percent compared to 3.7 percent for their peers without disabilities.
According to a new analysis by the National Partnership for Women & Families: only 36 percent of women with disabilities are employed compared to 70 percent of nondisabled women; only 31 percent of employed women with disabilities are economically secure; and American Indian/Alaska Native and Black women with disabilities are the least likely to be employed.
These gaps reveal unacceptable disparities in employment opportunities.
Furthermore, Americans with disabilities face barriers to receiving quality health care, such as service providers with inadequate training on how to properly treat patients with disabilities and medical facilities that have yet to make appropriate accommodations.
Affordable housing, businesses, airplanes, bathrooms, and playgrounds still are not uniformly accessible.
This restricted access reduces quality of life and presents obstacles that none of us should tolerate.
I am proud that I helped improve health care for those with disabilities during my tenure in Congress, including provisions in the Affordable Care Act that I championed to encourage community-based services for individuals with disabilities.
We must continue to work to make choice for receiving care in one's community mandatory, not just optional.
People should have the freedom to choose where they live and receive care.
I am proud that I also have

helped strengthen Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA marketplace health insurance to improve healthcare for Americans, including people with disabilities.
For example, a recent study by researchers at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Creedon, Zuvekas, Hill, Ali, McClellan, & Day, December 2022, Health Services Review, Volume 57, Issue S2) found that adults with disabilities who were newly-eligible for Medicaid experienced significant increases in health coverage, receipt of primary care services, and lower out-of-pocket costs from the federal expansion of Medicaid via the Affordable Care Act.
Further, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded premium tax credits and reduced drug prices to further lower healthcare costs.
I am proud that so many organizations and advocates in Illinois actively fight to protect Americans with disabilities.
