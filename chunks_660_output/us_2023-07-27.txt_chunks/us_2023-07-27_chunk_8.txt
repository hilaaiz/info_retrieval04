Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Patience Roggensack's 20 years of service on the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Justice Roggensack's legal legacy will be long remembered.
She helped to guide the court throughout her tenure during some of its most important times.
She has mentored countless attorneys and judges and will continue to serve as an important role model for the next generation of judges.
She will always serve as their fiercest advocate.
Justice Roggensack led a historic career.
Before serving on the Supreme Court, Justice Roggensack served on the Wisconsin Court of Appeals for 7 years.
She was elected to the Supreme Court in 2003.
I had the great honor of working for Justice Roggensack shortly after law school and saw her dedication to the law, her diligent work ethic, and her compassion for serving Wisconsin.
Everyone who has worked with Justice Roggensack, including myself, has benefited from her mentorship.
12 years after her election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Justice Roggensack became the first Justice to be elected by her colleagues in the court to the position of Chief Justice.
She held the position of Chief Justice for 6 years until relinquishing it in 2021.
Justice Roggensack's incredible service, dedication, and outstanding accomplishments will be long remembered after her July 31, 2023 retirement.
I congratulate Justice Patience Roggensack on her retirement and 20 years of service to Wisconsin. ____________________
SUPPORTING RESEARCH FUNDING FOR EPITHELIOID HEMANGIOENDOTHELIOMA AND OTHER RARE CANCERS; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
130



Date: 2023-07-27 Volume: 169, Issue: 130 Pages: E739 - E739 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING RESEARCH FUNDING FOR EPITHELIOID HEMANGIOENDOTHELIOMA AND OTHER RARE CANCERS ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. RASKIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the urgent need for research funding for epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE).
EHE is a rare and devastating cancer that can affect anyone of any age and that grows in the cells that make up our blood vessels, often appearing in the liver, lungs, and bones.
This disease is very rare, affecting one in one million people, and is also exceedingly difficult to diagnose.
According to the National Cancer Institute, patients suffering from EHE often live with severe pain, broken bones, disability, and respiratory infections.
Studies show that EHE is more common in women, but more fatal for men.
Because of its status as an exceedingly rare form of cancer, there is no standard treatment available and meager funding for lifesaving research.
This rare cancer is extraordinarily difficult to treat and often does not respond to chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
Because there is no standard, effective treatment for EHE, many patients must resort to organ transplants and undergo a vascular embolization, where doctors block the artery supplying blood to the tumor.
One of my constituents recently lost his beloved cousin, Brianna Rae Carney, to this terrible disease.
To honor her courageous, selfless spirit, he wrote me to encourage this body to raise awareness of EHE and invest in robust medical research Mr. Speaker, as a cancer survivor who owes my life to the excellent and effective medical treatment that I was fortunate enough to receive, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting increased federal support for finding more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for this terrible disease. ____________________
