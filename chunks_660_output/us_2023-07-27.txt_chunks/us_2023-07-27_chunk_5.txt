On his second tour, he commanded a squadron of HMLA-367 ``Scarface'' Cobra Helicopters, providing air support, day or night, under all weather conditions, to Marine ground combat units.
He received the Navy Cross for heroism during Operation Tailwind as he and his fellow ``Scarface'' Cobra Gunships engaged the enemy to provide cover for the extraction of a nearly overwhelmed force of U.S. Army Special Operators out of Laos.
He was also awarded two Legion of Merits with Combat ``V'', a Distinguished Flying Cross, 44 Air Medals/Strike Flight Awards, and was inducted into the Golden Eagles for his distinguished career as an aviator.
His wife of 65 years, Ann, son Harry Jr., and daughter Stacie will remember him as a husband and father who lived for others, giving freely of his time, skill, and love to all who were fortunate enough to have known him.
He is also survived by 4 grandchildren; and a great grandson.
I thank the Colonel for his service. ____________________

DUNCAN ______ of virginia in the house of representatives Mr. GRIFFITH.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of Gerald W. Duncan, who passed away on July 10, 2023, after a valiant three-plus year fight against Alzheimer's Disease.
After receiving his undergraduate degree from Virginia Tech and a master's in business administration from Radford University, Mr. Duncan began his career in 1967 as a software developer with the Research, Development, & Acquisition Information Systems Agency, Department of the Army, where he was honored with many awards during his 35 years of service.
He then pivoted careers, being elected as Treasurer of Giles County in 2000.
His success as Treasurer led him to being voted Treasurer of the Year for the State of Virginia.
Mr. Duncan loved serving the people of Giles County and had an open-door policy during his time as Treasurer.
When not working, Mr. Duncan loved to hunt deer, bears, and turkey throughout the country.
He was elected president of the Virginia State Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation for 3 consecutive terms, championing conservation of the wild turkey.
But most importantly, Mr. Duncan's proudest achievement was being a husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.
Mr. Duncan is survived by his wife, Ruth Duncan of Blacksburg; oldest son, Troy Duncan and wife, Heather, of New Castle; youngest son, Mark Duncan and wife, Eva, of Catawba; daughter, Margee Sisson and husband, Dougie, of Shawsville; grandchildren, Haley Chandler of Clearfield, Utah, Hagan Chandler and wife, Kierston, of Riner, Tanner Duncan of Richmond, Andrew Duncan of New Castle, Elijah Duncan of Catawba, and Summer Norwood of Shawsville; great-grandson, Myles Chandler of Riner; and great-granddaughter, Everly Chandler of Riner.
I wish them condolences on the loss of their loved one.
Mr. Duncan was known by his friends and family as being extremely kind and having unwavering determination throughout his life, always offering a helping hand to those in need.
I know he will be greatly missed.
