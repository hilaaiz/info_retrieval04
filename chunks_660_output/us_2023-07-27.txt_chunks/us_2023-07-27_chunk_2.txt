For example, a recent study by researchers at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Creedon, Zuvekas, Hill, Ali, McClellan, & Day, December 2022, Health Services Review, Volume 57, Issue S2) found that adults with disabilities who were newly-eligible for Medicaid experienced significant increases in health coverage, receipt of primary care services, and lower out-of-pocket costs from the federal expansion of Medicaid via the Affordable Care Act.
Further, the Inflation Reduction Act expanded premium tax credits and reduced drug prices to further lower healthcare costs.
I am proud that so many organizations and advocates in Illinois actively fight to protect Americans with disabilities.
For example, Access Living is a Chicago-based, advocacy nonprofit that has worked for over 4 decades to increase accessibility to transportation, housing, and education.
The Legal Council for Health Justice uses legal services to dismantle barriers to healthcare and to help individuals access services and benefits.
Equip for Equality serves as a federally- mandated legal advocate and watchdog.
The Arc of Illinois advocates for people with disabilities to so that Illinoisans can fully participate in their communities, providing education and advocacy services.
Chicago ADAPT promotes disability and civil rights, be in through housing accessibility, workforce accessibility and equity, or promoting community-based care.
And, the City of Chicago's HomeMod program removes barriers to housing by working with home remodeling companies to provide home accessibility modifications.
Every American deserves equal opportunity.
The Americans with Disabilities Act stands as testament to the determination and unrelenting will of thousands of activists, advocates, and policymakers.
As we celebrate its anniversary, I renew my commitment to fight to realize the fundamental right of every American to an accessible America. ____________________
HONORING COLLEEN DOLAN; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
130



Date: 2023-07-27 Volume: 169, Issue: 130 Pages: E738 - E739 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E738-E739] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING COLLEEN DOLAN ______ of illinois in the house of representatives Ms. SCHAKOWSKY.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent Colleen Dolan, from Chicago, for a successful career and to congratulate her on her much-deserved retirement.
Graduating from Lewis University with a degree in sociology and psychology, Colleen Dolan entered the workforce in 1975 as a bank teller at the First National Bank of Winnetka.
After a year, she took the first step in what would be an impressively steep climb up the human resources corporate ladder as a Profit-Sharing Analyst in corporate accounting at the Continental Illinois National Bank.
At Continental, she held several positions, rising to the rank of Sales Director--Personal Banking Relations at the end of her 13-year stint at the bank.
Along the way, she had two boys, Shaun and Ryan Dolan, and instilled confidence in her late father, a Zenith Business Executive, that her degrees would be useful in carving out a promising career in a field he was only beginning to understand.
In 1989, Colleen made a considerable leap forward as the U.S. Director of Human Resources for Leica Microscope, a position she held for 10 years before transitioning into the world of commercial real estate: first as the Vice President of Compensation & Benefits for a year at Equity Residential before moving to Transwestern, where she would spend the last and most fulfilling 23 years of her career.
She embodied the company's purpose statement: empowering good people to do extraordinary things together, Colleen started at Transwestern as Vice President and ascended to hold the roles of Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President before ultimately joining the C-suite as the Chief Human Resources Officer.
