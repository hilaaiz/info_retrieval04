Mr. Speaker, on this Veterans Day, I rise to recognize the people of Golden Valley, Montana, who are honoring the brave Montanans who served our Nation in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan with a new memorial in the community.
The Treasure State has a long history of military service.
And Montanans never fail to remember the sacrifice our men and women in uniform have made to preserve and protect the freedoms we cherish.
Golden Valley is no different.
I commend the work they have done to build a memorial to allow us all to pay tribute to those who have fought for our country.
It is a privilege to represent the people of Golden Valley in Congress.
It is also a privilege to recognize their commitment to honoring our Nation's heroes in the U.S. House of Representatives. ____________________
