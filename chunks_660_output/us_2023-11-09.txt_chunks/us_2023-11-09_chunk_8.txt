Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Orange High School's Marine Corps Junior ROTC Program and its cadets.
In 1955, Master Gunnery Sergeant James H. Fearns petitioned to establish the first ever Marine Corps JROTC Program in any Orange County High School.
His request was repeatedly denied, but the Master Gunnery Sergeant remained committed and traveled to Washington, D.C. to demand a meeting with the Commandant of the Marine Corps.
After speaking with the General a few days later, Master Gunnery Sergeant Fearns returned to Orange County having secured the charter.
Today, Orange High School has one of the largest Marine Corps JROTC Program in the Western United States.
The JROTC Program instills in its 162 cadets the values of citizenship, service to others, self- discipline, and personal responsibility.
Personal success after high school is an integral part of this program, exemplified by the James H. Fearns Marine Corps JROTC Memorial Scholarship.
This scholarship awards cadets who wish to attend college or pursue a vocational school certification.
Last year, 12 cadets received this prestigious award.
As we prepare to celebrate the 248th birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps, I am proud to recognize Orange High School's JROTC program and its cadets.
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring these accomplished students as they grow to become the leaders of tomorrow. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to all the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States and risked their lives to defend our freedoms and way of life and took and lived the oath to ``support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.''
Our Veterans have borne ``true faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation they took freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.''
Veterans are truly heroes walking among us.
I want to thank all of our armed servicemen and women for their selfless dedication to our protection every day.
Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who live in freedom that as President Kennedy said, ``The price of freedom is high, but Americans have always paid it.''
This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity to remember the fallen who gave the last full measure of devotion to their country on battlefields around the world--in places whose names may be unforgettable--or locations that have slipped into the pages of history.
We will never forget: Revolutionary War--Valley Forge; York Town; Civil War--The Battle of Antietam; The Battle of Gettysburg; World War I--The Battle of Argonne; Flanders Field; Verdun; World War II--Pearl Harbor; Battle of Bataan; The Battle of Midway; D-Day; Battle of the Bulge; Battle of Anzio; Battle of Corregidor; Korean War--Inchon; Heart Break Ridge; Pork Chop Hill; Vietnam--Tet Offensive; Battle of Hue; Desert Storm--September 11, 2001; Pentagon Attack (125 killed); Operation Enduring Freedom; Battle of Kandahar; Operation Iraqi Freedom; Second Battle of Fallujah; Operation Allies Refuge; Operation Allies Welcome.
The memory of the fallen is never forgotten.
Mr. Speaker, each Veterans Day, Americans come together to remember those who have served our country around the world in the name of freedom and democracy.
The debt that we owe to them is immeasurable.
