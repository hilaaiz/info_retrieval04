Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and legacy of a legendary Hoosier, Coach Bob Knight, I would like to include in the Record the obituary provided by Indiana University Athletics: Coach Bob Knight Passes Away at 83 Indiana University Athletics Bloomington, Ind.--Bob Knight, one of the most successful and influential figures in the history of college basketball, passed away on Nov. 1, 2023 surrounded by family and friends.
He was 83 years old.
Knight's coaching accomplishments are legendary.
He went 902-371 during a 42-year head coaching career that included stops at Army (1966-71), Indiana (1972-2000), and Texas Tech (2002-08).
Those 902 wins ranked No.
1 all-time when he retired in 2008, and currently ranks sixth.
He was a four- time National Coach of the Year, a five-time Big Ten Coach of the Year, and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame (1991), the College Basketball Hall of Fame (2006), and the IU Athletics Hall of Fame (2009).
While he enjoyed tremendous success at each of his three head coaching stops, he became a larger-than-life figure in the sport thanks to his accomplishments in Bloomington.
Hired by IU at the age of 30 in 1971, he led the program to three NCAA titles (1976, 1981, 1987), five Final Fours (1973, 1976, 1981, 1987, 1992), and 11 Big Ten Regular Season Championships (1973-76, 1980-81, 1983, 1987, 1989, 1991, 1993) in his 29 years as head coach.
Knight's 1976 team, which went 32-0 on its way to the NCAA title, remains the most recent to go undefeated on its way to an NCAA title.
His 1975 and 1976 teams, meanwhile, each went undefeated (18-0) in Big Ten play, and no Big Ten team has gone undefeated in a single season in league play since.
Indiana's 37 consecutive Big Ten wins during that period also established a new conference standard that has never been seriously threatened.
Knight's dominance at IU stretched through all three decades that he coached in Bloomington.
The 1970s included four Big Ten titles, two Final Fours, and one of the greatest teams in college basketball history with the undefeated 1976 national champions.
As great as the 1970s were, the 1980s were even better.
College basketball's most successful team during the decade, Knight's teams captured two NCAA titles and five Big Ten championships.
In the 1990s, the Hoosiers won two more league crowns, advanced to another Final Four, earned 10 NCAA tourney bids, and four straight Sweet 16 trips.
The 1990s also featured one of Knight's greatest teams to not win an NCAA title, as the 1993 team went 17-1 in the Big Ten, was the No.
1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, and featured four

players that would eventually be first- round NBA Draft picks.
In addition to his accomplishments representing Indiana University, Knight also enjoyed similar success on the international level.
He assembled and coached arguably the greatest amateur men's basketball team in history, as he led the 1984 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal in Los Angeles, and guided the U.S. team to the 1979 Pan American Games gold as well.
While his teams excelled on the court, Knight's student- athletes also embodied what it meant to be a student-athlete.
During his IU coaching career, 98 percent of his four-year players earned their degrees.
Besides being one of the sport's most successful coaches, Knight was also one of the most innovative.
He revolutionized and popularized the `motion offense,' an offensive style originally credited to one of Knight's mentors, Henry Iba.
