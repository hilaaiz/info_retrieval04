Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Fort Wayne Police Officer David Tinsley, who five years ago died in the line of duty, and to commemorate the designation of the Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
Officer Tinsley was known to his colleagues as a committed, professional police officer devoted to the force and to his craft.
Across his sixteen years in the Fort Wayne Police Department, he led by example, developing a reputation as a faithful servant to his community, his fellow officers, and his family and loved ones.
The Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will honor its namesake, encompassing a stretch of Fort Wayne's roadway that Officer Tinsley would frequently patrol.
It also passes by his home church of Emmanuel Lutheran and serves as a gateway for visitors entering downtown Fort Wayne from the west.
I cannot imagine a more fitting tribute.
Each time they travel along the parkway, residents of northeast Indiana will celebrate Officer Tinsley's service and recognize what an indispensable role he played in his community.
We will never forget his memory, and the Officer David Tinsley Memorial Parkway will stand as an enduring testament to his valor and service. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Lula ``Mae'' Parker-Harris, a pillar of the Dutchess County community who was beloved by all who knew her.
Mae recently passed away on August 27, 2023, at the age of 79.
Mae attended public schools and was educated at Dutchess Community College.
She spent her career at various organizations including Dutchess Community Day Care Center, Wassaic Developmental Center, and Astor Head Start.
Mae was known throughout the community for her selflessness and integrity.
A devoted member of the Smith Metropolitan AME Zion Church, she was committed to civil activism, social responsibility, and equity and equality in and around her community.
Her contributions to Poughkeepsie, NY and Dutchess County will endure for generations to come, and she will be dearly missed by all who knew her.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing the life of Lula Mae Parker-Harris, a remarkable woman who made a lasting difference in her community. ____________________
INTRODUCTION OF THE SERVICE ACADEMIES DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-11-09 Volume: 169, Issue: 186 Pages: E1081 - E1081 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE SERVICE ACADEMIES DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA EQUALITY ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Service Academies District of Columbia Equality Act, which would give the District of Columbia the same number of appointments and nominations to the U.S. service academies as states.
Currently, each Member of the House and each senator is allocated five appointments to each service academy-- the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy--and each Member of the House and each senator is allowed 10 nominations for each appointment.
Therefore, since D.C. has no senators, D.C. is deprived of 10 appointments and, assuming all appointments are vacant, 10 nominations to each service academy.
