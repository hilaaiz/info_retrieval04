This bill would

establish an arbitrary requirement for agencies to dispose of property

and leases.
It makes no accommodations for the workplace flexibility our federal

agencies need, not just to compete for talent, but also to accommodate

those with disabilities or military spouses whose employment would not

be possible without hybrid or remote work.
This bill demagogues the issue of hybrid work at a time when we

should be taking meaningful action to help the federal workplace remain

competitive and productive.
I welcome the Administration's efforts to end pandemic era remote

work postures while strengthening robust telework options for federal

employees, which we helped create with the Telework Enhancement Act.
There is a way forward that helps agencies adjust to post-pandemic

workforce needs, but this bill is not the solution and I urge my

colleagues to oppose it.

WENDY MOTTA, A REMARKABLE LEGACY OF PUBLIC SERVICE

HON.
SALUD O. CARBAJAL

Mr. CARBAJAL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an

exemplary public servant, Wendy Motta, who has dedicated her career to

serving the constituents of the 24th Congressional District with

unwavering commitment and tireless effort.
As we bid farewell to Wendy,

we reflect on her distinguished service and the indelible mark she

leaves on our community.
Wendy Motta's journey in public service spans decades, including

previously serving in the office of my predecessor, Congresswoman Lois

Capps.
Throughout her tenure as Senior District Representative, Wendy

demonstrated an exceptional ability to address the diverse needs of our

constituents, tackling crucial issues ranging from agriculture and

veterans' affairs to infrastructure and environmental stewardship.
Her

tireless efforts have made a lasting impact on the lives of those she

helped.
One of Wendy's most remarkable contributions was her dedicated work

in responding to natural disasters and emergencies.
Her leadership

during those challenging times provided solace and support to our

community, showcasing her resilience and dedication to the well-being

of the people she served.
Wendy's proactive approach and swift response

in times of crisis set a standard of excellence for public service in

our district.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Wendy Motta is the epitome

of a devoted family person.
Married to Silvio Motta, she has been a

loving partner and a source of strength for her family.
Wendy and

Silvio have been blessed with two wonderful children, Caio and Carina,

who undoubtedly have been inspired

by their mother's commitment to public service.
Prior to her service with Congress, Wendy Motta served the California

State Legislature in the 18th Senatorial District office.
Her

experience and expertise from the state level were instrumental in

navigating the complexities of multi-jurisdictional issues and

implementing effective policies for the benefit of our shared

constituents on the Central Coast of California.
As we express our gratitude for Wendy's years of service, we also

extend our best wishes for a fulfilling and joyous retirement.
The 24th

Congressional District has been fortunate to have such a dedicated

advocate, and Wendy's legacy will undoubtedly endure as an inspiration

for future generations of public servants.
In closing, I ask you to join me in acknowledging Wendy Motta's

selfless contributions to the well-being of our community and express

our deepest appreciation for her years of dedicated service.
May her

retirement be filled with the same warmth and kindness she has bestowed

upon us throughout her illustrious career.
