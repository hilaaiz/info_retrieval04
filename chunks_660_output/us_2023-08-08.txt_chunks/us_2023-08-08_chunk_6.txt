Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Commission of Fine Arts District of Columbia Home Rule Act.
This bill would remove the authority of the Commission of Fine Arts (CFA) over non-federal real property in the District of Columbia.
Under presidential executive orders (EOs) and federal law, the CFA has review authority for D.C.-owned parks and buildings, as well as for certain private land in D.C. Under the relevant EOs, CFA has review authority for the design of D.C.-owned parks and buildings.
Under the Shipstead-Luce Act, CFA has review authority for the design of private buildings in D.C. ``adjacent to public buildings and grounds of major importance,'' such as Rock Creek Park and the Potomac riverfront.
Under the Old Georgetown Act, the CFA has review authority for the design of private buildings in the part of Georgetown referred to as ``Old Georgetown'' in the act.
The federal government, including the CFA, whose members are appointed by the President, has no business in D.C. land-use policies and decisions unrelated to the federal presence.
Not only is the federal government's authority over D.C. buildings and private property a violation of home rule, it also delays and increases the cost of public and private development in D.C. This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support it. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine, a scientific expedition on behalf of the United States Navy that sent our Nation's first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, to the North Pole.
Nicknaming themselves ``PANOPOs'', an acronym from the phrase ``Pacific to the Atlantic via the North Pole'', one-hundred and sixteen crew members made the historic voyage under the polar ice, showing true American dominance in science, innovation, and naval capability.
On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I am proud to recognize the 65th Anniversary of Operation Sunshine and thank both Nautilus Alumni Association and the Submarine Force Library and Museum Association for their dedication to keeping American history alive. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues in the House join me in recognizing the Homer Fire Department on their 150th anniversary.
It is my sincere privilege to honor all the volunteer firefighters who have kept Homer safe since 1873 and continue to do so today. ____________________
