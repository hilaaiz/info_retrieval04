DR.
TOMMIE JACKSON, FROM JANUARY 18, 1954 TO JULY 26, 2023 ______ of connecticut in the house of representatives Mr. HIMES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a tremendously impactful leader and my good friend, Stamford's own Reverend Tommie Jackson.
Dr. Jackson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the third of 6 children.
Dr. Jackson was raised in Baltimore City and was a product of the Baltimore Public School System.
He graduated from Baltimore City College High School and attended the prestigious Morehouse University in Georgia.
He later attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where he met his wife, and life partner, Dorye Michelle Emory.
Dr. Jackson and Dorye were married in 1977 and shortly after moved to Houston, Texas where he attended Texas Southern University in pursuit of his Juris Doctor.
The Jacksons would later return to Baltimore, Maryland where he completed law school at the University of Maryland Law School.
Dr. Jackson was enormously proud of his daughters, Erin Marie and Evinn Leigh.
He answered his first call to Pastorship in 1990, at Calvary Baptist Church in Chester, Pennsylvania.
While there, Dr. Jackson, Dorye and his daughters touched the lives of the community.
Dr. Jackson's dedication to God's work then brought him and his family to Stamford, Connecticut in 1997, where he answered his second calling to Pastorship at Faith Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church.
For 20 years, Dr. Jackson served as the Pastor of Faith Tabernacle.
During his tenure at Faith, he spearheaded the expansion of his church.
He served the Stamford community with a weekly food bank and held back- to-school drives to equip children and families with supplies.
Dr. Jackson was a proponent of education and took the time to mentor and prepare students in the congregation and in the community for academic excellence.
Upon completing his doctorate degree at New York Theological Seminary, he went on to become part of the faculty, leading, guiding and mentoring aspiring faith leaders.
Dr. Jackson served as a spiritual advisor and mentor for the congregation and for the community.
In 2018, Dr. Jackson founded the Rehoboth Followship Church.
He was diligent in fostering this ministry and created a welcoming place of worship for all.
He loved his Rehoboth family and was always thinking of ways to expand the ministry.
I was honored to join Dr. Jackson in his tireless work to bring together faith leaders, register and empower voters, combat the scourge of gun violence in our communities, remedy the historic wrongs of our criminal justice system, and inspire the next generation to seize opportunities to get an education and improve the world they will soon enter.
Whenever they needed something good for the community done, they didn't have to seek out Dr. Jackson.
He was already there, and he welcomed them with open

arms.
Dr. Jackson was a tremendous advocate for his community, at the local and state level, and I was proud to call him my friend.
This world has lost a great leader.
I dedicate today to mourning and remembrance as well as furthering Dr. Jackson's legacy of service and sacrifice and uplifting those who follow in his path.
May we all be even half as successful as Dr. Jackson was at leaving the world a better place than we found it. ____________________
