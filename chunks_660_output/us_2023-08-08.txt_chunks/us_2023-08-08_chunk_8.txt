REMEMBERING AND HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER MATTHEW HARE; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2023-08-08 Volume: 169, Issue: 134 Pages: E765 - E765 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING AND HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER MATTHEW HARE ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. DUNCAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Easley, South Carolina Police Officer, Matthew Hare, who was killed in the line of duty on August 2, 2023, while saving the life of an individual suffering from a mental health crisis.
Officer Hare was driven by a desire to serve his community which led to his pursuing a career in law enforcement upon graduation from Easley High School.
Officer Hare is survived by his mother, Ashley Hare, in addition to his brother, Easton Hare.
At only 22 years of age, Officer Hare had just begun his career in 2022 and showed great promise after completing the SC Criminal Justice Academy.
When not on duty, he loved to be with his family and friends at the dinner table, outside on their next adventure, or playing the latest video game.
Despite many hobbies, Officer Hare always found time to cheer on his favorite football team, the Clemson Tigers.
On August 2, Officer Hare displayed the greatest form of love and act of service that can be asked of any police officer.
He responded to a call for an individual who was suffering from a mental health crisis and was precariously on the train tracks in Easley.
Knowing a train was coming and committed to saving this person he didn't know, Officer Hare sacrificed himself to save a member of the community he swore to serve and protect.
Mr. Speaker, South Carolina's Third District is known for its people and is home to countless heroes.
I'm honored to recognize Officer Matthew Hare, a hero who was taken from us far too soon.
Ashley and Easton will carry the fond memories of Officer Hare in their hearts forever, and Easley will remember this demonstration of selfless service.
Officer Hare's final actions truly exemplify John 15:13, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''
Thank Officer Hare for choosing to serve and giving us a great example of how we ought to love others.
The Easley community learned this lesson as is evident by the outpouring of support for him and his family since his passing.
Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the Hare family and the Easley Police Department as they lay to rest Officer Hare.
