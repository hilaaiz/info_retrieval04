HON.
JONATHAN L. JACKSON

Mr. JACKSON of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the

entrepreneurial spirit and community impact of Ms. Toni Taylor and Ms.

Malkah Taylor, the visionary owners of The Wrap Bar, a beloved culinary

gem on the Southside of Chicago, home to the now-famous jerk wraps.
The

family-owned businesses, particularly those led by Black women, play in

strengthening our local economies and enriching our communities.

restaurant; it is a testament to perseverance, culinary excellence, and

community building.
As a proud family-owned establishment, it embodies the values of hard

work and generational commitment, providing not only delicious and

In the vibrant landscape of Southside Chicago, Black women-owned

businesses like The Wrap Bar are indispensable.
They serve as vital

economic engines, creating jobs, circulating wealth within their

neighborhoods, and providing essential services and products.
Beyond their economic contributions, these businesses are powerful

symbols of self-determination, resilience, and success, inspiring

future generations and challenging systemic barriers.

Malkah's success with The Wrap Bar shines a bright light on the

incredible talent and dedication within the Black women entrepreneurial
