RECOGNIZING KALEY STIDHAM

HON.
BRETT GUTHRIE

Mr. GUTHRIE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kaley Stidham for her

service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
A London, Kentucky native, Kaley began her career as an intern for

her hometown member and Dean of the House Congressman Hal Rogers (KY-

05) followed by an internship with Senate Republican Leader Mitch

McConnell (KY).
During her Senior Year at the University of Kentucky,

Kaley became the Staff Assistant for Congressman Andy Barr (KY-06) in

his Lexington, Kentucky office and upon graduation in May 2023

transitioned to his Washington, D.C. office and shortly after took on

the role as Press Assistant as well.
When I became Chairman of the

House Committee on Energy and Commerce in January of this year, Kaley

joined my team as the Press Assistant where she became a valuable team

member in keeping the American public updated on what our committee has

been doing to restore the American Dream.
Recently, Kaley departed the House Committee on Energy and Commerce

to take on a new role as the Communications Director for Congresswoman

Kat Cammack (FL-03).
While she will no longer be working for a member

of the Kentucky delegation, I know she will succeed in her new role.
I

wish her the best, congratulate her on her new role, and thank Kaley

Stidham for her service to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
