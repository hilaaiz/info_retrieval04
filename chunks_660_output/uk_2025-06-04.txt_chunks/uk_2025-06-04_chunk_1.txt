CAPTAIN MICHELLE WILTROUT NAMED OHIO'S 13TH DISTRICT CHAMPION OF THE

WEEK

HON.
EMILIA STRONG SYKES

Mrs. SYKES.
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Captain Michelle

Wiltrout, who retired this year from the Summit County Sheriff's

Office, as this week's Champion of the Week for Ohio's 13th

Congressional District.
For 32 years, Captain Wiltrout, dedicated her career to serving and

protecting the people of Summit County in a wide range of roles.
Her

work has spanned the corrections division, the patrol division and

special operations, the detective bureau, and more.
In 2021, Captain Wiltrout earned the Taskforce Director position for

a State of Ohio Narcotics Taskforce, making her the first woman to run

a Narcotics Taskforce in the State of Ohio.
Just two years later, she was named 2023 Taskforce Commander of the

Year for her exceptional work and dedication in her role.
She was also

the first woman to receive this honor in the State of Ohio.
While in charge of the Drug Unit, Captain Wiltrout introduced new

tools such as drone technology, and expanded the county's K9 unit from

one dog to eight.
Again, I want to thank Captain Michelle Wiltrout for her

distinguished career serving our community, and congratulate her on

being this week's Champion of the Week.

CONGRATULATING ADAM KINGSTON, GOLD MEDAL RUNNER

HON.
LLOYD SMUCKER

Mr. SMUCKER.
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Adam Kingston

of Manheim Township on winning a gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter

run at the PIAA track and field championship on May 24.
The 2025 PIAA Class 3A track and field championship saw students from

across Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District excel, but it was

Manheim Township senior Adam Kingston who took home the gold.
Kingston

maintained the lead for the entire 3,200-meter race and crossed the

finish line with a time of 8:51:25, a Lancaster-Lebanon League record.
Kingston's state title finishes a storied career at Manheim Township.
He was also a part of Manheim Township's 4x800 relay team, alongside

Andrew Kemper, Ethan Peffley, and Cole Stevens, which won fourth place

later that day.
With his gold medal in the Class 3A 3,200-meter run, Kingston

solidified himself as one of Pennsylvania's best track and field

athletes.
I sincerely congratulate Adam on his success this year and

wish him well in his athletic and academic endeavors at Penn State

University.
