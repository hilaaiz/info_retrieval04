He is no stranger to helping others.
On a number of occasions, Sergeant Klein has stopped to assist those involved in vehicle accidents or medical emergencies.
I commend him for continuing to be an upstanding role model for his community and family.
I am honored to represent Sergeant Klein in Texas' 4th Congressional District.
It is a pleasure to award him the Congressional Veteran Commendation for his service to our Nation and to the people of North Texas. ____________________
HONORING MICHAEL D. COLE UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-14 Volume: 169, Issue: 188 Pages: E1102 - E1102 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MICHAEL D. COLE UPON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. TAKANO.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michael D. Cole upon his retirement from the United States Department of State after 22 years of service.
Mike embarked on his foreign service journey in 2001.
Since then, his service has extended from Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to U.S. Embassies and Consulates in Abuja, Bangkok, Budapest, Mumbai, San Salvador, and Vienna.
Mike assumed the role of Director of the Los Angeles Passport Agency in September 2020, facing head-on the arduous challenges and travel restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
As international travel has resumed in the years since, Mike's leadership in Los Angeles was critical in the agency's return to pre-pandemic productivity, processing passports for nearly three-quarters of a million U.S. citizens during his time as Director.
In this position, Mike was a reliable, affable, and professional partner to my District Office as caseworkers processed passport casework brought to them by my constituents.
Mike and his team provided prompt and satisfactory guidance in navigating these often tricky and changing requests.
Mike's dedication to public service is further exemplified by his service in the Consular Corps, where he has utilized his experience and expertise to mentor the next generation of Consular Officers.
His work to assist U.S. citizens during crises, offer support in disaster relief, aid bereaved families, and protect vulnerable children stand as a testament to his commitment to the American people domestically and abroad.
I extend my heartfelt thanks to Mike for his service to our constituents of the 39th Congressional District and our country, and I wish him a well-deserved retirement. ____________________
OPPOSING AMENDMENT 109 TO H.R. 5894; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-11-14 Volume: 169, Issue: 188 Pages: E1103 - E1103 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OPPOSING AMENDMENT 109 TO H.R. 5894 ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. NADLER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to Amendment 109 which imposes a cap of 30 percent of the total grant on all facilities and administrative, or F&A, costs for research awards made by the National Institutes of Health.
F&A costs help keep the lights on at research facilities across the country.
These costs are essential reimbursements for operational expenses incurred by universities and other research institutions for conducting research on behalf of the government.
This amendment would greatly affect the ability of research institutions to operate cutting- edge laboratories and maintain utilities such as heating or hazardous waste disposal.
This amendment would reduce critical scientific research that directly contributes to our ability to save lives and reducing suffering for the communities we serve.
Most medical breakthroughs were federally supported and took place at medical schools, teaching hospitals, and other research institutions across the country.
Without the federal government's reimbursement of F&A costs, institutions would be forced to scale back research that may help develop the next vaccine or cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, and other health threats, or the next technological innovation that will create new businesses or medical devices.
