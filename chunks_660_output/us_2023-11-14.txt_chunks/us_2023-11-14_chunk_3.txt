This amendment would reduce critical scientific research that directly contributes to our ability to save lives and reducing suffering for the communities we serve.
Most medical breakthroughs were federally supported and took place at medical schools, teaching hospitals, and other research institutions across the country.
Without the federal government's reimbursement of F&A costs, institutions would be forced to scale back research that may help develop the next vaccine or cure for cancer, Alzheimer's, and other health threats, or the next technological innovation that will create new businesses or medical devices.
As a result of these cuts, Americans will have to wait longer for cures and our country will cede scientific breakthroughs to foreign competitors such as China, which is heavily investing in this space.
This would undermine our nation's economic competitiveness and erode the United States' longstanding commitment to medical research that has yielded countless benefits to society and our well-being.
In summary, cutting essential F&A costs for scientific research would result in slower scientific progress, longer waits for cures, fewer jobs, and a threat to our nation's economic competitiveness.
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.

Date: 2023-11-14 Volume: 169, Issue: 188 Pages: E1102 - E1103 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1102-E1103] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING RON SAPP'S 24 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE CITY OF FERNANDINA BEACH ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. BEAN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Ron Sapp for his decades of dedication and service to Fernandina Beach.
Mayor Sapp's 24 years of civic service as Mayor, Vice Mayor, and Commissioner spanned four decades and displayed an unwavering commitment to bettering our hometown of Fernandina Beach.
I was proud to serve alongside him on the Commission, as did my father.
Fernandina is proud of Ron Sapp not only because of his dedication to his community, but also for his military service as an Air Force veteran.
But no true biography of Ron would be complete without a chapter on Mr. Sapp--the teacher.
Mr. Sapp didn't just teach students what to think, he taught them how to think, and that is something special.
Generations of Pirates developed an in interest in--and love for--public service--and for that inspiration, we are grateful.
Mayor Ron Sapp sought to preserve the spirit of Fernandina Beach as a small island town and is a better place because of his accomplishments.
Ron, of course, has done all these things with his wife Kasey by his side, and with the support of his daughters Sherri and Lori, and the love of his grandchildren.
On November 14, one of Mayor Sapp's greatest achievements is being named after him: The Ron Sapp Egans Creek Greenway.
Mayor Sapp's introduction of the Open Space Bond issue secured the funding for this greenway, which will leave this land untouched by development to be enjoyed by all.
