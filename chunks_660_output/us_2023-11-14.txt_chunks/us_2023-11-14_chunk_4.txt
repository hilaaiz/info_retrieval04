Ron, of course, has done all these things with his wife Kasey by his side, and with the support of his daughters Sherri and Lori, and the love of his grandchildren.
On November 14, one of Mayor Sapp's greatest achievements is being named after him: The Ron Sapp Egans Creek Greenway.
Mayor Sapp's introduction of the Open Space Bond issue secured the funding for this greenway, which will leave this land untouched by development to be enjoyed by all.
I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mayor Ron Sapp for his significant role in shaping Fernandina Beach into the beautiful town it is today. ____________________
