He completed a tool and die apprenticeship,

earned a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and began a

distinguished career at Ford Motor Company in Manufacturing

Engineering.
There, he developed an innovative single-piece rear

differential system that was later acquired by MIT.
He married in 1953,

retired at age 55, and spent the decades that followed traveling the

world, remaining dedicated to his family, faith, and community.
Mr. Speaker, Nate Scarpelli's life is a testament to service and

resilience.
Whether on the deck of the USS Moreno or in the engineering

halls of Ford Motor Company, his contributions strengthened both our

Nation's security and its industry.
It is my distinct honor to

recognize him as our Veteran of the Month for October 2025.
