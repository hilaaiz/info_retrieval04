RECOGNIZING ARVADA HIGH SCHOOL

_____

HON.
BRITTANY PETTERSEN

Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th

anniversary of Arvada High School.
For more than a century, Arvada High School has been a central part

of the community, empowering students with the tools they need to

succeed in their future education.
When the school first opened in

1899, only seven students were enrolled.
Today, Arvada High has over

700 students enrolled and is now a leading institution for families in

Jefferson County.
Through its 125-year history, the school has adapted

to meet the changing needs of its students through initiatives like the

Empowerment Academy, which provides specialized support to students who

require additional resources and increases equitable access to

education.
The school's dedicated teachers and staff have guided generations of

students and made Arvada High a cornerstone for community development

in Jefferson County.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it

is my honor to congratulate Arvada High School on its 125th anniversary

and for its dedication to students in our community.

RECOGNIZING FOOTHILLS REGIONAL HOUSING

HON.
BRITTANY PETTERSEN

Ms. PETTERSEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Foothills

Regional Housing (FRH), who is celebrating their 50th anniversary of

serving as the public housing authority for Jefferson County, Colorado.
First created in the fall of 1975, Foothills Regional Housing has

worked to meet the growing housing needs of Jefferson County by

preserving existing affordable housing units and developing new ones.
In addition to supporting low-income renters by administering over

1,800 vouchers through the Department of Housing and Urban Development,

FRH also supports low-income homeowners through their Emergency Home

Repair Program.
Under the leadership of Executive Director Lori Rosendahl, FRH has

built award-winning new developments like the Ives in Wheat Ridge and

the AVi at Olde Town in Arvada, which have been recognized for their

thoughtful design and emphasis on supporting residents.
I look forward

to seeing what the next 50 years will bring for FRH as they continue to

provide critical housing resources for our community.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, it

is my honor to congratulate Foothills Regional Housing on their 50th

anniversary and thank them for all they do for our community.

HON.
JOSEPH D. MORELLE

Mr. MORELLE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Hispanic American

Heritage Month to recognize an extraordinary artist, educator, and

identity, and family history, often drawing inspiration from our city's

legacy as the birthplace of modern photography through Kodak Park.

a vibrant cultural and economic hub that celebrates the diversity of

Rochester, New York.
