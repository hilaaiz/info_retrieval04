The Jefferson County Sheriff, Reggie Marinelli, and the entire Police

Department quickly responded with extraordinary service, arriving in

under two minutes.
That swift response saved lives and provided

reassurance to the Evergreen community in its greatest moment of need.
In the aftermath of the incident, the Evergreen Parent Teacher

Student Association (PTSA) mobilized to provide on-the-ground support

for the community, including mental health resources, warm meals, and

safe spaces.
These community volunteers--in addition to many other

supportive groups and organizations--have played a critical role in

connecting families with needed services and ensuring the entire

community has everything they need to re-enter their school.
Like far too many communities across Colorado and the Nation, this is

not the first time the Evergreen community has been touched by gun

violence.
Yet, in the aftermath of this tragedy, Evergreen has

demonstrated extraordinary resilience, uniting in support of one

another as the process of healing begins.
On behalf of the people of Colorado's 7th Congressional District, I

stand with the Evergreen community, offer my condolences to the victims

and their families, and reaffirm my commitment to ensuring every child

can go to school without fear for their safety.

RECOGNIZING UNITED STATES NAVY RADIOMAN PETTY OFFICER 3RD CLASS NATALE

``NATE'' JOHN SCARPELLI

_____

HON.
LISA C. McCLAIN

Mrs. McCLAIN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with deep respect and

admiration to recognize the remarkable service of Radioman Petty

Officer 3rd Class Natale ``Nate'' Scarpelli, a proud veteran of the

United States Navy and our distinguished Veteran of the Month for

October 2025 from Michigan's 9th Congressional District.
His courage,

dedication, and sacrifice during World War II reflect the very best of

the American spirit.
Radioman Scarpelli answered his country's call to service in 1942.
He

enlisted in the United States Navy and was assigned as a Radioman Petty

Officer 3rd Class aboard the USS Moreno (AT-87).
He joined his ship in

North Africa, becoming the youngest member of a seasoned crew.
The USS Moreno played a critical role in the war effort, carrying out

dangerous missions that included firefighting, towing disabled

warships, deploying depth charges, underwater welding, and escort

operations.
Radioman Scarpelli's skill as a radioman, communicating

through Morse code and signal lamp, kept the crew connected during

critical engagements.
He also served as the ship's marksman, helping

set sights on its 5-inch cannon, 40mm guns, and long-range weapons.
Radioman Scarpelli's service brought him to the frontlines of some of

the war's most pivotal campaigns.
The USS Moreno supported the Allied

invasion of Sicily, clearing the coastline for advancing Army units.
Later, it provided support during the Invasion of Southern France.
During combat, Radioman Scarpelli was wounded by land artillery and

treated at a field hospital before rejoining his ship, where he

continued his duties, including cutting mine cables and neutralizing

deadly sea mines.
In one remarkable mission, the USS Moreno captured a German one-man

submarine armed with a torpedo.
The vessel was brought aboard for

inspection, drawing the attention of senior military leadership eager

to study its design.
Radioman Scarpelli also served alongside his three brothers: Frank,

who fought in the Pacific with the Army; John, who took part in the

invasion of Northern France; and Augie, who manned guns on a Navy

merchant ship in the Pacific.
Their shared service reflects the

extraordinary sense of duty and sacrifice that defined their

generation.
After the war, which he served through 1945, Radioman Scarpelli

returned home to Michigan.
He completed a tool and die apprenticeship,

earned a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering, and began a

distinguished career at Ford Motor Company in Manufacturing

Engineering.
There, he developed an innovative single-piece rear

differential system that was later acquired by MIT.
He married in 1953,

retired at age 55, and spent the decades that followed traveling the

world, remaining dedicated to his family, faith, and community.
