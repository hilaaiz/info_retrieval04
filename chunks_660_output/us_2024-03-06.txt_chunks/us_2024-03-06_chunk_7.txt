Mr. Speaker, I use today to recognize Huron Valley PACE on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of their founding.
Their contributions over the past ten years to improving the lives of the elderly in Washtenaw County are worthy of commendation.
Huron Valley PACE was founded in 2014 in Ypsilanti, Michigan to provide medical and supportive services for the elderly in the greater Washtenaw County area.
Their all-inclusive care, which is covered by Medicare and Medicaid, provides coverage for primary and specialty care, prescription drugs, medical transportation, hospital visits, dental care, medical equipment, home care, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy.
Their extensive range of services have notably helped support hundreds of low-income adults with housing, living, and medical expenses, and their dedication to serving their community is admirable.
Over the past decade, Huron Valley PACE has been a proactive member of the local community, setting up events such as Super Bowl watch parties, heart disease awareness drives, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day community service projects in partnership with other local organizations.
In addition to caring for the elderly in Washtenaw County, Huron Valley PACE also works to instill a commitment to public service in local high school and university students by offering hands- on volunteer opportunities for students.
Volunteers distribute hot meals to underserved communities, lead food drives, and raise awareness about senior care.
Part of Huron Valley PACE's proactive approach to providing exceptional care for the elderly includes advocating for expanding comprehensive senior care services like the PACE Expanded Act.
At the state level, Huron Valley PACE works with the Michigan State Legislature to reduce the cost of medical care and to find innovative ways to help elderly people remain living in their homes.
This advocacy is yet another example of how Huron Valley PACE continues to demonstrate their commitment to providing and advocating for quality and affordable elderly care.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating the founding of Huron Valley PACE on their 10th anniversary.
They have had a tremendous impact on the Washtenaw County area and continue to find exciting ways to continue improving their services to their community, and I cannot wait to see what they accomplish over the next decade. ____________________

ADEL SCHNEIDER ______ of wisconsin in the house of representatives Mr. GALLAGHER.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a young Wisconsinite I have had the pleasure of meeting with throughout my time in Congress, Ms. Adel Schneider.
At nine months old, Adel was diagnosed with a severe dairy allergy.
This diagnosis transformed the Schneider family's daily life.
Oftentimes, Adel had to be careful with cake at birthday celebrations or at holiday events, where a main focus is food.
While this could have been isolating, Adel was inspired by her allergy; she began raising awareness in her hometown of Appleton.
Adel and her mother, Kara, are seen on local television, sporting events and at schools in Northeast Wisconsin, fundraising and informing others about food allergies.
Adel has been successful in her fundraising efforts, raising over $50,000 for FARE, a non-profit that promotes food allergy awareness and research.
In 2018, Adel was the recipient of the FARE Teen Achievement Award following her involvement in the annual Milwaukee Food Allergy Heroes Walk.
In 2020, the Schneider family donated allergy-friendly food to Paul's Pantry in Green Bay after receiving a grant from FARE.
