He continued to rise through the ranks in recognition of his exceptional service, culminating in his promotion to Captain, a role he held until his retirement.
His commitment to safety and excellence led him to join the Kingsport Fire Department Technical Rescue Team, where he specialized in Search & Rescue, Swift Water Rescue, Confined Space, High & Low Angle Rope Rescue, Trench Rescue, and Structural Collapse.
His leadership and expertise in these areas earned him the role of Technical Rescue Team Leader.
In addition to his remarkable service at the Kingsport Fire Department, Captain Mitchell also dedicated eight years as a member of the State of Tennessee Emergency Service Board in Nashville, where he played a pivotal role in regulating EMS activities across the state.
His service to the community extended well beyond his professional obligations to include his participation with the Big Brother/Big Sister Program of East Tennessee, H.O.P.E. (Help Our Potential Evolve), the Kingsport Life Saving Crew, and the Kingsport Firefighters Association Local 2270.
His advocacy efforts also saw him participate in state legislation, lobbying for the rights and welfare of firefighters across Tennessee, advocating on critical issues like PTSD and cancer.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Captain Kevin Mitchell for his outstanding service to the Kingsport Fire Department and the citizens of Kingsport, Tennessee.
His retirement marks the end of an era of exceptional service and leadership, and his legacy will continue to inspire current and future generations of public servants.
We wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. ____________________
MOURNING THE LOSS OF JOE MADISON, "THE BLACK EAGLE"; Congressional Record Vol.
170, No.

Date: 2024-03-06 Volume: 170, Issue: 40 Pages: E221 - E221 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MOURNING THE LOSS OF JOE MADISON, ``THE BLACK EAGLE'' ______ of maryland in the house of representatives Mr. HOYER.
Mr. Speaker, the other week, we lost a great American, renowned civil rights activist, and legendary radio host: Joe Madison.
He passed away on January 31 at age 74.
Some knew Joe as `the Judge' who would hear out his callers and guests even if they had different views but cut them off if they tried to spread misinformation.
Others knew him as `the Black Eagle'--his longtime radio nickname.
I had the pleasure of knowing him as a friend and as a crucial member of the local community.
Regardless of how we knew Joe, however, we all recognized him for who he was: a man of supreme integrity, character, and intellect.
The airwaves defined Joe's life, and Joe's life defined the airwaves.
From the start of his radio career as a DJ for the campus station at Washington University in St. Louis to its end on SiriuxXM's Urban View with a daily listenership in the tens of millions, Joe captivated his listeners.
They knew they could trust Joe.
He made a point never to violate that trust.
Joe understood both the nuances of radio as a medium and its power to change minds and change the country.
Before his radio career took off, Joe was a leading figure in the Detroit chapter of the NAACP.
He was only 24 when he became executive director of the Detroit branch of the organization--the youngest person in history to hold the position.
Never losing sight of his roots in advocacy, Joe used his platform on the radio to highlight the most pressing challenges of the day, especially those facing the Black community.
His perspective was invaluable in an era when conservative talk radio dominated the airwaves.
Throughout his life, Joe proved to be a powerful force for change both on and off the air, always asking his famous question.
`What are you going to do about it?'
He posed that question not only to others but to himself.
In 2001, he was arrested for protesting human rights abuses in Sudan.
