CORDOVA ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. CORREA.
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues, Representatives Levin, Sanchez, and Napolitano, and rise today to honor the life of Raymond ``Ray'' L. Cordova, a renowned labor leader who leaves behind a legacy of service.
Ray cut his teeth as an organizer in the early 1960s as part of the Freedom Summer Movement in Mississippi for almost two years.
A proud veteran of the U.S. Army Airborne, his service to his country continued after the Vietnam War when he returned home to build up his community.
He was always a dapper dresser and treated everyone with respect.
In a short time, Ray began making his name known as one of the most effective and impactful labor leaders in Orange County.
No matter what or who you believed in--if you were a Republican, Democrat, or something in between--Ray was a champion of all people.
When working men and women across America had no seat at the table, Ray fought tirelessly to make room through his leadership in the Communications Workers of America Union and as a labor organizer in Orange County.
Ray's influence and impact extends beyond his labor work.
He educated and prepared the next generation of the labor movement, and helped redefine politics in Southern California.
It is because of his mentorship that so many of the leaders of today are prepared to make the changes they envision, in California and beyond.
Not only was he a deeply loved member of our community, but my colleagues and I are lucky that Ray was also a dear friend.
I have personally had the pleasure of knowing and learning from him over the last 25 years.
I ask my colleagues to join me and Representatives Levin, Sanchez, and Napolitano in celebrating the extraordinary life and legacy of Raymond ``Ray'' L. Cordova.
I thank Ray for setting an example of leadership and service that we all may aspire to and learn from. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my constituent Captain Kevin Mitchell of the Kingsport Fire Department in Kingsport, Tennessee, who is retiring after more than 26 years of dedicated service to our community.
Captain Mitchell began his Journey with the Kingsport Fire Department on September 2, 1997.
Over the span of his illustrious career, he has not only served as a firefighter, but also advanced to become a paramedic serving in this capacity for over two decades.
His dedication to continued education extended far beyond his immediate duties as a respected instructor in both fire service and medical fields, where he taught crucial lifesaving techniques such as CPR, Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), and more.
Beginning his career as a firefighter, Captain Mitchell was soon promoted to the position of engineer, where he was responsible for driving and operating complex firefighting vehicles.
He continued to rise through the ranks in recognition of his exceptional service, culminating in his promotion to Captain, a role he held until his retirement.
His commitment to safety and excellence led him to join the Kingsport Fire Department Technical Rescue Team, where he specialized in Search & Rescue, Swift Water Rescue, Confined Space, High & Low Angle Rope Rescue, Trench Rescue, and Structural Collapse.
His leadership and expertise in these areas earned him the role of Technical Rescue Team Leader.
