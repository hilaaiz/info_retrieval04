THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. KEAN of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate Abilities of Northwest Jersey on their 50th Anniversary.
Over 50 years ago, a group of 14 grassroot advocates, including parents and members of the New Jersey community, came together to incorporate Abilities of Northwest Jersey as an organization fulfilling the vocational needs of adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities.
Starting as a small workshop serving 13 individuals in Washington, NJ and partnering with local companies, this group of advocates had a mission to improve the employability and quality of life for people with disabilities, leading to their sense of self-worth and independence.
Thanks to their efforts, Abilities was legally incorporated in 1974.
Since that time, Abilities have grown exponentially, serving individuals of all levels of abilities, through the expansion of various programs and services.
Abilities now serves over 375 individuals and their families throughout the northwest region of the state.
They are not only the disability employment experts for this region, but the professional staff also support those who are significantly challenged with medical or behavioral needs.
Their services are both exemplary and accredited by CARE International.
They have also opened a variety of Social Enterprises that offer vocational training opportunities as well as a valued service to our community-- PrintAbilities, SustainAbilities Electronics Recycling and PossAbilities Thrift Boutiques.
I am so proud of their accomplishments, the positive impact they have made on thousands of lives, and the exciting future that lies ahead. ____________________
