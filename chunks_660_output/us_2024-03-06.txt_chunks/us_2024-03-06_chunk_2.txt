Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Franklin Lucore of Monett, Missouri, who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout just prior to his 15th birthday.
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America program, and since its inception in 1911, only 4 percent of scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
Franklin is a freshman in the International Baccalaureate Program at Central High School in Springfield and a member of BSA Troop 38 in Monett.
He began his scouting career as a Cub Scout at the age of seven and since then has held numerous leadership positions with the troop, while also maintaining a 4.0 grade point average in school.
He is a member of the Brotherhood of the Order of the Arrow, scouting's National Honor Society, and a member of the Tribe of the Lone Bear, an honors program of the Ozark Trails Council's Camp Arrowhead.
He also has earned 36 merit badges, camped out more than 50 nights, hiked more than 100 miles and performed more than 36 hours of community service.
His Eagle Scout project provided improvements and outdoor furnishing to South Park, a 65-acre park owned by the city of Monett that caters especially to children and adults with disabilities.
Scouting has been teaching valuable lessons in leadership since it was established in February 1910, and achieving the rank of Eagle Scout is an important accomplishment.
This young man deserves our applause for a job well done.
I am proud to have him as a constituent. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Jackson Choi of Springfield, Missouri, who recently achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.
Eagle Scout is the highest rank attainable in the Boy Scouts of America program.
Since its inception in 1911, only 4 percent of scouts have earned this rank after a lengthy review process.
Jackson is a junior at Kickapoo High School in Springfield, and he has been in scouting since he joined as a Cub Scout in 2013.
He is a member of Troop No.
289, where he has held several leadership positions.
He also has attended three of the four high adventure camps earning him the Triple Crown Award from the Boy Scouts of America.
To earn the Eagle Scout designation, each individual must complete a project.
Jackson's project was to update the bamboo fencing at the Mizumoto Japanese Stroll Garden at the Nathaniel Green/Close Memorial Park in Springfield.
The garden was established by Springfield's Japanese sister city in 1985.
The original bamboo fencing had fallen into disrepair, so Jackson studied the process and replaced 100-feet of fencing in the traditional Japanese way.
This accomplished young man deserves our applause for a job well done.
I am proud to have him as a constituent. ____________________
