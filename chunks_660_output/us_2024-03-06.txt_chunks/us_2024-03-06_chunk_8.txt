Adel has been successful in her fundraising efforts, raising over $50,000 for FARE, a non-profit that promotes food allergy awareness and research.
In 2018, Adel was the recipient of the FARE Teen Achievement Award following her involvement in the annual Milwaukee Food Allergy Heroes Walk.
In 2020, the Schneider family donated allergy-friendly food to Paul's Pantry in Green Bay after receiving a grant from FARE.
She has partnered with Appleton's Minor League Baseball team, the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, to share information with the community on food-allergies.
She is a Red Sneakers for Oakley Ambassador, where she creates social media content centered on food allergy awareness.
Most recently, Adel ran her annual Teal Halloween Skate, which is a community Halloween event that provides allergy-safe treats.
As Adel became more vocal in the community, her advocacy spread to Congress.
I first met Adel in 2020 to discuss the FASTER Act, which requires food companies to include sesame as an allergen on their labels.
After successfully passing this legislation, I have continued to meet with Adel to discuss future legislation on food allergies.
Most recently, Adel and I discussed the ADINA Act, a bill I introduced in 2023.
This legislation would require pharmaceutical companies to be more transparent about their allergy risks on drug labels.
I always look forward to meeting with Adel and hearing about her community events in Northeast Wisconsin.
I value her perspective and commend the work she is doing on food-allergy awareness.
Adel has inspired many, including myself, with her advocacy for individuals with food allergies.
I take comfort in knowing there are young citizens stepping up in their communities.
Adel has a long list of accomplishments, and I look forward to watching her accomplish even more. ____________________
