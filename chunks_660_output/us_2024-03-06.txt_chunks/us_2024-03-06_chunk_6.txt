`What are you going to do about it?'
He posed that question not only to others but to himself.
In 2001, he was arrested for protesting human rights abuses in Sudan.
Breaking records with a 52-hour long broadcast in 2015, Joe raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.
He went on a 73-day hunger strike in 2021 to protest Republicans' legislative blockade of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
I saw his passionate advocacy firsthand when we worked together on the historic Emmett Till Antilynching Act.
Joe and I, along with many others, were frustrated that America still lacked a law that made lynching a federal crime more than a century after the idea was first proposed.
During the 116th Congress, we worked with Rep. Bobby Rush and then-Representative Karen

Bass to rectify that failure.
After Republicans blocked the bill's passage in 2020, we renewed our push in the 117th Congress.
At long last, President Biden signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law on March 29, 2022.
It wouldn't have been possible without Joe Madison.
Joe's work on the bill and on a variety of other causes over the years drew the admiration of millions.
Listeners were excited to tune in every day and guests were eager to come on Joe's show because they knew the commentary and conversation would be just as meaningful as his principled advocacy.
Whether discussing the opportunities that the new FBI consolidated headquarters will create for Greenbelt, Democrats' efforts to address inflation, or my longstanding work to protect voting rights, I had the pleasure of coming on Joe's show many times over the years to talk about critical issues in Maryland's Fifth District and beyond.
Many other leaders sought out these meaningful conversations with Joe, from former President Barack Obama to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi.
He inspired each of his guests--and each of his listeners--to reflect more deeply on their principles, their politics, and their perspectives.
Mr. Speaker, Joe's voice was defined not by its earthy baritone but by its moral clarity and commitment to truth.
Like so many others across the country and around the world, I will miss hearing it crackle through the radio in the morning.
Joe may be gone, but the question he posed to his listeners remains: `What are you going to do about it?'
Although he can no longer ask us that question, we can still answer.
Mr. Speaker, I offer my prayers to Joe's incredible wife of 47 years, Sherry; his three daughters, Monesha Madison Lever, Shawna Collins and Michelle Borleske; his son, Jason Madison; his four half-siblings; his five grandchildren; and his great-granddaughter.
I ask that all my colleagues join me in wishing them strength and in mourning Joe Madison--a titan of the airwaves.
May God bless and keep Joe Madison. ____________________
