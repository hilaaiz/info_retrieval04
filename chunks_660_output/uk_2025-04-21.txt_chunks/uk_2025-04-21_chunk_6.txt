During her tenure, Mary was instrumental in reducing smoking rates

and increasing childhood vaccination coverage across the state.
She was

known for her commitment to preventive care and for strengthening the

collaboration between state and local health agencies.
Beyond her professional accomplishments, Mary was deeply connected to

her community in Colville, Washington, where she resided for over 50

years.
Her dedication to both her local community and the broader

public health landscape left a lasting impact on the state.
Mr.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL EDEN MURRIE

HON.
MARK E. GREEN

Mr. GREEN of Tennessee.
Mr. Speaker.
I rise today to honor the life

and service of Retired Brigadier General Eden Murrie.
Throughout a

distinguished twenty-nine-year career in the United States Air Force,

Eden was awarded the Legion of Merit, Defense Meritorious Service

Medal, and the Aerial Achievement Medal, among many others.
She also

earned the title of ``master navigator'' after logging over 2,400

flying hours as well as serving as a flight instructor for three

different aircraft.
After achieving the rank of General Officer in

2009, Eden served as special assistant to the Vice Chief of Staff at

the United States Air Force Headquarters in Washington, D.C., before

transitioning to the Director of Legislative Affairs on the National

Security Staff for the White House.
From 2011 to 2013, she served as

the Director of Air Force Services and Deputy Chief of Staff for

Manpower, Personnel, and Services at the U.S. Air Force Headquarters.
Soon after retiring from military service.
Eden became the Chief

Operations Officer of Operation Stand Down Tennessee (OSDTN) in 2017

and became its Chief Executive Officer in 2020.
OSDTN is the only

comprehensive veteran-serving agency in Middle Tennessee, connecting

veterans with careers, community, and crisis services.
Under her leadership, OSDTN has served thousands of veterans by

delivering food boxes, providing financial assistance, helping veterans

find housing, and assisting veterans in their transition from military

to civilian life.
In her final full year as CEO, Operation Stand Down

Tennessee served 7,991 veterans while receiving over 16,000 visits to

OSDTN centers.
Her dedication to serving our nation and its veterans

has left an indelible mark on our Armed Forces and Middle Tennessee.
Eden is also a prominent leader in my community.
She has served on

the boards for The Women in Military Service for America Memorial

Foundation, Tennessee State Veterans' Homes, Centerstone Military

Services, and the Davidson County Veterans Court Foundation, as well as

an adviser for the Nashville YWCA Dress for Success program.
As Eden steps down from her role as CEO of Operation Stand Down

Tennessee.
I want to wish her the best and thank her for her decades of

public and private service.
I know she will tackle her next chapter

with the same passion and tenacity as her other outstanding

achievements.

OPPOSITION TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AND ELON MUSK'S THEFT OF SOCIAL

SECURITY TO PAY FOR HANDOUTS TO BILLIONAIRES

HON.
DANNY K. DAVIS

Mr. DAVIS of Illinois.
Mr. Speaker, as a policymaker and citizen, I

unconditionally and absolutely reject President Trump's and Elon Musk's

work to steal American's Social Security benefits, a scheme that hurts

middle-class and working-class families and seniors to pay for tax

handouts to billionaires.
When Americans already face increased prices

and economic hardship from the President's chaotic policies, Mr. Trump

threatens Social Security--the leading assistance program that 73

million Americans depend on for monthly assistance.
This group includes

the more than 7 million seniors aged 65 or older for whom 90 percent of

their income is their earned Social Security benefits.
Without Social

Security, 52.2 percent of older women would live in poverty.
