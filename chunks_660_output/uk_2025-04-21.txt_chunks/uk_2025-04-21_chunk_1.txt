CELEBRATING ASIA CENTER MALL AND ASIA FOOD MARKET

HON.
TIMOTHY M. KENNEDY

Mr. KENNEDY of New York.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the

remarkable contributions of Asia Food Market, a cornerstone of the

Western New York community and one of the largest retailers of Asian

products in our region.
With a diverse selection of over ten thousand

goods sourced from across Asia--including Thailand, the Philippines,

India, China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and many more--Asia Food Market

brings the flavors, traditions, and richness of Asian cultures right to

the heart of the Buffalo Niagara Region.
Their mission goes far beyond providing authentic food.
Asia Food

Market is committed to enriching the cultural fabric of our community,

fostering understanding, appreciation, and shared experiences among

people of all backgrounds.
It stands as a vital bridge between

cultures, offering not only culinary delights but also an open

invitation to explore and celebrate Asia's vibrant heritage.
With the exciting opening of the Asia Center Mall, the organization

is poised to take that mission even further.
This new space combines

retail, dining, entertainment, and cultural programming, creating a

dynamic hub for community engagement and cross-cultural connection.
The

Asia Center Mall represents a bold vision: one where multiculturalism

is not only celebrated but woven into the daily life and economic

vitality of our region.
Mr. Speaker, as we acknowledge this milestone, let us recognize the

essential role that Asia Food Market plays--not just as a business, but

as a beacon of cultural exchange, economic growth, and community

spirit.
Please join me in applauding the achievements and continued

success of both Asia Food Market and the Asia Center Mall, as they

remain an enduring source of pride and connection for generations to

come.
