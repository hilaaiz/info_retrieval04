Over the

course of her career, Josayne has demonstrated a steadfast commitment

to making a difference in her community, specifically in the areas of

civil rights and women's advocacy.
Josayne was driven to a career in public service after she lost a

close friend to domestic violence.
Coupled with her own experiences

surviving domestic violence, she has since dedicated her life to

speaking out against domestic and sexual violence.
In 2004, she founded

the Love Quest Foundation, an organization that seeks to provide a safe

space for young adults and survivors of domestic violence to learn

healthy relationship habits and heal from trauma.
Over the past 2

decades, the Love Quest Foundation has transformed the lives of

countless young people and survivors across Dutchess County.
In addition to her work with her foundation, Ms. Anderson-Tetera has

served as Dutchess County's Equal Opportunity and Inclusion Officer

since 2020.
In her position, Josayne is charged with maintaining and

improving the County's commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
Previously, she worked for the New York State Department of Corrections

and Community Supervision where she conducted investigations which

aimed to prevent discrimination, misconduct, and assaults in the

workplace.
She has also served as: Financial Secretary and recruitment

presenter for the New York State Minorities in Criminal Justice, Board

Member for Life Flows Through Every Body, and Fellow for CEO Action for

Racial Equity.
I commend Josayne's impressive contributions to the Hudson Valley.
Through her work, she has undoubtedly made a positive impact on the

lives of countless men and women, The President's Volunteer Service

Award is a formal acknowledgment of the hundreds of hours she has

devoted to improving her community, but I want to take this opportunity

to attest to the immeasurable contributions that she has selflessly

made to Dutchess County and to our state.
