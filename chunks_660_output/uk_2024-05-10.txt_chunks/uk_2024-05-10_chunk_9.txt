As proposed, this sanctuary

bridges the physical gap of protection between the Monterey Bay and

Channel Islands national marine sanctuaries.
It will enhance the

lifeforce (tishwin) of coastal ocean waters and shorelines by

integrating and engaging the traditional knowledge of the indigenous

People in partnership with scientists, environmental public interest

groups, and diverse members of the concerned public.
So far.
the proposal has received an overwhelmingly positive

response, and the plan is to provide formal designation by mid-2024.
Violet's continued leadership to the Chumash people and the San Luis

Obispo/Santa Barbara County community is an inspiration to men and

women throughout the district.
Her ongoing efforts ensure that the

heritage and legacy of the Chumash are respected and will endure for

generations to come.
I am honored to recognize Violet Sage Walker for her continued

commitment to the Central Coast.
I ask all Members to join me today in

honoring an exceptional woman of California's 24th Congressional

District for her incredible work in the community.
