MARC A. VEASEY

Mr. VEASEY.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Mr. MyoungSub Choi

for his exceptional efforts to preserve and share cultural heritage

through the practice of Taekwondo.
Mr. Choi understands that Taekwondo is more than a martial art--it is

a means of storytelling, cultural connection, and youth empowerment.
Through his leadership and mentorship, he has inspired students across

North Texas to embrace both the physical and philosophical dimensions

of the sport.
By nurturing discipline and pride within a diverse community, Mr.

Choi has built a lasting legacy.
His work during the 23rd Annual Korean

American National Sports Festival is a testament to his enduring

commitment to cultural celebration and civic unity.
We commend Mr. Choi for using sport as a bridge across generations

and communities.

RECOGNIZING THEODORE GOMEZ

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to rise today to

recognize Mr. Theodore Gomez for his service at Withlacoochee River

Electric Cooperative (WREC) and his remarkable role in the Light Up

Navajo Project.
In May, a courageous team of 16 WREC employees traveled

over 1,800 miles to the remote, rugged terrains of Arizona and New

Mexico, where they spent two weeks installing vital electrical

infrastructure for Navajo families who have lived without power for

generations.
Their efforts brought light, safety, and hope to

communities long overlooked, allowing children to study after dark,

families to preserve

food, and elders to live with greater comfort.
Despite daunting

challenges and limited equipment, the WREC team completed a demanding

project in just eight days--far ahead of expectations--demonstrating

professionalism, humility, and unwavering commitment to this life-

changing mission.
The impact of WREC's work goes far beyond electricity; it represents

a bridge to connection, opportunity, and the return of future

generations to their ancestral homes.
The emotional moment when power

was turned on for the impacted families--bringing tears of joy and

renewed hope--is a testament to the profound difference this project

made.
WREC's participation in the ``Light Up Navajo'' initiative

reflects not only their technical expertise but also their heart and

respect for the people they serve.
Their dedication has energized ten

homesteads and countless lives, creating a legacy of service that

embodies the true spirit of cooperative values.
The WREC team's journey

inspires us all, proving that with compassion and teamwork, even the

most daunting challenges can be overcome to light up lives and

communities.
I commend the entire team for their efforts on this

worthwhile endeavor and for their ongoing service to our local

community.
