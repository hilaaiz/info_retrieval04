Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Pamela Ott on the

occasion of her retirement after more than two decades of distinguished

service to the City of Pleasanton, California.
Pamela has dedicated over 22 years to serving Pleasanton with vision,

leadership and unwavering commitment to public service.
She began her

career in Pleasanton as Executive Director of the Downtown Association

and joined the city government in 2003 as the Economic Development

Director.
In 2021, she was appointed Assistant City Manager, a role in

which she has excelled in until her retirement on June 20, 2025.
Pamela holds a Bachelor of Science from the University of Florida and

a Master's in Organization Development from the University of San

Francisco.
In addition to her public service, she has given her time to

local causes, including the Valley Humane Society Board and the

Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley Advisory Board.
Throughout her career, Pamela has played a vital role in shaping

Pleasanton's economic development.
She led major business recruitment

efforts that brought transformative companies such as Workday, 10x

Genomics, and Veeva Systems to the city.
Her work on the Johnson Drive

Economic Development Zone helped deliver a vibrant new commercial hub,

including a Costco and two new hotels.
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Pamela took swift action to

support local businesses by designing and implementing innovative

recovery programs that helped them stay afloat and connected to their

customers.
Her leadership was essential during a time of great

uncertainty and change.
As a Pleasanton resident since 2001, Pamela has been more than a

public servant, she has been a dedicated neighbor, a compassionate

leader, and a steadfast champion for her community.
As she steps into

retirement, I offer my deepest gratitude for her service and wish her

all the best as she is afforded more time with her husband, Jim, and

daughters, Melissa and Kelsey.
