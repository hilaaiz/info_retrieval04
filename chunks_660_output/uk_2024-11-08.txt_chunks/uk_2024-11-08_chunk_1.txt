CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE FRIENDS UNIVERSITY SINGING QUAKERS

HON.
RON ESTES

Mr. ESTES.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Friends

University Singing Quakers for a century of vocal excellence.
The Singing Quakers have proven to be a premier choral group that has

taken their talents across the country, including our nation's capital,

and even around the world.
They have entertained Kansans locally with

annual home concerts, Christmas candlelight concerts and Symphony of

Spring.
The many men and women who have performed with this prestigious group

should be commended for their incredible talent, dedication to musical

greatness, camaraderie and character.
The Friends University Singing

Quakers represent their institution and our region well.
I also want to recognize the phenomenal leadership of the Singing

Quakers' directors, including current director Dr. Rayvon T.J. Moore,

recent director Dr. Mark Bartel and longtime director Dr. Cecil Riney.
They have elevated choral music in Kansas and are well-respected far

beyond the Sunflower State.
As they gather this weekend to celebrate and perform, I want to thank

the alumni and current performers of the Friends University Singing

Quakers for providing our region with exceptional choral music for 100

years.
