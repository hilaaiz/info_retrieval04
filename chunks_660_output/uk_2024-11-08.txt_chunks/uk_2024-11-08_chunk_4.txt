HONORING THE RECIPIENTS OF TEXAS' 26TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT VETERAN

COMMENDATION

HON.
MICHAEL C. BURGESS

Mr. BURGESS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recall and recognize the

recipients of a special annual salute to honor local Veterans of the

26th Congressional District of Texas.
Starting in 2005, I have had the

privilege of honoring distinguished Veterans of my district with Texas'

26th Congressional District Veteran Commendation.
Our nation's Veterans have selflessly and honorably served our

country and preserved our freedoms.
It is because of their service that

we enjoy all the liberties we are afforded.
These brave men and women

deserve our thanks and praise.
I am grateful to have had the opportunity to publicly recognize

eighty-six Veterans over the past two decades and honor their service

through the presentation of the Congressional Veteran Commendation

(CVC) at the annual ``Salute Our Veterans'' luncheon sponsored by the

Highland Village Business Association (HVBA) and the City of Highland

Village, Texas.
At this patriotic event each year, in addition to the announcement of

the CVC recipients, each Veteran in attendance is afforded the

opportunity to give their name and branch of service along with a

highlight of their military service.
With an annual attendance of over

250, the HVBA graciously covers the cost of the luncheon for attending

Veterans and their guest.
As I retire from the U.S. House of Representatives, allow me to

announce the five recipients of the 2024 Congressional Veteran

Commendation and add their names to the illustrious list of prior

recipients.
