As the largest mint in the world, the United States Mint

produces the coinage required by our Nation to conduct its

trade and commerce.
In addition, Congress authorizes a

maximum of two commemorative coin programs annually to

celebrate and honor American people, places, events, and

institutions.
I would like to thank Senator Browne,

Representative McHenry and Representative Waters for their

work to get the Greatest Generation out of their respective

committees and working with the sponsors, leadership and Mint

to ensure the language was correct and passed in time for

2024.
Since the beginning of the modern commemorative coin

program in 1982, the United States Mint has raised more than

$522 million in surcharges authorized to help build or

enhance new museums, preserve historical sites, and support

important national programs.
In accordance with legislation,

the Mint includes a surcharge as part of the price of each

commemorative coin.
These surcharges are authorized to be

turned over to the sponsoring organizations for projects that

benefit the community.
In this case, surcharges are

authorized to be awarded to the Friends of the National World

War II Memorial to support the National Park Service in

maintaining and repairing the memorial, and for educational

and commemorative programs.
I'd like to tell you a little about the designs.

of a person walking up a ramp leading to one of the towers.

The Greatest Generation commemorative coin designs are emblematic of

the National World War II Memorial and the service and sacrifice of

American soldiers and civilians during World War II.
We hope this

program will honor their courage and their spirit.
It is our pleasure

to assist the Friends of the National World War II Memorial in their

efforts to teach the lessons of yesterday to unite the generations of

tomorrow.
