In some small rural areas, like where I grew up, there aren't credit

unions everywhere like there are in the city of Houston where I live

now.
Even in the city of Houston, many small businesses during the

pandemic couldn't secure a PPP loan in round one.
We [as Congress] had

to go in and do a carve-out to literally force the banks to provide

loans to small businesses.
I am glad that one of my colleagues was openhearted and gave people a

lot of loans.
I just hope that that included loans to minority small

businesses.
Mr. Speaker, this is real.
It is not hypothetical.
We know that

minority-owned small businesses were less likely to receive a loan

during the pandemic compared to White firms.
Regrettably, Mr. Speaker,

racism and discrimination flourish in the darkness.
We need to shine a

light and allow the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to make

lending more transparent.
Mr. Speaker, a transparent market will be a competitive market.
With transparency in lending, banks are driven to compete and offer

better terms.
With this resolution, extreme MAGA Republicans are protecting the

secret discriminatory practices of big banks and lenders.
Repealing

this rule would harm all those who stand to benefit from much-needed

transparency.
Make no mistake, extreme MAGA Republicans continue to put the

interests of the big bank CEOs and corporate lobbyists ahead of their

constituents.
It is they who, time and time again, put profits over

people.
House Democrats will continue protecting everyday consumers and

small business owners, while holding corporations accountable.
We will always put people over corporate profits.
We will always put

light over darkness.

Minority Entrepreneurs Struggled To Get Small-Business Relief Loans

(By Stacy Cowley)

A year after the Paycheck Protection Program started,

studies show how its design hurt Black- and other minority-

owned businesses.
Southern Bancorp is a lender serving the Arkansas and

Mississippi Delta, where poverty rates are among the highest

in America and decades of redlining shaped neighborhoods with

little generational wealth.
When the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses

started last April, so many of Southern Bancorp's customers

didn't qualify for the relief money that the Arkansas bank's

chief executive, Darrin Williams, turned to donors to raise

money for $1,000 grants so it wouldn't have to turn

applicants away empty-handed.
The bank made 128 such grants, giving more than 100 of them

to businesses run by women or minority owners.
One let a nail

salon owner buy plexiglass so she could reopen.
Another

allowed a small cafe to buy safety gear for its staff.
A day

care used the money for the new sanitizing equipment it

needed.
``So many companies will never come back, and

disproportionately more of those that will be lost are Black

and brown businesses,'' Mr. Williams said.
Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program in March

2020 as an emergency stopgap for what lawmakers expected to

be a few months of sharp economic disruption.
But as the

pandemic raged on, the program--which made its first loans

one year ago this past week--has turned into the largest

small-business support program in American history, sending

$734 billion in forgivable loans to struggling companies.
The program helped nearly seven million businesses retain

workers.
But it has also been plagued by complex, changing

rules at every stage of its existence.
And one year in, it

has become clear that the program's hasty rollout and design

hurt some of the most vulnerable businesses.
