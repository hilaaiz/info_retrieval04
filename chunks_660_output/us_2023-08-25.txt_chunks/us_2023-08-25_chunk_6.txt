238, the Church of the Nazarene where he taught Sunday School, and his neighborhood watch, where he is known for generously shoveling driveways and sidewalks throughout the community.
He is a man of many hobbies and talents, including wood carving, flying his plane, and bowling.
And in the large and loving family he established, Willis is beloved as the historical archivist and storyteller, with a zest for life and a laugh that echoes across multiple generations.
Mr. Speaker, Willis Rockwood is a man who has spent his long and fruitful life deeply devoted to his family, his friends, his country, and his faith.
Those who know and love him fondly refer to him as their ``National Treasure,'' and I assert that he is just that.
On the occasion of his 100th birthday, I salute his life of service, and want to reflect our community, our state, and our Nation's gratitude for all he has contributed and constructed. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of the life of Staff Sgt.
Darren James ``DJ'' Breton, who has recently passed away at age 32, and to honor his service to the Nation.
Born in Wiesbaden, Germany, DJ embarked on a remarkable journey that took him across the globe and led him to proudly serve his country through his role as a crew chief in the United States Air Force.
His passion for sports, particularly hockey, became the heartbeat of his life.
DJ generously shared his love for the game by dedicating his time to the Youth Hockey League, where he not only nurtured young talents but also found immense joy.
To both the youths he mentored and the family he deeply cherished, DJ brought a lighthearted sense of humor and an essence of selflessness, dependability, and respect for others.
DJ will be remembered for his legacy of service, care, and joy.
He is survived by his loving father Dennis; his devoted mother, Kimberly; and his 2 adoring sisters, Cassandra and Hanna.
DJ was, and is, well-loved and highly respected amongst his family and community, and his memory will not soon be forgotten.
I pray that his loved ones may be comforted as they mourn his loss.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the life and legacy of Staff Sgt.
Darren James Breton.

CLARENCE B. JONES ______ of new york in the house of representatives Mr. TORRES of New York.
Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech delivered by the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I rise to honor not only the transformative impact of this iconic address but also to recognize the significant contribution of Dr. Clarence B. Jones to its creation.
Furthermore, it is imperative that we acknowledge the instrumental role that the vibrant Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale played in the enduring legacy of this momentous event.
The ``I Have a Dream'' speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the March on Washington, stands as an indelible marker of American history.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s eloquence and vision, as expressed in that speech, continue to inspire and challenge us to this day.
His words called for unity, justice, and equality, transcending the barriers of time and space to resonate with generations that followed.
