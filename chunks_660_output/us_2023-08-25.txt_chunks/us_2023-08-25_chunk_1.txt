Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Sergeant Paul R. Daw, a Vietnam War veteran and upstanding constituent of New York's 21st District.
Paul was raised in Long Island, New York.
After graduating high school, he joined the United States Army, serving for 2 years in the Vietnam War from July 1969 to May 1971.
Sergeant Daw was stationed in Vietnam as an Eleven-Bravo infantryman alongside his fellow men with the 1st Cavalry Division, Ranger Company A. For his service, Sergeant Daw was highly decorated.
Upon his honorable discharge in 1971, Sergeant Daw earned a Bronze Star with 2 oak leaf clusters, a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, the Combat Infantry Badge, the Army Accommodation Medal for Valor, and the Good Conduct Medal.
After returning home to Long Island from Vietnam, Sergeant Daw joined the New York Police Department, where he served for 21 and a half years as an officer of the law.
Off the force, Sergeant Daw also supported his community as a volunteer firefighter until his retirement from the NYPD in 2003, at which time he moved upstate to the North Country.
In his retirement, Sergeant Daw has taken time to focus on his family life.
He and his wife Jean have been happily married for 16 years, in the company of his children Jason and Kelly and stepdaughter Katie.
Sergeant Paul R. Daw's life of service and bravery is truly admirable.
On behalf of New York's 21st District, it is my honor to recognize the remarkable life of Sergeant Paul R. Daw. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, Jeff Williams.
In 2012, Jeff founded Taste Project, an organization that provides meals in Fort Worth to those in need.
Jeff knew what food scarcity felt like growing up in a family of 4 where both of his parents worked hard to keep food on the table even though money was tight.
When he was younger, his parents would sometimes skip meals to make sure him and his sister had dinner.
Jeff's upbringing gave him the idea to create a place where members of the community could go to always get an affordable meal.
In 2017, the Taste Project opened a pay-what-you-can community restaurant in Fort Worth, the Taste Community Restaurant, where diners can pay as little as a penny for a meal.
Beyond the restaurant, the Taste Project empowers and provides hope to North Texans through culinary classes, job training programs, and even a community garden that helps teach people gardening skills.
In the last 6 years, Jeff and Taste Community Restaurant have helped more than 150,000 people and are currently serving more than 1,000 people a week.
Jeff and his team work hard every day to make sure they help as many people as possible.
I'd like to thank Jeff for his dedication to serving the people and families of North Texas. ____________________
