Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, the Coppell Fire Department.
Due to a power failure at the Village Parkway Pump Station earlier this year, the City of Coppell announced a Boil Water Notice and requested that residents and businesses only use water in emergency situations.
The Coppell Fire Department's Emergency Management and Public Works team leapt into action and helped restore power to the water pump, all during a brutal Texas heatwave.
The department offered multi-faceted assistance, from staffing the Emergency Operations Center, providing heat rehab support at the distribution point, transporting water from local vendors to the public library, on top of the normal daily operational items.
I'd like to thank the Coppell Fire Department for their quick response and service to the residents of Texas-24 by helping make Coppell's water safe to drink again. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the service of Major Laterrious ``Tony'' Starks, who served as a legislative liaison for the U.S. House of Representatives with profound duty, leadership, and commitment from January 2021 to August 2023.
Major Starks served as a defense fellow for my office, and, as a legislative liaison, his interpersonal skills built countless relationships throughout Headquarters, Department of the Army, and Capitol Hill.
These relationships enabled him to communicate the Army's narrative and facilitate senior leader engagements.
In addition to the duties as a legislative liaison, Major Starks expertly balanced a collateral duty as the White House Social Aide Senior Program Manager.
His professionalism has resulted in strategic success across the Executive Branch.
Due to his exceptional efforts, he was selected to lead over 100 White House events, to include two Medal of Honor Ceremonies and three State Visits.
In addition to his military-based contributions to our great nation, which have included service in many parts of the United States as well as in other countries, to include Germany and Korea, Major Starks is well-versed educationally, having invested himself in various levels of university programs.
Major Starks's education includes studying at George Washington University, pursuing a master's degree in Legislative Affairs, from 2020 to 2021; studying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a Strategic Studies Fellow, in 2019; studying at Abilene Christian University, pursuing a doctorate's degree in Education, from 2018 to 2021; and studying at Stephen F. Austin State University, pursuing an undergraduate degree in Political Science and Government, from 2006 to 2010.
He is currently a doctoral candidate.
Major Starks is an outstanding individual who has already served his country in many ways, and it is my honor to esteem him today. ____________________
