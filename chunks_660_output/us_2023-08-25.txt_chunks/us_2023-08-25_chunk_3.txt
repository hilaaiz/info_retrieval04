Mr. Speaker, today I honor the legacy of a Livingston County, Michigan woman whose life, though cut tragically short, was a testament to kindness, inclusivity, and tolerance.
Pamela Ann Ross of Brighton never sought attention, never wanted credit for the light she spread so generously everywhere she went.
But as those who love her grapple with her loss, we must lift up her life as an example of what it really means to live in community.
Pam loved her state and the people in it.
A proud graduate of Milford High School, she traveled right down the road to attend Michigan State University, leaving the state only briefly to pursue a Master's degree in teaching from Arizona State University.
Pam brought those skills and talents back home, seeking to help set students up for success as citizens of the world and inspire in them a drive to do well and succeed in life.
To this day, she is remembered as a beloved and inspirational second grade teacher who wanted nothing more than to see her students reach their full potential.
As she built her family, first with husband Stan and later with their 2 sons, Jackson and Nicholas, and 2 canine ``children,'' Luna and Bella, Pam made the decision to devote herself fully to the homefront.
But she never stepped back from her mission to be of service to others, nor did she ever stop seeing the very best in people.
Pam was a steadfast volunteer in her children's classrooms, with Boy Scouts, and with numerous community organizations, including Habitat for Humanity where she served on the board of directors for many years.
Pam was also a fierce advocate for equality, and a firm believer that every child and every person in the community deserves love, acceptance, and respect just as they are.
She was particularly passionate about vulnerable populations, speaking out in her firm but loving way at school board meetings and organizing events in support of LGBTQ+ and minority students, as well as those with disabilities.
But it was Pam's quiet life of service that her friends and family remember most: the way holiday and birthday gifts would appear on the porches of neighborhood children whose parents were going through tough times, or the gift cards those same parents would find under their doormats, the backpacks she stuffed full of school supplies for kids who might otherwise go without, the meal deliveries that just showed up for families in need.
Pam never attached her name to those gifts.
But everyone knew where they came from--and the love behind them.
Mr. Speaker, in this world there are those who dream of a better world and those who actively work to make it so, and

Pam was the rare blend of both.
In Pam's world, neighbors looked after each other no matter what, and strangers were merely friends she had yet to meet.
Her unexpected passing leaves a deep void in the hearts and lives of so many, and I send my deepest condolences to her family, friends, and all who knew and loved her.
May her memory live on in every step we actively take toward a kinder, more inclusive community.
Everyone was welcome in Pam's heart and in her home, so it is fitting that her legacy will forever be remembered. ____________________
