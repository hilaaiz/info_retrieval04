Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Gary Carpenter for the excellent professional and dedicated service he has rendered as the Congressional Liaison for the United States Air Force Academy for the past 18 years.
He previously served his country in the U.S. Air Force from 1982 to 2004, as an active-duty enlisted Public Affairs Specialist for the U.S. Northern Command/NORAD and the Uniformed Services University.
The productive and collaborative relationships he has fostered between the USAFA Directorate of Admissions and congressional offices across the nation will be greatly missed.
I have no doubt Mr. Carpenter will leave USAFA in good hands.
His accomplishments attest to his integrity, quality of character and his dedication to the institution and country which he has served with such honor.
It has been the privilege of my staff to work with him and his office throughout the years on behalf of potential Air Force Academy candidates from Texas.
As he moves on to new challenges, Mr. Carpenter has had a tremendous and positive impact on the futures of thousands of students and military leaders.
On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, I extend my warmest regards to Gary Carpenter on a job well done and wish him all the very best in the future.
He has our thanks and gratitude. ____________________
