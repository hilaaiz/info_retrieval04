I enjoyed working with Cynthia over the past 30 to 40 years.
Her

contributions to her community knew no end.
The people of Manhattan's

Upper West Side will miss her deeply but know that we will continue to

carry out the work that she cared about so deeply.
We will continue to

work for social justice, environmental justice, women's rights, LGBTQ+

rights, and health care for all.
I thank her for her years of service.
May she rest in peace.
And may her memory be a blessing to us all.
