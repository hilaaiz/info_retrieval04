EHE is

a rare and devastating cancer that can affect anyone of any age and

that grows in the cells that make up our blood vessels, often appearing

in the liver, lungs, and bones.
This disease is very rare, affecting

one in one million people, and is also exceedingly difficult to

diagnose.
According to the National Cancer Institute, patients suffering from

EHE often live with severe pain, broken bones, disability, and

respiratory infections.
Studies show that EHE is more common in women,

but more fatal for men.
Because of its status as an exceedingly rare

form of cancer, there is no standard treatment available and meager

funding for lifesaving research.
This rare cancer is extraordinarily difficult to treat and often does

not respond to chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
Because there is

no standard, effective treatment for EHE, many patients must resort to

organ transplants and undergo a vascular embolization, where doctors

block the artery supplying blood to the tumor.
One of my constituents recently lost his beloved cousin, Brianna Rae

Carney, to this terrible disease.
To honor her courageous, selfless

spirit, he wrote me to encourage this body to raise awareness of EHE

and invest in robust medical research

Mr. Speaker, as a cancer survivor who owes my life to the excellent

and effective medical treatment that I was fortunate enough to receive,

I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting increased federal

support for finding more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for

this terrible disease.
