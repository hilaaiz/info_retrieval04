CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF DEERFIELD BEACH

HON.
JARED MOSKOWITZ

Mr. MOSKOWITZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly special

milestone for my district: 100 years since the incorporation of

Deerfield Beach, Florida.
What started in June 1925 as a town of just 500 people has boomed

into a vibrant city and one of the best places to live in South

Florida.
Deerfield Beach is special not just because of its natural

beauty, but also because of the people who have built this city up for

the past century and make it what it is today.
I'm proud to represent parts of Deerfield Beach, and I'm fortunate to

work with Mayor Todd Drosky and its local commissioners to deliver the

federal resources this city needs to support its infrastructure, boost

its economic development, and keep families here safe.
It is truly an

incredible place to call home.
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in wishing a

happy 100th birthday to the City of Deerfield Beach.
I look forward to

what this next century brings for this community and its residents.

Mr. BERGMAN.

During his tenure with

Congressman Upton, Ratner's leadership as Legislative Director and

Deputy Chief of Staff was instrumental in advancing critical

legislative priorities, particularly in the field of healthcare, where

his expertise and dedication helped shape policies that improved the

lives of countless Americans.
Ratner further distinguished himself by bringing his wealth of

experience and steady hand to the office of Wisconsin Congressman Bryan

Steil, where he served as Chief of Staff.
His contributions extended

beyond Michigan and Wisconsin, including his service with Louisiana

Senator Bill Cassidy, reflecting a career dedicated to principled

governance.
Throughout his decades of service, Ratner has been known for his

tireless work ethic, his keen understanding of complex policy matters,

and his unwavering integrity.
His efforts, especially in healthcare

policy, have left an indelible impact on the legislative process and

have helped ensure that the voices of his constituents were heard and

represented with honor and diligence.
As Ratner concludes his exceptional career in the U.S. House of

Representatives, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for his many years

of faithful service.
His dedication has set a standard of excellence in

public service, and his contributions will continue to benefit the

American people for years to come.
We wish Ratner all the best in his future endeavors and thank him for

his extraordinary commitment to our country.
