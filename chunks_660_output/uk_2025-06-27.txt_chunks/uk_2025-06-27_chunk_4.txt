He mobilized coalitions across political spectrums, religions,

and cultural backgrounds to come together to win this historic, long

overdue vote.
As the longest-serving leader of the First Institutional Baptist

Church, Pastor Stewart has traveled extensively, preaching in 39 states

and territories and 60 countries, and has received many accolades for

his contributions to our community and beyond.
Following the teachings

of the Gospel, his work always focused on the poorest and neediest:

immigrants, unsheltered people and veterans, and those suffering from

mental health issues.
Pastor Stewart and the Church turned Christian values into action.
FIBCO Family Services, Samaritan House for Homeless Families, Ujima

House for Unwed Teenage Mothers and their Infants, and the Broadway

House, all created under Pastor Stewart, minister to those most in need

of compassion and care.
FIBCO has become a hallmark in Phoenix's

nonprofit scene and has even taken their mission abroad, expanding

across Africa.
Pastor Stewart's impressive academic and public service record led to

roles as Chair of the National Immigration Forum and President of

American Baptist Churches of the Pacific Southwest.
He was proclaimed a

``State History Maker'' by the Arizona Historical Society.
Under

unanimous direction of the Phoenix City Council, the street in front of

the First Institutional Baptist Church was renamed ``Dr. Warren H.

Stewart Way''.
Today, all of Arizona congratulates our very own ``living legend'' on

his well-deserved retirement.
Pastor Stewart's career and contributions

have cemented him as one of Arizona's greatest religious leaders.
I have personally been blessed to know him as a friend and trusted

advisor.
He'll be the first to tell you he couldn't have enjoyed such a

long career without the love and support of his wife, Reverend Dr.

Karen Stewart, and their children and grandchildren.
We thank the

entire Stewart family for sharing him with us.
I thank Pastor Stewart for his decades of service to our community,

and may your quest for moral justice continue in your next chapter.
Godspeed.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF SENATOR DAVID L. JORDAN UPON HIS

RETIREMENT FROM PUBLIC SERVICE TO THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great

pride and deep respect to honor the life and remarkable public service

of Mississippi State Senator David L. Jordan--a man whose journey from

the cotton fields of Leflore County to the Mississippi State Capitol is

not just inspiring--it's the story of Mississippi, and of America at

its best.
Senator Jordan was born in rural Leflore County Mississippi, the

youngest of five children in a sharecropping family.
He began working

in the cotton fields as soon as he was big enough to carry a sack.
Like

so many children in that era, he missed a lot of school during harvest

season.
But even then, young David knew education was the key to

something more.
And he never stopped pushing toward it.
He worked nights washing dishes at a Holiday Inn while putting

himself through Mississippi Valley State University and later earned a

master's degree in chemistry from the University of Wyoming.
That kind

of grit--working all night, studying all day--is something we don't

talk about enough in politics.
But that's the kind of man Senator

Jordan is.
He began his professional life as a science teacher, but his heart

was always with the community.
In 1985, he made history as the first

African American elected to the Greenwood City Council, where he served

with quiet strength and fierce dedication for 36 years.
He became a

trusted leader, someone people turned to for guidance and fairness, no

matter the issue.
In 1993, he was elected to the Mississippi State Senate, representing

District 24.
