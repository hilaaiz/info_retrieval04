The Soldiers,

Airmen, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled here on

September 17, 2025, answered our Nation's call to service during one of

its greatest times of need.
From the Pacific Asian Theatre to the

Korean Theater, these brave Americans risked life and limb, gave

service, and sacrificed much, all while embodying what it is to be a

hero.
We owe them more gratitude than can ever be expressed,,

I welcome these brave veterans to Washington and to their memorials.
I am proud to include in the Record  the names of these men and women

for all to see, hear, and recognize, and I call on my colleagues to

rise and join me in expressing gratitude.

HON.
DONALD S. BEYER, JR.
Mr. BEYER.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and include in the

Record, three prominent community members in the Nepali American

community who have contributed to cultivating arts, culture, and

business around the country.
Navin KC

For more than twenty-five years, Navin KC has been a tireless force

in the world of dance and choreography, introducing Nepali language,

art, and culture to audiences both nationally and internationally.
As

the Founder and Director of KC Dance Center in Virginia, he has

provided countless students, particularly second-generation children,

with dance training that emphasizes not only technique but also

cultural heritage and language.
His choreography has been featured in

films, theater productions, and music videos, while his students have

performed across the United States in places such as Hollywood, New

York, Texas, and Colorado.
