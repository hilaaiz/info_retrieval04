RECOGNIZING THE GREATER HERNANDO COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the

Greater Hernando County Chamber of Commerce on the occasion of its

100th anniversary--a remarkable milestone that reflects a century of

steadfast service, economic leadership, and community commitment.
Chambers of commerce are foundational institutIons within our

communities.
They promote economic vitality, advocate for local

businesses, and offer critical resources such as training, marketing,

and networking.
The Greater Hernando County Chamber of Commerce

embodies these principles and has served as a vital engine of

prosperity for generations.
The Chamber traces its origins to 1925, when local leaders first

organized a community chamber under the guidance of Frederick

Williamson, its inaugural president.
Despite the challenges of the

Great Depression, the Chamber persevered and experienced a revival in

1938, led by visionary banker Alfred McKethan--a pivotal figure in

Hernando County's economic history.
As the county grew rapidly in the

latter half of the 20th century, particularly with the development of

new communities like Spring Hill, the business landscape became

increasingly diverse and fragmented.
In a decisive moment of unity and

forward-thinking, leaders Morris Porton, Steve Emerson, and Vince Vanni

worked to consolidate the business community.
Their efforts culminated

in the formal establishment of the Greater Hernando County Chamber of

Commerce on December 22, 1992.
Over the past 100 years, the Chamber has evolved and expanded to meet

the changing needs of Hernando County's business community.
Guided by

its Pillars of Success--Advocacy, Marketing, Networking, and Training--

the Chamber has become the largest and oldest business organization in

Hernando County.
