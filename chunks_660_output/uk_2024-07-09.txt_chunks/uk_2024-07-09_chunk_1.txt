CELEBRATING MOUNTAIN LAKE FIRE COMPANY AND LADIES AUXILIARY'S 75TH

ANNIVERSARY

HON.
THOMAS H. KEAN, JR.
Mr. KEAN of New Jersey.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the

Mountain Lake Fire Company and Ladies Auxiliary on their 75-year

anniversary.
A team of 25 volunteers including firefighters, Emergency

Medical Technicians (EMTs), and first responders, the Mountain Lake

Fire Company has generously supported the communities of both Liberty

and White Townships during any and all kinds of emergencies.
The

Company was founded in 1949 with a single small fire truck, and over

the past 75 years the Company has grown into a pillar of the community,

from bringing townspeople together for their annual car show to

educating children on fire safety.
Reflecting on their dedicated

service, it is no surprise that the Mountain Lake Fire Company and

Ladies Auxiliary is still thriving after 75 years.
As a former

volunteer firefighter myself, I am honored to have such dedicated first

responders and community members in the 7th Congressional District, and

I look forward to seeing them continue to flourish in years to come.

HON.
RAUL RUIZ

Mr. RUIZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the

dedication and hard work of an outstanding employee, Stella Jimenez, as

I bid her farewell as she moves on to the next step of her career.
Stella Jimenez brought a wealth of experience and an unwavering

commitment to community service.
Stella's journey was characterized by her unwavering dedication to

enact positive change.
In her capacity as District Director, Stella assumed a pivotal role

in leading diverse initiatives aimed at enhancing the well-being of

residents in Imperial and Riverside Counties.
Stella demonstrated a profound understanding of the community's needs

and challenges.
Her leadership, characterized by a unique combination

of grace and effectiveness, garnered admiration and respect from

colleagues and constituents alike.
Stella's dedication to community engagement was unparalleled.
Whether

it was championing the proposed Chuckwalla National Monument or

ensuring full stakeholder engagement in Imperial County, she approached

each initiative with unwavering determination and a genuine desire to

make a difference.
Stella's influence extended to coordinating high-profile events, such

as the Department of Homeland Security's visit to present the

Outstanding Citizen by Choice Initiative Award by Secretary Alejandro

Mayorkas.
Under her guidance, these events not only achieved success but also

carried a deeply personal touch, reflecting Stella's commitment to

meaningful engagement and connection.
Collaborating closely with the staff of White House Senior Advisor

Mitch Landrieu, Stella facilitated impactful visits to various sites.
Through her efforts, she fostered community dialogue and left a

lasting impact, further solidifying her reputation as a dedicated and

effective advocate for change.
Stella's colleagues referred to her as someone who was always

reachable, willing to advocate for them, and someone who went above and

beyond to go across the aisle and work with local and state partners to

help a constituent in need.
She empowered others to navigate challenges with newfound assurance

and strength.
The impact of Stella's mentorship on many is immeasurable.
Her

guidance not only shaped others' professional trajectories but left an

indelible mark on their personal development as well.
I am profoundly grateful for the privilege of working with Stella

Jimenez.
Through her tireless efforts and unwavering passion, Stella Jimenez

stood as a beacon of inspiration, leaving an enduring and profound

impact on the communities she served.
Her legacy continues to inspire

others to strive for positive change and to make a difference in the

world around them.
I look forward to seeing what Stella Jimenez does next and know that

she will continue to inspire those around her.
