Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a

trailblazer in the realm of education and civil rights, John L. Barnes.
A native of Charleston, MS, John grew up about 10 miles north of

Charleston and attended Sherman Creek Elementary School.
He was also

the valedictorian of his 1964 graduating class at Allen-Carver High

School.
He courageously shattered racial barriers while pursuing his

education at Mississippi State University (MSU).
During his time at

MSU, John encountered significant challenges due to racial prejudice

and discrimination.
As one of the first African American students at

the university, he faced hostility, exclusion, and limited

opportunities.
Despite these obstacles, John persevered, contributing

to the gradual transformation of MSU's campus climate.
His courage and

resilience paved the way for future generations of students seeking

equal access to education.
His enrollment at MSU in 1965 marked a significant milestone, as he

became the first African American student to graduate from the

university, June 2, 1968.
He received a Bachelor of Arts from the MSU

College of Arts and Sciences.
His brother, Aaron was the third African

American to graduate from MSU.
After graduating from MSU, he briefly

taught at Allen-Carver School before embarking on his corporate career

in New York City.
His achievements as the first African American

graduate from MSU and his subsequent professional path demonstrate

resilience and determination.
While specific achievements beyond this groundbreaking moment may not

be widely documented, John's legacy remains an inspiration for those

who continue to fight for educational equity and social justice.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing John L.

Barnes for his dedication to advocacy in education, civil rights, his

courage and perseverance.
