RECOGNIZING DR.
STEPHEN PAPPAS

HON.
GUS M. BILIRAKIS

Mr. BILIRAKIS.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor the

life and legacy of Dr. Stephen Pappas.
A lifelong Washingtonian,

Stephen was born in 1930 to the late Steve and Georgia Pappas and was a

proud graduate of Western High followed by his ophthalmology residency

at Episcopal Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital.
In 1961, Dr. Pappas

completed his clinical fellowship in the retina service at Harvard's

teaching hospital, Massachusetts Eye & Ear Infirmary, in Boston.
He

returned to Washington as the first formally fellowship-trained retina

specialist in the region.
A deeply patriotic American, Dr. Pappas was

honored to serve as Chief of Ophthalmology at the Naval Dispensary in

Washington, D.C. from 1961 to 1963, rising to the rank of Lieutenant

Commander.
He later served as a civilian consultant at the National

Naval Medical Center in Bethesda from 1968 to 1976.
In 1963, he founded

his solo ophthalmology practice, providing compassionate, state-of-the-

art care.
In 1978, he moved his growing practice, Retina Consultants,

from the District to Bethesda.
