Mr. Speaker, hunger and food insecurity are issues that plague many nations around the world.
Luckily, within the district that I represent, there is an international organization working to alleviate this concern by working with farmers around the world to improve agricultural practices and teaching about advancements in fertilizer technology.
Founded in October 1974, the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC) was created to fill a gap found in the inability to field international calls for assistance by the Tennessee Valley Authority's National Fertilizer Development Center.
After just shy of three years in operation, the IFDC was designated a public international organization in March 1977.
On this 50th anniversary, the staff that makes up the IFDC are working just as hard as they were on day one to make sure people around the world do not just have access to food, but have the knowledge needed to grow this food so that they can create a sustainable agricultural process that will feed generations.
The IFDC is headquartered in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and currently operates in over 25 countries.
President and CEO Henk van Duijn, along with the rest of the International Fertilizer Development Center's Global Management Team, Dr. Oumou Camara, Chris Holt, Douglas Kerr, and Dr. Upendra Singh, make up an outstanding team that delivers needed expertise to countries around the world.
I want to thank each and everyone at the International Fertilizer Development Center for their 50 years of service to the international community.
They have provided a way for people across the world to grow food and feed their communities.
Congratulations to them on their incredible achievements and for representing the very best of the United States by making significant contributions to the international community.
I look forward to continued great work and the success of everyone at IFDC. ____________________
