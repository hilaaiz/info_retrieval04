Dr. Zufall dedicated his life to serving others and leaves an incredible legacy in New Jersey's Eleventh Congressional District and beyond.
Dr. Zufall was born in Middleton, New York and raised in Irvington, New Jersey.
He graduated from Princeton University and served our country in the Navy during World War II before continuing his education at Harvard Medical School.
From his leadership in the military as U.S. Army First Lieutenant and Captain in the medical corps, to his service as a physician at Bellevue Hospital and Dover General Hospital, Dr. Zufall dedicated his life to caring for others.
Dr. Zufall's most well-known achievement is the creation of Zufall Health, a Federally Qualified Health Center serving communities across Northern New Jersey.
After several medical service trips to Peru, he and his wife Kay committed themselves to providing healthcare to those in need closer to home.
Initially a once-a-week, one-room clinic, Zufall has since expanded to seven counties and two mobile sites that serve 48,000 New Jerseyians annually.
The clinic has received many accolades, including the Jefferson Award given to Dr. Zufall and Kay in 2009.
Dr. Zufall, known lovingly by many as ``Dr. Bob,'' worked tirelessly to make sure that all New Jersey residents regardless of means have affordable access to healthcare.
Dr. Zufall deeply cherished his family and enjoyed spending time with his wife Kay, children Kathryn, Margaret, Ellen, Nancy, and David, his three siblings, nine grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren.
On March 5, 2024, Dr. Robert Zufall peacefully passed away at the age of 99.
The selfless manner in which Dr. Zufall served his community is an inspiration to us all.
He will not be forgotten and his impact will continue to be felt in New Jersey for generations to come. ____________________
