Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Food Shed Co-op family on their achievement in organizing and establishing a community-owned grocery store.
The concept of establishing a cooperative emerged from discussions among a group of friends seeking to strengthen their community.
They collectively decided to create a community-owned store in McHenry County, embarking on an unpredictable and awe-inspiring journey.
Their dedication to bringing this dream to fruition is truly commendable.
Food Shed Co-op is more than a simple grocery store, it is a symbol of the determination of the community.
It is committed to providing everyone with access to fresh, locally sourced, and sustainably produced food.
With a mission to support local farmers and producers, reduce environmental impact, and foster a sense of community, Food Shed Co-op is a shining example of what can be achieved when like-minded individuals come together for a common cause.
Nearly 2,100 people purchased equity shares in the co-op, reflecting the strong support of the community during the project's development and grand launch.
This steady belief in Food Shed Co-op's mission speaks volumes about the community's commitment to building a vibrant, neighborhood-focused supermarket that is accessible to everyone.
I am proud to represent such an innovative group of individuals who continually strive to uplift their community and applaud the vital work they are doing to create a healthier and more sustainable future in McHenry County.
I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Food Shed Co-op in celebrating their grand opening. ____________________
COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPPORTUNITY CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-19 Volume: 170, Issue: 69 Pages: E374 - E374 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OPPORTUNITY CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS ______ of texas in the house of representatives Ms. ESCOBAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Opportunity Center for the Homeless.
Since its inception on January 3rd, 1994, the Opportunity Center has been a steadfast refuge for homeless adults, originally focusing on men but expanding to accommodate the increasing number of women seeking shelter.
Through this evolution, it has established permanent and transitional housing options to offer stability and hope to those in need.
Central to the Center's philosophy is the principle of recovery to service.
It proudly stands as the largest employer of homeless individuals in the El Paso community, with close to 60 percent of its staff having lived experience with homelessness.
This practice not only provides employment but also fosters a sense of purpose, self-worth, empathy, and dignity among its employees.
In a landmark achievement in October 2011, the Opportunity Center became the first homeless shelter in the United States to receive excess food from schools, thanks to Congressional clarification on food donation regulations.
This initiative has since provided over 1.2 million meals in 2023 alone, nourishing those in need and exemplifying the Center's commitment to holistic support.
Founded by Ray Tullius, a U.S. Army veteran and Golden Nugget award recipient, the Center is dedicated to aiding veterans facing homelessness and has assisted countless individuals.
By fostering collaboration among stakeholders, such as service providers, educational institutions, and local governments, the Opportunity Center ensures high-quality care and compassion for those experiencing homelessness.
Today, it is my privilege to honor the Opportunity Center for its 30- year legacy of service, resilience, and compassion.
May it continue to make a profound impact on the lives of our community for many years to come. ____________________
