Aiden was caring and always put others ahead of himself.
According to his baseball coach, Rodney McNealy, Aiden has been a part of the league since Tee-ball and made a name for himself in the Majors Division of the Adelanto Little League, where he played for the Rockies last spring.
Aiden was a true sportsman whose passion for baseball and life was contagious.
While Aiden's life was tragically cut short, he made a tremendous impact on every life he touched.
Aiden is survived by his mother Allyssa, his stepfather, Alex, and his two siblings.
He will be deeply missed by all who knew him.
My thoughts and prayers are with Aiden's family as they navigate this difficult loss.
I ask my colleagues to join me in mourning Aiden's passing and celebrating his life. ____________________

Date: 2023-10-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 166 Pages: E953 - E954 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E953-E954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ALMOND ROCA'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of washington in the house of representatives Mr. KILMER.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I would like to take a moment to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brown & Haley's invention of their flagship candy, Almond Roca, on October 10, 2023.
My district is home to vibrant towns and thriving small businesses-- but none so sweet as Brown & Haley, a confectionary company founded by two friends, Harry Brown and JC Haley, in 1912 in the City of Tacoma, Washington.
In 1923, they invented their signature candy: the Almond Roca, an iconic, log-shaped crunchy toffee covered in chocolate and crushed almonds.
Almond Roca traveled with our troops in World War II, was carried by Sir Edmund Hilary during his Everest expeditions, and today is sold in over 60 countries.
One hundred years later, Brown & Haley produces Almond Roca using the same recipe, the same ingredients, and even in the same plant in Tacoma--a converted shoe factory purchased in 1919.
Brown & Haley remains a family business with over 200 employees and today produces over three million pieces of Almond Roca.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I am thrilled to acknowledge Brown & Haley's enduring legacy in Tacoma and the 100 years of joy that Almond Roca has brought not just to our neck of the woods, but across the world. ____________________
