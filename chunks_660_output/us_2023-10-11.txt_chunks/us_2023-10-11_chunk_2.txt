Multi-talented and multi-faceted, Coach Smith also served as Albany State baseball coach from 1981 to 1983, compiling a record of 46-37-1.
Overall, during his career in coaching, he compiled an impressive record of 157-90-4; he made 5 NCAA D-II Playoff appearances and led Albany State to 9 SIAC Championships.
He was inducted in the Albany State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SIAC Hall of Fame in 2014.
Coach Smith's impact was felt well beyond the athletic field.
He was more than just a coach.
He helped shape the character of generations of young men and women at Albany State and helped shape the character of his community through his active civic engagement in local, state and national politics.
He strongly encouraged people to exercise their duty to vote in every election.
Coach Smith accomplished much in his life but none of it would have been possible without the grace of God and love and support of his late wife, Charlene Johnson Smith.
This union lasted for 60 years until Charlene's passing in April of 2022.
On a personal note, Coach Smith was my friend and supporter for 30 years.
For his loyalty, support and wise counsel, I

will be forever grateful.
Coach Hamp Smith was a Hall of Fame Coach and a Hall of Fame human being.
To God be the Glory for his extraordinary life and legacy.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second Congressional District in paying tribute to Coach Hampton Smith and in extending our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and all who mourn his loss.
Moreover, we pray that we will all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead. ____________________
