Tiffany's firm belief in doing what was right was exemplified in frequent spirited debates with her siblings.
Her devotion to the Church placed morals at the forefront of her person.
Baptized at a young age at the first Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church, Tiffany, along with her mother and siblings, later became founding members of Free Spirit Missionary Baptist Church under Reverend Boyd and Careathers.
An active member of the Free Spirit Missionary Baptist Church until her passing, Tiffany exemplified a lifelong commitment to church service.
Tiffany, through her determined and wise personality, held herself and others to high moral standards.
As her favorite saying was ``What would Jesus do'', she found herself working for Aspire of Western New York and People Incorporated, two non-profit organizations dedicated to helping those with developmental disabilities lead lives integrated in the general community.
Tiffany joined Aspire in 2006 during a time of expansion, with the organization seeking to represent her own life's goals: to care for those who need it.
As a Buffalo native, she cared for her community through her work in the social work field.
She passed shortly after her advance to management in 2021.
Tiffany is survived by a large family.
including her new granddaughter whom she affectionately called ``P,'' ``CinnaBun,'' and ``Honey Bun.''
I invite all present to join me in recognizing Tiffany, who was devoted as ever to family, morality, and care until the end. ____________________
RECOGNIZING TURKISH REPUBLIC DAY AND THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKIYE; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
166



Date: 2023-10-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 166 Pages: E953 - E953 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING TURKISH REPUBLIC DAY AND THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKIYE ______ HON.
BILL PASCRELL, JR.
of new jersey in the house of representatives Mr. PASCRELL.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, the people of Turkiye and Turkish Americans celebrate Turkish Republic Day every year on October 29th.
This important date commemorates when Turkiye in 1923 became a republic thanks to the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
This October 29th is a special celebration because it marks 100th Anniversary of the Republic of Turkiye.
While Anatolia, the home of the Republic of Turkiye, has been a cradle of civilizations for millennia, Turkiye has transformed from its ancient history to the modern skylines of Ankara.
The progress the Turkish people have made over the past century is a testament to their resilience, determination, and spirit.
The Republic of Turkiye has historically been a strong and reliable ally of the United States thanks to its founding principles of democracy, secularism, and equality.
Turkiye boasts the second largest military in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and is allied with the United States on key issues of counterterrorism, energy diversification, securing the global supply chains, and drug and human trafficking prevention.
I am proud to recognize the rich tapestry of Turkish-American contributions to the United States.
Turkish-Americans have made important strides in several fields, including academia, business, medicine, arts, and culture.
Turkish-Americans have enriched our society with their traditions, cuisine, and heritage.
These contributions are especially ever present in New Jersey's Ninth Congressional district, with the largest Turkish immigrant community in the United States centered around the thriving Little Istanbul in South Paterson.
The Turkish-American community is an important bridge to strengthen the understanding and friendship between our two nations.
As I reflect on Turkiye's 100th Republic Day, I hope everyone will celebrate the shared values and interests that bind our nations.
I congratulate, Turkiye, on their centenary, and I thank them, Turkish-Americans, for their enduring contributions to the United States. ____________________
