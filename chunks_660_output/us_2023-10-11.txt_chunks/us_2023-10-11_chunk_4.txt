Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize the contributions of Janet Scoll Johnson as she is honored as one of California's 8th Congressional District's Women of the Year.
Janet is an active and determined community advocate for environmental justice.
She has served in many roles as part of her advocacy and community service.

Janet also served for four years as the co-chair of the Richmond ShorelineAlliance.

Thanks to Janet's successful advocacy, a land-use ordinance to phase out a coal and petroleum coke handling and storage at a private terminal in the Port of Richmond was passed.

Date: 2023-10-11 Volume: 169, Issue: 166 Pages: E954 - E954 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PAYING REMEMBRANCE TO AIDEN ORTIZ ON THE OCCASION OF HIS PASSING ______ of california in the house of representatives Mr. OBERNOLTE.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is with a heavy heart I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Aiden Ortiz, who was tragically struck and killed by a vehicle at age twelve on September 25, 2023.
His family, friends, and community are devastated by this sudden loss.
A sixth grader at Melva Davis Academy of Excellence.
Aiden Ortiz was known as a selfless, caring son and friend to all who had the privilege of knowing him.
As a father of two myself, it is nearly impossible to imagine losing one's child.
I treasure every moment with my sons, and losing a child so suddenly is every parent's greatest fear.
Aiden was caring and always put others ahead of himself.
According to his baseball coach, Rodney McNealy, Aiden has been a part of the league since Tee-ball and made a name for himself in the Majors Division of the Adelanto Little League, where he played for the Rockies last spring.
Aiden was a true sportsman whose passion for baseball and life was contagious.
