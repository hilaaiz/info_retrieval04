Early day camp meetings were held each August in the valley below, an area that served as a campground for meetings at the Chinn Chapel Campground.
The road beside it was part of the main road from Southern Denton County to the County seat and was called Chinn's Chapel Road.
The area became well known in Denton County as the Chinn's Chapel Community, still recognized today with The Chinn's Chapel Log Cabin still standing in the Chinn's Chapel Cemetery on what is now known as Chinn Chapel Road.
The legacy of Martha ``Patsey'' is still evident today in the familiar Southern Denton landmarks that bear the names of her son and the efforts of her daughter-in-law and the Chinn family with whom they shared the values of the pioneer farming families: a love of family, God, and country; a spirit of community cooperation; practical problem solving with a know-how that comes from living on the land; and a respect for the richness and beauty of the rural Texas landscape.
On behalf of the 26th Congressional District of Texas, I honor Martha ``Patsey'' Brockett Wakefield and her spirit, exemplifying the fortitude and gratitude that are the foundations of Southern Denton County.
Her descendants have left their imprint on this community for the over one million residents of this County they established, and I recognize their important role in establishing their rich history and the North Texas quality of life we are grateful to share. ____________________
HONORING SAMMY McDOWELL; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-30 Volume: 170, Issue: 74 Pages: E410 - E410 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SAMMY McDOWELL ______ of minnesota in the house of representatives Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Sammy McDowell, who was a community leader, restaurateur, and friend to all.
Sammy grew up in Minneapolis and was a fixture in the community throughout his life.
He worked in food service for many years before starting his own catering service and restaurant.
His flagship restaurant, Sammy's Avenue Eatery opened in 2012 on West Broadway Avenue in North Minneapolis.
Not only has Sammy's served delicious food for over a decade, it has also become an important gathering place for the community.
He had recently expanded and began operating a Sammy's Avenue Eatery pop-up in Saint Paul, in a space which features Black- owned businesses.
Even as a business owner, Sammy never compromised his generosity towards others and always went the extra mile to check on the wellbeing of his friends, as well as his customers.
Sammy's passion for his community was contagious, and I know that the spaces he created will continue to be sources of friendship, inspiration, and comfort.
Sammy was also a well known devoted member of Shiloh Temple and sang in the choir there for many years.
He was worshiping among loved ones at Shiloh just before his death.
He had a hand in many things throughout the community, and was always a familiar face at events around the city.
This past week, a balloon release was held in several U.S. cities to celebrate Sammy's life.
These nationwide celebrations are a testament to Sammy's admirable ability to make an impression on those around him.
His company will be dearly missed by those who had the privilege to know him.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the incredibly full life of Sammy McDowell and recognizing his accomplishments in entrepreneurship and community-building, and his immeasurable impact on the people and city of Minneapolis. ____________________
