Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution and their effort to commemorate the men and women who achieved American independence, realizing that those Patriots believed in the noble cause of liberty and served valiantly to found a new nation.
More directly, I would like to acknowledge cooperative spirit of the Flower Mound, Benjamin Lyon, Cross Timbers, Captain Molly Corbin, Peters Colony, and Shawnee Trail Chapters of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution who have united to promote America's upcoming 250th birthday and endeavor to convey its relevance to our society.
This cooperative spirit honors the tradition begun by the pioneers who settled the southern community of Denton County, now known as Copper Canyon.
On Saturday, April 27, 2024, the Flower Mound Chapter met to hold an official grave marking and dedication honoring Martha ``Patsey'' Brockett Wakefield (1797-1873), one of Denton County's early matriarchs, with an official grave marking and dedication at Chinn's Chapel Cemetery in Copper Canyon, Denton County, Texas.
As the youngest daughter of Revolutionary War Patriot William Ebenezer Brockett, born in 1797, Martha Brockett married Henry Wakefield, Jr. in January of 1817.
Henry Wakefield, Jr. was the son of Revolutionary War Patriot Henry Wakefield, himself the offspring of Revolutionary War Patriot Charles Wakefield.
In 1853 Henry Wakefield, Jr. and his wife, Martha ``Patsey'' Brockett Wakefield, moved with their large family to 320 acres of land Henry purchased for $320 in Denton County, Texas.
In 1859, Silas Wakefield and his brother Simpson Burke Wakefield, two of Henry and Martha ``Patsey's'' 11 children, and among 9 who survived into adulthood, each purchased adjoining land grants of 160 acres nearby.
Located on land purchased by Simpson, the Denton County Town of Waketon was named after the family.
Simpson's wife, Jane, with two other women, and Mary Stowe Chinn, founded Chinn's Chapel Methodist Church, believed to be the oldest church and school in Denton County.
Originally named Antioch, the chapel was built from donated logs provided by settlers visiting the nearby Lockhart Spring.
In 1858 the community came together and assembled the logs into the cabin structure that served as a church, school and as a temporary shelter for new settlers as they built their own homes.
As settlers died from various causes, the settlers were frequently buried near the log cabin chapel.
When Simpson and Jane Wakefield died a month a part in 1861, they were among the early burials in the Chinn's Chapel Cemetery.
The Christians worshipping in the log cabin were offered the service of a Methodist circuit rider preacher who would arrive regularly about once every three months.
They sought membership in the Texas Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and were admitted in 1872.
They

renamed the log cabin ``Chinn's Chapel Methodist Church'' in honor of the Chinn Family.
Early day camp meetings were held each August in the valley below, an area that served as a campground for meetings at the Chinn Chapel Campground.
The road beside it was part of the main road from Southern Denton County to the County seat and was called Chinn's Chapel Road.
The area became well known in Denton County as the Chinn's Chapel Community, still recognized today with The Chinn's Chapel Log Cabin still standing in the Chinn's Chapel Cemetery on what is now known as Chinn Chapel Road.
