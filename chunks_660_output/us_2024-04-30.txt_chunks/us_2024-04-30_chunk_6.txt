Coordinating with each member union, engaging with leadership as well as rank and file, while also providing guidance and advocacy to Congressional Members and staff, Bill has built a distinguished reputation with all those who have had the opportunity to

work with him.
I, like many others, am so grateful to have benefited from his expertise and counsel.
I thank him for that as well as his many years of friendship and support.
In a professional career that has spanned more than six decades, Bill Samuel has left an indelible mark on the labor movement in America.
Many of those whose lives have been improved by his work will never meet or know Bill.
Throughout his career he has been a champion for working Americans, standing up time and time again to protect their rights to safe working conditions, fair and livable wages, as well as secure health and retirement benefits.
Today, as he marks his retirement, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and deepest thanks to Bill for his outstanding service.
My very best wishes to him, his wife, Tracy; and his children Jack and Lucy, for many more years of health and happiness as he begins this new life chapter. ____________________
