Karl served a total of seventeen years as the Girls Varsity Head Coach, while also coaching the varsity boys' team for four years and acting as the skipper for the boys' junior high team for an additional seven years.
Karl followed in the footsteps of his father, Elmer Kreiser, the Columbia Boys Basketball Coaching legend who established the program's legacy across the Commonwealth.
Respected on and off the court, Karl's coaching was defined by his mentorship.
The focal point of his leadership was ensuring his players knew the importance of giving back to the people in the community.

Over his nearly three decades of coaching, Karl won 431 games.
In his last four seasons with the Girls Varsity Team, Columbia won three section crowns, a league title, while making it to four district championships, and three state playoffs.
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Coach Karl Kreiser on a remarkable career and wish him well as he begins his well-deserved retirement. ____________________

Date: 2024-04-17 Volume: 170, Issue: 67 Pages: E365 - E365 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE 120TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TENNYSON CENTER FOR CHILDREN _____ HON.
DIANA DeGETTE of colorado in the house of representatives Ms. DeGETTE.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 120th anniversary of the Tennyson Center for Children in Denver, Colorado.
Established in 1904, Tennyson Center for Children has been committed to serving Colorado's most neglected and abused children.
Their high-quality programs have changed lives and led to successful outcomes for many of those who use their services.
Supporting at-risk youth and keeping families together helps to secure bright futures for children and puts them on a path to success, and Tennyson has worked to support families across Colorado.
Ninety-one percent of the children who rely on Tennyson services have experienced trauma, neglect, or abuse.
To address the complex needs of this population, Tennyson offers a breadth of services, including child and family therapy, parenting support, behavior management, education support, and childcare.
Thanks to these services, 98 percent of families who sought assistance at Tennyson stayed together.
In 2023, I worked with Tennyson to secure federal funding to assist in the construction of the mental health residential treatment center.
This center focuses on the urgent and unmet mental health needs of vulnerable, low-income children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
The new center will help Tennyson better serve vulnerable youth in our communities by increasing access to essential mental health treatment.
I look forward to our continued partnership to ensure Tennyson can continue to provide life-changing care to those most at risk of abuse and trauma.
One hundred and twenty-nine years of service to Colorado is a tremendous accomplishment, and I congratulate the entire staff at Tennyson on achieving this milestone.
Tennyson Center for Children is a fixture of our community, and I am honored to recognize its 120th anniversary. ____________________
