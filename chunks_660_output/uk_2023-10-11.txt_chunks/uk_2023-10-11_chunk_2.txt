Sadly,

Coach Smith passed away on Monday, October 2, 2023.
A homegoing service

to celebrate his remarkable life was held on Saturday, October 7, 2023,

at the Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia.
The genesis of the life of Coach Hampton Smith began on October 1,

1934, in Greenwood, Mississippi where he was born to the union of the

late Richard Smith and Fannie Hampton Smith.
A product of the Leflore

County, Mississippi school system, he graduated from Threadgill High

School and went on to earn a Bachelor's degree from Mississippi Valley

Vocational College (Now Mississippi Valley State University) in 1957.
From 1957 to 1959, Coach served honorably in the United States Army.
Coach Smith began his legendary coaching career in 1959 as an

assistant coach at Mississippi Valley Vocational College.
He then

coached at McComb High School and J.E. Johnson High School before

serving as assistant football coach at Tennessee Agricultural and

Industrial College during 1969 and 1970 while earning his Master's

degree.
Coach Smith then began the first of two legendary stints at

Albany State College in 1971 through 1976, went back to Mississippi

Valley for 1977 to 1978, only to return to Albany State as an assistant

coach from 1980 to 1981.
He then became head coach for the Albany State

Golden Rams from 1982 to 1999.
Multi-talented and multi-faceted, Coach

Smith also

served as Albany State baseball coach from 1981 to 1983, compiling a

record of 46-37-1.
Overall, during his career in coaching, he compiled an impressive

record of 157-90-4; he made 5 NCAA D-II Playoff appearances and led

Albany State to 9 SIAC Championships.
He was inducted in the Albany

State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SIAC Hall of

Fame in 2014.
Coach Smith's impact was felt well beyond the athletic field.
He was

more than just a coach.
He helped shape the character of generations of

young men and women at Albany State and helped shape the character of

his community through his active civic engagement in local, state and

national politics.
He strongly encouraged people to exercise their duty

to vote in every election.
Coach Smith accomplished much in his life but none of it would have

been possible without the grace of God and love and support of his late

wife, Charlene Johnson Smith.
This union lasted for 60 years until

Charlene's passing in April of 2022.
On a personal note, Coach Smith was my friend and supporter for 30

years.
For his loyalty, support and wise counsel, I will be forever

grateful.
Coach Hamp Smith was a Hall of Fame Coach and a Hall of Fame human

being.
To God be the Glory for his extraordinary life and legacy.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask my colleagues to join my wife, Vivian

and me, along with the more than 765,000 people of Georgia's Second

Congressional District in paying tribute to Coach Hampton Smith and in

extending our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and all who

mourn his loss.
Moreover, we pray that we will all be consoled and

comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks,

and months ahead.
