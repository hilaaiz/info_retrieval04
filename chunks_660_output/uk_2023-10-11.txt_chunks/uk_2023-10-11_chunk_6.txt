RECOGNIZING TIFFANY LYNN CAVER-PUGH

HON.
BRIAN HIGGINS

Mr. HIGGINS of New York.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to

recognize Tiffany Lynn Caver-Pugh, a loving mother and grandmother who

passed away in her horne on August 25, 2023.
Tiffany was a character of

devotion to kindness and spirituality.
Born in Buffalo on March 11, 1978.
Tiffany called herself a Buffalo

native.
As the youngest of four siblings.
Tiffany's firm belief in

doing what was right was exemplified in frequent spirited debates with

her siblings.
Her devotion to the Church placed morals at the forefront

of her person.
Baptized at a young age at the first Shiloh Missionary

Baptist Church, Tiffany, along with her mother and siblings, later

became founding members of Free Spirit Missionary Baptist Church under

Reverend Boyd and Careathers.
An active member of the Free Spirit

Missionary Baptist Church until her passing, Tiffany exemplified a

lifelong commitment to church service.
Tiffany, through her determined and wise personality, held herself

and others to high moral standards.
As her favorite saying was ``What

would Jesus do'', she found herself working for Aspire of Western New

York and People Incorporated, two non-profit organizations dedicated to

helping those with developmental disabilities lead lives integrated in

the general community.
Tiffany joined Aspire in 2006 during a time of

expansion, with the organization seeking to represent her own life's

goals: to care for those who need it.
As a Buffalo native, she cared

for her community through her work in the social work field.
She passed

shortly after her advance to management in 2021.
Tiffany is survived by a large family.
including her new

granddaughter whom she affectionately called ``P,'' ``CinnaBun,'' and

``Honey Bun.''
