It is deeply painful that we have lost someone so dedicated to healing, and connecting so many people, no matter their background, to such a destructive act.
Sam's senseless death has left a hole not just in our hearts but in the fabric of our community.
She was a beacon of light and I ask that as we grieve her loss, we recommit ourselves to the principles by which she lived.
Sam firmly believed in the power of government to do good: to lift people out of poverty, to give a voice to

the voiceless, and to bring justice and equality to all.
She was deeply committed to the idea that what united us as Americans and Michiganders was much more important than the ways some try to divide us.
I send my deepest condolences to all who knew and loved her.
May her memory be a blessing forever in our hearts. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, it is my honor today to recognize the accomplishments of three outstanding women.
Ashley Ferris, Yvette Marquez-Sharpnack and Alice Jackson who will be honored by the Northwest Douglas County Chamber & Economic Development Corporation as ``Women Who Soar.''
Ashley Ferris, a law enforcement officer, left an indelible mark in Denver from 2018 to 2023.
Even before her tenure as a dedicated law enforcement officer, her background as a United States Army Intelligence Analyst and project manager showcased her remarkable skills.
Ashley's heroic efforts were exemplified during the critical incident on December 27, 2021, where she confronted and took down the Lakewood, CO mass shooter, despite sustaining injuries herself.
This act of bravery earned her accolades, including the Law Enforcement Officer of the Year 2022 by the National Police Hall of Fame and the Valor Award.
Her unwavering determination and resilience, even in the face of adversity, make her an inspiration.
Yvette Marquez-Sharpnack, a celebrated cookbook author and Emmy Award-winning creator and chef, blends her Texan roots into culinary masterpieces.
Drawing inspiration from her grandmother's Mexican traditions and her mother's home-style dishes, she crafts delectable creations showcased on MuyBuenoBlog.com.
Besides her blog, Yvette, based in Colorado, is a sought-after brand ambassador and recipe developer, engaging her audience on social media.
Alice Jackson is a trailblazer in the energy sector, shining as Xcel Energy's Senior Vice President of System Strategy and Chief Planning Officer.
Her leadership in this male-dominated field has been transformative.
With a decade of contributions, Alice has redefined the standards of excellence in executive leadership.
Her success story is not just inspiring but a testament to her resilience, making her an inspiration for aspiring professionals in the industry.
From saving lives during a mass shooting to Emmy winning inspiration, this year's recipients have made a lasting impact on those around them and in our community.
It is leaders like these women who will allow us to achieve a more prosperous and inclusive future and I congratulate them all on being recognized as ``Women Who Soar.'' ____________________
