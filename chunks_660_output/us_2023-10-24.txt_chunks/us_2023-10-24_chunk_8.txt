Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, today I am honored to recognize the life of a quintessential West Side of Buffalo resident, Robert Lipp.
Often referred to as ``The Mayor of Fifteenth Street,'' Robert left an indelible mark on a community that will be mourning his loss for a long time to come.
Born in 1965, Robert graduated from Maryvale High School in Cheektowaga, and Bryant & Stratton College in Buffalo, where he obtained a degree in Electronic Technology.
A longtime employee with the New York State Thruway Authority, an on-the-job accident meant that Robert entered retirement earlier than he had planned.
Instead of approaching this situation with negativity, Robert began to dive into some of his passions.
As a man that understood the value of community and neighborhoods, he would plant flowers each year for Buffalo's annual Garden Walk.
Robert did not simply hope that someone would take steps to beautify the West Side of Buffalo; he did it.
Whether it result from confrontation of absentee landlords or fixing the electrical issues of his neighbors, there was no limit to the level of love that Robert displayed for the City of Buffalo.
Of course, Robert enjoyed many other activities, as well.
He loved to camp, go to concerts and weddings, and (in typical Buffalo fashion) watch his beloved Bills and Sabres.
He spent time with his many dogs, sought to make each year's Garden Walk better than the last, and served as a dedicated member of the Democratic Committee.
Survived by his husband, Bobby Graber, and countless loving family members, Robert's sudden passing will undoubtedly be difficult to endure.
Nevertheless, to all of those who knew and loved Robert, his legacy will remain.
Robert served as a model citizen in so many ways, and our community will forever be a better place because of him. ____________________

Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to recognize Mrs. Cindy Castello for the vital role she has played in the development of Cherokee County, Georgia as a stronghold of conservative values.
Cindy and her husband, Pete, have been friends of my family for many years.
We have witnessed her character and dedication to our shared cause in all of her numerous roles as a community servant.
As a dedicated leader, Cindy has been instrumental in recruiting and developing many community activists to become public servants and run for public office.
She has utilized her extensive network of relationships and years of experience within the Georgia Republican Party, the 11th Congressional District, and the Cherokee County Republican Party to lay a foundation which will impact Cherokee County for years to come.
She has devoted countless hours volunteering her time, talents, and energy to serve eleven years on the Zoning Board of Appeals; and, during her eighteen years of service on the Tax Equalization Board, she played a vital role for Cherokee County in steering the future of the county by applying commonsense conservative values.
In her thirty-three years of dedicated service on the Cherokee County Board of Elections, Cindy has helped to set a standard of excellence, and helped develop the Board into one of Georgia's finest and most innovative entities.
She has provided invaluable support and has been instrumental in the development of the Cherokee County Republican Party for the past forty years.
She exemplifies the very best of public service and is truly an inspiration to so many.
It is abundantly fitting and proper that Cindy's dedication to the cause of faith, family, and freedom be appropriately recognized in the U.S. House of Representatives.
