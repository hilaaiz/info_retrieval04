HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SAMANTHA WOLL; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
175



Date: 2023-10-24 Volume: 169, Issue: 175 Pages: E1006 - E1007 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1006-E1007] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF SAMANTHA WOLL ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Ms. SLOTKIN.
Mr, Speaker Pro Tempore, it is with profound grief that I pay tribute to the life of a passionate advocate, a dedicated former Congressional staff member, an organizer, and a true believer in interfaith dialogue, Samantha Woll.
Sam had a brilliant mind, a generous spirit, and was a true light in the community.
While we do not yet know the circumstances of her death, we do know how she lived, so today I ask that we remember the profound impact she had on her community, our state, and the Nation in her short time on this earth.
Sam worked for me from nearly the moment I became a Congresswoman-- helping us set up the Lansing office in 2019 and helping to lead it for my full first term as Team Slotkin's Deputy District Director.
Like everyone who met her, I was immediately struck by her kindness, her sharp mind, and her ever-present smile.
Though she was young, Sam came to our team already well-established, having worked for multiple members of the state legislature, as well as many different causes close to her heart.
She would go on to work for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and State Senator Stephanie Chang, among others.
I was also struck by her profound faith; not just her personal faith in Judaism, but her profound faith in humanity.
Sam dedicated her time on my staff, and truly her entire life, to building understanding and bridges between people, and bringing light in the face of darkness.
She helped establish our first interfaith roundtable and continued that work when she left our office, serving as president of the Isaac Agree Synagogue in Detroit where she was known for her outreach and dialogue with her Muslim and Christian neighbors.
As the Detroit Jewish News noted in naming her one of the ``36 Under 36'' influential young people in the Jewish community, ``By extending her hand and creating space for connection between Muslims and Jews, she has exemplified the values of healing the world.''
She also played a vital role in the revitalization of Detroit, including the renovation and reopening of her historic synagogue just a few months ago.
It is deeply painful that we have lost someone so dedicated to healing, and connecting so many people, no matter their background, to such a destructive act.
Sam's senseless death has left a hole not just in our hearts but in the fabric of our community.
She was a beacon of light and I ask that as we grieve her loss, we recommit ourselves to the principles by which she lived.
