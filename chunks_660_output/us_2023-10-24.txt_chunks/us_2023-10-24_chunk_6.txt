At its inception in 2018, the brewhall operated modestly with a nine-member team, opening its doors for just 41 hours across five days each week.
During that time, the team focused on brewing and, as demand grew, distributing its unique beers.
Today, they employ 27 workers, with over half of the original staff still remaining on the team and have grown their customer base and expanded their offerings to include morning coffee and espresso over 86 hours every week.
I'm grateful for co-founders, Ryan Lindquist and Damon Schuler's role in the revitalization of downtown Shakopee by turning their historic space into Scott County's first taproom and coffeehouse.
Their leadership of the brewhall showcased necessary innovation when pivoting to distribution during the pandemic and working with other local small businesses.
I've also appreciated their ``Share More Than A Beer Day,'' which creates awareness and financial support for partnering organizations and has led to more than $50,000 in donations to local non-profits.
It was a special honor to join Shakopee Brewhall's Caitlin Drayna at the Chamber's Awards Gala on October 19th.
It is my privilege to represent Shakopee Brewhall in Congress and I look forward to sharing a beer together soon. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY OF PARIS PEACE AGREEMENT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-10-24 Volume: 169, Issue: 175 Pages: E1008 - E1009 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1008-E1009] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 32ND ANNIVERSARY OF PARIS PEACE AGREEMENT ______ of massachusetts in the house of representatives Mrs. TRAHAN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today in recognition of the 32nd Anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement that ended the Cambodian-Vietnamese War.
As the Chair of the Congressional Cambodia Caucus and the Representative of a district with one of the highest populations of Cambodian-Americans, I rise to honor the anniversary of the peace agreement and call on the United States to do everything possible to help Cambodia realize its full democratic potential.
This historic agreement ended a horrible war that stretched over three decades and caused the deaths of countless soldiers and civilians.
One of the promises outlined in the accord was for free and fair elections.
Unfortunately, that aspiration was never realized, and the current state of Cambodia's government personifies the challenges that remain to achieving a truly democratic nation.
For thirty-eight years, Cambodia was ruled with an iron grip by Prime Minister Hun Sen. The democratic promise of free and fair elections was shattered by his weaponization of government power.
Over the years, Hun Sen took steps to eliminate his opposition, ban independent media outlets, and jail peaceful protesters.
In depriving the Cambodian people of their human rights, Hun Sen moved Cambodia closer to an authoritarian state and robbed them of the representative government promised in their Constitution and the Paris Peace Agreement.
Earlier this year, Cambodia held a sham election that made a mockery of the democratic process.
The prearranged result saw a landslide victory for Hun Sen who in turn announced an immediate transfer of power to his son, Hun Manet.
Let me be clear, these most recent elections violated the Cambodian Constitution, a document that Hun Sen helped draft and signed three decades ago, and his unprecedented decision to unilaterally transfer power to his son indicates Cambodia will be subject to authoritarian rule for another generation.
As we recognize the 32nd anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement, the Congressional Cambodia Caucus stands firmly against the rising tide of authoritarianism in Cambodia.
We will not stand idly by while Hun Manet picks up where his father left off.
Instead, we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to push for a free, democratic Cambodia.
