As we recognize the 32nd anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement, the Congressional Cambodia Caucus stands firmly against the rising tide of authoritarianism in Cambodia.
We will not stand idly by while Hun Manet picks up where his father left off.
Instead, we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to push for a free, democratic Cambodia.
I am a proud co-lead of the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act (H.R. 4659), legislation that promotes free and fair elections, democracy, political freedoms, and human rights in Cambodia by applying sanctions on Cambodian officials who denigrate those rights.
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Cambodian Caucus to pass this bill and with the Biden Administration to ensure that these sanctions are imposed effectively.
Passing the Cambodian Democracy and Human Rights Act will help ensure that the principles of the Paris Peace Agreement are upheld and that

Cambodians can move closer to achieving the self-determination and dignity they deserve.

Headquartered in Amherst, NY, this organization, and their staff have undoubtedly had a lasting impact on countless constituents in Western New York.
Founded in 1923, the reach and growth of this chapter of the Better Business Bureau is nothing short of impressive.
The eighth largest Better Business Bureau, it serves 6 million people across 48 counties in New York State.
Due to their unwavering enthusiasm, BBB of Upstate New York closes 15,000 complaints annually while posting over 10,000 reviews.
Throughout their long history, millions of service-oriented tasks have been completed in the name of consumer education and standards enforcement.
Their mission is simple: provide consumers with resources to not only avoid dishonest business practices but offer remedies for those who have been wronged.
Very importantly, all levels of government rely on BBB of Upstate New York to front-end this education of consumers.
Federal, state, and local law enforcement have also been able to begin investigations (and ultimately prosecutions) of bad faith actors in our local marketplace.
That type of responsibility is only given because the Better Business Bureau of Upstate New York has proven to be an honest broker for consumers.
Trust is at the very core of business, and it is only due to organizations like the Better Business Bureau of Upstate New York that consumers can approach matters with confidence.
I applaud their century of work to better our community, and I wish them continued expansion and prosperity in aiding the men and women of our community. ____________________
