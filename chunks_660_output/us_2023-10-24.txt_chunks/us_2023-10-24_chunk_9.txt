She has provided invaluable support and has been instrumental in the development of the Cherokee County Republican Party for the past forty years.
She exemplifies the very best of public service and is truly an inspiration to so many.
It is abundantly fitting and proper that Cindy's dedication to the cause of faith, family, and freedom be appropriately recognized in the U.S. House of Representatives.
On behalf of the citizens of Cherokee County, Georgia's 11th Congressional District, and myself and my family, I offer my sincere appreciation to Mrs. Cindy Castello for her decades of faithful public service to our community. ____________________
TRIBUTE TO OPTUS BANK; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
175



Date: 2023-10-24 Volume: 169, Issue: 175 Pages: E1006 - E1006 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO OPTUS BANK ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. CLYBURN.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished South Carolina bank for its unwavering commitment to advancing minority-owned businesses.
Optus Bank of Columbia, South Carolina was recently awarded the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) 2023 Robert J. Brown Minority Business Enterprise of the Year Award.
Their steadfast support of businesses in distressed areas has uplifted communities and the lives of many.
To recognize the important role of entrepreneurs and institutions in advancing minority-owned businesses, the Minority Business Development Agency at the United States Department of Commerce established Minority Enterprise Development Week in 1983.
Since then, the Department of Commerce has commenced numerous awards to celebrate the outstanding achievements of minority entrepreneurs.
The Robert J. Brown Minority Business Enterprise Award recognizes companies that have exceeded industry standards and achieved phenomenal financial success while showing a commitment to social responsibility and strong community involvement.
The award is among the highest levels of recognition that a U.S. minority business enterprise can receive from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Optus Bank was selected because of its commitment to closing the racial wealth gap, exacerbated by systemic disparities in the financial industry.
Following in the footsteps of Victory Savings Bank, the first Black-owned bank in South Carolina, Optus is committed to providing access to capital to individuals and businesses excluded from the banking system.
By turning deposits from community members into loans that serve local businesses, Optus provides funding for enterprises that may not be approved for traditional loans.
Their unique community driven mission has allowed them to achieve great success while helping scores of minority-owned enterprises succeed in South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker Pro Tempore, I ask that you and our colleagues join me in celebrating Optus Bank and their unwavering commitment to serving communities and people in need.
Their actions should serve as an example to other organizations dedicated to positively impacting the communities they operate in.
South Carolina is more prosperous because of the efforts of Optus Bank and I wish them continued success. ____________________
