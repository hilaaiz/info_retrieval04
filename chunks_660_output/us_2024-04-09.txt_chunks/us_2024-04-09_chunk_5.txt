In 2018, LCDR Belton founded Course Correction LLC, a service-disabled veteran owned small business which specializes in financial literacy education, leadership training, and contract management.
His legacy of excellence continues to inspire and guide those who follow in his footsteps.
LCDR Belton passed away unexpectedly on February 12, 2024.
In addition to his remarkable career, LCDR Belton's life was marked by love and commitment.
Issac was married to Kansas City, Kansas native Lieutenant Commander Anjail Belton, also a retired Naval Officer.
Together they have four adult children.
They recently finalized the adoption of six of their grandchildren on December 20, 2023.
It is with great pride and gratitude that I recognize the outstanding service and life of Lieutenant Commander Issac L. Belton.
His numerous awards and decorations, including the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy Commendation Medal, and Combat Action Ribbon, attest to his exceptional valor and dedication.
In his eyes, however, LCDR Belton's family was his greatest achievement.
I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our heartfelt appreciation to LCDR Belton and his family for their sacrifices and service to our country.
May his legacy

serve as a shining example of honor, courage, and selfless dedication to duty for generations to come. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Nathaniel ``Ray'' Tuck, Jr., who passed away at the age of 52 on February 11, 2024, after battling cancer for the past two and a half years.
Ray was born in Roanoke, Virginia, on April 30, 1971, to Nathaniel Ray and Barbara Z. Tuck.
He later graduated from Radford University in 1994 and earned his Doctor of Chiropractic from the National University of Health Sciences in 1997.
After graduating, he joined his father's chiropractic clinic in Southwest Virginia where they practiced together for many years.
His son, Nathaniel R. Tuck, III is currently in chiropractic school, hoping to continue the family legacy.
During Ray's incredible career, he served as the President of the Virginia Chiropractic Association, Chairman of the Board, and later President of the American Chiropractic Association, and was also appointed to be the chiropractor on the Virginia Board of Medicine.
Ray is survived by his wife, Bonnie, of 29 years, his daughter Abi Dolgos (husband Dakota Dolgos and grandson Gatlin Dolgos), his son Nathaniel (girlfriend Abby E. Markham), his mother Barbara, his sister Amelia Martin (husband Buddy Martin), and his brother Ben M. Tuck (wife Priyam Chipper).
I wish them peace and strength during this difficult time.
I was lucky to know Ray personally, as my daughter, Abby, has dated his son Nathaniel for a number of years.
He was a good man, and I was glad to have been able to know him before he passed.
We will all greatly miss him. ____________________
