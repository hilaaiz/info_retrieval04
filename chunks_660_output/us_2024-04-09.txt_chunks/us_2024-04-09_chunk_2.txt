Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable organization, Delta Missions.
Delta Missions Ministry is a nonprofit Christian outreach organization dedicated to advancing the gospel of Jesus Christ, offering discipleship training to local residents, and empowering them to actively engage in their local churches.
Our mission is to impact lives and nurture spiritual transformation through weekly Bible studies, lay training, recreational activities, and mentoring programs tailored for youth, adults, and senior citizens.
Under the guidance of Reverend Herron Wilson, Delta Missions was born out of a desire to replicate the impactful work experienced during his time with The Sonflowers, a mission focused on Vacation Bible School (VBS) camps in the town of Sunflower.
Upon returning to the Southgate Community in Indianola, Rev. Wilson identified an opportunity to utilize the vacant Bethune Center at the heart of the community to launch a VBS camp.
The Executive Director of South Delta Housing generously granted access to the center without charge.
The inaugural VBS camp took place in the summer of 1995, drawing over 100 enthusiastic kids.
The overwhelming positive response led to the transformation of the summer camp into a weekly gathering, providing not only spiritual education but also recreational activities, arts and crafts, and occasional outings for children and their families.
This grassroots initiative laid the foundation for Delta Missions, which is proud to celebrate its 30th year of service to the Indianola community this summer.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Delta Missions for their passion and dedication to serving their community. ____________________
