In this capacity she not only addresses immediate hunger but also fosters a sense of belonging and support within the community.
Coordinating a team of 30 volunteers is no small feat, yet Karen does so gracefully and efficiently.
She assists in recruiting and training volunteers and fosters a sense of camaraderie and purpose among them.
Her hands-on approach during food pick-ups, where she personally welcomes each family and assists with intake procedures, demonstrates her commitment to serving others with dignity and respect.
Karen's advocacy for youth literacy is also a testament to her belief in the power of education to transform lives.
By leading volunteer efforts for youth reading programs, she promotes literacy and instills a love for learning in young minds, empowering them to reach their full potential.
During the holidays, Karen's leadership shines brightly as she volunteers many hours to the YMCA's Seasons of Giving and Giving Tree programs, encouraging community members to spread joy and generosity by purchasing gifts for children in need.
Her ability to inspire others to give back underscores her exceptional leadership and ability to mobilize resources for the greater good.
Despite her preference for working behind the scenes, Karen's impact reverberates throughout the YMCA and the community at large.
Her selfless dedication and unwavering passion serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration, inspiring others to follow in her footsteps and make a positive difference in the world.
It is clear that Ms. Epting has made a profoundly positive impact on our community, and I am grateful for her service. ____________________
RECOGNIZING THE SALINE FIDDLERS' 30TH ANNIVERSARY; Congressional Record Vol.

Date: 2024-04-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 60 Pages: E320 - E320 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE SALINE FIDDLERS' 30TH ANNIVERSARY ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic, a premier youth fiddling show band from Saline, Michigan, on their 30th anniversary.
Comprised of students from Saline High School the fiddlers present an energetic and polished show that features a diverse range of music from American folk, fiddle, bluegrass, jazz, western swing, and Celtic traditions.
Their 30 years of unforgettable performances are remarkable, and their commitment and skill are worthy of commendation.
The Fiddlers began in 1994 with the simple idea of introducing an alternative style of musical education to public school students to maintain and expand their interest in musical performance.
Since 1994, these remarkable students have set the standard for extracurricular music programs in the United States and have become a model for instruction and motivation that other schools across the nation have added to their own programs.
With over 1,500 performances in the majority of the states in our nation, the Fiddlers have a storied history that includes three performances at the White House, two performances on the Millennium Stage at the Kennedy Center, and a performance at the State of Michigan's Presidential Inaugural Ball.
The Fiddlers have also traveled to Canada and Europe for performances and have made multiple trips to Saline's sister cities of Brecon, Wales and Lindenberg, Germany.
Each year, the group performs 50-60 times, with around a third of their annual schedule being donated to community service events.
I still fondly remember their performance at the Saline Celtic Festival this past summer.
Working alongside the artistic team, the Saline Fiddlers help plan each aspect of their shows by crafting arrangements and making diverse organizational decisions that helps teach the students collaborative ownership while giving students the opportunity to explore their creativity and showcase their enthusiasm throughout the show making process.
These accomplished members of the Fiddlers are selected through competitive auditions that assess their musical talent and personal maturity.
They balance academics, school organizations, jobs, and other extracurricular activities.
