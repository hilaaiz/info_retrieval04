COURTNEY STACEY LIM FOR HER DECADE OF EXEMPLARY CARE AND SERVICE ______ of michigan in the house of representatives Mrs. DINGELL.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Courtney S. Lim, on the occasion of her 10 years of practicing medicine.
Her continued dedication and service to her patients in Ann Arbor, Michigan is worthy of commendation.
Dr. Courtney Lim attended the University of Michigan Medical School in 2008, then went on to complete her residency at the McGaw Medical Center at Northwestern University in 2012, earning a board certification for obstetrics and gynecology.
Afterwards, she returned to Ann Arbor, where she continued her education through a fellowship, achieving a Focused Practice designation in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery in 2014 from the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Now practicing as Service Chief of Gynecology at the University of Michigan's Von Voigtlander Women's Hospital in Ann Arbor, Dr. Lim is serving patients with extreme care and compassion.
Dr. Lim is committed to caring for those afflicted with complex gynecologic disorders.
She is open about her approach to health care and continuously strives to determine what the best course of action is for each individual.
Dr. Lim truly listens to her patients and recommends a treatment plan that is best aligned with that patient's values and wishes.
Dr. Lim offers both medical and surgical treatment options and strives to be as minimally invasive as possible when it comes to surgery.
In her work, Dr. Lim is conscientious, knowledgeable, and addresses even the smallest of concerns from her patients.
She exemplifies the values of what it means to be an excellent caretaker and serves as a leader in her field of work.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Courtney S. Lim for her continued service to her patients.
Dr. Lim conducts herself in a way that our future doctors should aspire to: thoughtfully listening to each and every patient, and serving as a steady, compassionate force for patients to find comfort with.
I have no doubt she will continue to exhibit her dedication and genuine care in treatment for many years to come. ____________________
