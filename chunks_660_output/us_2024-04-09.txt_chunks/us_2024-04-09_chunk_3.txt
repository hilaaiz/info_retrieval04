Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Angelo K. Tsakopoulos upon receiving the American Hellenic Institution Hellenic Heritage Lifetime Achievement Award.
Mr. Tsakopoulos is the founder, CEO, and co-chairman of AKT Development and has devoted his career to improving California for all.
Born in Arcadia, Greece, Mr. Tsakopoulos first came to the United States at the age of 15.
He worked diligently to send money home to his family in Greece and attended the University of Illinois and Sacramento State University, where he cultivated his passion for learning.
In 1964, he founded AKT Development, beginning what would become a lifetime of leadership in California's residential and commercial development.
Through his work with AKT Development, Mr. Tsakopoulos built entire communities, universities, and homes, helping California and its residents thrive.
Since its founding, AKT Development has built over 60,000 homes and today, it manages nearly 20,000 acres of farmland in Northern and Central California.
Mr. Tsakopoulos' critical work is characterized by his commitment to balancing the need for natural spaces with real estate development.
His philosophy is simple: plant as many trees as possible and preserve the existing ones whenever possible.
Mr. Tsakopoulos' passion for environmental stewardship led him to establish the Sacramento Tree Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting and growing the urban forest within Sacramento.
His dedication to planting and preserving trees as both a developer and lifelong advocate will continue to benefit California for generations.
Mr. Tsakopoulos' leadership, generosity, and compassionate spirit have impacted the lives of countless members of his community and beyond.
I join the American Hellenic Institution in honoring the critical contributions of Mr. Tsakopoulos. ____________________
