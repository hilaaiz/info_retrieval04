Working alongside the artistic team, the Saline Fiddlers help plan each aspect of their shows by crafting arrangements and making diverse organizational decisions that helps teach the students collaborative ownership while giving students the opportunity to explore their creativity and showcase their enthusiasm throughout the show making process.
These accomplished members of the Fiddlers are selected through competitive auditions that assess their musical talent and personal maturity.
They balance academics, school organizations, jobs, and other extracurricular activities.
Teaching students not just about music but about maintaining a balanced schedule and workload is a true testament to how the Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic has helped 30 years of students prepare for their futures through music.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the Saline Fiddlers Philharmonic on their 30th anniversary.
Their commitment to music and community is an incredible accomplishment and has helped preserve music and tradition for future generations.
I cannot wait to see all they accomplish in the years to come. ____________________
