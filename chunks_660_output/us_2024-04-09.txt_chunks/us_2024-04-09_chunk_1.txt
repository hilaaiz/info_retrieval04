Date: 2024-04-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 60 Pages: E319 - E319 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING JAKE MERKLINGER AND RASHAWN TRUELL ______ HON.
EARL L. ``BUDDY'' CARTER of georgia in the house of representatives Mr. CARTER of Georgia.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two Georgia quarterbacks--Calvary Day School's Jake Merklinger, and New Hampstead High School's RaShawn Truell, for their tied win of the Finocchiaro Award.
The Michael Finocchiaro Memorial Outstanding Football Player Award, now in its 43rd year, crowns the standout high school player in Savannah and Chatham County.
Remarkably, the recent award ceremony marked only the second occasion in its history where two players tied after voting concluded.
Merklinger, the senior quarterback who is committed to Tennessee, also took home the Ashley Dearing Award as a junior, which is awarded to the most versatile male high school athlete.
Truell says ``this a big honor for [him], especially as a junior, to win this award.''
He followed that by stating, ``It show's that all the hard work that I have put in has paid off.
But everything I work for is to help our team--our goal is to win a state championship.''
Congratulations again to both Jake and RaShawn. ____________________

Date: 2024-04-09 Volume: 170, Issue: 60 Pages: E321 - E322 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E321-E322] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY CLARA WILLIAMS ______ of south carolina in the house of representatives Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all South Carolinians, I am grateful to wish Mrs. Clara Singleton Williams a happy 100th birthday.
Clara Williams, a native of South Carolina, was born on April 9, 1924, to parents Isaiah Singleton and Annie Livingston Singleton.
She attended schools in Fairfield, Aiken, and Orangeburg County, where she graduated from Wilkerson High School.
After, she furthered her education at Claflin University for two years.
In 1946, Clara married Blanton Everett Williams, and together they had eleven children, twenty-nine grandchildren, forty-five great grandchildren, and three great-great grandchildren.
They purchased land and a home in Salley, South Carolina, where to this day Clara enjoys watching her vegetables and flowers grow.
Blanton and Clara were happily married for sixty-one years until his death in 2007.
Clara lives each day to the fullest with warm-hearted memories.
Over the years, she has embraced diverse pursuits, including cooking, canning, farming, quilting, and caring for babies, all while dedicatedly managing her household and working for Aiken County Public Schools.
Her spirit of generosity shines through in her unwavering commitment to caring for others.
Whether tending to her own children and many grandchildren or extending her kindness to members of her community, Clara's compassion knows no bounds.
As a devout Christian, Clara acknowledged her faith at an early age and was baptized at Good Hope Baptist Church in Ridgeway, South Carolina.
She later became a member of Samaria Baptist Church in Springfield, South Carolina, where she still faithfully attends.
Her love for both her church and her family is palpable, evident in her years of dedicated service to both.
At the age of 100, Clara has witnessed many significant landmarks of American history: the Great Depression, World War II, Briggs v. Elliott, Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Cold War, 9/11, and the first African American President of the United States.
Today, I honor Mrs. Clara Singleton Williams and wish her a happy 100th birthday.
I am pleased to join her family and friends in congratulating her on this remarkable milestone.
