Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by Mr. Terry Williams, a

local painting contractor and pastor, and Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister

and clinical therapist.
Together, they facilitate regular gatherings--

often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with

historically Black or White congregations.
These events are not mere

meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest

dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse

backgrounds.
Through these efforts, Mission Mississippi of Leflore County engages

in what Mr. Williams aptly describes as ``heart work''--emphasizing

their belief that the path to racial harmony begins with the courage to

know one another, to listen, and to love unconditionally.
Their work

underscores that true unity is not achieved solely through laws or

policies, but through relationships and shared purpose.
In January of this year, the chapter hosted a luncheon at St. Francis

of Assisi Catholic Church, followed by a community meal in April that

featured remarks from Dr. Montrell Greene, pastor of Sycamore Street

Church of Christ.
These are but a few examples of their ongoing efforts

to bring diverse voices to the table and create a space where

differences are acknowledged and celebrated.
Mr. Quinn, reflecting on his journey from Texas to Georgia to

Wisconsin before settling in the Delta, spoke candidly of Mississippi's

often misunderstood legacy.
He rightly observed that Mississippi is too

frequently portrayed as a scapegoat for America's racial challenges,

when in truth, it is home to many individuals working tirelessly to

heal those very wounds--Mission Mississippi of Leflore County among the

foremost.
Grounded in faith and expansive in impact, their mission exemplifies

what it means to live out the gospel in a divided world--breaking

bread, building bridges, and showing that we have more in common than

in conflict.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mission

Mississippi of Leflore County for their vital work in uplifting their

community, challenging stereotypes, and leading with grace and love.
Their efforts remind us that reconciliation is possible--one

conversation, one relationship, and one act of compassion at a time.
