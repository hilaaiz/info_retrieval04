Additionally, she contributed her talents to the Foundation

Boards of Darton College and Albany State College (now university), as

well as the Board of Directors of SunTrust Bank.
Reba's dedication to

her community was further demonstrated through her membership in the

Dougherty County Kiwanis Club.
Throughout her life, Mrs. Stewart received numerous accolades that

reflect her profound impact on the community.
Among these are Albany's

Woman of the Year, the Golden Deed Award from The Exchange Club of

Albany, the Woman of Distinction Award from the Girl Scouts of America,

and the Woman of the Youth Award from the Boys and Girls Club of

Albany.
Guided by her strong faith, she was a devoted member of Byne Memorial

Baptist Church.
Reba cherished her church and her church family for

seventy-three years.
She actively participated in various church

activities, generously reaching out to the community through mission

efforts.
On a personal note, Reba was my dear friend and neighbor for many

years.
She always greeted me with a warm smile and sometimes not so

subtle advice.
She never told me what I wanted to hear, but she always

told me what she felt I needed to hear.
I will be forever grateful for

the fidelity of her friendship and the timbre of her character.
Reba accomplished much in life but none of it would have been

possible without the love and support of her beloved late husband of

sixty-two years, Emmett; her daughter, Leslie Stewart Sullivan; her two

grandchildren Clay and Mary Stewart Sullivan and a host of other

relatives and friends.
Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I along with the more than 765,000

people of Georgia's Second Congressional District, salute and honor the

life of Mrs. Reba W. Stewart.
I ask my colleagues to join us in

extending our deepest condolences to her family and all who mourn her

loss during this difficult time of bereavement.
I pray that they will

be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in

the days, weeks and months ahead.
Mrs. Reba W. Stewart leaves behind a legacy of love, service, and

dedication to family and community.
Her influence will be felt for many

years to come, and she will be deeply missed.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL BLACKLEDGE

HON.
ZACHARY NUNN

Mr. NUNN of Iowa.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant

Colonel Daniel Blackledge for his more than two decades of service in

the United States Air Force.
A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy

and a proud leader within the intelligence community, Lt.
Col.
Blackledge has represented our Nation with distinction in uniformed

service across the globe.
From his early days as an intelligence officer to his most recent

assignment as a Legislative Liaison to the Secretary of the Air Force,

Lt.
Col.
Blackledge has demonstrated unwavering commitment to the

security and strategic readiness of our Nation.
His operational

leadership has taken him from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam to RAF

Molesworth, to deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan--always delivering

with precision, integrity, and focus.
Over the course of his career, Lt.
Col.
Blackledge served in pivotal

roles at the Pentagon, U.S. Strategic Command, and in multiple joint

environments.
His work has helped shape national policy and defense

priorities, particularly through his most recent role advising Air

Force leadership and Congress on programs vital to our military's

intelligence gathering, communications, and battlefield awareness

capabilities.
As he enters retirement, we also recognize the enduring support of

his family.
His wife, Captain Katie Blackledge, is a fellow veteran and

airman in her own right, and together they have raised two exceptional

daughters, Laurel and Lane Blackledge.
Their shared sacrifice and

steadfast support have been essential to Daniel's service, and our

Nation owes them a debt of gratitude as well.
