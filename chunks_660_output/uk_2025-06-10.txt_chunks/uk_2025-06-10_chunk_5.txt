In April alone, the Carolina Cruiser made 16 stops where

members of my team heard about the issues that matter to WNC

communities, answered questions about disaster recovery, and

assisted with federal agencies.
During these office hours, my

team heard from over 150 individuals.
As your congressman, it is my goal to remain accessible to

you.
In addition to mobile office hours, I regularly host

``Chat With Chuck'' meetings to hear from constituents one-

on-one about their concerns and answer their questions

individually.
If you're interested in scheduling a meeting

with me, please fill out the form on my website at

edwards.house.gov/chatwithchuck.
If you want to stop by mobile office hours for assistance

navigating a federal agency or to just provide feedback, stay

updated on the office hours schedule by following the

Carolina Cruiser on X and Facebook, and visiting my website

at edwards.house.gov/carolinacruiser.
With my warmest regards,

Chuck Edwards,

Member of Congress.

RECOGNIZING JERRY SANOK FOR FORTY YEARS OF COMMITTED SERVICE AND

LEADERSHIP

HON.
NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, for over 40 years, Jerry Sanok has been

a cornerstone of the Republican Party--a principled leader whose

honesty, strategic mind, and dedication have earned him respect across

Alden and beyond.
It is only fitting that his hometown now honors a

lifetime of unwavering service.
On June 11th, Jerry will receive the Honorary Lifetime Chairman

Award, and I'm proud to stand with the Alden Republican Committee in

recognizing this well-earned distinction.
As Chairman, Jerry has led

winning campaigns, mentored future leaders, and built coalitions that

have delivered victory at every level--from Town Hall to Capitol Hill.
His political instincts are unmatched, and his advice has shaped the

success of candidates and party leaders across New York.
What defines Jerry most, however, is his unwavering loyalty and deep

patriotism.
For over four decades, he has worked tirelessly to make his

community, his state, and his country stronger for the generations to

come.
In every season--in challenge and in triumph--he has stood firm

in his convictions and committed to the conservative values that unite

us.
It is with great pride and deep gratitude that I join the Alden

Republican Committee in honoring Gerald J. Sanok--for a lifetime of

leadership, patriotism, and service to the Republican cause.

RECOGNIZING MISSION MISSISSIPPI OF LEFLORE COUNTY FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO

RACIAL RECONCILIATION AND COMMUNITY UNITY

HON.
BENNIE G. THOMPSON

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize

and commend Mission Mississippi of Leflore County, a remarkable

organization based in Greenwood, Mississippi, for its unwavering

commitment to racial reconciliation, spiritual healing, and community

building.
Founded as part of the broader Mission Mississippi movement, which

began in Jackson in 1992, the Leflore County chapter has become a

beacon of hope and unity in the Mississippi Delta.
At a time when

division often dominates our national discourse, this grassroots

organization brings people together across racial and denominational

lines through intentional fellowship, shared meals, and mutual respect.
Mission Mississippi of Leflore County is led by Mr. Terry Williams, a

local painting contractor and pastor, and Mr. Luke Quinn, a minister

and clinical therapist.
Together, they facilitate regular gatherings--

often breakfasts or luncheons--that rotate between churches with

historically Black or White congregations.
These events are not mere

meetings; they are powerful acts of reconciliation, fostering honest

dialogue, trust, and deeper understanding among individuals of diverse

backgrounds.
