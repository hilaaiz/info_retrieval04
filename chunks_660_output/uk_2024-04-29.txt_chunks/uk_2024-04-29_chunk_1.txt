HONORING FELLOW MISSISSIPPIAN AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE THOMAS

JEFFERSON FOUNDATION--DANIEL P. JORDAN

HON.
MICHAEL GUEST

Mr. GUEST.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy

of Mississippi native Dr. Daniel P. Jordan.
Dr. Jordan served as the

executive director and the President of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation

in Charlottesville overseeing the historical process and interest of

Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.
As a native Mississippian, he was known for his ``Magnolia Alerts''

which would alert him to any vehicle with a Mississippi license plate.
David would personally go to the visitor's center and welcome his

fellow Mississippians to Monticello.
He was known as ``the most consequential president on the Mountaintop

since Jefferson himself.''
He worked hard to raise money for the Thomas

Jefferson Foundation and to expand the research capabilities at

Monticello.
David made the history of Jefferson accessible to everyday

Americans through expanding Monticello's programing and growing their

audience.
Dr. David Jordan was a frequent visitor to the Neshoba County Fair in

Mississippi, even during his long tenure in Virginia.
I'm thankful for

Dr. Jordan's dedication to the scholarship of history, the years of

research into Jefferson's life, and his unwavering commitment to his

Mississippi roots.
I will end with some of David's words about President Jefferson.
``We

have 200 people trying to keep up with one man--one dead man, and we

will never catch him.''
If anyone got close to catching Jefferson, it

was Dr. Daniel Jordan.

HONORING JAMES COLLINS TAYLOR, VETERAN OF THE GHOST ARMY, FOR RECEIVING

THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL

HON.
WARREN DAVIDSON

Mr. DAVIDSON.
Mr. Speaker, on February 1, 2022, the President signed

into law S. 1404, which awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the 23rd

Headquarters Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service Company, known

as the Ghost Army.
The Congressional Gold Medal is the oldest and

highest civilian award in the United States.
I rise today to honor

Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II for his contributions,

sacrifices, and patriotism while serving in the Ghost Army during World

War II.
Due to the unit's sworn secrecy, their service and

contributions went unnoticed for far too long.
Sergeant Major James Collins Taylor II was born in Mission, Texas, on

November 13th, 1915.
Mr. Taylor joined the Civilian Conservation Corps.
After the outbreak of World War II, he was assigned to the 23rd

Headquarters Special Troops.
This specialized unit comprised only 1,100

brave Americans and often served near the front lines.
Mr. Taylor helped conduct numerous deceptive campaigns with the Ghost

Army throughout Europe.
During his service, he received a Certificate

of Merit and was promoted to Sergeant Major of the Army--the highest

rank possible for an enlisted soldier.
While the Ghost Army's work was

secret, its impact was substantial.
The Ghost Army performed 22

``deception missions'' across the front lines of France, Belgium, and

Germany.
By simulating the movement of 30,000 service members, the

Ghost Army fooled German forces and aided General Patton at several

critical junctures in World War II.
It is my honor to recognize the service Sergeant Major James C.

Taylor and the Ghost Army.
Their dedication and service saved thousands

of American lives.
Although the Congressional Gold Medal reaches Mr.

Taylor posthumously, he is survived by a grateful family and country.
