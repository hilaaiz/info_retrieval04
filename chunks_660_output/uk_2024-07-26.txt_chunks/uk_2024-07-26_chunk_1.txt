HONORING CITY OF MISSION VIEJO CITY MANAGER DENNIS WILBERG

HON.
YOUNG KIM

Mrs. KIM of California.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank Mission Viejo

City Manager Dennis Wilberg for his decades of service to our Mission

Viejo community and to Orange County.
His work in the public and private sectors of civil and

transportation engineering, including 20 years as City Manager, has

left an enormous impact across Mission Viejo and the County.
From helping create the second-largest animal shelter in Orange

County and building a water treatment facility, to increasing public

safety and maintaining the City's transportation network, there's no

question how he has become the longest-tenured city manager in Orange

County.
I thank him for his dedication to keeping our communities safe and

connected.
We are grateful for his leadership, and I wish him a wonderful

retirement.

HONORING TEATRO VISION: 40 YEARS OF BUILDING COMMUNITY

HON.
ZOE LOFGREN

Ms. LOFGREN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of myself and

Representatives Anna

Eshoo, Ro Khanna, and Jimmy Panetta to recognize the accomplishments of

Teatro Vision for 40 years of community building and social justice

work in San Jose, CA.
Teatro Vision was founded in 1984 in San Jose, California, with the

mission of inspiring the people of Santa Clara County and surrounding

areas.
The theater was co-founded by Elisa Marina Alvarado, who is a

director, actress, and dancer.
Through Teatro Vision, Elisa Marina

Alvarado established Instituto de Teatro, an educational program that

teaches comprehensive training in theater for Latino communities.
For the last 40 years, Teatro Vision has produced and presented

projects that have been made accessible to the entire community,

emphasizing activist theater and focusing on Latino and Chicano

communities, integrating Latin American cultures.
Teatro Vision's

recent projects include ``Miss You Like Hell,'' ``Luz: A Shadow Play

Inspired by Senior Stories,'' and ``Raices, El Libro de los Caminos,''

performed at the Mexican Heritage Plaza in San Jose.
Teatro Vision's work is centered in the Mayfair neighborhood located

in East San Jose where their main stage, the Mexican Heritage Plaza, is

also situated.
Over 77 percent of the Mayfair neighborhood is made up

of Latinx; 66 percent of which speak Spanish at home.
Teatro Vision's

programs give accessibility to Title I schools in Mayfair, where many

students come from economically disadvantaged households.
Teatro Vision has shared powerful stories and convictions that speak

to the courage, compassion, and power of many minority communities.
The

team at Teatro Vision are strong leaders that our community needs now

and in the future.
