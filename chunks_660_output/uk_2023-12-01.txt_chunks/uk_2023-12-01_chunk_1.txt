CELEBRATING THE 300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH OF

SHREWSBURY, MASSACHUSETTS

HON.
JAMES P. McGOVERN

Mr. McGOVERN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of the 300th

Anniversary of the First Congregational Church and Meeting House in

Shrewsbury.
The Congregation will celebrate this tremendous milestone

on Monday, December 4.
Mr. Speaker, the history of the Church spans almost as far back as

the town itself.
In October 1717, the General Court of Massachusetts

permitted Shrewsbury as a township, as long as 40 families would settle

there, build a meeting house, and settle an ordained minister within

three years.
With little delay, Reverend Job Cushing was ordained, and

the original church covenant was adopted on December 4, 1723.
For 109 years, the meeting house was the site for both church and

town affairs, until the two separated in 1832.
Since its inception, the

Church has undergone moves, repairs, remodels, and expansions.
Nevertheless, the Church remained a steadfast community center.
During its long history, the Church has remained a site of social

responsibility.
The Church championed a Vigilance Committee to support

the Underground Railroad.
Its ministries outreach to those in need.
And

today, the Church is an open and affirming Congregation.
In 1961, the First Congregational Church of Shrewsbury became part of

the United Church of Christ.
Since then, the Church has opened its

doors to all, supporting the diverse needs of the Shrewsbury community.
Mr. Speaker, the First Congregational Church of Shrewsbury strives to

keep adapting to be in service to all people.
I look forward to

celebrating this crucial community organization on their 300th

Anniversary.
Please join me in paying honor and tribute to the First

Congregational Church of Shrewsbury.
