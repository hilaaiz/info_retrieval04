Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the Ray-Fre Senior Citizens Club in Raymond, New Hampshire, for the 50th anniversary of their location on Main Street and the 55th anniversary of the club's founding.
Ray-Fre was established in 1968 when the Raymond and Fremont senior centers chose to combine.
By 1973, they had a permanent location, elected officers, and by-laws.
Ray-Fre offers a variety of games, activities, and volunteer opportunities open to those 55+ including line dancing, cribbage, Meals-on-Wheels, and knitting.
Their continuous community-building, festivities, and engagement opportunities help our seniors age gracefully and with dignity, connecting them with friends and family in a lively atmosphere.
Aside from games and festivities, Ray-Fre offers our seniors the opportunity to maintain a healthy lifestyle, learn about new technology, and participate in local community service.
Each week, members may take part in walking groups or video exercises, participate in computer classes to remain fluent in technology and learn new skills, or volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels.
Additionally, the knitting group meets Mondays to make hats for cancer survivors, infants, and the homeless and provided over 1,900 articles in 2021.
Ray-Fre's impact extends far beyond their seniors and strives to make a difference in the community.
On behalf of the constituents of New Hampshire's First Congressional District, I commend Ray-Fre for their devotion to community-building, service, and engagement.
Their 55 years as a club complements their immeasurable positive impact on the community.
I greatly appreciate the work they do for our seniors and the opportunities provided to them. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Trooper Jeffrey Dunlap, a devoted public servant, for his heroic actions on the evening of Monday, July 3.
For more than 13 years, Trooper Dunlap has served in the North Carolina State Highway Patrol, risking his life every day to protect and serve the people of Buncombe County.
On the evening of July 3rd, Trooper Dunlap stopped his vehicle to assist a stranded motorist on I-26 West.
In a horrific turn of events, the motorist pulled out a gun and shot Trooper Dunlap in the chest.
Thankfully, the round was stopped by Trooper Dunlap's bulletproof vest, and he was able to swifty return fire.
In the face of imminent danger, Trooper Dunlap neutralized the threat, saving his own life and protecting the lives of innocent bystanders.
Following the shooting, Trooper Dunlap was taken to a local hospital and has since been discharged.
The true essence of heroism is the willingness to sacrifice one's own personal safety for the protection of others.
Trooper Dunlap has and will continue to show up to work every day willing to place himself in danger for the greater good.
I thank Trooper Dunlap, for exemplifying what it means to protect and serve. ____________________
