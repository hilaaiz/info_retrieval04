He leveraged a partnership with the Detroit Institute of Arts to provide a permanent home for students to play outside of regular school hours.
Since then, Detroit City Chess Club has strived to engage young people in the game of chess.
The club has grown from only a handful of members at its inception to reaching thousands of students and adults alike.
The Detroit City Chess Club has played all over the world, winning 15 National titles, 16 regional championships, 28 state championships, and hosting 4 individual No.
