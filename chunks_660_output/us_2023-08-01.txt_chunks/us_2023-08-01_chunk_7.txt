Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a faithful servant, trusted counselor, and cherished community leader, Deacon Benjamin ``Ben'' Swinton.
Deacon Swinton, a lifelong friend and supporter, transitioned from this life on July 26, 2023, in Sumter, South Carolina.
His compassion and kindness will be sorely missed.
Mr. Benjamin Swinton was born on September 10, 1929, in Sumter, South Carolina.
He attended Sumter City Schools and graduated from Lincoln High School in 1954, where he was a gifted athlete.
Upon graduating high school, Mr. Swinton pursued higher education at North Carolina A&T University and completed his coursework at Morris College in Sumter, graduating Magnum Cum Laude.
Mr. Swinton also dutifully served our nation in the United States Army.
After graduating from Morris College, Mr. Swinton pursued a career in public service.
He served as a counselor and planner at the Wateree Community Actions Agency before joining the South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation Center, where he served for 21 years before his retirement.
In these capacities, Mr. Swinton was uplifting to many members of the Sumter community.
Deacon Swinton was a man of faith.
He was a lifelong member of the Salem Missionary Baptist Church and served the Church as a Sunday School teacher, a combined choir member, the Director of Christian Education, and Sunday School Superintendent.
Additionally, he served on the Deacon Board with distinction.
Mr. Swinton was also a dedicated family man.
He is survived by his loving wife, Dollie Woods Swinton to whom he was married for 68 years.
Together they had 1 son, Benjamin Anthony Swinton, who preceded him in death.
He is also survived by a daughter, Juanita Balls Williams, brothers Harry W. Swinton and Roosevelt (Naomi) Swinton, and many grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.
Mr, Speaker, I ask that our colleagues join me in honoring the remarkable life of Deacon Benjamin Swinton.
His long life of service as a counselor and spiritual leader made an indelible impact on his community and will be remembered by all who were fortunate to know him. ____________________
