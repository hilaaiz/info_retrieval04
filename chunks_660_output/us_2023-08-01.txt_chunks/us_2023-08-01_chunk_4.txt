INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.
132



Date: 2023-08-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 132 Pages: E750 - E750 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL CAPITAL PLANNING COMMISSION DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOME RULE ACT ______ of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Ms. NORTON.
Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the National Capital Planning Commission District of Columbia Home Rule Act.
This bill would remove the authority of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), a federal agency, to review or approve the development of District of Columbia-owned real property.
This bill would also remove the requirement that the D.C. Mayor get NCPC's approval before selling D.C.-owned real property and allow D.C. agencies to transfer jurisdiction over D.C.-owned real property among themselves without NCPC's approval.
Under federal law, NCPC has approval authority for the development of D.C.-owned buildings located in the ``central area,'' including the location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of such buildings.
D.C. is required to consult with NCPC on D.C.-owned buildings outside the central area, but NCPC has only advisory authority in those areas.
The central area is defined by the concurrent action of NCPC and the D.C. Council and currently consists of the Downtown and Shaw Urban Renewal Areas.
NCPC's authority over D.C.-owned real property is unnecessary, as demonstrated by the virtual absence of its use to disapprove sales or development, and violates D.C. home rule.
The federal government should not be able to slow or block the development of D.C.-owned real property or add to the cost of development.
This bill is an important step to increase home rule for D.C. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________

PLANT VOGTLE'S UNIT 3 OFFICIALLY ONLINE; Congressional Record Vol.
169, No.

Date: 2023-08-01 Volume: 169, Issue: 132 Pages: E751 - E751 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PLANT VOGTLE'S UNIT 3 OFFICIALLY ONLINE ______ of georgia in the house of representatives Mr. ALLEN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Southern Company and all of the co-owners on their historic accomplishment of Unit 3 at Plant Vogtle officially coming online this week.
Plant Vogtle, located in Georgia's 12th District, is now home to the first newly-constructed nuclear unit in the United States in more than 30 years, with Unit 4 shortly to follow.
Announced earlier this week, Unit 3 is fully operational and will provide 24/7 baseload power to 500,000 Georgia homes and businesses for decades to come.
A project of this magnitude does not come to fruition easily, but the persistent efforts and dedication since 2012 have culminated in what can only be defined as a major win for all Georgians and America as a whole.
Seeing the results of the meaningful collaboration and hard work that made this possible is truly a blessing.
I am beyond proud that Georgia-12 is leading the way in America's nuclear energy expansion; congratulations to Southern Company, Oglethorpe Power Company, MEAG Power, and all involved for this historic accomplishment. ____________________
