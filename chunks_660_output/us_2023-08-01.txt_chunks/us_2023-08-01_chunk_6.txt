Mrs. Earl worked under Senator Inhofe until 2019, when she left the Senate to become a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, where she worked on the passage of the Great American Outdoors Act, Endangered Species Act regulatory reforms, and oversight of the National Park Service.
Mrs. Earl joined my Washington D.C. office at the beginning of the 117th Congress, serving as my Legislative Director.
Her portfolio included some of the most important issues for the 22nd district, such as energy, water, trade, environmental work, healthcare, and agriculture.
Not only did Mrs. Earl have an incredible grasp of these complex and challenging issues, but she dedicated an enormous amount of time to building relationships with relevant stakeholders in the Central Valley--even traveling to the district multiple times to meet with farmers, energy producers, hospital leaders, and more.
She was also critical in leading my legislative team's work on the House Appropriations Committee, ensuring the Central Valley had a seat at the table when it came to funding the federal government.
One of her most significant accomplishments during her time in my office was her leadership on the Working to Advance Tangible and Effective Reforms (WATER) for California Act.
This sweeping water legislation was made possible because of the months of effort on behalf of Mrs. Earl, and I am incredibly grateful for her work on this issue which is so critical for Central Valley communities and our local economy.
After nearly a decade spent in both Oklahoma and Washington D.C., Mrs. Earl would depart my office in March of this year and return to her beloved home state of Texas with her husband, Andrew.
While her welcoming personality, signature quick wit, and leadership in our office are

all greatly missed, I am incredibly excited for Mrs. Earl as she begins this exciting new chapter of her life.
Knowing Amanda, her character, work ethic, and compassion for others, I have no doubt there are many great things ahead for her.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives to join me in honoring Mrs. Amanda (Hall) Earl for her service to our country and wishing her the very best in this next chapter of her life. ____________________

Under his leadership, the Monongahela Church of the Nazarene remains committed to reaching the lost, helping those in need, and loving those they meet.
