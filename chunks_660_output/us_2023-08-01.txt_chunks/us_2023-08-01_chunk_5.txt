In 2014, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in journalism and public relations.
Following her graduation, Mrs. Earl began her political career working on state campaigns across Oklahoma.

Shortly after, she joined Senator Inhofe's personal office as a Legislative Assistant, working on major policy issues such as energy and water.
