After being owned

by his family for seven generations, Andy eventually sold his family

farm to the town of Londonderry.
In doing so, he made sure that the

land would be used for local schools, civic organizations, and nature

conservation.
Andy's passing is a profound loss to Londonderry, but I know that his

legacy will live on through those who knew and loved him, including his

sons, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
His life offers

inspiration to Granite Staters across New Hampshire who care about and

aspire to make change in their communities.
I am grateful for his

memory and for the lasting impact Andy has made on our state.

Mr. KEAN.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and

commitment of the Chester First Aid Squad.

RECOGNIZING COUNCILWOMAN PATRICIA ``PAT'' ANDALORO

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to recognize

Councilwoman Patricia Andaloro for her many years of devoted service to

the people of Buena Borough.
She was recently celebrated at the Buena

Boro Republican League dinner, a well-earned recognition of her

dedication, integrity, and steadfast commitment to her community.
Pat

first served as the Borough Clerk, where she became the backbone of

local government.
In that role, she guided residents and colleagues

alike with professionalism and care, ensuring that the daily functions

of the borough ran smoothly.
Her attention to detail and her deep

knowledge of municipal operations earned her the respect and trust of

everyone who worked alongside her.
Today, as Councilwoman, Pat continues to bring that same spirit of

service and leadership.
She has shown an unwavering commitment to good

governance, always keeping the needs of her neighbors at the forefront.
The recognition she received at the Buena Boro Republican League dinner

was not just a tribute to her past accomplishments, but a reminder of

the lasting impact she continues to make.
I congratulate Pat on a very

well-deserved honor and I thank her for the great work she is doing in

South Jersey.
God bless Pat and God bless our United States of America.
The greatest country on the face of the Earth.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT MADELINE DELEIGHA MILLER

HON.
JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Mr. VAN DREW.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize

Madeline Miller of Logan Township, who at just sixteen years old has

earned the rank of Eagle Scout, a distinction achieved by only a small

percentage of Scouts nationwide.
At such a young age, Madeline has

already shown remarkable dedication, leadership, and service.
For her

Eagle project, she designed and built dog play

equipment at the Triple Seven Animal Rescue in Elmer, South Jersey,

creating a doghouse tunnel, hurdle, and even re-purposing a fire

hydrant to provide a lasting space for the animals in their care.
