At a time when religious persecution, catastrophes and tensions among

religious communities seem to be dominating news headlines, Patriarch

Bartholomew presents an alternate vision: ``War in the name of religion

is war against religion,'' he tells us.
He calls on people of faith of

all traditions to be ``peacemakers'' and protectors of the Earth.
There are thousands of Greek-Americans living in Arizona's 8th

Congressional District, including the hundreds of faithful at St.

Haralambos Greek Orthodox Church in Peoria.
They, and Orthodox

Christians throughout our land, welcome this visit with joy.
My

constituents are particularly proud of the fact that Patriarch

Bartholomew has been an outspoken defender of human dignity and has

reached out to Jewish and Muslim leaders throughout the world.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming His All-

Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew to Washington, D.C., and in

paying tribute to his decades of ministry for peace, reconciliation and

environmental stewardship.
May God continue to bestow his example as a

guide to defend religious freedom, choose cooperation over conflict,

and secure a healthier, safer America for future generations.
