Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown Hero, FMC Fort Worth Warden, Freddy Garrido.
Warden Garrido has spent almost 30 years in the Bureau of Prisons and is retiring on October 31, 2023.
During his impressive career, Warden Freddy Garrido has served selflessly to promote responsibility and lifelong skills for those incarcerated.
Through his passion for service, Warden Garrido has used his role to give an underserved community hope and a second chance.
Warden Garrido served at various duty stations including, FDC Oakdale, FCI Forrest City, FCC Butner, FMC Lexington, FCC Florence, FCC Victorville, and FCC Beaumont before moving to North Texas at a critical time to provide leadership and direction at FMC Fort Worth.
Those who work closely with him say that his attitude and leadership style make them more empathetic and compassionate in fulfilling their own duties.
During his time at FMC Fort Worth, Warden Garrido has made leadership development and training a priority.
By establishing vocational programs, like a ``second chance cafe'' and HVAC program, the incarcerated have the opportunity to learn valuable life skills to equip them upon their release into society.
I want to congratulate Warden Garrido on his retirement and thank him for his outstanding career of service. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 183 Pages: E1065 - E1065 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE REVEREND JUAN MARTINEZ ______ HON.
ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Ms. DeLAURO.
Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to join the New Haven community in mourning the loss of the Reverend Juan Martinez.
At the age of 94, Reverend Martinez lived a full life, full of family, faith, and service to our community.
His legacy of advocacy and religious leadership has left an indelible mark and will serve as an inspiration to many for generations to come.
Born in Puerto Rico, Reverend Martinez came to New Haven more than six decades ago, eventually making a home in West Haven where he has lived for more than fifty years.
He and his first wife, Persida, raised six children, all of whom have mirrored their father's commitment to community.
His son, John, was a beloved State Representative for many years before his tragic passing in 2002; Joe a firefighter for the City of New Haven; and Ariel, followed his father in becoming a pastor himself.
His daughter, Evelyn, volunteered her time as a supervisor and site coordinator for the Vita Tax Program.
A Pentecostal Minister, Reverend Martinez founded the Door of Salvation Pentecostal Church of New Haven where he led the congregation for more than sixty years.
As a spiritual guide, he nourished the souls of many--often providing much needed comfort during the hardest of personal trials.
A leader in the Pentecostal ministry and understanding the growing need for Spanish language led houses of worship, Reverend Martinez was also responsible for the establishment of a multitude of Spanish speaking churches across the state.
As a pastor, Reverend Martinez had a unique insight into the needs of his community.
With many in his congregation struggling to find financial and economic security, he looked for ways he could make a difference in their lives.
