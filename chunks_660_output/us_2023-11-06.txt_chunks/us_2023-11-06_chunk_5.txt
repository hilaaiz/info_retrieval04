Bosq offers four, five and nine course menus.
Bosq is the only restaurant in Colorado's Third Congressional District to earn the Michelin star.
Bosq is set apart not only by its exceptional cuisine but its commitment to our Colorado community.
The restaurant collaborates with local farmers and ranchers to ensure that the food is as fresh as it is delicious.
They embody the very best of Colorado excellence and have brought a world-class dining experience to Colorado's Third Congressional District.
Bosq is a beacon of what can be achieved when talent, dedication, and love for one's community come together, and I am incredibly proud to represent this outstanding establishment.
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Bosq for being awarded the Michelin star and redefining culinary excellence in Colorado's Third Congressional District. ____________________

MARIA GAMBOA ______ of florida in the house of representatives Mr. GAETZ.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. Maria Gamboa, an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Interpreter in the Okaloosa County School District.
As an employee with more than 25 years of service, Ms. Gamboa worked in Exceptional Student Education (ESE) at Crestview High School for 13 years before spending the past 14 years as an ESOL Interpreter at Pryor Middle School and now Choctawhatchee High School.
At Choctaw, Ms. Gamboa offers academic support both in the classroom and in the afterschool tutoring program.
She provides the right level of encouragement while also holding students accountable for attending school and taking advantage of the opportunities which lead to graduation.
Ms. Gamboa has also assisted in implementing a monthly English Language Learners (ELL) Parent Information Night to better inform families about high school life.
Furthermore, she assisted in creating a weekly language acquisition class for any ELL family that wants to strengthen their English skills.
According to her principal, Michelle Heck, Ms. Gamboa has ``earned the respect, admiration, and love of our Choctaw staff because of her kind-hearted self, always making time to lend an ear to any and all who need someone to listen, bountiful amounts of patience and her endless generosity to our students, parents, and staff members alike.''
Ms. Gamboa is a mother to five Okaloosa County School graduates, all of whom have received college scholarships.
She is a firm believer that every family deserves the opportunity to be equipped with the necessary resources to help their child succeed in their academic life.
She expressed her gratitude, saying, ``I am very blessed to be able to help Spanish speaking parents and students be successful in school.''
I, along with all of Northwest Florida, thank Ms. Gamboa for her hard work and dedication to her students and this community.
On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am privileged to recognize Ms. Gamboa for her contributions to Northwest Florida. ____________________
