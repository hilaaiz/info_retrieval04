1 Peter 4:10 says, ``As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.''
The Second Congressional District of Alabama is fortunate to have outstanding individuals like them.
I would like to recognize these young producers for their participation in this year's young farmer competitions and their dedication to production agriculture in Alabama's Second Congressional District.
The farmers and producers in Alabama's Second Congressional District have created a remarkable legacy of feeding and supporting citizens across the great state of Alabama and the Nation. ____________________

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wendy Pate, City Councilwoman for the City of Trenton, on the occasion of her retirement.

Together they have two children, Daphne and Carl III.
Her family has been volunteering in community activities for years, including working with the local Boy Scouts and events put on by the Trenton Business Association, the Trenton Educational Foundation, and the local Student Council.
Wendy is a retired high school math teacher and MEA-retired member.
She served as MEA-RA, class congress sponsor, and staff morale committee chair.
Wendy was elected to the Trenton City Council in 2019.
She was a member of the City Beautiful Commission and is a member of the Trail Town Advisory Committee.
She also co-founded a community action group, the DCC Coal Grant Riverfront Community Group, whose mission is to support the Trenton Coast Resiliency Master Plan and engage residents to support sustainable uses for Trenton's waterfront and revitalize their downtown.
Wendy also spearheaded the project to paint murals on West Jefferson Ave in order to beautify a main intersection in Trenton as well as celebrate their 2021 designation as a Pure Michigan Trail Town.
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Councilwoman Wendy Pate for all that she has done for the City of Trenton.
Both in her position on the city council and in her private life, Wendy has worked tirelessly to make Trenton and the Downriver area healthier and more sustainable for future generations.
