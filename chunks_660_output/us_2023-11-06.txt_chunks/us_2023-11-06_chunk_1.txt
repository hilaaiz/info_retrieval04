ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Ms. DeLAURO.
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to join the congregation of the Beulah Heights First Pentecostal Church of New Haven, Connecticut in extending my heartfelt congratulations on the celebration of their 100th Anniversary.
Throughout its history, the Church and its congregation have demonstrated a unique commitment to serve the community and ensure that the most vulnerable of our citizens could find comfort and resources in their time of need.
Originally named Beulah Heights Mission, the ministry was founded in a converted storefront on Poplar Street in New Haven during the summer of 1923 under the leadership of the late Elder Walter and Rosa B. Andrews.
While their initial membership was modest, just twelve, over the next several decades, under the leadership of Elder Andrews, Mother Andrews, and then Elder Lambert Tolbert, the ministry saw steady growth.
In 1943, the Elder George H. Brooks succeeded Elder Tolbert and in 1950 was installed as Pastor of Beulah Heights Church.
The installation of Pastor George Brooks at Beulah Heights Church also marked the beginning of what would be an expansion of the Church's work in the community and generational leadership at Beulah Heights.
After serving as junior pastor under his father, Elder Theodore L. Brooks, Sr.
was installed as the church's fifth pastor in 1988.
It was the vision and leadership of Bishop Brooks that Beulah Heights became a pillar in the Greater New Haven community.
The first outreach ministry under this new administration was the Beulah Land Development Corporation, launching what still today is an ongoing renaissance in New Haven's Dixwell community.
The organization's mission focused on transforming severely blighted properties into safe, revitalized affordable homes for working families.
Over the last four years, its Back to School Fair has served over 1,500 children and 3,000 families.
Children from preschool through high school receiving backpacks filled with all the tools necessary to be prepared on the first day of school and adults and parents in attendance are connected with a network of health and human services resources from around the city.
The Beulah Heights Social Integration Program provides outreach to individuals who have experienced substance abuse, dependence and incarceration-- equipping them with essential resources to help them obtain employment, housing, and mental health support.
And the T.L. Brooks Ministries utilizes new technologies to make the preached word available for the masses on CD and DVD.
Today, while Bishop Brooks remains an active participant in both the Church and its many ministries, his son, Elder Harold Brooks leads Beulah Heights First Pentecostal Church, while his other son, Darrell Brooks serves as the Chief Operating Officer for Beulah Land Development--representing a third generation of invaluable

service to our community.
The Beulah Heights First Pentecostal Church has not only been a center for religious worship, but a vehicle through which their members could give back to the community.
For the last century, the Beulah Heights First Pentecostal Church has been a fixture in our community, their ministry and outreach efforts leaving an indelible mark on our community.
The Beulah Heights First Pentecostal Church gives its members a place to find their spiritual center and to solidify and support their values--a beacon of light and hope for their members and the community.
I am proud to stand today and extend my very best wishes to them as they mark this milestone in their history.
Happy 100th Anniversary and as we say in Italian, C'ent Anni. ____________________
