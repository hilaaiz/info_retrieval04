His passion for his country led him to extend his original tour for an additional year due to the Berlin Crises.
After leaving active duty, Jim began his finance career with IBM in Kansas City, Missouri.
In 1964, he began his 35-year banking career with Central Trust Bank in Jefferson City, Missouri while simultaneously joining the 420th Civil Affairs National Guard Reserve Unit.
During his career with the Central Bank organization, Jim rose through the operations and loans divisions, as well as the ranks of the Missouri National Guard, until Central Bancompany's acquisition of Bank of Lake of the Ozarks in 1987.
Jim was then named President and CEO of the newly named Central Bank of Lake of the Ozarks, and he earned his rank of Colonel in the Missouri National Guard.
Passionate about his community, Jim left a mark wherever he lived.
His commitment to his community was evidenced through his involvement in the new construction of roads and bridges, economic development through Central Bank, public schools, YMCA, hospitals, and the Dogwood Animal Shelter.
He had a strong sense of community and worked hard to make his home a better place for everyone.
Although a busy man, Jim still found time to enjoy his hobbies.
He loved to play golf, spending an equal amount of time playing as he did trying to convince his grandchildren to play.
When he wasn't golfing, Jim was snow skiing, visiting Palm Springs, or visiting he and his wife's friends in Tucson, Arizona.
Left to cherish his memory is his wife Marjorie M. Herfurth, his two children from his marriage in 1961 to Barbara A. Silvers: daughter, Kimberly Herfurth Ayscue of Franklinton, North Carolina; son, J. Matthew Herfurth and his wife Jeane Herfurth of Madison, Mississippi; his four grandchildren Michael and Andrew Boyleir; daughter, Grace, of Monet, Missouri.
He was preceded in death by his sister, Barbara Herfurth Moffitt.
Jim's life was one of service, grace, and love for his family and

community.
He will be deeply missed by all whom he encountered. ____________________

Date: 2023-11-06 Volume: 169, Issue: 183 Pages: E1063 - E1063 ================================================================================ [Extensions of Remarks] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING BOSQ RESTAURANT'S MICHELIN STAR ______ of colorado in the house of representatives Ms. BOEBERT.
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor Bosq, an exceptional restaurant in Aspen, Colorado, for being awarded the coveted Michelin star.
This honor puts Bosq among the finest restaurants not only in Colorado, but in the entire world.
Bosq joins the ranks of just over 200 restaurants in America to have this great honor.
The Michelin star represents years of hard work, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to culinary excellence.
Michelin stars are a hallmark of fine dining and coveted honor by many of the world's top chefs and restaurant patrons.
Not easy to obtain, the stars are awarded to restaurants that are the absolute best in a given city.
Restaurants gain immense prestige and exposure as a result of this honor.
An Aspen native, Barclay Dodge and his wife Molly have created a dining experience that is nothing short of exceptional.
Bosq offers four, five and nine course menus.
Bosq is the only restaurant in Colorado's Third Congressional District to earn the Michelin star.
Bosq is set apart not only by its exceptional cuisine but its commitment to our Colorado community.
