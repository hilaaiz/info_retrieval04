That is our obligation as an ally

and as the world's strongest democracy.
It is my promise to them.
As the lead Democrat on the House

Appropriations Committee, I promise that I will never give up that

fight.
I will continue to support resources and funding for the

Ukrainian people, and I urge them not to give up.
We must all continue

speaking out, for as long as it takes, until Ukraine is safe and free

once more.
