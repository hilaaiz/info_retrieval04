NICHOLAS A. LANGWORTHY

Mr. LANGWORTHY.
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the remarkable

life and service of Richard ``Dick'' Young, a lifelong member of the

Lancaster, New York community, who recently passed away at the age of

94.
Dick was a proud graduate of Lancaster High School, Class of 1948,

where he served as class president and remained dedicated to keeping

his classmates connected for decades.
In fact, those remaining from his

class gathered in 2023 to celebrate their 75th reunion--an

extraordinary milestone.
Following graduation, Dick answered the call to serve his country by

joining the United States Navy.
From 1948 to 1949, he served aboard the

USS Buck 761 Destroyer, supporting efforts during the Chinese

Revolution.
After his initial service, he enrolled at Marietta College,

but when the Korean War broke out, he was called back to duty--this

time serving as a ship-fitter on the USS Marsh DE699 from 1950 to 1952.
In recognition of his dedicated service, Dick was honored in 2019

through the Honor Flight to Washington.
Dick returned home to join the family business.
His father, Lester

Young, had founded the Young Fire Equipment Corporation in 1944, and by

the time Dick completed his military service, he was destined to lead

the company.
As President, he relocated it to 204 Cemetery Road in

Lancaster, where his Navy-honed skills and forward-thinking mindset

revolutionized the fire apparatus industry.
He designed firetrucks that

were decades ahead of their time--earning a reputation for building the

``Cadillac of Firetrucks.''
Though Young Fire closed in 1991, Dick's passion for innovation never

waned.
In 1993, he launched the Performance Advantage Company in

Lancaster, which continues to design and distribute tool and equipment

mounting solutions for the fire service, military, and other industries

in over 38 countries.
In 2007, Dick established the Greater Lancaster Museum of

Firefighting, located next to his business.
The museum showcases

historic firefighting artifacts, including those from local departments

and even pieces from the 9/11 Towers.
It stands as a tribute to

volunteerism, which Dick regarded as the backbone of strong

communities.
He often said, ``Communities cannot function without the

selfless sacrifices that volunteers contribute.
We've got to encourage

more volunteers.''
Dick also served his community as an elected member of the Lancaster

Village Board, where he played a key role in uniting the Village and

Town to address critical infrastructure needs, including improvements

to the sewer system.
Mr. Speaker, Dick Young leaves behind a legacy of service,

innovation, and unwavering dedication to his community and country.
His

accomplishments, generosity, and leadership set a gold standard that

will continue to inspire generations to come.
May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT OF BILL MATTHYS

HON.
MICHAEL CLOUD

Mr. CLOUD.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Bill Matthys--a man

whose life reflects a steadfast commitment to education, public

service, and community.
Raised in rural Wharton County, Mr. Matthys graduated from El Campo

High School in 1965, later earning degrees from Wharton County Junior

College and the University of Houston, including a BA in English and

Journalism and a master's in Curriculum and Instruction.
In 1967, he

married Pamela, his high school sweetheart, and together they built a

loving family and a legacy of service.
Following college, Mr. Matthys served on active duty in the United

States Army from 1970 to 1974, including time stationed in Germany, and

later in the Army Reserve until his honorable discharge as a Captain in

1981.
His service to our Nation was marked by integrity and continued

through his 35 years dedicated to public education in Texas.
He worked

as both a teacher and administrator, with 16 of those years at Cuero

ISD.
After retiring from education, he continued serving the community

through legal work as a certified paralegal at a local firm.
His civic involvement has been just as remarkable.
