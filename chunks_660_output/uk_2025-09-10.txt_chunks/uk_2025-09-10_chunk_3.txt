``Wadaag''

is the Somali word for ``sharing,'' and this principle is reflected in

the design of this building.
The project, constructed and owned in

partnership with the BIPOC and woman-owned developer Nawal Noor, was

planned and crafted in close collaboration with the community.
Getting

input from those whose lives are most impacted by this development was

central to the vision that shaped its final form.
The Wadaag Commons Project is the sixth and final phase of the Seward

Commons redevelopment effort, which has transformed the neighborhood

from a desolate industrial park into a high-density, transit-oriented

housing and commercial area serving diverse incomes.
I was proud to

secure $1.8 million in federal Community Project Funding to help

facilitate the success of this crucial endeavor.
Beyond its value to the surrounding community, this project is

invaluable to those who will call it home.
Wadaag Commons provides

affordable housing to large families and those experiencing

homelessness.
The 39 new units include homes with income-based pricing

and

Section 8 voucher commitments to address the burden of rising rent.
Several other units have more than two bedrooms to meet the needs of

multigenerational households, which has been an option long missing

from the local housing landscape.
One of the most notable features of this project is the inclusion of

indoor and outdoor play areas for children, facilities that are too

often overlooked in affordable housing developments.
Alongside these

play spaces are private entrances, accessible layouts, and culturally

relevant design elements all chosen to support daily life, connection,

and communal care.
Please join me in recognizing the residents, advocates, and partners

who made Wadaag Commons possible.

RECOGNIZING COLORADO STATE CHAMPIONS, THE GRAND MESA LITTLE LEAGUE

SENIOR ALL-STARS

_____

HON.
JEFF HURD

Mr. HURD of Colorado.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a

remarkable group of young men and their coaches from Western Colorado,

the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars baseball team.
This summer, these players, ages 14 to 16, won the Colorado Senior

Little League State Championship in Grand Junction.
They went on to

compete in California for the regional title against some of the best

teams in the West, proudly representing Colorado with grit and

determination.
The team brings together players from across our district, including

Grand Junction, Clifton, Palisade, Parachute, and Rifle.
They first

captured the district championship and then fought their way through

the state finals, defeating two tough Denver-area teams to claim back-

to-back state titles--their third in just four years.
Their success is built not only on talent but also on the dedication

of their coaches, the support of their families, and the spirit of

their communities.
I am proud of these young men and honored to

celebrate the Grand Mesa Senior All Stars for the way they represented

the Western Slope and the State of Colorado.
