In 1972, The Bob Newhart Show premiered and catapulted Bob into a new

tier of critical acclaim, adoration, and commercial success.
Known for

its dry humor and heart, The Bob Newhart Show drew millions of viewers

into a Chicago-based story about a psychologist and his clients and

friends.
With incredibly strong ratings and significant praise, the

show ran for six seasons, leading to his other acclaimed show, Newhart.
Through these efforts, Bob connected with homes and families through

his extraordinary storytelling skills.
He was described by coworkers

and friends as kind, funny, and intellectual, and is remembered as

humble and warm despite his fame.
Before reaching comedic stardom, Bob graduated from Loyola University

Chicago with a bachelor's degree in business management.
He then served

two years in the Army during the Korean War and held jobs in accounting

prior to recording the comedy album that won him Album of the Year at

the 1961 Grammys, ``The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart''.
Bob had a

love of philanthropy and used his comedic talents to emcee at various

benefits from childhood cancer to Scleroderma research.
He was adamant

about using his career and success for the benefit of others and showed

the world how important that mission was to him by raising $350,000 for

the National Children's Cancer Society.
Bob was a true Chicagoan and proved that through the exposure he gave

the city in his show as well as his enthusiastic support for the Cubs.
The city is proud to honor his life and legacy through renaming the

street by the Edgewater condominium to ``Bob Newhart Way''.
Thanks to

him, this building is one of the most recognizable in Chicago,

appearing in The Bob Newhart Show's opening credits for 142 episodes.
The city of Chicago and the whole country have lost an incredible

figure who shaped modern comedy and sitcom TV, and he will be dearly

missed.
His legacy lives on through his children, grandchildren, and

friends, and he will be remembered by the lives that he touched through

his work and philanthropic efforts.
I am forever grateful to Bob for

shining a light on this incredible city and showing was it means to be

a true legend.

HONORING CLAY COUNTY FLAGS FOR HEROES

_____

HON.
AARON BEAN

Mr. BEAN of Florida.
Mr. Speaker, on September 11, 2025.
the Rotary

Club of Orange Park Sunrise will once again raise ``Flags for Heroes,''

a moving sea of hundreds of American flags honoring the men and women

who lift our communities every day.
In Clay County and across Northeast Florida, we remember the lives

lost on September 11, 2001, and we salute the heroes who still answer

the call: first responders, service members, veterans, teachers,

nurses, and the quiet volunteers who serve without fanfare.
Each flag

carries a name, a story, and a promise that we will never forget.
I commend the Rotarians, sponsors, and families who make this

commemoration possible, and I invite neighbors to walk among the flags,

reflect, and thank a hero in their life.
America is strongest when

service is celebrated, and sacrifice is honored.
I thank the Rotary Club of Orange Park Sunrise for reminding us of

who we are.
Let's go get them.

HONORING THE WADAAG COMMONS PROJECT

_____

HON.
ILHAN OMAR

Ms. OMAR.
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Wadaag Commons

Project in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis.
``Wadaag''

is the Somali word for ``sharing,'' and this principle is reflected in

the design of this building.
The project, constructed and owned in

partnership with the BIPOC and woman-owned developer Nawal Noor, was

planned and crafted in close collaboration with the community.
Getting

input from those whose lives are most impacted by this development was

central to the vision that shaped its final form.
